00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
 [MUSIC PLAY] 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.220
 ROK ZORKO: I'm Dress Zorko. 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.330
 I am the vice president of products. 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.910
 When we started, there were only eight of us. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.870
 Everything was sketched on a whiteboard 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 and then built very quickly. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.240
 In the first six months we built something like seven or eight programs, I think. 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.041
 And the last one, Talking Tom, was then a global hit. 

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.820
 IZA LOGIN: Currently we have more than 2.5 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.940
 billion downloads and over 250 million monthly users 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.300
 just on the Talking Tom and Friends franchise, 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.570
 and we are all eager to go on like this. 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.790
 ROK ZORKO: We've seen Android become our majority platform. 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.170
 When we launched My Talking Tom in November 2013, 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.010
 the initial figures were 50/50. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.060
 That means 50% of our users and downloads came from Android and 50 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.180
 from other platforms. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.560
 Now the split is 70/30. 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.170
 That means 70% Android, 30% other platforms, 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.230
 but we use the same cross marketing. 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 We use the same marketing, so it just means 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.660
 that Android has grown. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.870
 Outfit7's launch strategy for the latest games 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.600
 has always been all platforms at the same time. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.120
 And the main reason is that you're the biggest 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.730
 impact, and we really don't want to 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.739
 any of our users should be dissatisfied. 

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:22.780
 MARKO STAMCAR: We have My Talking Angela in December 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.600
 launched. 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.960
 We first performed phase deployment in Google Play 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 and then, after everything was ready, 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.870
 has gone 100% on all platforms. 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.840
 And within 1 week, I think, we had 1 million downloads. 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.130
 So it was a great success and recognition for all our teams, 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.150
 from products to marketing. 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.140
 ROK ZORKO: We only delivered paid programs, 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.060
 and now we do free (freemium) programs within our purchases 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.290
 from 2013 and 2014, and revenue growth was more than 1,000%. 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.860
 I think we have chosen the right strategy to go "freemium". 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.510
 When we built our first program, AdMob was the only software provider 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.830
 inside. It is still one of our most important advertising providers. 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.710
 We didn't really expect us to earn so much. 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.090
 Our most successful programs right now have everyone 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.290
 a lot of mini games inside them, and us 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.970
 has decided that the best way to bring engagement to a new level is 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.550
 is to put Google Play Services rankings in 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.550
 and it really encourages competition in a healthy way. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.200
 I think the main reason why our downloads continue to grow faster, 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.880
 is because we have always been very good at cross marketing. 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.220
 We always say internally that 50% of our business is 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.600
 to build great apps and games 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.279
 And the other 50% is making sure people are aware of them. 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.320
 MARKO STAMCAR: When we got so successful with apps, 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.420
 wanted us to have Outfit7 had to become more than just a program company. 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.870
 We wanted to be a company that provides entertainment. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.320
 That's why we started building our YouTube channel 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.880
 And now we have millions of subscribers 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.990
 and 1.4 billion viewers. 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.400
 And we were recently accepted for YouTube for Children 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.460
 program. 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.370
 IZA LOGIN: Google plays a big role because in some 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.170
 areas we could not imagine it without Google 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.690
 do our distribution, and it's nice to see how users 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.850
 play with and enjoy our programs worldwide.
