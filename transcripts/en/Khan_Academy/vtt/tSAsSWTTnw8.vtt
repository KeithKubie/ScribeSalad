00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.867
is try to draw connections
between angular displacement

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:09.250
and notions of arc length
or distance traveled.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.104
Right over here, let's
imagine I have some type

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:13.643
of a tennis ball or something,

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:16.814
and it is tethered with a
rope to some type of a nail.

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:19.235
If you were to try to
move this tennis ball,

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.246
it would just rotate around that nail.

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:24.459
It would go along this blue circular path.

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:26.298
Let's just say for the sake of argument

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:28.681
the radius of this blue
circle right over here,

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.891
let's say it is six meters.

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.698
You could view that as
the length of the string.

00:00:33.698 --> 00:00:35.196
We know what's going on here.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:39.448
Our initial angle, theta
initial, the convention is

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:42.087
to measure it relative
to the positive x-axis.

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:45.357
Our theta initial is pi over two.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:49.457
Let's say we were to then
rotate it by two pi radians,

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:50.991
positive two pi radians.

00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:54.612
We would rotate in the
counterclockwise direction two pi.

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:58.487
Then the ball would end up
where it started before.

00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:02.731
Theta final would just
be this plus two pi,

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.789
so that would be five pi over two.

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.499
Of course, we just said that we rotated

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:11.612
in the positive
counterclockwise direction.

00:01:11.612 --> 00:01:13.804
We said we did it by two pi radians,

00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:15.883
so I kind of gave you the answer

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:17.781
of what the angular displacement is.

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.630
The angular displacement
in this situation,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.797
delta theta, is going to
be equal to two pi radians.

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.341
The next question I'm going to ask you is

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.291
what is the distance the
ball would have traveled?

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:35.953
Remember, distance where we
actually care about the path.

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:39.814
The distance traveled would be essentially

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:42.830
the circumference of this circle.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.999
Think about what that is,

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.279
and actually while you pause
the video and think about

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.671
what the distance the ball traveled is,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.848
also think about what
would be the displacement

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:52.765
that that ball travels.

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:56.943
Well the easier answer, I'm
assuming you've had a go at it,

00:01:56.943 --> 00:01:57.776
is the displacement.

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.614
The ball ends up where it
starts, so the displacement

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.643
in this situation is as.

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:02.989
We're not talking about
angular displacement.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.226
We're just talking about regular
displacement would be zero.

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:08.570
The angular displacement
was two pi radians,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.072
but what about the distance.

00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:12.463
We'll denote the distance by S.

00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:14.091
As we can see, as we'll see,

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:15.870
we can also view that as arc length.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.119
Here the arc is the entire circle.

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.432
What is that going to be equal to?

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:24.562
Well, we know from
earlier geometry classes

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:25.757
that this is just going to be

00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:27.025
the circumference of the circle

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:31.558
which is going to be equal
to two pi times the radius.

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:35.641
It's going to be equal to
two pi times six meters

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:41.415
which in this case is going to be 12 pi.

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:47.287
Our units, in this case,
is going to be 12 pi meters

00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:49.236
would be the distance that we've traveled.

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:51.573
Now what's interesting right over here is

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:54.888
at least for this particular
case to figure out

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:57.273
the distance traveled to
figure out that arc length,

00:02:57.273 --> 00:02:59.660
it looks like what we did is

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.410
we took our angular displacement,

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.792
in fact we took the magnitude
of our angular displacement,

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:09.113
you could just view that as
the absolute value of it,

00:03:09.113 --> 00:03:12.913
and we multiplied it times
the radius of our circle.

00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:15.310
If you view that as the
length of that string as R,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.810
we just multiply that times R.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.726
We said our arc length,
in this case, was equal

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:24.630
to the magnitude of our
change in displacement

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.283
times our radius.

00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:28.830
Let's see if that is always true.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.789
In this situation, I have
a ball, and let's say

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.079
this is a shorter string.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.402
Let's say this string
is only three meters,

00:03:36.402 --> 00:03:40.569
and its initial angle, theta
initial, is pi radians.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.563
We see that as measured
from the positive x-axis.

00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:48.378
Let's say we were to rotate it clockwise.

00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:52.461
Let's say our theta final
is pi over two radians.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.964
Theta final is equal
to pi over two radians.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:59.447
Pause this video, and see if you can

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:03.127
figure out the angular displacement.

00:04:03.127 --> 00:04:06.680
The angular displacement
in this situation is going

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.950
to be equal to theta
final which is pi over two

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.748
minus theta initial which
is pi which is going

00:04:13.748 --> 00:04:16.136
to be equal to negative pi over two.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:17.162
Does this make sense?

00:04:17.162 --> 00:04:20.263
Yes, because we went clockwise.

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:24.347
Clockwise rotations by convention
are going to be negative.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:25.265
That makes sense.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.716
We have a clockwise rotation
of pi over two radians.

00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:32.404
Now based on the information
we've just figured out,

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:34.626
see if you can figure out the arc length

00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:37.667
or the distance that this tennis ball

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.823
at then end of the
string actually travels.

00:04:39.823 --> 00:04:42.613
This tennis ball at the end
of the three meter string.

00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:46.023
What is this distance
actually going to be?

00:04:46.023 --> 00:04:48.146
Well, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:50.151
You could say, hey
look, this is one fourth

00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:52.458
of the circumference of the circle.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:56.357
You could just say,
hey, this arc length, S,

00:04:56.357 --> 00:04:59.774
is just gonna be one fourth times two pi

00:05:04.064 --> 00:05:08.657
times the radius of three
meters, times three.

00:05:08.657 --> 00:05:10.954
This indeed would give
you the right answer.

00:05:10.954 --> 00:05:14.469
This would be, what, two
over four is one half,

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.223
so you get three pi over two,
and we're dealing with meters,

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:22.589
so this would be three pi over two.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.014
But let's see if this is
consistent with this formula

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:26.624
we just had over here.

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:29.047
Is this the same thing if we were to take

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:31.738
the absolute value of our displacement.

00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:33.437
Let's do that.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:35.615
If we were to take the
absolute value of our,

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:37.635
I'd should say our angular displacement,

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:40.997
so we take the absolute value
of angular displacement,

00:05:40.997 --> 00:05:43.561
and we were to multiply it by our radius.

00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:46.573
Well, our radius is three meters.

00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:49.886
These would indeed be equal because this

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:52.507
is just going to be positive
pi over two times three

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:55.423
which is indeed three pi over two.

00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:59.422
It looks like this formula
is holding up pretty well.

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:02.815
It makes sense because
what you're really doing

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:04.007
is you're saying, look,

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:08.174
you have your traditional
circumference of a circle.

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:11.123
Then, you're thinking
about, well, what proportion

00:06:11.123 --> 00:06:13.148
of the circle is this arc length?

00:06:13.148 --> 00:06:16.484
If you were to say, well,
the proportion is going to be

00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:20.734
the magnitude of your
angular displacement.

00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:24.154
This is the proportion of the
circumference of the circle

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:25.239
that you're going over.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.336
If this was two pi, you'd
be the entire circle.

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:30.770
If it's pi, then you're
going half of the circle.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.832
Notice, these two things cancel out.

00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:36.282
This would actually give
you your arc length.

00:06:36.282 --> 00:06:38.248
Let's do one more example.

00:06:38.248 --> 00:06:40.552
Let's say in this situation, the string

00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:45.116
that is tethering our
ball is five meters long,

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:50.053
and let's say our initial
angle is pi over six radians

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:51.035
right over here.

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:53.868
Let's say that our final angle is,

00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:57.430
we end up right over there.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.190
Our theta final is equal to pi over three.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.331
Based on everything
we've just talked about,

00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:07.057
what is going to be the
distance that the ball travels?

00:07:07.057 --> 00:07:09.974
What is going to be the arc length?

00:07:11.594 --> 00:07:15.193
Well, we could, first, figure
out our angular displacement.

00:07:15.193 --> 00:07:19.360
Our angular displacement is
going to be equal to theta final

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:25.778
which is pi over three minus theta initial

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.808
which is pi over six which is going to be

00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:31.400
equal to pi over six,
and that makes sense.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.391
This angle right over
here, we just went through

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:36.354
a positive pi over six radian rotation.

00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:38.879
We went in the counterclockwise direction.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.336
Then, we just want to
figure out the arc length.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.516
We just multiply that times the radius.

00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:49.298
Our arc length is going
to be equal to pi over six

00:07:49.298 --> 00:07:52.215
times our radius times five meters.

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:56.969
This would get us to
five pi over six meters,

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:02.831
and we are done.

00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:04.224
Once again, no magic here.

00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:05.713
It comes straight out of the idea

00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:07.777
of the circumference of a circle.
