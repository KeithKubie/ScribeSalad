00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, I believe it's very possible for India
to become a superpower.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.090
It's a tough trajectory, but I think you have
a lot of advantages.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.120
Number one, you have a population of young
people coming up which

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.020
everybody knows is going to be the heart of
the energy of the country

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.630
and of innovation in the country.
If you manage this upcoming population, and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.730
manage to channel those
energies appropriately into innovation, entrepreneurship,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.560
et cetera,
and you create these structures, the innovation

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.120
frameworks that can
allow this to be sustainable, then I think

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.710
you have a very realistic
shot of becoming one of the world's superpower.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.760
You're already on the way with a phenomenal
growth rate.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.600
But that's not enough.
You need to create a lot of other systems

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
and infrastructures that are
going to enable this growth rate to be sustainable

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
in the way that the
superpowers have been able to do for themselves,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
such as the United
States, and previously, although failed, the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.500
Soviet union.
I think probably the model is one that's more

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.290
based on innovation,
science and technology-based innovation I

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.360
think is particularly
important and channelling the energy of your

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.729
youth, which you're going
to have a phenomenal advantage in.
