00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.302
I mean,
I didn't do myself any favors.

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:04.637
I really just made this drink.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.541
It's like...
you know.

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.243
[both laugh]

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.512
Let's talk about outer space.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.380
Hello, I'm Jenny Slate,

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:17.083
and today
we're going to talk

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.053
about Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.423
and their beautiful
cosmic discovery.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.458
This is my dog's...

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:26.692
uh, penis,

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.529
and then I've also
had his balls removed.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.531
- Aw, shame, shame.
- Reggie.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.633
"Give me back my balls."
You can't have 'em.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.102
I took them away!

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.703
But I have a full vagina.
[laughs]

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:38.704
[clicks tongue]

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:41.074 line:0%
In 1960,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:46.245 line:0%
Bell Labs made this, like,
giant listening device for NASA.

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.081
But then, by the time
they were ready to use it,

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.449
a better thing had been built.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.683
So then it was just, like,
by itself,

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.318
all by itself in New Jersey.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.354
A lonely horn.
[sighs]

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.190 line:0%
But two scientists,

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.258 line:0%
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson,

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.160 line:0%
they were like, oh, whoa, whoa!

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.395
Hold on, hold on!

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:05.398
If no one's using that,
could we use it?

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.201
They were like,
come on down to the horn.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.769
So they get to the horn.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.439
They're like, we are beautiful
scientists with lovely minds,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.042
and we want to listen
to the sounds between the stars.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.077
Boink.
They're like, let's go, babe!

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.712
Let's listen up!
[laughs]

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.648
Oh, God, I love thinking of them
calling each other "babe."

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.651
So they listen,
and the sound

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.753
is a hundred times louder

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.556
than any sound
they expected to hear.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:35.128
It's like
[imitates static].

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.363
The universe is like...
[imitates static]

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:38.698
Find out about me!
[imitates static]

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.299
So they were like,

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:43.469
what is this darn sound?

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:44.804
[laughs]

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.640
It's coming from everywhere
in the sky at once.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:48.808
Everywhere, everywhere,
everywhere.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.809
[imitates static]

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.511
And then they were like, no.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.746
There's no way a sound could
come from everywhere at once,

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.681
so we have to eliminate
all the other sounds

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.216
that might be,
like, interfering.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.353
So first they thought maybe--

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.423
Someone doesn't care
about science.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:07.560
They were like, it must be
coming from, you know, New York.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.195
Urban interference, you know.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.130
New York is a city
with buildings and lights

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.099
and people and subway
and blah, blah, blah.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.767
So they were like,
point it there.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.235
[hums]

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.172
Pointed the horn
at New York City.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.773
No, that's not
what we were hearing.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.275
Forget about you, New York.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.511
Maybe it's coming
from a military base nearby.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.314
And then they just, like,
point it at the military bases,

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.249
but they didn't hear that noise
coming from there.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:33.052
No, it isn't it.
[laughs]

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:34.053
So then they were like,
okay, next.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.321
Maybe it's from the sun.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.190
They point it at the sun,
and the sun was like,

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.492
I'm just the sun.
I don't give a [bleep].

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.693
They were like,
it's not the sun.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.396
What the funk is this, man?

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.464
And then they were like,
we should check our device.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.266
What if there's something
inside of this thing,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.736
like, you know,
mold or a skeleton...

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.072
of a hobo that crawled in there
to get shelter?

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.308
[laughing]
Or whatever.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.712
They look inside the horn.
Guess what.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.682
This [bleep] thing
is filled with pigeons.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:07.353
Houston, we do have a problem,
and it's pigeons.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.689
[both laugh]

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.758
Arno is like,
you do it, Robert.

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.293
You [bleep] kill them.

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.762
Robert's like,
I don't want to do it.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.431
You do it.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.066
[laughs]

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.634
Guess what they did.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.402
They shot them with a gun.

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:24.637
A shotgun.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.072
Then they were like,
well, that'll do it.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.173
[chuckles]

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.407
After they've wiped
the bird blood

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.642
off of their hands,

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.711
they're both like,
R.I.P. these pigeons.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:32.812
Let's do this.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.715
Boink.
They start to listen.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.283
They're like, oh, [bleep].

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:38.684
[imitates static]

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:39.785
They hear it again.

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:43.222
What the hunk is this
right now?

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.757
[both laugh]

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.226
They don't have the answer.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.794
They don't know what to do.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:51.430
They listen through the horn
for years.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:52.632
They're going
through their papers,

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.066
their papers, their papers.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.369
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,
I can't get it.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.437
Ugh, ugh,
there's nothing here.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.839
Ugh.
This one's boring.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.241
Ugh, this is
in another language.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.710
Just being like, we're never
gonna figure this out.

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:08.414
Finally, they find a study
done by a scientist

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:09.415
whose name is Dicke.

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:11.050
[chuckles]

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.586
He had this crackpot theory
that the universe,

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.323
instead of being infinite,
actually started at some point.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:21.560
Dicke's like,
13.8 billion years ago,

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:23.296
aka old as [bleep].

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.497
[laughs]

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.631
Check your watch.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:27.266
I think the universe started

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:30.770
with, like, a crazy explosion,
aka the Big Bang.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.471
But they had no way to prove it.

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.740
Then these two guys
from New Jersey

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:37.209
who have been listening to this
[bleep] pigeon [bleep] horn...

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.211
[laughs]

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.447
Call him up, they're like,
we hear this thing.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.782
It's like
[imitates static].

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.116
Have you ever heard of that
before?

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.618
He's like, oh, my God.

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:47.053
That's it.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.321
This is
what we've been studying.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.357
Cosmic microwave.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.460
[sighs]
What is that word?

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:55.761
What is the word?

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.096
We know it.
What is it?

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.733
Cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.568
[triumphant music]
- Okay?

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:06.072
It's the sound of microwaves

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.073
from the Big Bang.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.607
[imitates static]

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.675
And they were like,
yeah, that's it!

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.277
This is it!
We got it! We got it!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.479
This is basically the sound
of the Big Bang.

00:05:13.512 --> 00:05:15.414
They wanted to try
to find anything,

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:19.185
but what they found
was the sound of everything.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:23.022
Boing!
[babbles]

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:24.256
I had to unfollow NASA
on Instagram

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.225
'cause it made me too crazay!

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:27.727
It would just be like,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.363
this is a picture
of a [bleep] black hole!

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.164
And I was like, aah!

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:33.499
[laughs]

00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:35.301
Okay, let me tell you this.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:38.037
Penzias and Wilson
get the Nobel Prize for physics.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.538
Everyone [bleep] flips out,
and they were like,

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.108
yes, the Big Bang is real.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.509
It happened.
It's real.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.510
You guys did it.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:47.079
Penzias and, um...
and, uh...

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:49.215
Oh, [bleep].
The other guy.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.450
I just keep thinking
of Winslow...

00:05:51.483 --> 00:05:53.352
[laughing] But I know
that's from<i> Family Matters.</i>

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.353
(Derek)
Carl.

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.288
[laughing]

00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.693
Carl Winslow
discovered the Big Bang.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.262
Derek, what this is right here,

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:06.699
this is the sound of the echo

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:10.736 align:start size:47% position:53%
of the universe
being created.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.772 align:start size:53% position:47%
[imitates static]

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:15.708 align:start size:41% position:59%
Suck on that
for a second.

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:16.709 align:start size:63% position:38%
See how you like it.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:19.111 align:start size:56% position:44%
Just for a second.

00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:22.415 align:end position:100%
The universe is like,
just suck on it for a second.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:25.518
[both laugh]

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.752
(Jenny)
I'm the [bleep] universe.

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:28.621
Suck on it for a second.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.787
[patriotic music]
