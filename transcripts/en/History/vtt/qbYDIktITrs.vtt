00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.586
To test the strength and
durability of your edges,

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.754
I'm going to be
taking your blades

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.423
and chopping into
these coconuts.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.966
Remember, this test
is all about what

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.843
the coconuts do to your
blades, and not what

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.679
your knives do to the coconuts.
Alan, you're up.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.057
You ready?
- Absolutely, let's do it.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.184
It puts a lot of pressure
on me having a coconut

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.103
chop as the challenge.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.231
The Coconut Empire Forge
was meant to chop coconuts.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.107
We're going to make it happen.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.863
[music playing]

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:35.118
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes!

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.124
Well, Alan, the
handle is really narrow,

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.002
but I could hold on
to it really well.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.505
You put a really fine
edge on this blade,

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.759
and it picked up a roll
here, and another small one

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.177
right next to it.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.554
In all, there's no
chipping, and it held up.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.222
Well done.
ALAN: Thank you.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.974
BEN: Hunter, you're up next.
You ready?

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:58.975
Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.477
I know I got this one.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.061
This blade's so heavy,
whether it's sharp or not,

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.772
it's going through.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.107
But I just gotta hope I maintain
that hard steel on the edge,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:06.983
and that nothing bad happens.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.071
[music playing]

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.286
Yeah, sweet!

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:24.584
Well, Hunter, first off,
your edge held up really well.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.212
It's not super-duper sharp.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.172
I feel pretty safe running
my fingers across here

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.090
without getting cut.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.176
But it held up really well.
Tim, you're up next.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.012
You ready?
- Oh, yeah, more than.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.723
I am dying up here.
(LAUGHING) I just want

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:40.225
to see that knife come down.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.226
I want to see coconuts shredded.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.482
[music playing]

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.573
As long as the edge
holds up, you're good.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.164
Well, Tim, your edge
held up beautifully.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:05.834
But for a chopper, this
handle-- it's kind of round.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.045
And on the second coconut,
it just turned in my hand

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:10.129
and glanced off.

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:14.884
But other than that, well done.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.302
Thank you.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:20.139
Bladesmiths, this is
the ratchet strap slash.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.600
Now a sharp weapon should
cut cleanly through.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.312
Unlike the coconut test, this
is all about what your blade

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.106
does to these straps.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.691
Alan, you're first.
You ready?

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.609
Yes sir.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.903
With the damage that I
incurred on the coconut chop,

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.780
I'm a little concerned
about how it's going to go

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.533
through the ratchet straps.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.411
[music playing]

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.167
All right, Alan, let's
talk about your blade here.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.710
It still is sharp.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.005
But your edge took damage
on the strength test.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.257
And when I'm slashing
through these ratchet straps,

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.845
you can tell, because some areas
of this-- it tore through it.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.390
Overall, though,
your weapon will cut.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.266
Thank you.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.183
Hunter, you're up next.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.268
You ready?

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.561
I guess.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.937
The blade's not as
sharp as I like it.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.981
When they go into that
strap, I'm afraid it's

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.733
going to just bounce off.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.943
If it won't even cut a strap,
there's no way I'm moving on.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.533
Yes!

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.077
All right, Hunter, let's
talk about your blade here.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.621
When you slice
through it, you can

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:29.792
see that it tore some parts
of this particular strap

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.544
right here.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.796
But the weight of this cuts and
pushes through all the weight.

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:34.756
It will cut. ,

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:35.632
Thank you.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.841
Tim, you're up next.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.800
You ready?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.178
As I'm ever going to be.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.930
I'm worried about
my handle indexing.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.184
Because if it rolls, it's
going to glance off, I'm done.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.020
[music playing]

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.106
Nice, dude.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.650
I can breathe again.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.027
All right, Tim, let's
talk about your blade here.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.445
First up, your handle.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.948
It's on a smaller narrow
side, but you know what?

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.492
It's comfortable when
I grabbed onto it.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.160
Your edge-- it's razor-sharp.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.164
It pretty much cut all the
way through, and it will cut.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.624
Thank god.

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.626
DOUG: Good job.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.753
DAVID: All right,
bladesmiths, the judges

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.672
have made their final decision.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:21.636
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Alan.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.680
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.390
Ben's going to tell you why.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.102
Alan, I loved watching you
set up for your [inaudible] But

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.895
during the strength
test, your blade took

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.397
some pretty serious damage.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.898
And that caused
it to underperform

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.483
in the sharpness test as well.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.609
And it's for those
reasons we are

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.778
going to have to let you go.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.197
Alan, please
surrender your blade.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.449
ALAN: I agree with
the judge's decision.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.370
My blade incurred just too much
damage striking those coconuts.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.622
This competition has
definitely stoked the fire

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.165
of my bladesmithing passion.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.376
And I will continue
to develop skills.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.377
The Coconut Empire has only
lost the battle, not the war.
