When we think about Grant's situation with his suitcase, x can really only equal

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.445
a whole number. Remember that x stood for the number of wiper sets that Grant

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:12.276
has packed in his suitcase. And since wiper sets are objects in the world,

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:16.620
they're countable things. You can't really have half of a wiper set, or I guess

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:20.914
you could, but Grant's only taking complete sets with him. Now, when I say that

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:24.882
wiper sets can be counted, you might automatically think of the natural numbers.

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:28.780
Since these are the counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. But in principle,

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:32.661
Grant could also pack zero glasses wipers. He could just not bring any wipers to

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:36.484
the expo, probably wouldn't be that smart, but he could do it. And if we take

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:39.854
this set of natural numbers and add zero to it, we get the whole numbers.
