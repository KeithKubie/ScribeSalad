00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.435
Am I early?

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:05.238
I came on time as to avoid
the cats and dogs outside.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.673
So no one dressed slutty
and old-timey?

having fun!

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.514
As much as I loved the bike

What is going on here?

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.055
I thought you said this

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.589
That's what the letter
that I got said.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.058
I got a letter, too.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.726
Who would hang chains
on the bookshelves...

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.561
that aren't chaining
anything up?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.538

Wait. Timothy, you're gonna
be Professor Grapes.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.056
Oh, I've always wanted
to be a professor.

into this plan.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.547
You have 60 minutes to figure
out all the clues...

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.349
and unlock all the locks...

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.284
including this lock
on this very door...

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:28.822
or else you'll never escape
the room!

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.892

Don't swallow it, you idiot!

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:37.997
Oh, my god,
she's choking on it!

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.333

so easy in kids' movies.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.707
How are we supposed
to get out now, Gene?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.345
You figure out the clues and
then you use the-- you use the--

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.746

Somebody do something!

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.289
Oh, I thought that would work.

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:06.659

Oh, Windy, thank god
you're here.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.668

Um, you recommended I not be
hired by your colleague.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.517
Do you work here now?
Did you hire him?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.019 line:85%
I did.
