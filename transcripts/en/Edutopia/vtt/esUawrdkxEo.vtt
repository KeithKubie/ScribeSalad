00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.276
&gt;&gt;Courtney: A text can
sometimes be very intimidating,

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:12.396
especially for a struggling
reader, an English language learner.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.666
Art is a universal language.

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:16.916
Every child can read a piece of art.

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:21.266
They're able to give an opinion, they're
able to find evidence in that work

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:22.826
because they can read the visual.

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:26.066
It's a place where every
child can be successful.

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:28.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Now, it's making sense.

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:35.196
&gt;&gt;Courtney: At Concourse
Village Elementary School,

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:37.686
we are a literacy-based school.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.906
We believe that every
educator is teaching reading,

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:43.616
so you're learning reading in
music, you're learning reading

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:46.796
in physical education, you're
learning reading in art.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:48.966
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're going to get
an artwork that you're going

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:50.306
to have a discussion with your--

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:51.566
&gt;&gt;Courtney: When you're reading a book,

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:54.296
you have words that are
communicating the idea.

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:58.876
Artwork is the same concept,
except it's visuals

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:00.406
that are communicating that idea.

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.956
&gt;&gt;Ivelisse: We're reading the
pictures, but not with our mouth.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.376
We're reading it with our eyes.

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:08.626
&gt;&gt;Courtney: So second grade is
learning about three different types

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.786
of communities, rural, urban,
and suburban communities.

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:16.396
&gt;&gt;Each group has your master work that
you're looking at with a question.

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:20.736
Our first group is Romare
Bearden's The Block. What would it--

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:24.726
&gt;&gt;So there's different literacy
strategies, such as making connections,

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:29.226
visualizing, prediction inference,
and these are the same strategies

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.856
that you can use to read
a piece of artwork.

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:36.566
&gt;&gt;Ivelisse: The picture I was asked to
look at looks like a suburban community,

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:41.986
a single home and the
question was what was the mood,

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:45.516
if it's happy, if it's a sad picture.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.776
That goes with different colors.

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:51.766
&gt;&gt;Courtney: What is the mood
of this artwork? Ivelisse?

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:56.606
&gt;&gt;Ivelisse: It would feel
calming because the evidence,

00:01:56.796 --> 00:01:58.806
for me, was the light tone colors.

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:04.786
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The artist's use of
light colors create a happy mood.

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:08.536
&gt;&gt;Thinking of a prediction
question, what might it feel

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:10.956
like to be inside this work and why?

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:13.926
&gt;&gt;Provide evidence from
the work to support.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.896
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: She told us to
look carefully, and then,

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:20.156
think how would it feel
like to be in that picture.

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:24.476
I noticed that there's a crowd
and they're listening to music.

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:28.486
&gt;&gt;It will feel kind of
jammy on that street.

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:29.626
&gt;&gt;Courtney: What do you mean by that?

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.526
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: It will feel cool
to be on a street with a lot

00:02:33.526 --> 00:02:35.076
of music and a lot of people.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:38.296
&gt;&gt;Courtney: When you go
back to your tables today,

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:42.246
you're going to revise your
work thinking about these ideas.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:44.926
&gt;&gt;So after the master work session,

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:48.696
they can apply these literacy
ideas to their own work.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:50.696
What is the mood of my work?

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:53.916
What am I trying to communicate?
What's my theme?

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:58.196
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: So we continued our
pictures. I was doing the city.

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:00.626
&gt;&gt;Courtney: The sky comes all
the way down to the street.

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:02.306
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: Oh. 
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Remember, horizon line.

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:06.496
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: I could ask myself
how I know it's an urban community.

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:10.616
I put a deli store right
next to a lot of buildings.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.136
&gt;&gt;Courtney: We need to do our gallery
walk and provide our feedback.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.696
&gt;&gt;The same way that we critique master
work, we critique each other's work.

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:20.636
&gt;&gt;I hear a lot of oohs and ahs.

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:25.456
&gt;&gt;Sebastian: We went on a gallery
walk. You look at your peers' work.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:29.896
I might ask what is the
mood in this picture?

00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:31.986
What are you trying to tell me.

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:36.116
&gt;&gt;Courtney: I would like to hear some
of the feedback that you received.

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.456
&gt;&gt;Ivelisse: I like how she painted.

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:42.496
&gt;&gt;Courtney: Why did you choose to
paint the solar panel with glitter?

00:03:42.976 --> 00:03:45.176
&gt;&gt;Ivelisse: It would
show the electricity.

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:48.546
&gt;&gt;Courtney: That's a really
great artistic decision.

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.646
&gt;&gt;So because we embed
literacy in the arts,

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:55.316
students find these cross-curricular
connections.

00:03:55.656 --> 00:04:00.126
A lot of the vocabulary
transfers over, mood, tone,

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:02.436
atmosphere, prediction, inference.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.436
Art is kind of an entry point for them.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:10.426
It allows them to really be
creative and be critical thinkers.
