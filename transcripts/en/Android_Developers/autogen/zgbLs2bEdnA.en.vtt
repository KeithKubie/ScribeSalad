00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.840
Indian cuisine is one of the most vibrant

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.440
and delicious foods in the world.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.700
With the variety of spices,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.430
each dish can be tailored to your own individual tastes,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.720
if you have the right recipe.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.000
My name is John Mathew,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.260
I’m the Co-Founder and CEO of Riafy Technologies.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.460
We developed the Cookbook app

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.259
to help foodies from around the world

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320
discover delicious recipes in their own language.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.980
Cookbook Recipes is present in 157 countries

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.100
around the world, and we support 23 languages,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.100
5 of which are Indian.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.820
It is also India’s largest cooking app

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.700
with 5.5 million users.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.280
In India, the devices that consumers

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.579
use are quite diverse,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.329
ranging from almost-obsolete models

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.600
to the latest smartphones.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.460
Consumers are also concerned about

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.350
the connectivity speeds, data costs and app sizes.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.760
To succeed in the Indian market,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.379
you need to tackle all these challenges.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.740
That is why we focused on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.180
optimising Cookbook Recipes.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.380
Our app was already 7MB

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.600
when Google introduced us

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.940
to Android App Bundles and Dynamic Delivery.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.260
App Bundles compiles your code and resources,

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.000
so you no longer need to build, sign,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
and manage multiple APKs.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.700
Dynamic Delivery then delivers

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.220
only the optimized APKs

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.140
for that user's device configuration.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.180
Initially, we were sceptical about App Bundles

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.380
and whether it could make

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.820
the app size even smaller.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.680
And even if it did, would it increase
the number of downloads?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
But we gave it a shot anyway, because we’re a team that likes to push the boundaries.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.820
And we’re so glad we did.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.560
The integrations of Android App Bundles

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.940
and Dynamic Delivery took us just one day,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.780
and a size reduction of 38.2% was almost immediate.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.160
The biggest impact we had was with
our app’s language component.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.539
It identifies the user's language preferences

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.820
and dynamically loads only those resources
required for that language.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.860
App Bundles doesn’t just reduce the download size.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.000
Since the codes are placed into separate modules,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.500
only some of them need to be changed for an update,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.080
making the whole process easier,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.320
and also keeping the size to the smallest.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.680
Cookbook Recipes is now only 3.5MB, 
and in India alone,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.100
we saw a 70% increase in our 
store-to-install conversion rate.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.259
We also converted our entire suite of 21 apps

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.640
into App Bundle in just one week,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.540
and this gave us a 37% reduction in average app size,
and 19% boost in conversions.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.660
Now that we’ve done Android app bundles,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.420
we’re really excited about modularising our apps

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.040
using dynamic feature modules.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.440
This will help us improve user experience

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.120
by letting our users download
the features only if they need them.
