00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt;Hello YouTube. I'm going to answer a question
about whether we're going to get growth. And

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.950
let me tell you the real problem. The problem
is that the growth we were having was not

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.950
real. It was like an uninsured risk-taking
that gave the illusion of growth with huge

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:31.689
amount of downside risks that we're paying
for now. Let me give you an example: take

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.629
two companies, one company makes two dollars
a share, doesn't have insurance, eventually

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.379
it's going to go bust. It looks good on paper.
Another company makes a dollar a share, but

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.749
it's very robust. It does not have downside
risk, it's insured against what I call a

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:53.749
black swan. The first company looks better
according to economic trick metrics, according

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.670
to economic measurements, but the second one
in the long run is the one that will survive.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.089
So let's not shoot for growth. Let's shoot
for robustness. Let's work on a society that

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.340
is robust to model error, robust to the black
swan. A society different from the one the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.190
banks gave us. Let's snatch it back away from
them. Thank you.
