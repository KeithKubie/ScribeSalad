00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.990
A group of scientists is saying that the asteroid
impact that killed off the dinosaurs might’ve

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.529
changed the world far more than we realized!

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.331
Some 66 million years ago, a 10-kilometer-wide
asteroid hit the Yucatan Peninsula and the

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:18.600
global effects killed more than three-quarters
of all species, including dinosaurs and many

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.400
ocean-dwelling life forms.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.530
The immediate aftermath was earthquakes, tsunamis,
and volcanic eruptions, as well as vaporized

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.369
rock launched high above the surface that
heated as it fell back to Earth, sparking

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.369
fires.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.450
And these fires are what changed the climate
and decimated most living things!

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.700
According to this new model: Soot from the
global wildfires was heated by the Sun and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.230
lofted high into the atmosphere.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.330
There, it created an impenetrable barrier
around the globe.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Just picture it…

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.060
The planet is as dark as a moonlit night in
the middle of the day, meaning little to no

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.520
photosynthesis.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.210
Any plants not killed by wildfires are dead.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.540
The the lynchpin of the ocean food chain -- phytoplankton
-- is gone.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.670
All the species that rely on these for food
are dead.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.970
The atmospheric soot causes global surface
temperatures to drop by as much as 28 Celsius

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.590
over land and 11 over the oceans.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.410
But the soot in the atmosphere keeps absorbing
sunlight, heating the stratosphere, sucking

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.040
up water vapour, and destroying the ozone.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.820
Eventually the atmosphere is cleared of soot,
but only after a year of darkness, and then

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.810
the environment is decimated.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.799
This is not a planet to call home.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.320
Amazingly, this model shows it doesn’t take
a lot of soot for this kind of global devastation

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.390
to happen.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.990
One simulation used just 5 billion tons of
soot, about a third of what scientists think

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.420
was actually produced after the impact.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.479
But this simulation isn’t exact to how the
world was 66 million years ago.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.299
Still, it’s a sobering thought.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.780
While nuclear warfare or a smaller impact
wouldn’t have the same effects, either would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.570
still put enough soot into the atmosphere
to cool the surface and heat the upper atmosphere,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.010
potentially changing the global climate enough
to wipe out multiple species.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.899
Speaking of wiping out species like dinosaurs,
what colour were dinosaurs really?

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.850
We dug into it in this episode right here.
