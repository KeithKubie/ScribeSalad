00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.040
NARRATOR: In the 19th Century

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.500
anywhere from 10,000 to
30,000 orphan children

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.330
lived in New York City.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.960
Charles Brace had a solution.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.210
Send these orphans by train
to small towns across America

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
and put them up for adoption.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.120
Over the course of 75
years, the orphan trains

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.080
brought more than 200,000
abandoned children

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.580
to new homes.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.750
In 1848, Charles Loring
Brace arrived in New York

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.580
on a mission, to aid New York's
poor immigrant population.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.380
After graduating
divinity school,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830
Reverend Brace worked at
the Five Points Mission,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.250
a charitable organization
in one of the city's poorest

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.670
neighborhoods that also became
a home for its orphan children.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.250
In 1853, Brace founded
the Children's Aid

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.420
Society, an organization
still active today.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.250
New York had as many as
30,000 orphans, almost 6%

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.580
of the entire
population of the city.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.330
But at the time,
the label of orphan

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.540
didn't just apply
to the parentless.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.040
Some families just couldn't
take care of their children

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.080
in the harsh conditions
of New York's slums.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.620
Many of these orphans were
children of recent immigrants

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.380
who, if they could find
jobs, were forced to take

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.380
dangerous, low-paying work.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.920
Dying on the job
was not uncommon.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.790
Dying at home was
also not uncommon.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.420
These immigrants mostly lived
in cramped, unsanitary tenements

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.580
where disease easily spread.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.210
Their children could be
orphaned if one parent died

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.960
and the other couldn't
care for them.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.290
Sometimes both living parents
gave up their children simply

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.120
because they didn't
have the resources

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.880
to ensure their survival.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.460
Reverend Brace recognized
that the best chance

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.420
for those orphaned was not
in the asylums and juvenile

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.790
prisons where they were normally
sent, but with actual families.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.290
So under the Children's Aid
Society, he hatched a plan.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.000
Orphaned, homeless children
at least six years old,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.580
which was considered
working age,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.250
would be placed
on trains heading

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.000
out to America's farmlands.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.750
The hope was that they would
be adopted by new families

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.750
and grow up in a more
peaceful rural setting, away

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.830
from the dangers of the city.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.080
[train whistle blows]

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.790
The first orphan
train left in 1854--

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.500
42 children bound for
apple-picking country

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.120
in Michigan.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.500
All orphan trains were
supervised by a Western agent,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.750
who was responsible for
picking the small towns

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.580
where the children had the
best chance of being adopted.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.580
The agent would bombard the
town with advertising banners

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.420
and pamphlets
announcing the orphans'

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.000
arrival and their
availability for adoption.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.460
On the day the orphans
arrive, interested families

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.170
would gather at the town
hall, courthouse, or theater

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.710
to inspect the
potential adoptees.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.830
Children were placed on a
stage or elevated platform,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.380
physically put up for adoption.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.710
They were poked and
prodded, examined

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.710
thoroughly for their health
and physical capabilities.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.170
Once potential parents
made their selections

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.960
and the selection committee of
prominent townsfolk approved,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960
the orphans were handed over.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.540
Families were only
allowed to take one child.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.330
So any siblings
traveling together

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.710
would almost always
become separated.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.960
Any children left over would
move on to the next town.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.830
In their new homes, the freshly
adopted orphans were encouraged

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.710
to forget their past
lives in New York

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.040
completely, and in some cases,
adopt the religious beliefs

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.500
of their new families.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.250
Most learned farming skills.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.500
But some families treated
their new children

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.080
more as indentured servants,
sometimes accompanied by abuse,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.420
which often went unchecked by
the Children's Aid Society.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.250
So what happened to these
orphan train children?

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.830
Like their childhoods,
their adulthoods varied.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.080
The program produced
many successes,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.250
including two future
governors who traveled

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920
on the same orphan train.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.750
But the notorious outlaw
Billy the Kid also

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.040
rode west on an orphan train.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.750
In 1910, a survey concluded
that 87% of the orphans

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.380
had "done well," although
the term "done well"

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.420
was not clearly defined.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.500
The orphan train ceased
operating in the 1920s,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
as federal, local,
and state governments

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.920
enacted new child labor laws
and assumed control for the care

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.620
of orphan children.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.120
But the work of Charles Brace
and the Children's Aid Society

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.460
lives on.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.420
The program helped
lay the groundwork

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.880
for America's modern
foster care system,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.460
tasked with caring for more
than 400,000 children today.
