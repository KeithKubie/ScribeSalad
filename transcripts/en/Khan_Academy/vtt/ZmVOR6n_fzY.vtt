00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.481
- [Instructor] Function g can
be thought of as a translated

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:05.619
or shifted version of f of
x is equal to x squared.

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:07.588
Write the equation for g of x.

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:08.463
Now, pause this video,

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.981
and see if you can work
this out on your own.

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.300
All right, so whenever I think
about shifting a function,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.270
and in this case, we're
shifting a parabola,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.441
I like to look for a distinctive point.

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:20.744
And on a parabola, the vertex is going

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.577
to be our most distinctive point.

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:24.412
And if I focus on the vertex of f,

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:28.196
it looks like if I shift that to the right

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:29.029
by three,

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.377
and then if I were to shift that down

00:00:33.377 --> 00:00:34.210
by four,

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:37.702
at least our vertices would overlap.

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:40.380
I would be able to shift the vertex

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.713
to where the vertex of g is.

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:45.093
And it does look,

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:47.937
and we'll validate this, at
least visually, in a little bit,

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:50.424
so I'm gonna go minus four
in the vertical direction,

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:53.235
that not only would it
make the vertices overlap,

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:55.599
but it would make the
entire curve overlap.

00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.191
So we're going to make,
we're gonna first shift to

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.024
the right

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:03.322
by three.

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:06.031
And we're gonna think about how
would we change our equation

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.581
so it shifts f to the right by three,

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.434
and then we're gonna shift down by four.

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:12.267
Shift down

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:14.979
by four.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:19.264
Now, some of you might
already be familiar with this,

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:20.550
and I go into the intuition

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.617
in a lot more depth in other videos.

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:23.670
But in general,

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.614
when you shift to the right by some value,

00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.070
in this case, we're shifting
to the right by three,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.523
you would replace x with x minus three.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:37.767
So one way to think about this
would be y is equal to f of

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:39.540
x minus three,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.582
or y is equal to, instead
of it being x squared,

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:46.727
you would replace x with x minus three.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:49.213
So it'd be x minus three squared.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:52.066
Now, when I first learned this,
this was counterintuitive.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.010
I'm shifting to the right by three.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.477
The x-coordinate of my vertex
is increasing by three,

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:00.654
but I'm replacing x with x minus three.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.910
Why does this make sense?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.695
Well, let's graph the shifted version,

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:07.338
just to get a little
bit more intuition here.

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:09.702
Once again, I go into much more
depth in other videos here.

00:02:09.702 --> 00:02:12.127
This is more of a worked example.

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:14.707
So this is what the shifted
curve is gonna look like.

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:16.363
Think about the behavior that we want,

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:18.306
right over here, at x equals three.

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:20.636
We want the same value
that we used to have

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:22.252
when x equals zero.

00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:23.994
When x equals zero for the original f,

00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:25.146
zero squared was zero.

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.035
Y equals zero.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.924
We still want y equals zero.

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:29.116
Well, the way that we can do that is

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.625
if we are squaring zero,

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.869
and the way that we're gonna square zero

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.440
is if we subtract three from x.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.512
And you can validate that at other points.

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:40.214
Think about what happens
now, when x equals four.

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:42.608
Four minus three is one squared.

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:44.083
It does indeed equal one.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.404
The same behavior that you used to get

00:02:46.404 --> 00:02:48.404
at x is equal to one.

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.428
So it does look like we have
indeed shifted to the right

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:56.456
by three when we replace
x with x minus three.

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:58.515
If you replaced x with x plus three,

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.186
it would have had the opposite effect.

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:02.558
You would have shifted
to the left by three,

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:04.154
and I encourage to think about

00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:06.513
why that actually makes sense.

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:08.441
So now that we've shifted
to the right by three,

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:11.067
the next step is to shift down by four,

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:13.359
and this one is little bit more intuitive.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.193
So let's start with our
shifted to the right.

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:18.795
So that's y is equal to
x minus three squared.

00:03:18.795 --> 00:03:21.250
But now, whatever y value we were getting,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.335
we want to get four less than that.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.785
So when x equals three, instead
of getting y equals zero,

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.198
we want to get y equals
four less, or negative four.

00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:30.863
When x equals four,
instead of getting one,

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:33.374
we want to get y is
equal to negative three.

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:35.970
So whatever y value we were getting,

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.220
we want to now get four less than that.

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:42.167
So the shifting in the vertical direction

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.459
is a little bit more intuitive.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.195
If we shift down, we subtract that amount.

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:49.436
If we shift up, we add that amount.

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:52.850
So this, right over here,
is the equation for g of x.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.410
G of x is going to be equal
to x minus three squared

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.965
minus four.

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:00.798
And once again, just to review,

00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:04.858
replacing the x with x
minus three, on f of x,

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:07.114
that's what shifted,

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:07.947
shifted

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:09.775
right

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.602
by three,

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.752
by three.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:16.999
And then, subtracting the four,

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.296
that shifted us down by four,

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:20.819
shifted

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:21.652
down

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.062
by four,

00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.794
to give us this next graph.

00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:30.098
And you can visualize, or
you can verify visually,

00:04:30.098 --> 00:04:33.285
that if you shift each of these
points exactly down by four,

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:34.370
we are,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.044
we are indeed

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:38.877
going to overlap on top of g of x.
