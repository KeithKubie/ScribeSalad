00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.640
There was earlier on a slide which

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.880
showed that 5 percent of everything was

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.095
you know us the real world, that we know

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:18.285
 

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:21.425
How do you know its 5 percent

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.945
when you don't know what dark matter is made of?

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:26.085
Yeah, good question. So,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:29.405
well there are a number of different ways of working out how much dark matter is out there

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.495
so there is the lensing method

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.125
so you can use this lensing method across

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.805
the whole sky essentially and map the distribution of dark matter

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.135
by how light is being bent through space and you can

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:42.245
compare how much bending you expect from how much visible material

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:46.245
so thats one way of getting how much dark matter there is.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.385
another way actually the way dark matter was originally observed was by

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.525
looking at the rotation of stars around galaxies so

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:54.745
A  physicist called Vera Reuben in the 70s was looking at

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:58.635
andromeda and the other galaxies near to the earth and she measured

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.795
she measured the rotation speeds of the stars and what

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.935
you expect is that closer to the center of the  galaxy

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.305
you have lots of gravity. The stars should be orbiting very

00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:10.315
quickly in order to not fall into the center essentially

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:12.855
and then as you move out through the galaxy, gravity gets weaker and

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:16.235
you would expect stars at the edge of the galaxy to be going around more slowly

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.765
and what she found out was that the speeds of the stars

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:20.415
didn't seem to depend on how far

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.705
they were from the center

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.995
they fell off a little bit but more or less they stayed constant at any distance

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.775
and that again to explain that

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:30.655
motion you need to invoke some invisible material that adds

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:32.935
an extra gravitational attraction to hold

00:01:32.935 --> 00:01:33.435
the stars in the galaxy

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.905
and you can use that again to measure how much dark

00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:39.115
matter there is in neighbouring galaxies to our own for example.

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:42.245
The other way of doing it is by looking at something called the cosmic

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.085
microwave background which is a very very

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:48.395
faint microwave radiation left over from the big bang

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:50.725
so its essentially the point at which

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:53.685
just about 380,000 years after the big bang

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:55.975
the universe before that point was like the sun

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:59.135
it was kind of a boiling massive super-heated plasma

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.945
at 380,000 years it expanded enough

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:04.315
and cooled down enough and that plasma condensed into

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:07.265
a gas and light, for the first time could travel freely

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:08.775
and that light has been basically travelling

00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:11.765
through space ever since, and we now detect it as this very faint echo

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.075
and by looking at patterns that this

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.235
radiation across the whole sky leaves, you can calculate again

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:20.235
how much dark matter there is in the universe and all three of these methods

00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:23.285
give you broadly similar answers

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.805
and the dark energy one you can work out by basically how

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.255
much acceleration is there in the

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:29.505
way that galaxies are moving away from our own.

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:32.705
So they are all complementary measurements and they basically all line up

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.275
so its a fairly solid picture,

00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:37.005
particularly in terms of the dark matter

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.975
Anyone over there? The young man in the middle

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.385
if

00:02:45.455 --> 00:02:47.905
so like how  you have a dimension

00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:51.285
is to what that means that there isn't

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:54.615
a boson for gravity

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.635
aah very good question(so how could you explain gravity)

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.805
is there a boson for gravity is that what you are asking?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.920
no..no basically if there is no boson for

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.300
gravity, how could you explain it?.ok, so thats a very good question

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.940
so there are two parts of the question.You asked about extra dimensions

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.925
does that mean there is no boson for gravity..well we think,

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:19.235
there is a particle for gravity and it would be called the graviton

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.165
and it would be a bit unlike

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.475
the other particles in that table

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:25.755
the problem with gravitons is that

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:29.135
assuming that they do exist and we sort of assume that they do

00:03:29.305 --> 00:03:31.695
because  gravity is so weak

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:34.685
its very very difficult to actually measure

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:36.945
their effect so,

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:39.505
if you go down to particle level,

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:40.525
you have got these

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:43.465
these incredibly strong forces.You have got the electromagnetic force

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:46.505
you have got the strong nuclear force and you have got the weak force

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:48.565
and they totally overwhelm gravity

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:49.065
so if you are trying to

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:51.385
do some experiment where you are measuring

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:53.405
say, the gravitational attraction between

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:55.965
two particles, that attraction is so

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:59.075
fantastically tiny, that it's basically impossible to measure

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:00.525
in an experiment at the moment

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:03.295
if you wanted to find really sort of

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:04.425
really see evidence of gravitons

00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:06.865
you have to build a gigantic particle accelerator

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:09.755
that was the size of the milky way, unfortunately

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:12.955
so, we think gravitons are out there

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:15.305
but we dont have any firm

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:16.115
evidence for

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.875
their existence but its kind of assumed that they are but they are very very

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.915
at the moment, impossible to detect directly

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:26.125
but sometimes actually these, extra dimensional theories

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.565
contain massive gravitons in them

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.505
and those are things you could observe in a collider, so if some of these

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:34.415
extra dimensions of space ideas are right

00:04:34.415 --> 00:04:37.645
then there could be gravitons that are detectable by the LHC for example

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.615
so we might find out maybe if we are lucky.

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:43.575
Thank you..I have noticed

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:46.505
that there is a question upstairs.We will come to you as the very final question

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.405
because unfortunately we don't have a microphone upstairs

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:51.165
but is there anyone in the center block?maybe on the left there?

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.975
The gentleman right at the back there

00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:54.825
I'm sorry to send you right to the top

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:57.675
but we will just watch Phil run up the stairs *laughter*

00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:58.675
There we go

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:02.825
You said in the large hadron collider(LHC)

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:05.315
there are black holes created

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.535
mini black holes that disintegrate

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:10.545
into particles spontaneously..but we know there

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:11.455
are black holes in

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:14.455
the universe at the center of galaxies.

00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:17.365
Why don't they decay spontaneously too?

00:05:17.365 --> 00:05:20.605
Ahh thats a good question..they do actually, but just very slowly

00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:22.755
so..umm

00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:26.925
essentially what Stephen Hawking showed..i think it was in the 60s or 70s

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.065
was that a black hole,

00:05:29.065 --> 00:05:32.245
if you are not feeding it and it's just sitting in empty space

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:35.295
gently radiates energy away so that it evaporates

00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:38.335
over a very very long period of time

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:41.525
the bigger the black hole is, the slower the evaporation is

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:44.615
so essentially as a black hole evaporates, imagine you had a black hole

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:47.445
and you left it in space for trillions and trillions and trillions of years

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:50.395
very gradually, it would give off radiation and get smaller and smaller

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:53.515
and as it got smaller, the radiation gets higher and higher.

00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:55.645
So basically a black hole kind of

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:58.535
dies very slowly, but then at the last minute it kinda goes schwoop!

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.455
very quickly and all of its energy disappears

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:03.345
and it would be a very violent process..so

00:06:03.345 --> 00:06:05.775
the black hole that we..well..we haven't managed

00:06:05.775 --> 00:06:08.125
so far there is no evidence that black holes are being created at the LHC

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:10.985
there is certainly no sign of them..but if you could

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:13.215
create one of these things because it's

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:15.825
basically as small as a black hole could be

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.755
it would evaporate instantaneously because of its tiny size

00:06:18.755 --> 00:06:21.765
whereas a much bigger blackhole

00:06:21.765 --> 00:06:25.245
would evaporate very very slowly and the level of radiation it gives off is extremely low

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:29.215
I want to ask you about the Alice experiment

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:32.335
It's a bit of a Cinderella experiment at CERN that doesn't sort of get mentioned

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:35.355
yeah poor Alice yeah..so..what's coming

00:06:35.355 --> 00:06:37.665
out of the colliding heavy

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:38.985
ions together

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:41.565
you are looking for new states of matter

00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:44.345
can you just update us on what is happening with that

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:46.655
and will that have informed our theories that we've just had, this

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:49.615
wonderful discovery, the neutron star merger

00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:52.545
multi messenger astronomy

00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:55.745
has that informed at CERN our theories

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:57.535
of how nuclear synthesis takes place

00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:59.975
in the neutron star merger

00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:02.560
Really, you are getting a little bit at the edge of my knowledge here to be honest

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.335
I can tell you about Alice but the neutron star..whether there is a link there I don't know

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:07.925
there maybe..but what Alice does

00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:10.825
essentially is the heavy ion experiment

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.485
so for usually for about a month of the year

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:15.455
the LHC, rather than accelerating protons accelerated lead ions

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:18.365
so that the nuclei of the lead bang into each other

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:19.815
and when that happens

00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:22.695
I cant remember what the atomic number of lead is..but it's a big number (82)

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:23.755
some 100

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:30.055
hundred and something( atomic mass:207) I can't remember exactly..but when those nuclei bang into each other you get a huge amount of mess essentially

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:33.015
so *laughs* the Alice collisions..I showed you some of the

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:35.545
collisions of CMS

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:38.025
CMS collisions have just 100s of lines in them

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:41.515
the Alice collisions just have 1000s of particles going everywhere

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.500
so what the objective of Alice is really trying to do is to study

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.945
a state of matter that hasn't existed in the universe

00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:49.275
since the very short

00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:51.995
fraction of a second after the big bang something called a quark-gluon plasma

00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:53.315
 

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:55.515
so..the states of matter you maybe familiar with

00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:58.055
you got

00:07:58.055 --> 00:07:59.985
solids, liquids and gases

00:07:59.985 --> 00:08:02.785
if you take a gas and heat it up even more eventually the electrons will dissociate

00:08:02.785 --> 00:08:05.165
from the atom and you get plasma and that's

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:06.535
what the sun is made of mostly

00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:08.845
if you heat a plasma even more, eventually

00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:11.635
at very high temperatures, the nuclei

00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.955
will disintegrate into protons and neutrons

00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:16.025
if you keep heating them even more

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:18.455
the protons and neutrons melt effectively

00:08:18.455 --> 00:08:21.435
and they turn into a sort of soup of quarks and gluons

00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.205
which behaves a bit like a liquid

00:08:24.205 --> 00:08:27.105
kind of this blob of extremely hot liquid

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:27.555
umm

00:08:27.555 --> 00:08:30.795
and what Alice was trying to do is really to study the properties of this stuff, so you get

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:31.815
 

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:37.635
in these lead ion collisions you get little blobs of quark-gluon plasma that exist for a short period of time and then they

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:40.295
condense like kind of a

00:08:40.295 --> 00:08:42.815
a liquid turning into a solid

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:45.855
and the particles come flying out of that blob

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:48.555
and it gives what you see in the detectors turning further properties of that very hot blob

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:51.585
i think i may get this number wrong

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:54.565
but Alice broke the record for the highest man made temperature

00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:56.725
..ever..a few years ago

00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.405
i think it was something stupid like 1.5 trillion

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:02.025
kelvin, but don't quote me on that

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:04.745
but it was of that order anyway..so they

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.965
are doing really extraordinary things..I don't know very

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:09.345
much about it and it's very exciting and it's kind of

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:11.225
it's really telling us something about

00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:14.485
what the conditions of the universe would have been like shortly after the big bang

00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:17.665
and it also helps us to understand this strong nuclear force

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:20.305
because the strong force is actually very

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:22.215
hard to study because it's

00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:25.085
impossible actually to separate quarks

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:27.145
out from protons

00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:29.815
and the only time this happens is  when you make this quark-gluon plasma where

00:09:29.815 --> 00:09:32.675
you have this free quarks and gluons floating about

00:09:32.675 --> 00:09:35.885
and looking at how it behaves compared to what the strong force

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:38.455
tells us or the theory of the strong force tells us allows us

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:41.425
to also understand a bit more about this force in the standard model.

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:46.455
Going back to the dark matter theory,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.280
You didn't mention the modified

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.340
Newtonian gravitational theory, the MOND

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.255
Is that falling out of favour now?

00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:57.375
It's not really been in favour for a long time I think

00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.695
MOND is essentially

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:02.715
when dark matter was discovered, an attempt was made

00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:03.015
 

00:10:03.015 --> 00:10:06.235
to say lets not invoke a whole new type of physical material

00:10:06.235 --> 00:10:08.355
what if its just the gravity that needs to be modified

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:10.295
we need to change the law of gravity

00:10:10.295 --> 00:10:13.305
and maybe we can explain gravity rotation curves

00:10:13.305 --> 00:10:15.575
and various other things just by changing Einstein's theory of relativity

00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:17.905
general relativity essentially

00:10:17.905 --> 00:10:21.145
and its always been a bit marginal but I think

00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:24.105
I mean really all the evidence suggests that it doesn't really work

00:10:24.105 --> 00:10:25.635
you cant use it to explain

00:10:25.635 --> 00:10:28.605
all these different things that you see. Lensing, rotation curves,

00:10:28.605 --> 00:10:30.145
 

00:10:30.145 --> 00:10:33.105
the formation of structures in the universe..it's very hard to account

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:36.105
for all these different things using the modified gravitational theories

00:10:36.105 --> 00:10:39.165
I think actually that measurement in the neutron star collisions

00:10:39.165 --> 00:10:40.005
umm

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:43.365
was a really big blow to the MOND theory

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.545
the reason these..so this is

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.915
you may have heard about it.. it was in the news I think couple of weeks ago

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.665
LIGO, which was this gravitational wave detector

00:10:50.745 --> 00:10:52.395
saw the sign of

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:55.245
two neutron stars banging into each other in a very distant part of the universe

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:57.855
and that causes these ripples in spacetime

00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:00.685
which can be detected by these incredibly sophisticated

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:03.935
gigantic lasers essentially in the states

00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:07.145
what was interesting about the neutron star collision was that it

00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:10.085
didnt just have a gravitational wave associated with it

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:12.975
it had a light source associated with it

00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:15.365
so the two or three things that LIGO

00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:17.995
has seen before when black hole-black hole collisions

00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:20.535
when black holes collided they don't give off any light they just go..glub

00:11:20.755 --> 00:11:23.565
they give out lots of gravitational waves but no light

00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:25.985
neutron stars that were not black holes, they are made of matter

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:29.015
very strange and very dense matter,when they bang into each other you get

00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:31.925
you do get a lot of light produced..so I think when

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:34.795
LIGO detected this gravitational wave they said

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.665
look at the sky quickly and telescopes pointed at the place where

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:40.645
they thought the wave had come from and they saw a glow of light

00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:43.275
and what they found was that the time

00:11:43.275 --> 00:11:46.595
the arrival time between the light and the gravitational wave was basically

00:11:46.595 --> 00:11:49.355
exactly the same, within a sec or few seconds

00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:51.505
and this gravitational wave had travelled

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:53.815
across almost the entire universe and what that tells us

00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:56.455
is that the speed of gravity and speed of light is basically the same

00:11:56.455 --> 00:11:59.435
and usually in MOND theories they are not

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:00.665
so..

00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:04.445
as my understanding at least there is kind of this

00:12:04.445 --> 00:12:05.755
neutron-neutron star collision

00:12:05.755 --> 00:12:08.735
actually is a big blow to MOND theories as well..so

00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:11.525
they are probably i suspect there would probably be any theory where you can find any way of

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:14.285
explain your way why you havent seen any sign of it

00:12:14.285 --> 00:12:16.225
but they are not really in favor at the moment

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:17.835
ok thanks

00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:21.355
so are there any questions?the gentleman at the back

00:12:21.455 --> 00:12:24.305
no women asked questions i would like women to ask questions if thats possible

00:12:24.305 --> 00:12:27.075
*laughs* the man in the middle..i am sorry i just

00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:28.605
wanted a laughing frenzy.Phil can you get the mic up there?

00:12:28.975 --> 00:12:31.015
umm so you talked about anti matter so

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:34.065
what if they are an anti-force field

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:37.235
if it is possible what would

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:38.535
they be like?

00:12:39.255 --> 00:12:42.445
umm..well anti force fields..you mean the umm..

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.855
so like the photon...

00:12:44.615 --> 00:12:45.615
yeah

00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:48.205
so the force particles do

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.965
have anti particles but they are actually themselves

00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.615
so this photon is the only anti particle

00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:55.585
so two photons can annihilate

00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:58.625
and make an electron and positron for example..the same with  gluons

00:12:58.625 --> 00:12:59.835
and the same with

00:12:59.835 --> 00:13:01.875
the Ws and the Zs so they are

00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.435
all their own anti particles

00:13:03.435 --> 00:13:06.595
actually the W is one where its really obvious..let me go back

00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:08.295
one animation

00:13:09.535 --> 00:13:10.545
ok not too far

00:13:11.035 --> 00:13:12.365
there we go..so

00:13:12.545 --> 00:13:15.475
the W actually comes in two different types..the W+ and the W-

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:17.685
the W+ is positively charged

00:13:17.685 --> 00:13:20.375
and the W- is negatively charged..so they are literally

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:21.235
antiparticles  of each other

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:23.475
but the photon is its own anti particle,the gluons

00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:25.065
they are their own antiparticles as well so..

00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:27.365
its are not quite the same but they do have

00:13:27.365 --> 00:13:28.675
anti versions

00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:32.865
The lady in the center..pass the mic along

00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:38.685
I just want to ask a question about something

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:41.685
you mentioned at the start about cosmic energy fields  giving

00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:44.085
mass to all particles..umm..

00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:47.695
Is it that different particles have different fields?

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:50.375
or is it that theres..

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:53.415
the field is giving mass to all particles?

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.695
well..so there is a field

00:13:55.695 --> 00:13:58.885
for every single particle..so for every

00:13:58.885 --> 00:14:01.855
square in this table has a field there is..

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:04.375
an up quark field for example and an

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:07.195
up quark is just a ripple in the up quark field

00:14:07.195 --> 00:14:09.085
and the same for the

00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:12.035
I don't know..the muon neutrino field and the

00:14:12.035 --> 00:14:15.435
muon neutrino is a little ripple in the muon neutrino field

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:18.825
so those are the fields that these particles exist in

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:22.195
but on top of that there is another field which is the Higgs field

00:14:22.355 --> 00:14:24.025
and that field...

00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:27.285
for one thing the ripple in the Higgs field  is the Higgs boson

00:14:27.285 --> 00:14:30.275
this thing..but that field also imbued to

00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:32.945
these other particles with the property of mass

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.315
so if you like, when you make a little ripple inside the up quark field

00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:36.785
 

00:14:36.785 --> 00:14:39.895
that interacts with the Higgs field around it and it

00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:42.165
acquires mass through that interaction.

00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:45.475
its not a very good analogy unfortunately but that is basically what is going on

00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:50.305
5-ish minutes left

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:52.785
there is a question here..I will come up..you don't mind

00:14:57.825 --> 00:15:00.905
can I ask you a question about dark energy? so dark energy is a

00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:02.695
field of some sort

00:15:02.695 --> 00:15:05.915
that opposes gravity..but is energy really a..

00:15:05.915 --> 00:15:06.465
 

00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:09.515
the right name for it or are we talking about something completely different?

00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:12.605
there are different..well everything is energy to some extent

00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:15.595
so any field is

00:15:15.595 --> 00:15:18.315
a form of energy..there is energy stored in

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:21.465
the electromagnetic fields,the quark fields,the electron field and so on

00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:24.395
so energy is probably fine because it basically describes pretty much anything you can think of.

00:15:24.395 --> 00:15:26.755
umm there are a lots of different possibilities

00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:29.385
for what dark energy could be

00:15:29.405 --> 00:15:31.015
one of the first attempts

00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.985
of explaining it was that..well i said that

00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:37.435
all of these particles in the standard model have associated fields

00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:40.445
and those fields even when there are no particles in them

00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:42.095
so when there are no ripples moving about

00:15:42.095 --> 00:15:43.755
these fields have a finite amount of energy

00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:45.915
thats due to something called quantum

00:15:45.915 --> 00:15:48.325
uncertainly..because of quantum mechanics

00:15:48.325 --> 00:15:50.635
all these fields if you think about them a bit like

00:15:50.635 --> 00:15:53.565
the surface of a pond..they are all jittering  slightly all the time

00:15:53.565 --> 00:15:54.535
and that

00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:57.005
jittering contains a certain amount of energy

00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:59.485
so what people tried to do was calcuate

00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:02.455
if you take a cubic meter space and i calculate

00:16:02.455 --> 00:16:02.935
how much

00:16:02.935 --> 00:16:06.255
energy is stored in all these jitters and all these fields we have got here

00:16:06.285 --> 00:16:09.185
how  big is that energy?and could it be dark energy?

00:16:09.195 --> 00:16:12.105
and what you find..you get a number that is something like a

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:14.785
ten to the hundred and twenty two times big

00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:18.285
*laughs* so..if you basically  calculate using the standard..

00:16:18.285 --> 00:16:21.085
well,the naive version of the standard model..some calculation to estimate

00:16:21.085 --> 00:16:23.735
roughly how much energy is stored..you find a number that

00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:26.125
is 10  with a 120 zeroes after it

00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:28.675
too large..so if that were..

00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:31.745
dark energy then the universe would have ripped itself to pieces immediately

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.985
essentially..so..

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:36.785
it may be that its the energy of the vacuum

00:16:36.785 --> 00:16:38.105
which is what we are talking about here

00:16:38.105 --> 00:16:41.525
and its just that we dont know how to really calculate it properly we are missing something

00:16:41.805 --> 00:16:44.435
umm..it could be some additional field though

00:16:44.435 --> 00:16:47.245
so..umm..there are various ideas that it could

00:16:47.245 --> 00:16:50.175
be a field a bit like the Higg's field so..

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.565
an additional something called the 'inflaton'

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:56.055
field..or something else..which then..

00:16:56.075 --> 00:16:57.495
something that could have been involved in the

00:16:57.495 --> 00:17:00.235
expansion of the universe shortly after the big bang and it

00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:02.905
has been hanging around ever and since and is still causing this..

00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:05.945
expansion..there are some ideas that it even could be the Higg's field itself

00:17:05.945 --> 00:17:08.525
or that the Higg's field could somehow be causing

00:17:08.525 --> 00:17:11.615
expansion of the universe..there are loads of ideas out there but unfortunately

00:17:11.615 --> 00:17:13.245
we don't have evidence for any of them just yet.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:17.985
umm..I am sure I saw some other hands over there here we go

00:17:17.985 --> 00:17:19.655
there is a gentleman..there..

00:17:21.955 --> 00:17:22.955
Thank you

00:17:24.935 --> 00:17:27.915
umm..I was wondering if the Higgs field

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:30.715
that is what is giving all the other particles mass,

00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:32.575
How is it that the Higgs boson

00:17:32.575 --> 00:17:35.765
has an associated mass with it on the diagram there

00:17:35.765 --> 00:17:38.605
the Higg's gives itself mass is the answer to the question

00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:41.225
*laughs* it is a bit unsatisfying but umm..

00:17:41.225 --> 00:17:43.115
yeah, the Higgs boson also

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:46.165
interacts with the Higgs field and gets mass through its interaction

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.415
with the Higgs field

00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:49.655
you have to take my word for it unfortunately

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:54.025
and there is a question just there as well..just..yes

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:55.025
thats great

00:17:56.525 --> 00:17:58.895
Hi, can I talk a bit about the..

00:17:58.895 --> 00:18:01.915
you said that the Higgs boson gives mass and its

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:03.895
mass is in like..

00:18:03.955 --> 00:18:06.535
in general is quite related to the gravity

00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:09.525
but apparently it's not so..

00:18:09.525 --> 00:18:11.595
can you talk about that relation?

00:18:12.015 --> 00:18:13.955
yeah..ok so umm

00:18:14.055 --> 00:18:16.955
lets talk about gravity first..so what Einstein is

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:19.735
well we get Newton's law of gravity

00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:22.635
what Newton's law of gravity says is that

00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:24.845
gravity is created by mass so  if i have

00:18:24.845 --> 00:18:27.505
two masses mass M1 and mass M2

00:18:27.505 --> 00:18:28.945
then there is a force between them

00:18:28.945 --> 00:18:32.005
which depends on how big those masses are and how apart they are

00:18:32.005 --> 00:18:34.355
so,the bigger the masses the stronger the force

00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:35.835
that is what Newton says

00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:38.725
Einstein said something slightly different  which is that

00:18:38.725 --> 00:18:42.035
it's not just mass but its all forms of energy and momentum

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:44.905
so if I take a bit of space..lets say

00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:47.605
I don't know..a piece of the interior of the sun

00:18:47.845 --> 00:18:49.155
that contains

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:52.215
electrons,protons and other things whizzing about..they all have mass

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.485
they have rest mass..but they also have

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:57.405
kinetic energy because they are moving and they have momentum

00:18:57.405 --> 00:19:00.065
because they are moving about and they have a pressure

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.795
as well..so in general relativity

00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:05.405
basically all forms of energy are sorts gravitation

00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:07.355
not just rest mass

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:09.895
so that means if things are moving about quickly

00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:12.805
they contain mass..they create mass

00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:15.675
as well..or create gravity rather

00:19:15.675 --> 00:19:18.185
so that is the relation between energy and mass

00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:19.685
so when we were talking about the Higgs field

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:22.665
we are really talking about the rest mass of these particles so if

00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:25.885
I take an electron and i stop it and look at it

00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:27.345
it has this fundamental amount

00:19:27.345 --> 00:19:29.815
of energy left in it when it is not doing anything

00:19:29.815 --> 00:19:32.505
which is its rest mass...and that rest mass

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.265
comes from the Higgs field but..

00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:37.845
not actually interesting..not all mass actually

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:40.675
not all mass ..only the rest mass comes from the Higgs field

00:19:40.675 --> 00:19:43.745
so if you have say..a hot bit of the sun

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:46.325
a lot of the energy in that system that creates

00:19:46.325 --> 00:19:47.295
gravity is not

00:19:47.295 --> 00:19:50.195
to do with the rest mass of the particles in it

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.280
umm..actually interestingly..the proton and the neutron

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.300
if you..umm

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:01.005
I said their masses are about 2000 times mass of the electron..protons and neutrons are made of up quarks and down quarks

00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:03.895
so here are these two things here..so..these have

00:20:03.895 --> 00:20:06.915
a mass in..this is particle physics units

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.995
of about 2MeV

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:12.045
which is about 4 times

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.085
the mass of the electron..so we got

00:20:15.085 --> 00:20:18.395
4 times the mass..we got two of these guys i the proton..so thats about

00:20:18.445 --> 00:20:19.445
umm..

00:20:19.545 --> 00:20:21.825
8 times the mass of the electron and then you add on this

00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:24.645
and that  gives you another 8

00:20:24.645 --> 00:20:27.055
so about 16 times the mass of the electron

00:20:27.055 --> 00:20:30.095
but the proton is 2000 times heavier..so how does that work?

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:32.395
well thats because most of the mass

00:20:32.395 --> 00:20:34.435
of the proton doesnt come from the mass of the quarks at all

00:20:34.435 --> 00:20:35.855
it comes from

00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:38.605
the energy stored in the binding of the strong force

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:41.655
that glues these quarks together inside the proton

00:20:41.655 --> 00:20:44.055
so the Higgs field only really accounts for actually

00:20:44.105 --> 00:20:46.935
very small amount of mass..most of the mass in our body

00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:48.715
is the mass of the strong force

00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:51.665
binding around inside these protons and neutrons

00:20:51.665 --> 00:20:54.375
so..it explains a particular type of mass

00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:56.175
when there is a link to gravitation but the

00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:58.255
Higgs field itself doesn't actuually

00:20:58.255 --> 00:21:00.945
do anything different to  say the electron

00:21:00.945 --> 00:21:03.925
to the quarks..in terms of adding extra energy

00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:04.995
that can create gravity

00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:09.355
so we will take the final question from down here..the gentleman with the mic

00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:13.015
hi uhh..you said that the Higgs boson

00:21:13.015 --> 00:21:16.035
was predicted from umm..

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:17.955
mathematical equations

00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:20.525
I was just wondering if lot of these theories are based on math

00:21:20.525 --> 00:21:23.415
Why are they all correct? Isn't like

00:21:23.455 --> 00:21:26.405
Isn't there like only one right answer

00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:29.595
from these mathematical equations?..well these are.. I mean yeah

00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:32.195
these are only models so..

00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:33.885
maths is the language you use but they are not

00:21:33.885 --> 00:21:36.545
derived from first principles..so any theory

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:39.695
in physics starts with some assumptions so..

00:21:39.695 --> 00:21:41.905
for example if you take umm..

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.605
if you take general relativity..Einstein's theory on gravity

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.665
that starts from the assumption that

00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:50.515
acceleration and gravity are indistinguishable

00:21:50.515 --> 00:21:53.265
so thats his assumption..so if you use that you can then

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.720
with a few other things you can make progress

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.220
and derive the theory of gravity

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.175
but it's not something that just emerges from mathematics by itself..you could

00:22:00.175 --> 00:22:01.195
write down lots of

00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:04.105
different theories..and people indeed..people do thats what theorists spend all their days doing

00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:07.015
actually is coming up with some different..so

00:22:07.015 --> 00:22:10.295
the standard model starts off with some set of assumptions basically,

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:13.065
you are about to add in different sorts of

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:16.075
symmetries of nature and different sorts of particle fields

00:22:16.075 --> 00:22:18.295
and then you can use the theory to calculate

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:21.225
how these things would behave but you could equally well..put in some

00:22:21.225 --> 00:22:23.915
different fields like super symmetry or something else they are not

00:22:23.915 --> 00:22:26.215
derived from some single fundamental principle

00:22:26.215 --> 00:22:28.765
and then everything comes out of it

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:31.645
you have to start somewhere..i am gonna introduce these ingridients

00:22:31.645 --> 00:22:33.385
and then work out what the consequences are

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:36.295
I guess what you are describing is sort of this like dream of

00:22:36.295 --> 00:22:39.385
the final theory that Weinberg and others have talked about for a very long time

00:22:39.385 --> 00:22:42.395
there may be some basic principle

00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:44.775
that if we start with it we can workout everything and

00:22:44.775 --> 00:22:46.815
that seems rather unlikely..I think you are always

00:22:46.815 --> 00:22:49.665
gonna have to make some assumption at the beginning

00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:52.095
and that assumption will determine what the theory looks like

00:22:53.495 --> 00:22:54.845
so finally

00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:57.425
you have been bursting to ask this question the whole time so if you could just uhh

00:22:57.655 --> 00:23:00.155
pass the mic thank you.....Are we in the 3rd dimension

00:23:00.155 --> 00:23:03.175
or the 4th dimension because of time?

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:05.225
right..so thats quite a good question.

00:23:05.225 --> 00:23:07.695
So there are three dimensions of space that is up,

00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:10.505
that way and that way and here is also time

00:23:10.775 --> 00:23:13.625
so there are four dimensions but time is quite unlike

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.975
the three dimensions..so spatial dimensions

00:23:15.975 --> 00:23:18.565
you can choose how you move through them..I can go this way..

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:21.435
or I can go this way or I can jump in the air

00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:24.185
but I can't choose how I move through time but that kind of just seems to happen

00:23:24.185 --> 00:23:26.845
I can get carried along through time

00:23:26.845 --> 00:23:29.145
and people don't really understand

00:23:29.145 --> 00:23:31.865
very well what time is and there are lots of ideas about

00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:34.565
you know trying to explain..you know

00:23:34.565 --> 00:23:36.005
trying to get time emerge from a deeper principle

00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:39.065
but yes..the short answer to the question is yes..there are 4 dimensions including time

00:23:39.065 --> 00:23:42.225
but we don't necessarily really know what time is.

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:45.585
Fantastic well..

00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:50.235
thats a very slightly intruiging*laughs* but also

00:23:50.235 --> 00:23:52.445
tantalising point to end this evening

00:23:52.445 --> 00:23:55.375
iIjust wanted to end with a slight commment and..

00:23:55.375 --> 00:23:57.905
as some of you may know and I may well get the day wrong here

00:23:57.905 --> 00:24:00.215
but i think it was 1897 when

00:24:00.215 --> 00:24:03.295
JJ thompson at the Cavendish laboratory

00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:05.665
umm discovered the electron

00:24:05.665 --> 00:24:08.315
as should correctly say the fundamental particle that later

00:24:08.315 --> 00:24:11.075
became known as the electron which is a very long-winded way of saying

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.065
he had once called it the electron umm where did he come

00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:17.040
to come to announce it? Well, he came right here to this very lecture theatre to announce

00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:19.500
the electron discovery so, I would like to think Harry

00:24:19.505 --> 00:24:21.185
that when you, and your colleagues

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:23.205
of the Cavendish laboratory and uhh..

00:24:23.205 --> 00:24:26.095
the LHCB experiment solved the problem

00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:29.125
of the Lepton universality, you'll come back here

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:31.395
to announce the discovery but uhh..

00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:34.295
and in the meantime thank you so much for the fantastic talk and an excellent evening *applause*
