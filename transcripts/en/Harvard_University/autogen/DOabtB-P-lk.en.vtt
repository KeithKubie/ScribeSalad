welcome to the second lecture in our
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.609
welcome to the second lecture in our
series on science and cooking and we're

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
series on science and cooking and we're
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.089
series on science and cooking and we're
delighted today to have Joanne Chang

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099
delighted today to have Joanne Chang
 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.740
delighted today to have Joanne Chang
this week the topic is phase transitions

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
this week the topic is phase transitions
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.089
this week the topic is phase transitions
now phase transitions is what happens

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
now phase transitions is what happens
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.650
now phase transitions is what happens
like when you boil water you know that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
like when you boil water you know that
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749
like when you boil water you know that
when you heat water it goes from being a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
when you heat water it goes from being a
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.280
when you heat water it goes from being a
normal temperature to being at some

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
normal temperature to being at some
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.250
normal temperature to being at some
point the liquid transforms to a gas and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
point the liquid transforms to a gas and
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.619
point the liquid transforms to a gas and
there are lots of phase transitions in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
there are lots of phase transitions in
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720
there are lots of phase transitions in
cooking I mean in fact arguably cooking

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
cooking I mean in fact arguably cooking
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280
cooking I mean in fact arguably cooking
is really the control of phase

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
is really the control of phase
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.319
is really the control of phase
transitions and it turns out that one of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
transitions and it turns out that one of
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750
transitions and it turns out that one of
the most useful phase transitions for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
the most useful phase transitions for
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.950
the most useful phase transitions for
and really one of the most interesting

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
and really one of the most interesting
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.689
and really one of the most interesting
for cooking happens with sugar water

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699
for cooking happens with sugar water
 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.820
for cooking happens with sugar water
which is going to play I think a

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830
which is going to play I think a
 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.310
which is going to play I think a
prominent role in tonight's lecture and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
prominent role in tonight's lecture and
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990
prominent role in tonight's lecture and
I mean the thing about sugar water

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
I mean the thing about sugar water
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240
I mean the thing about sugar water
actually is anyone drinking Coca Cola

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
actually is anyone drinking Coca Cola
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.030
actually is anyone drinking Coca Cola
does anyone have a Coca Cola you have a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040
does anyone have a Coca Cola you have a
 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.560
does anyone have a Coca Cola you have a
Coca Cola no one will admit it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
Coca Cola no one will admit it
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.359
Coca Cola no one will admit it
so I mean well okay so let me ask you a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
so I mean well okay so let me ask you a
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.710
so I mean well okay so let me ask you a
question maybe in fact I'm not going to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
question maybe in fact I'm not going to
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.120
question maybe in fact I'm not going to
use my slides maybe I'm going to just

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
use my slides maybe I'm going to just
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.800
use my slides maybe I'm going to just
talk about phase transitions instead so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
talk about phase transitions instead so
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080
talk about phase transitions instead so
I should have brought this demo so does

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
I should have brought this demo so does
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090
I should have brought this demo so does
anybody know if we took is that a beaker

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
anybody know if we took is that a beaker
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.590
anybody know if we took is that a beaker
of water

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600
of water
 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.210
of water
this is ice that's ice so if we took

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
this is ice that's ice so if we took
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.860
this is ice that's ice so if we took
water that's about how much water is

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870
water that's about how much water is
 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.110
water that's about how much water is
that that's about it's five and a half

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120
that that's about it's five and a half
 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.760
that that's about it's five and a half
cups of water does anybody know how much

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
cups of water does anybody know how much
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440
cups of water does anybody know how much
sugar we can dissolve in five and a half

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
sugar we can dissolve in five and a half
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.500
sugar we can dissolve in five and a half
cups of water that is for example

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510
cups of water that is for example
 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.090
cups of water that is for example
suppose we had another beaker which was

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
suppose we had another beaker which was
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.340
suppose we had another beaker which was
filled with sugar up to this level do

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
filled with sugar up to this level do
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050
filled with sugar up to this level do
you think if we mixed it in the water it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
you think if we mixed it in the water it
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.899
you think if we mixed it in the water it
would dissolve who votes yes who votes

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
would dissolve who votes yes who votes
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.280
would dissolve who votes yes who votes
no okay so but most of you didn't vote

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
no okay so but most of you didn't vote
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.870
no okay so but most of you didn't vote
did you notice that they didn't vote so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
did you notice that they didn't vote so
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.890
did you notice that they didn't vote so
let's try it again you're not allowed to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900
let's try it again you're not allowed to
 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.630
let's try it again you're not allowed to
get away with this so it's a this is a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
get away with this so it's a this is a
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.980
get away with this so it's a this is a
straightforward question you can go home

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
straightforward question you can go home
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170
straightforward question you can go home
and verify it if we had you know five

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
and verify it if we had you know five
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270
and verify it if we had you know five
and a half cups of sugar and we poured

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
and a half cups of sugar and we poured
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310
and a half cups of sugar and we poured
it in five and a half cups of water who

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
it in five and a half cups of water who
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.890
it in five and a half cups of water who
votes that it would dissolve who votes

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900
votes that it would dissolve who votes
 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.649
votes that it would dissolve who votes
that it wouldn't dissolve okay so what

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
that it wouldn't dissolve okay so what
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.680
that it wouldn't dissolve okay so what
if we had five and a half cups of salt

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690
if we had five and a half cups of salt
 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.050
if we had five and a half cups of salt
instead of sugar salt so reads the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
instead of sugar salt so reads the
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910
instead of sugar salt so reads the
cooking material right so you use Co

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
cooking material right so you use Co
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.880
cooking material right so you use Co
something

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890
something
 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.640
something
who thinks the salt would dissolve who

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650
who thinks the salt would dissolve who
 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.380
who thinks the salt would dissolve who
thinks that the salt would not dissolve

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
thinks that the salt would not dissolve
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.050
thinks that the salt would not dissolve
okay so what if we had ten cups of sugar

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
okay so what if we had ten cups of sugar
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.150
okay so what if we had ten cups of sugar
sugar so that's five and a half cups of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160
sugar so that's five and a half cups of
 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.560
sugar so that's five and a half cups of
water suppose I had ten cups of sugar

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570
water suppose I had ten cups of sugar
 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.470
water suppose I had ten cups of sugar
who thinks it would dissolve who thinks

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
who thinks it would dissolve who thinks
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.240
who thinks it would dissolve who thinks
it wouldn't it off okay you're getting

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250
it wouldn't it off okay you're getting
 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.950
it wouldn't it off okay you're getting
better at voting so the answer is is

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960
better at voting so the answer is is
 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.580
better at voting so the answer is is
that ten cups of sugar would dissolve so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590
that ten cups of sugar would dissolve so
 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.800
that ten cups of sugar would dissolve so
the solubility so you can dissolve twice

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
the solubility so you can dissolve twice
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.440
the solubility so you can dissolve twice
the twice the weight of sugar in the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450
the twice the weight of sugar in the
 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.670
the twice the weight of sugar in the
equivalent weight of water at room

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680
equivalent weight of water at room
 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.650
equivalent weight of water at room
temperature now Joanne is going to be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660
temperature now Joanne is going to be
 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.910
temperature now Joanne is going to be
doing a lot of boiling are you going to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
doing a lot of boiling are you going to
 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.330
doing a lot of boiling are you going to
be boiling

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
be boiling
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.280
be boiling
I am so when you boil suppose you have

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
I am so when you boil suppose you have
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680
I am so when you boil suppose you have
water at 100 degrees Celsius boiling

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
water at 100 degrees Celsius boiling
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.650
water at 100 degrees Celsius boiling
point

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660
point
 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.730
point
how much sugar can you dissolve that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740
how much sugar can you dissolve that
 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.380
how much sugar can you dissolve that
does anybody know I mean maybe I'll ask

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
does anybody know I mean maybe I'll ask
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.180
does anybody know I mean maybe I'll ask
it this way so let's say we had eleven

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
it this way so let's say we had eleven
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.370
it this way so let's say we had eleven
so I'm leading you to the answer but so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
so I'm leading you to the answer but so
 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140
so I'm leading you to the answer but so
we said eleven cups so what about

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
we said eleven cups so what about
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.940
we said eleven cups so what about
fifteen cups can you add boiling water

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
fifteen cups can you add boiling water
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.820
fifteen cups can you add boiling water
fifteen cups twenty cups who votes

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
fifteen cups twenty cups who votes
 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.760
fifteen cups twenty cups who votes
fifteen who says yes twenty who says yes

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
fifteen who says yes twenty who says yes
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.740
fifteen who says yes twenty who says yes
so it turns out it's four times it's a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
so it turns out it's four times it's a
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.000
so it turns out it's four times it's a
factor of four at one hundred degrees

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
factor of four at one hundred degrees
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.610
factor of four at one hundred degrees
Celsius it's also the case and maybe

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
Celsius it's also the case and maybe
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.870
Celsius it's also the case and maybe
this is a better intro than what I had

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
this is a better intro than what I had
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.920
this is a better intro than what I had
prepared come to think of it cuz this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
prepared come to think of it cuz this
 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.090
prepared come to think of it cuz this
might even be relevant for what you're

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100
might even be relevant for what you're
 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.090
might even be relevant for what you're
going to talk about that's unusual right

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100
going to talk about that's unusual right
 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.340
going to talk about that's unusual right
you know so so it's also the case that I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
you know so so it's also the case that I
 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.720
you know so so it's also the case that I
don't know if you knew this but the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
don't know if you knew this but the
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.030
don't know if you knew this but the
boiling point of sugar water mixtures

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040
boiling point of sugar water mixtures
 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.430
boiling point of sugar water mixtures
increases with temperature so if you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440
increases with temperature so if you
 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.530
increases with temperature so if you
actually were to put four cups of sugar

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
actually were to put four cups of sugar
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.979
actually were to put four cups of sugar
of sugar in to a cup of water at a

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989
of sugar in to a cup of water at a
 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.630
of sugar in to a cup of water at a
hundred degrees Celsius the water

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640
hundred degrees Celsius the water
 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.130
hundred degrees Celsius the water
wouldn't be boiling the mixture wouldn't

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140
wouldn't be boiling the mixture wouldn't
 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.060
wouldn't be boiling the mixture wouldn't
be boiling the boiling point actually

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070
be boiling the boiling point actually
 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.979
be boiling the boiling point actually
goes up and I think what you're going to

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989
goes up and I think what you're going to
 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.780
goes up and I think what you're going to
see when Joanne gives this lecture and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
see when Joanne gives this lecture and
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.770
see when Joanne gives this lecture and
this is dangerous for me to see because

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780
this is dangerous for me to see because
 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.300
this is dangerous for me to see because
I have absolutely no idea what you're

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310
I have absolutely no idea what you're
 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.030
I have absolutely no idea what you're
going to say but anyway this will be

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
going to say but anyway this will be
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.660
going to say but anyway this will be
except that she's going to talk about

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670
except that she's going to talk about
 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.610
except that she's going to talk about
sugar is that is that you have to

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620
sugar is that is that you have to
 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.320
sugar is that is that you have to
control temperature very carefully

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330
control temperature very carefully
 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.240
control temperature very carefully
because what happens of course is that

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250
because what happens of course is that
 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.580
because what happens of course is that
that if you if you just dump heat in it

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590
that if you if you just dump heat in it
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.410
that if you if you just dump heat in it
then the the thing starts to boil the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420
then the the thing starts to boil the
 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.090
then the the thing starts to boil the
gas comes off and that of course means

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100
gas comes off and that of course means
 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.729
gas comes off and that of course means
that the sugar fraction increases which

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739
that the sugar fraction increases which
 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.199
that the sugar fraction increases which
makes the boiling point increase more

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209
makes the boiling point increase more
 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.690
makes the boiling point increase more
which makes the which makes the sugar

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700
which makes the which makes the sugar
 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.250
which makes the which makes the sugar
fraction increase even more and there's

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260
fraction increase even more and there's
 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.780
fraction increase even more and there's
a runaway phenomenon in this which is

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
a runaway phenomenon in this which is
 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.870
a runaway phenomenon in this which is
the reason how many of you make candy

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880
the reason how many of you make candy
 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.789
the reason how many of you make candy
how many of you don't make candy okay

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799
how many of you don't make candy okay
 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.680
how many of you don't make candy okay
good the second which is the reason that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690
good the second which is the reason that
 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.570
good the second which is the reason that
which is the reason that you have to buy

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580
which is the reason that you have to buy
 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.610
which is the reason that you have to buy
candy thermometers Joanne I don't think

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620
candy thermometers Joanne I don't think
 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.479
candy thermometers Joanne I don't think
needs a candy thermometer

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489
 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.590
so she'll explain to you how she gets

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600
so she'll explain to you how she gets
 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.759
so she'll explain to you how she gets
away with this presumably or if she

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769
away with this presumably or if she
 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.069
away with this presumably or if she
doesn't ask her so with no further ado

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079
doesn't ask her so with no further ado
 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.990
doesn't ask her so with no further ado
let me introduce Joanne so I actually it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000
let me introduce Joanne so I actually it
 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.280
let me introduce Joanne so I actually it
always makes me very happy to introduce

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290
always makes me very happy to introduce
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.840
always makes me very happy to introduce
Joanne for a number of different reasons

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850
Joanne for a number of different reasons
 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.240
Joanne for a number of different reasons
but one of them which for those of you

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250
but one of them which for those of you
 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.130
but one of them which for those of you
who have come here before you've heard

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140
who have come here before you've heard
 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.060
who have come here before you've heard
me say this but I'll just say it again

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070
me say this but I'll just say it again
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.220
me say this but I'll just say it again
is that so Joanne was a Harvard

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230
is that so Joanne was a Harvard
 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.870
is that so Joanne was a Harvard
undergraduate and she was an applied

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
undergraduate and she was an applied
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.560
undergraduate and she was an applied
math major and I as it happens run the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570
math major and I as it happens run the
 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.050
math major and I as it happens run the
applied math major I'm at Harvard and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060
applied math major I'm at Harvard and
 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.180
applied math major I'm at Harvard and
I've always I've never I've never

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190
I've always I've never I've never
 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.950
I've always I've never I've never
understood why I was involved in the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960
understood why I was involved in the
 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.909
understood why I was involved in the
science of cooking and Joanne though

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919
science of cooking and Joanne though
 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.170
science of cooking and Joanne though
well I mean she was an applied math and

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180
well I mean she was an applied math and
 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.580
well I mean she was an applied math and
she actually knows what she's doing and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590
she actually knows what she's doing and
 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.570
she actually knows what she's doing and
so it sort of somehow made me feel good

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580
so it sort of somehow made me feel good
 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.460
so it sort of somehow made me feel good
so anyway with that Joanne thank you

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470
 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.350
thank you for that introduction I always

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360
thank you for that introduction I always
 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.630
thank you for that introduction I always
learned something from the introduction

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640
learned something from the introduction
 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.120
learned something from the introduction
that you give Michael you always explain

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130
that you give Michael you always explain
 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.430
that you give Michael you always explain
stuff so one of the reasons why I love

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440
stuff so one of the reasons why I love
 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.250
stuff so one of the reasons why I love
coming to these classes I'm a nervous

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260
coming to these classes I'm a nervous
 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.740
coming to these classes I'm a nervous
wreck the entire week before I still am

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750
wreck the entire week before I still am
 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.710
wreck the entire week before I still am
right now but in that quick five or ten

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720
right now but in that quick five or ten
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.270
right now but in that quick five or ten
minutes that Michael speaks I always

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280
minutes that Michael speaks I always
 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.040
minutes that Michael speaks I always
learn a little bit more about what it is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050
learn a little bit more about what it is
 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.469
learn a little bit more about what it is
that I do because I know how it works

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479
that I do because I know how it works
 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.080
that I do because I know how it works
and I can explain what will happen but I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090
and I can explain what will happen but I
 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.700
and I can explain what will happen but I
didn't even think about what was

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710
didn't even think about what was
 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.050
didn't even think about what was
happening with the boiling point we are

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060
happening with the boiling point we are
 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060
happening with the boiling point we are
going to boil sugar I'm going to show

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
going to boil sugar I'm going to show
 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.440
going to boil sugar I'm going to show
you different things you can do with the

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450
you different things you can do with the
 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.480
you different things you can do with the
different stages of sugar but I didn't

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490
different stages of sugar but I didn't
 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.130
different stages of sugar but I didn't
even think about the actual boiling

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140
even think about the actual boiling
 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.190
even think about the actual boiling
point rising a little bit into the

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200
point rising a little bit into the
 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.750
point rising a little bit into the
lecture I will talk about the freezing

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760
lecture I will talk about the freezing
 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.110
lecture I will talk about the freezing
point of a liquid and how when you add

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120
point of a liquid and how when you add
 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.520
point of a liquid and how when you add
sugar to it it actually depresses the

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530
sugar to it it actually depresses the
 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.900
sugar to it it actually depresses the
freezing point but I hadn't thought

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910
freezing point but I hadn't thought
 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.940
freezing point but I hadn't thought
about how it works the other way so that

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950
about how it works the other way so that
 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.310
about how it works the other way so that
was really fun to learn so thank you

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320
was really fun to learn so thank you
 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.480
was really fun to learn so thank you
again for having me back

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490
again for having me back
 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.659
again for having me back
this year and thank your Harvard for

Jess

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.310
so the last two years that I've taught

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320
so the last two years that I've taught
 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.240
so the last two years that I've taught
here I focused very broadly on just the

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250
here I focused very broadly on just the
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.240
here I focused very broadly on just the
chemistry of science and the chemistry

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250
chemistry of science and the chemistry
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.000
chemistry of science and the chemistry
of baking science and baking and I

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010
of baking science and baking and I
 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.880
of baking science and baking and I
focused on making a cake what we did was

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890
focused on making a cake what we did was
 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.980
focused on making a cake what we did was
we took all the different ingredients

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
we took all the different ingredients
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.590
we took all the different ingredients
that go into a very simple yellow cake

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600
that go into a very simple yellow cake
 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.590
that go into a very simple yellow cake
and I talked about multiplication of

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600
and I talked about multiplication of
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.200
and I talked about multiplication of
eggs I talked about gluten formation I

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210
eggs I talked about gluten formation I
 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.820
eggs I talked about gluten formation I
talked a little bit about buttermilk and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830
talked a little bit about buttermilk and
 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.920
talked a little bit about buttermilk and
how it reacts differently than milk I

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930
how it reacts differently than milk I
 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.570
how it reacts differently than milk I
talked about all of the different ways

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580
talked about all of the different ways
 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.520
talked about all of the different ways
you can leaven a cake so with air and

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
you can leaven a cake so with air and
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.750
you can leaven a cake so with air and
with steam baking soda baking powder you

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760
with steam baking soda baking powder you
 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.490
with steam baking soda baking powder you
put all these things together mix them

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500
put all these things together mix them
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.510
put all these things together mix them
all up and then you get cake and what we

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520
all up and then you get cake and what we
 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.540
all up and then you get cake and what we
did the last two years is we taught

some of the cakes we did one with no
 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.680
some of the cakes we did one with no
baking powder one with no baking soda we

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690
baking powder one with no baking soda we
 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.420
baking powder one with no baking soda we
did melted butter instead of

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
did melted butter instead of
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.800
did melted butter instead of
room-temperature butter we did a host of

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810
room-temperature butter we did a host of
 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.690
room-temperature butter we did a host of
different things and it was a super fun

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700
different things and it was a super fun
 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.630
different things and it was a super fun

Harvard students were actually taking

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560
Harvard students were actually taking
 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.160
Harvard students were actually taking
this class as a course and two of the

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.170

science and cooking class and then
 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.710
science and cooking class and then
watching the lecture that I taught about

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720
watching the lecture that I taught about
 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.800
watching the lecture that I taught about
cake for their final project I think it

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810
cake for their final project I think it
 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.930
cake for their final project I think it
was their final project they decided

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940
was their final project they decided
 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.490
was their final project they decided
they wanted to do more with cake and so

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500
they wanted to do more with cake and so
 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.250
they wanted to do more with cake and so
they came up with spray cake I don't

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260
they came up with spray cake I don't
 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.690
they came up with spray cake I don't
know if any of you guys saw this it was

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700
know if any of you guys saw this it was
 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.030
know if any of you guys saw this it was
actually in the globe about two or three

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.040
actually in the globe about two or three
 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.120
actually in the globe about two or three
months ago it was front-page news that

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130
months ago it was front-page news that
 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.650
months ago it was front-page news that
these two Harvard students had come up

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660
these two Harvard students had come up
 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.740
these two Harvard students had come up
with a cake that you can put it they put

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750
with a cake that you can put it they put
 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.320
with a cake that you can put it they put
it in an aerosol can it sits on a shelf

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330
it in an aerosol can it sits on a shelf
 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.020
it in an aerosol can it sits on a shelf
in the grocery store and whenever you're

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.030
in the grocery store and whenever you're
 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.240
in the grocery store and whenever you're
hungry and you want cake you just spray

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250
hungry and you want cake you just spray
 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.510
hungry and you want cake you just spray
this into a pan and then bake it and

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520
this into a pan and then bake it and
 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.000
this into a pan and then bake it and
then you get cake so this is for people

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010
then you get cake so this is for people
 

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.740
then you get cake so this is for people
who think that cake mixes are too

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:06.750
who think that cake mixes are too
 

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.140
who think that cake mixes are too
difficult

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.150
difficult
 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.000
difficult
and thus you just want to take an

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.010
and thus you just want to take an
 

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.760
and thus you just want to take an
aerosol can and spray it but they came

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:12.770
aerosol can and spray it but they came
 

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.620
aerosol can and spray it but they came
by the restaurant and they baked me some

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:14.630
by the restaurant and they baked me some
 

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.200
by the restaurant and they baked me some
cake they wanted me to approve it and

cake they wanted me to approve it and
 

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.879
cake they wanted me to approve it and
see if they if I thought it was good and

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:18.889
see if they if I thought it was good and
 

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:21.070
see if they if I thought it was good and
I thought it was really good and I have

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080
I thought it was really good and I have
 

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.450
I thought it was really good and I have
to say it was really exciting to know

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:22.460
to say it was really exciting to know
 

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.610
to say it was really exciting to know
that something that I had taught had

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:24.620
that something that I had taught had
 

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.770
that something that I had taught had
actually led these students and inspired

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:26.780
actually led these students and inspired
 

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.520
actually led these students and inspired
them to create to create a product where

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:30.530
them to create to create a product where
 

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.629
them to create to create a product where
they're going to go off and make

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639
they're going to go off and make
 

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.719
they're going to go off and make
millions so two questions lead lead from

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:34.729
millions so two questions lead lead from
 

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.339
millions so two questions lead lead from
that and when I told my parents about

00:08:36.339 --> 00:08:36.349
that and when I told my parents about
 

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.170
that and when I told my parents about
this I sent it to them because my

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:38.180
this I sent it to them because my
 

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.130
this I sent it to them because my
picture was somewhere and they always

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:39.140
picture was somewhere and they always
 

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.230
picture was somewhere and they always
loved that kind of stuff the first thing

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.240
loved that kind of stuff the first thing
 

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.579
loved that kind of stuff the first thing
my mom said is are you getting royalties

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:42.589
my mom said is are you getting royalties
 

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:46.060
my mom said is are you getting royalties
on this so that I I still don't know I

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.070
on this so that I I still don't know I
 

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.250
on this so that I I still don't know I
haven't heard from them but they will

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:48.260
haven't heard from them but they will
 

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.500
haven't heard from them but they will
they might be here in this room or maybe

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.510
they might be here in this room or maybe
 

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.940
they might be here in this room or maybe
they'll watch the video and so they know

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:51.950
they'll watch the video and so they know
 

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.250
they'll watch the video and so they know
where to find me so you can you can

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:54.260
where to find me so you can you can
 

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.400
where to find me so you can you can
always you can always tag me along and

always you can always tag me along and
 

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.930
always you can always tag me along and
then the other question it raises is

00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:58.940
then the other question it raises is
 

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.760
then the other question it raises is
that it really does up the ante for this

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:00.770
that it really does up the ante for this
 

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.950
that it really does up the ante for this
lecture and can I create a lecture that

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:02.960
lecture and can I create a lecture that
 

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.829
lecture and can I create a lecture that
will inspire people and make people

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839
will inspire people and make people
 

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.110
will inspire people and make people
innovate something even more exciting so

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120
innovate something even more exciting so
 

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.090
innovate something even more exciting so
a lot of pressure this time around ok so

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.100
a lot of pressure this time around ok so
 

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.460
a lot of pressure this time around ok so
this time professor Brenner and I talked

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:15.470
this time professor Brenner and I talked
 

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.470
this time professor Brenner and I talked
about focusing on a singular subject

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480
about focusing on a singular subject
 

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.220
about focusing on a singular subject
rather than the broad topic of cooking

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.230
rather than the broad topic of cooking
 

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.410
rather than the broad topic of cooking
and baking and science and chemistry but

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.420
and baking and science and chemistry but
 

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.180
and baking and science and chemistry but
instead on just one subject and that is

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.190
instead on just one subject and that is
 

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.240
instead on just one subject and that is
sugar so this actually came at a great

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.250
sugar so this actually came at a great
 

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.400
sugar so this actually came at a great
time when professor Brunner called me

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.410
time when professor Brunner called me
 

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.260
time when professor Brunner called me
last year because I was just finishing

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.270
last year because I was just finishing
 

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.420
last year because I was just finishing
the manuscript for a new book that is

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:34.430
the manuscript for a new book that is
 

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.130
the manuscript for a new book that is
coming out next spring which is called

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:36.140
coming out next spring which is called
 

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.110
coming out next spring which is called
baking with less sugar and I just spent

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120
baking with less sugar and I just spent
 

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.930
baking with less sugar and I just spent
the prior year baking all year long with

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:40.940
the prior year baking all year long with
 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.090
the prior year baking all year long with
recipes that I was used to using at the

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.100
recipes that I was used to using at the
 

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.280
recipes that I was used to using at the
bakery but with less sugar or with no

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.290
bakery but with less sugar or with no
 

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.199
bakery but with less sugar or with no
sugar so I had a lot of experience

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:47.209
sugar so I had a lot of experience
 

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:49.900
sugar so I had a lot of experience
baking with less sugar or no sugar and

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:49.910
baking with less sugar or no sugar and
 

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.269
baking with less sugar or no sugar and
seeing the way the recipes came out when

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279
seeing the way the recipes came out when
 

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:54.970
seeing the way the recipes came out when
you didn't have sugar so I was excited

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:54.980
you didn't have sugar so I was excited
 

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.620
you didn't have sugar so I was excited
to take everything that I've learned and

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:56.630
to take everything that I've learned and
 

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.360
to take everything that I've learned and
then share that with you guys so that

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.370
then share that with you guys so that
 

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.590
then share that with you guys so that
you can see all the things that you can

00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600
you can see all the things that you can
 

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.660
you can see all the things that you can
make with either no sugar or very little

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:01.670
make with either no sugar or very little
 

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.320
make with either no sugar or very little
sugar it turns out that sugar is

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.330
sugar it turns out that sugar is
 

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.750
sugar it turns out that sugar is
something that is genetically engineered

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760
something that is genetically engineered
 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.050
something that is genetically engineered
inside of us we are all born with an

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.060
inside of us we are all born with an
 

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.530
inside of us we are all born with an
affinity for sugar and if you have

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:14.540
affinity for sugar and if you have
 

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.360
affinity for sugar and if you have
something sweet in your mouth your body

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.370
something sweet in your mouth your body
 

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.520
something sweet in your mouth your body
reads it as a possible source of energy

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:18.530
reads it as a possible source of energy
 

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.560
reads it as a possible source of energy
and it reads it as probably not

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:20.570
and it reads it as probably not
 

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.190
and it reads it as probably not
something that's

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200
something that's
 

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.740
something that's
to be harmful it doesn't read that when

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:23.750
to be harmful it doesn't read that when
 

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.440
to be harmful it doesn't read that when
it gets something sour or something

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:26.450
it gets something sour or something
 

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.820
it gets something sour or something
bitter and so having something that is

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:30.830
bitter and so having something that is
 

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.370
bitter and so having something that is
sweet is something that we are all

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:32.380
sweet is something that we are all
 

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.720
sweet is something that we are all
accustomed to and that we are all

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:34.730
accustomed to and that we are all
 

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.870
accustomed to and that we are all
attracted to so when you think about

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880

you definitely need sugar for reasons

00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720
you definitely need sugar for reasons
 

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.620
you definitely need sugar for reasons
other than just and I'll be demoing that

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:02.630
other than just and I'll be demoing that
 

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.999
other than just and I'll be demoing that
as well we're going to make meringue

00:14:03.999 --> 00:14:04.009
as well we're going to make meringue
 

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.579
as well we're going to make meringue
that stabilizes the egg foams so it

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:06.589
that stabilizes the egg foams so it
 

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:08.620
that stabilizes the egg foams so it
turns out that sugar does so many other

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:08.630
turns out that sugar does so many other
 

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.259
turns out that sugar does so many other
things other than just add sweetness so

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:11.269
things other than just add sweetness so
 

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:13.420
things other than just add sweetness so
the first so I'm going to spend a little

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.430
the first so I'm going to spend a little
 

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.429
the first so I'm going to spend a little
time talking about the different roles

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:15.439
time talking about the different roles
 

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:18.100
time talking about the different roles
that sugar plays in various desserts and

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:18.110
that sugar plays in various desserts and
 

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.230
that sugar plays in various desserts and
then I'm going to go into the stages of

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240
then I'm going to go into the stages of
 

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.110
then I'm going to go into the stages of
sugar we're going to take some sugar

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120
sugar we're going to take some sugar
 

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.850
sugar we're going to take some sugar
syrups which are all up here and we're

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:24.860
syrups which are all up here and we're
 

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.470
syrups which are all up here and we're
going to take them to different stages

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480
going to take them to different stages
 

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.139
going to take them to different stages
and you'll get to see how they react to

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:29.149
and you'll get to see how they react to
 

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:32.199
and you'll get to see how they react to
make different pastries so so now I'm

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:32.209
make different pastries so so now I'm
 

00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:33.100
make different pastries so so now I'm
just going to go through kind of a

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.110
just going to go through kind of a
 

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.410
just going to go through kind of a
laundry list of what other things sugar

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:35.420
laundry list of what other things sugar
 

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.360
laundry list of what other things sugar
does to a dessert that makes it a

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.370
does to a dessert that makes it a
 

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.199
does to a dessert that makes it a
dessert so the first thing is creaming

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:40.209
dessert so the first thing is creaming
 

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:44.710
dessert so the first thing is creaming
sugar into butter so any cake recipe any

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720

creaming butter and sugar together you

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100
creaming butter and sugar together you
 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.580
creaming butter and sugar together you
take granulated sugar you mix it into

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:52.590
take granulated sugar you mix it into
 

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.800
take granulated sugar you mix it into
butter and you cream it what's called

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:54.810
butter and you cream it what's called
 

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.290
butter and you cream it what's called
creaming in a mixer and you mix it and

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300
creaming in a mixer and you mix it and
 

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.850
creaming in a mixer and you mix it and
mix it mix it until it becomes light and

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860
mix it mix it until it becomes light and
 

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.980

fluffy in color and basically what's
 

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.810
fluffy in color and basically what's
happening is if I mean you guys all know

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820
happening is if I mean you guys all know
 

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.070
happening is if I mean you guys all know
the texture of sugar it's very

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.080
the texture of sugar it's very
 

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.560
the texture of sugar it's very
granulated if you look at those granules

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:06.570
granulated if you look at those granules
 

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.480
granulated if you look at those granules
of sugar and under a microscope if

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.490
of sugar and under a microscope if
 

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.550
of sugar and under a microscope if
they're little itty bitty crystals and

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560
they're little itty bitty crystals and
 

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.920
they're little itty bitty crystals and
the little sugar crystals have very hard

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:12.930
the little sugar crystals have very hard
 

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.020
the little sugar crystals have very hard
jagged edges and when they are mixed

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.030
jagged edges and when they are mixed
 

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.080
jagged edges and when they are mixed
with the butter or margarine or any sort

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.090
with the butter or margarine or any sort
 

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.510
with the butter or margarine or any sort
of solid fat what the sugar crystals are

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:20.520
of solid fat what the sugar crystals are
 

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.540
of solid fat what the sugar crystals are
doing is they are acting as they're

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:23.550
doing is they are acting as they're
 

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.090
doing is they are acting as they're
digging little air pockets into the fat

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100
digging little air pockets into the fat
 

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.330
digging little air pockets into the fat
and so it's sort of like when you're a

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:29.340
and so it's sort of like when you're a
 

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.250
and so it's sort of like when you're a
gardener and you take a hoe and you're

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260
gardener and you take a hoe and you're
 

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
gardener and you take a hoe and you're
hoeing the the firm earth and you're

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:33.270
hoeing the the firm earth and you're
 

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.000
hoeing the the firm earth and you're
aerating it that's exactly what happens

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.010
aerating it that's exactly what happens
 

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.130
aerating it that's exactly what happens
when you're creaming sugar and butter

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:37.140
when you're creaming sugar and butter
 

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.440
when you're creaming sugar and butter
together all of those air pockets then

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:39.450
together all of those air pockets then
 

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.630
together all of those air pockets then
go on when you're making your cake or

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:41.640
go on when you're making your cake or
 

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.610
go on when you're making your cake or
your cookie to make your final product

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620
your cookie to make your final product
 

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.700
your cookie to make your final product
light and fluffy and tender and not hard

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:46.710
light and fluffy and tender and not hard
 

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.590
light and fluffy and tender and not hard
and dense so when you think about

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600
and dense so when you think about
 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.510
and dense so when you think about
cookies and you think about cakes you

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:50.520
cookies and you think about cakes you
 

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.010
cookies and you think about cakes you
need the sugar to make them taste sweet

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.020
need the sugar to make them taste sweet
 

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.170
need the sugar to make them taste sweet
but then you also need them in order for

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180
but then you also need them in order for
 

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.700
but then you also need them in order for
them to be light and fluffy because of

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:55.710
them to be light and fluffy because of
 

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.720
them to be light and fluffy because of
the creaming properties so this is this

00:15:59.720 --> 00:15:59.730
the creaming properties so this is this
 

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.850
the creaming properties so this is this
is from last year's lecture we have a

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860
is from last year's lecture we have a
 

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.730
is from last year's lecture we have a
picture of a cake in which it's creamed

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740
picture of a cake in which it's creamed
 

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.800
picture of a cake in which it's creamed
with a full amount of sugar and then we

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:06.810
with a full amount of sugar and then we
 

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.050
with a full amount of sugar and then we
used half amount of sugar and from the

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060
used half amount of sugar and from the
 

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.430
used half amount of sugar and from the
pictures it doesn't look hugely

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440
pictures it doesn't look hugely
 

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.080
pictures it doesn't look hugely
different but if you were to imagine a

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.090
different but if you were to imagine a
 

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.540
different but if you were to imagine a
six inch cake there's actually about an

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:14.550
six inch cake there's actually about an
 

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.550
six inch cake there's actually about an
inch to 1/2 an inch all the way through

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560
inch to 1/2 an inch all the way through
 

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.500
inch to 1/2 an inch all the way through
the cake we noticed when we used half

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.510
the cake we noticed when we used half
 

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.790
the cake we noticed when we used half
the amount of sugar and it's because

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800
the amount of sugar and it's because
 

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.800
the amount of sugar and it's because
there was half the amount of sugar

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:21.810
there was half the amount of sugar
 

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.110
there was half the amount of sugar
crystals to create those air pockets and

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120
crystals to create those air pockets and
 

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.210
crystals to create those air pockets and
so then the final product wasn't able to

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220
so then the final product wasn't able to
 

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.830
so then the final product wasn't able to
rise quite as much so the cake was a

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:27.840
rise quite as much so the cake was a
 

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.930
rise quite as much so the cake was a
little bit denser and it didn't rise

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940
little bit denser and it didn't rise
 

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.360
little bit denser and it didn't rise
quite as much

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.370
quite as much
 

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.130
quite as much
another thing that sugar does is that

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:34.140
another thing that sugar does is that
 

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.530
another thing that sugar does is that
it's hydroscopic and what this means is

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540
it's hydroscopic and what this means is
 

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.020
it's hydroscopic and what this means is
that it attracts water molecules that

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.030
that it attracts water molecules that
 

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.000
that it attracts water molecules that
are in the air and it brings it to

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.010
are in the air and it brings it to
 

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.690
are in the air and it brings it to
itself so this is one of the reasons why

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:44.700
itself so this is one of the reasons why
 

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.600
itself so this is one of the reasons why
you can take cookies and cakes and such

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:47.610
you can take cookies and cakes and such
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.310
you can take cookies and cakes and such
and you can package them and they can

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320
and you can package them and they can
 

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.570
and you can package them and they can
sit on the shelf and they won't get

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:50.580
sit on the shelf and they won't get
 

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.200
sit on the shelf and they won't get
stale

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.210
stale
 

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.120
stale
because what the sugar does is it keeps

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.130
because what the sugar does is it keeps
 

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.830
because what the sugar does is it keeps
the moisture that's already in the

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:54.840
the moisture that's already in the
 

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.230
the moisture that's already in the
cookie inside the cookie and it helps it

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240
cookie inside the cookie and it helps it
 

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.790
cookie inside the cookie and it helps it
last longer so you can put it on the

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800
last longer so you can put it on the
 

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.749
last longer so you can put it on the
supermarket

00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759
supermarket
 

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.329
supermarket
and sell it for weeks at a time

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:01.339
and sell it for weeks at a time
 

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:03.799
and sell it for weeks at a time
originally when we were talking about

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:03.809
originally when we were talking about
 

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:06.679
originally when we were talking about
what is a desert in which the only thing

that sugar does is adds sweetness this

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:08.549
that sugar does is adds sweetness this
 

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:10.309
that sugar does is adds sweetness this
was the first slide that I had because I

00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319
was the first slide that I had because I
 

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.110
was the first slide that I had because I
thought well if he takes some fruit

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120
thought well if he takes some fruit
 

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.879
thought well if he takes some fruit
and he mix a little bit of sugar into it

00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:13.889
and he mix a little bit of sugar into it
 

00:17:13.889 --> 00:17:15.409
and he mix a little bit of sugar into it
and you sweeten it then that's a desert

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419
and you sweeten it then that's a desert
 

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:17.210
and you sweeten it then that's a desert
and the only thing the sugar is doing is

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220
and the only thing the sugar is doing is
 

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.699
and the only thing the sugar is doing is
adding sweetness right well it turns out

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:19.709
adding sweetness right well it turns out
 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:21.319
adding sweetness right well it turns out
not if you look at the picture closely

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.329
not if you look at the picture closely
 

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.689
not if you look at the picture closely
you can see in the the pot of

00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699
you can see in the the pot of
 

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:24.860
you can see in the the pot of
strawberries you can see a little bit of

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:24.870
strawberries you can see a little bit of
 

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.529
strawberries you can see a little bit of
that sauce that sauce is because sugar

00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:27.539
that sauce that sauce is because sugar
 

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:29.990
that sauce that sauce is because sugar
is hydroscopic when it mixes with the

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000
is hydroscopic when it mixes with the
 

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.759
is hydroscopic when it mixes with the
strawberries it's drawing out all the

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:31.769
strawberries it's drawing out all the
 

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:33.560
strawberries it's drawing out all the
moisture in the strawberries and it's

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:33.570
moisture in the strawberries and it's
 

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.629
moisture in the strawberries and it's
creating a sauce and so that's the other

00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:35.639
creating a sauce and so that's the other
 

00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.460
creating a sauce and so that's the other
way in which sugar helps make this

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:37.470
way in which sugar helps make this
 

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.529
way in which sugar helps make this
dessert so delicious it makes it sweet

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539
dessert so delicious it makes it sweet
 

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:41.389
dessert so delicious it makes it sweet
and then it also combines with the

00:17:41.389 --> 00:17:41.399
and then it also combines with the
 

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:42.529
and then it also combines with the
liquid and the strawberries to make a

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539
liquid and the strawberries to make a
 

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:44.870
liquid and the strawberries to make a
sauce okay so the people who said

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880
sauce okay so the people who said
 

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.710
sauce okay so the people who said
popsicle sorbet and milkshakes this is a

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720
popsicle sorbet and milkshakes this is a
 

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.500
popsicle sorbet and milkshakes this is a
really interesting part about sugar that

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:51.510
really interesting part about sugar that
 

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.860
really interesting part about sugar that
I didn't know from a from a science

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:54.870
I didn't know from a from a science

I just knew from an operational level

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.610
I just knew from an operational level
 

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.389
I just knew from an operational level
that when I used to make sorbets and ice

00:17:59.389 --> 00:17:59.399
that when I used to make sorbets and ice
 

00:17:59.399 --> 00:18:01.580
that when I used to make sorbets and ice
creams if I had something that didn't

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.590
creams if I had something that didn't
 

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.710
creams if I had something that didn't
have a lot of sugar it was really really

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720
have a lot of sugar it was really really
 

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.570
have a lot of sugar it was really really
icy and if I had something in which I

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580
icy and if I had something in which I
 

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.190
icy and if I had something in which I
had mismeasured and I put too much sugar

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200
had mismeasured and I put too much sugar
 

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.720
had mismeasured and I put too much sugar
it was really soupy and I could never

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:08.730
it was really soupy and I could never
 

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.610
it was really soupy and I could never
really figure out why I just made sure

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620
really figure out why I just made sure
 

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.470
really figure out why I just made sure
that I followed the recipe so that

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480
that I followed the recipe so that
 

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.049
that I followed the recipe so that
wouldn't happen but in studying more

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059
wouldn't happen but in studying more
 

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.759
wouldn't happen but in studying more
about the role of sugar and what it does

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:16.769
about the role of sugar and what it does
 

00:18:16.769 --> 00:18:20.509
about the role of sugar and what it does
to desserts sugar actually depresses the

00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:20.519
to desserts sugar actually depresses the
 

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:22.850
to desserts sugar actually depresses the
freezing point of a liquid so if we take

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860
freezing point of a liquid so if we take
 

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.940
freezing point of a liquid so if we take
ice and we put it in the freezer you get

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:25.950
ice and we put it in the freezer you get
 

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.379
ice and we put it in the freezer you get
an ice cube right it's going to freeze

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:27.389
an ice cube right it's going to freeze
 

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:29.779
an ice cube right it's going to freeze
it zero degrees Celsius 32 degrees

00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:29.789
it zero degrees Celsius 32 degrees
 

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:32.269
it zero degrees Celsius 32 degrees
Fahrenheit if you add some sugar to that

00:18:32.269 --> 00:18:32.279
Fahrenheit if you add some sugar to that
 

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.519
Fahrenheit if you add some sugar to that
what it does is that it means that that

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:34.529
what it does is that it means that that
 

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:37.759
what it does is that it means that that
sugar water won't freeze right at zero

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:37.769
sugar water won't freeze right at zero
 

00:18:37.769 --> 00:18:39.230
sugar water won't freeze right at zero
degrees Celsius but it might be a little

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240
degrees Celsius but it might be a little
 

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.240
degrees Celsius but it might be a little
bit lower and so if you have a freezer

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.250
bit lower and so if you have a freezer
 

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.039
bit lower and so if you have a freezer
that's at zero degrees Celsius then that

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:43.049
that's at zero degrees Celsius then that
 

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:45.139
that's at zero degrees Celsius then that
sugar water that you have won't freeze

00:18:45.139 --> 00:18:45.149
sugar water that you have won't freeze
 

00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:47.000
sugar water that you have won't freeze
solid so we use this to our advantage

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.010
solid so we use this to our advantage
 

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.370
solid so we use this to our advantage
when we're making frozen desserts so

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380
when we're making frozen desserts so
 

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.080
when we're making frozen desserts so
when you make a popsicle or sorbet or

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.090
when you make a popsicle or sorbet or
 

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.149
when you make a popsicle or sorbet or
milkshake you need the sugar to make it

00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159
milkshake you need the sugar to make it
 

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:54.980
milkshake you need the sugar to make it
taste good and to make it sweet but you

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:54.990
taste good and to make it sweet but you
 

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.639
taste good and to make it sweet but you
also need the sugar to make it actually

00:18:57.639 --> 00:18:57.649
also need the sugar to make it actually
 

00:18:57.649 --> 00:18:59.899
also need the sugar to make it actually
scoopable so that you can eat it so it's

00:18:59.899 --> 00:18:59.909
scoopable so that you can eat it so it's
 

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:02.690
scoopable so that you can eat it so it's
not like sucking on a on an ice cube so

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700
not like sucking on a on an ice cube so
 

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.629

this is Version three one cup of sugar

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940
this is Version three one cup of sugar
 

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.730
this is Version three one cup of sugar
this is the the actual recipe you can

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740
this is the the actual recipe you can
 

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.480
this is the the actual recipe you can
see you can actually scoop into it this

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:35.490
see you can actually scoop into it this
 

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.790
see you can actually scoop into it this
is version four one and a half cups of

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:37.800
is version four one and a half cups of
 

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.770
is version four one and a half cups of
sugar and you can see that you can scoop

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780
sugar and you can see that you can scoop
 

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.970
sugar and you can see that you can scoop
into it and you can see that it's

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980
into it and you can see that it's
 

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.680
into it and you can see that it's
actually kind of melted because it's not

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:42.690
actually kind of melted because it's not
 

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.340
actually kind of melted because it's not
quite frozen and then finally this is

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:46.350
quite frozen and then finally this is
 

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.720
quite frozen and then finally this is
two cups of sugar this is twice the

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:47.730
two cups of sugar this is twice the
 

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.040
two cups of sugar this is twice the
amount of sugar that you should have in

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.050
amount of sugar that you should have in
 

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.049
amount of sugar that you should have in
this recipe and it's practically soup

00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059
this recipe and it's practically soup
 

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.630
this recipe and it's practically soup
you can see it's like really syrupy and

you can see it's like really syrupy and
 

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.940
you can see it's like really syrupy and
she doesn't even have to be so stiff

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:55.950
she doesn't even have to be so stiff
 

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:01.520
she doesn't even have to be so stiff
anymore so that's what sugar does to

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:01.530
anymore so that's what sugar does to
 

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.410
anymore so that's what sugar does to

okay so the first thing we're going to
 

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:32.789
okay so the first thing we're going to
do is just beat up the egg whites

00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799
do is just beat up the egg whites
 

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:34.500
do is just beat up the egg whites
without any sugar at all so like I was

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.510
without any sugar at all so like I was
 

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.880
without any sugar at all so like I was
saying you have the protein strands of

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:38.890
saying you have the protein strands of
 

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.260
saying you have the protein strands of
the egg whites are starting to get

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:40.270
the egg whites are starting to get
 

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.970
the egg whites are starting to get
filled with air and you're going to see

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:41.980
filled with air and you're going to see
 

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.919
filled with air and you're going to see
like this is egg whites before they're

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:43.929
like this is egg whites before they're
 

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:48.380
like this is egg whites before they're
beaten they're yellow they're viscous I

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:48.390
 

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.580
think you can start to see into the bowl

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:50.590
think you can start to see into the bowl
 

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.720
think you can start to see into the bowl
you can see how it's starting to get

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:51.730
you can see how it's starting to get
 

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.640
you can see how it's starting to get
white and airy that's because all of the

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:53.650
white and airy that's because all of the
 

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.039
white and airy that's because all of the
air is starting to get captured within

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:56.049
air is starting to get captured within
 

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:59.700
air is starting to get captured within
the foams now the protein of the egg

00:20:59.700 --> 00:20:59.710
the foams now the protein of the egg
 

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.529
the foams now the protein of the egg
whites which is now capturing all the

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:01.539
whites which is now capturing all the
 

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:04.409
whites which is now capturing all the
air those protein strands aren't that

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:04.419
air those protein strands aren't that
 

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:06.029
air those protein strands aren't that
stable so I'm going to whip this and

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039
stable so I'm going to whip this and
 

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.169
stable so I'm going to whip this and
whip this and with this and I'm going to

00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:07.179
whip this and with this and I'm going to
 

00:21:07.179 --> 00:21:08.610
whip this and with this and I'm going to
put this out in the bowl but you're

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:08.620
put this out in the bowl but you're
 

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.779
put this out in the bowl but you're
going to see it's going to be very

00:21:09.779 --> 00:21:09.789
going to see it's going to be very
 

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:11.850
going to see it's going to be very
unstable it's going to look a little bit

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:11.860
unstable it's going to look a little bit
 

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.950
unstable it's going to look a little bit
like styrofoam and it's not going to be

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960
like styrofoam and it's not going to be
 

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.149
like styrofoam and it's not going to be
anything that you're going to be able to

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159
anything that you're going to be able to
 

00:21:15.159 --> 00:21:16.470
anything that you're going to be able to
really bake with because it's going to

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480
really bake with because it's going to
 

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.020
really bake with because it's going to
start to deflate we're going to do

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.030
start to deflate we're going to do
 

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.640
start to deflate we're going to do
another batch with egg whites and sugar

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
another batch with egg whites and sugar
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.799
another batch with egg whites and sugar
so sugar when I start to add that to the

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:25.809
so sugar when I start to add that to the
 

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:28.770
so sugar when I start to add that to the
egg whites the sugar actually combines

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:28.780
egg whites the sugar actually combines
 

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.500
egg whites the sugar actually combines
with the water that's in egg whites so

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:31.510
with the water that's in egg whites so
 

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.060
with the water that's in egg whites so
egg whites are protein strands and water

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.070
egg whites are protein strands and water
 

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.970
egg whites are protein strands and water
we're going to whip up the sugar into

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:35.980
we're going to whip up the sugar into
 

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.250
we're going to whip up the sugar into
the egg whites and in that batch the

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:38.260
the egg whites and in that batch the
 

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.470
the egg whites and in that batch the
sugar will combine with the water and

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480
sugar will combine with the water and
 

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.020
sugar will combine with the water and
it's going to create a syrup within this

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.030
it's going to create a syrup within this
 

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.510
it's going to create a syrup within this
foam and what the syrup is going to do

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520
foam and what the syrup is going to do
 

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.520
foam and what the syrup is going to do
is it's actually going to protect all of

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.530
is it's actually going to protect all of
 

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.100
is it's actually going to protect all of
the little protein bubbles that the egg

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.110
the little protein bubbles that the egg
 

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.480
the little protein bubbles that the egg
whites are forming when it goes into

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:51.490
whites are forming when it goes into
 

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.880
whites are forming when it goes into
foam and so it's sort of like packing

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:53.890
foam and so it's sort of like packing
 

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.380
foam and so it's sort of like packing
peanuts you know when you have something

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.390
peanuts you know when you have something
 

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.730
peanuts you know when you have something
fragile you buy all those little

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:56.740
fragile you buy all those little
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.890
fragile you buy all those little
styrofoam peanuts and you pack your

00:21:58.890 --> 00:21:58.900
styrofoam peanuts and you pack your
 

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.240
styrofoam peanuts and you pack your
fragile items and you put lots of

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.250
fragile items and you put lots of
 

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.470
fragile items and you put lots of
peanuts around it to make sure it

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480
peanuts around it to make sure it
 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.210
peanuts around it to make sure it
doesn't break that's exactly what will

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:03.220
doesn't break that's exactly what will
 

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.630
doesn't break that's exactly what will
happen with the sugar so you can see

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640
happen with the sugar so you can see
 

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.230
happen with the sugar so you can see
that now the egg white foam is all nice

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240
that now the egg white foam is all nice
 

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.480
that now the egg white foam is all nice
and white and it's getting foamy and I

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:12.490
and white and it's getting foamy and I
 

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.620
and white and it's getting foamy and I
don't know if you can see but now it's

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:13.630
don't know if you can see but now it's
 

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.690
don't know if you can see but now it's
starting to get over whipped because

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:15.700
starting to get over whipped because
 

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.240
starting to get over whipped because
it's all of those proteins are being

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.250
it's all of those proteins are being
 

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.159
it's all of those proteins are being
stressed and stretched and stretched and

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:20.169
stressed and stretched and stretched and
 

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:21.930
stressed and stretched and stretched and
they're taking all the air they can can

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:21.940
they're taking all the air they can can
 

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.270
they're taking all the air they can can
they can and then they're just like okay

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.280
they can and then they're just like okay
 

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.440
they can and then they're just like okay
that's enough and then they start to

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:25.450
that's enough and then they start to
 

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:33.530
that's enough and then they start to
break down

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:33.540
 

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:43.830
so this one so this one can you tell how

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840
so this one so this one can you tell how
 

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.910
so this one so this one can you tell how
I don't know if you can really see but

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:44.920
I don't know if you can really see but
 

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.640
I don't know if you can really see but
it's do you see how deflated it looks

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:47.650
it's do you see how deflated it looks
 

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.710
it's do you see how deflated it looks
and it's like it's just a matter of time

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720
and it's like it's just a matter of time
 

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.560
and it's like it's just a matter of time
before all of this kind of deflates and

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:52.570
before all of this kind of deflates and
 

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.440
before all of this kind of deflates and
it doesn't look very I don't know I mean

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.450
it doesn't look very I don't know I mean
 

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:56.790
it doesn't look very I don't know I mean
to me this doesn't look very stable but

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:56.800
to me this doesn't look very stable but
 

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.900
to me this doesn't look very stable but
I don't know if you're not a baker if

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:57.910
I don't know if you're not a baker if
 

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.480
I don't know if you're not a baker if
you can tell that this isn't very stable

00:22:59.480 --> 00:22:59.490
you can tell that this isn't very stable
 

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.860
you can tell that this isn't very stable
so is there nan Baker out there they can

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:01.870
so is there nan Baker out there they can
 

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.030
so is there nan Baker out there they can
look at this up

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.040
look at this up
 

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.610
look at this up
does this look stable to you you don't

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:05.620
does this look stable to you you don't
 

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.830
does this look stable to you you don't
know okay you're gonna have to take my

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840
know okay you're gonna have to take my
 

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.600
know okay you're gonna have to take my
word for it this is not stable look at

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:09.610
word for it this is not stable look at
 

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:15.300
word for it this is not stable look at
it it's like see it just looks like it's

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.310
it it's like see it just looks like it's
 

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:16.770
it it's like see it just looks like it's
not going to last and then we're gonna

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:16.780
not going to last and then we're gonna
 

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.060
not going to last and then we're gonna
put it over here and you're gonna watch

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.070
put it over here and you're gonna watch
 

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.910
put it over here and you're gonna watch
it all night long and you'll see okay so

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:20.920
it all night long and you'll see okay so
 

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.190
it all night long and you'll see okay so
then we're gonna do the exact same thing

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200
 

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.460
with the same amount of egg whites to

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.470
with the same amount of egg whites to
 

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:37.460
with the same amount of egg whites to
begin with but this time we're gonna add

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:37.470
begin with but this time we're gonna add
 

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.570
begin with but this time we're gonna add
so the key is you have to start it

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:39.580
so the key is you have to start it
 

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.310
so the key is you have to start it
really slow

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320
 

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.530
so the same process is going to happen

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:46.540
so the same process is going to happen
 

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:52.230
so the same process is going to happen
it's going to start to get foamy

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240
 

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.020
so while this is while I'm waiting to

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.030
so while this is while I'm waiting to
 

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.420
so while this is while I'm waiting to
add this these are the things that you

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.430
add this these are the things that you
 

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.920
add this these are the things that you
can make some of the things that you can

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:58.930
can make some of the things that you can
 

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.810
can make some of the things that you can
make with stabilized egg foams you can

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:00.820
make with stabilized egg foams you can
 

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.030
make with stabilized egg foams you can
make lemon meringue pie you can make

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:03.040
make lemon meringue pie you can make
 

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.150
make lemon meringue pie you can make
angel food cake you can make buttercream

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.160
angel food cake you can make buttercream
 

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.640
angel food cake you can make buttercream
on the slowly of the sugar so lemon

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:08.650
on the slowly of the sugar so lemon
 

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.500
on the slowly of the sugar so lemon
meringue pie you take this meringue that

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:10.510
meringue pie you take this meringue that
 

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:12.630
meringue pie you take this meringue that
I'm making and you plop it on a pie and

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640
I'm making and you plop it on a pie and
 

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.950
I'm making and you plop it on a pie and
that's meringue for lemon meringue pie

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960
that's meringue for lemon meringue pie
 

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.390
that's meringue for lemon meringue pie
angel food cake you take this exact

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400
angel food cake you take this exact
 

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.040
angel food cake you take this exact
meringue that I'm making you're going to

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.050
meringue that I'm making you're going to
 

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.020
meringue that I'm making you're going to
see how easy baking is you're going to

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.030
see how easy baking is you're going to
 

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.090
see how easy baking is you're going to
fold in some cake flour and bake it and

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.100
fold in some cake flour and bake it and
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.010
fold in some cake flour and bake it and
that's angel food cake and then

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.020
that's angel food cake and then
 

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.780
that's angel food cake and then
buttercream again you're going to take

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:27.790
buttercream again you're going to take
 

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.250
buttercream again you're going to take
this exact meringue that I'm making and

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:29.260
this exact meringue that I'm making and
 

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.720
this exact meringue that I'm making and
you're going to throw butter into it and

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:30.730
you're going to throw butter into it and
 

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.520
you're going to throw butter into it and
then that's going to be buttercream so

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:32.530
then that's going to be buttercream so
 

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.630
then that's going to be buttercream so
those are some things that you can make

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640
those are some things that you can make
 

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.660
those are some things that you can make
with sugar and egg foams so I'm gonna

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:39.670
with sugar and egg foams so I'm gonna
 

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.820
with sugar and egg foams so I'm gonna
let this go for a little bit and then

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:41.830
let this go for a little bit and then
 

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.110
let this go for a little bit and then
I'm going to show you the difference

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120
I'm going to show you the difference
 

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.320
I'm going to show you the difference
between this one and that one so while

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:46.330
between this one and that one so while
 

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.730
between this one and that one so while
that's going I'm going to give you

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:47.740
that's going I'm going to give you
 

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.300
that's going I'm going to give you
another thing that sugar does sugar

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:50.310
another thing that sugar does sugar
 

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.680
another thing that sugar does sugar
tenderizes and inhibits gluten

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:52.690
tenderizes and inhibits gluten
 

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.300
tenderizes and inhibits gluten
development and I'm not going to go into

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:54.310
development and I'm not going to go into
 

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.560
development and I'm not going to go into
a big long thing about gluten but

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.570
a big long thing about gluten but
 

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.480
a big long thing about gluten but
basically gluten is a big buzzword

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.490
basically gluten is a big buzzword
 

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:58.860
basically gluten is a big buzzword
everybody knows about gluten it means

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:58.870
everybody knows about gluten it means
 

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.290
everybody knows about gluten it means
you want to avoid wheat gluten are two

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:01.300
you want to avoid wheat gluten are two
 

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.360
you want to avoid wheat gluten are two
protein molecules that exist in wheat

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:03.370
protein molecules that exist in wheat
 

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.390
protein molecules that exist in wheat
flour and they exist separately until

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400
flour and they exist separately until
 

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.310
flour and they exist separately until
you add liquid to wheat flour as soon as

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320
you add liquid to wheat flour as soon as
 

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.440
you add liquid to wheat flour as soon as
you add liquid to it the two protein

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.450
you add liquid to it the two protein
 

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.630
you add liquid to it the two protein
molecules bond together and then they do

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640
molecules bond together and then they do
 

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.120
molecules bond together and then they do
exactly what the egg whites do is they

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.130
exactly what the egg whites do is they
 

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.260
exactly what the egg whites do is they
bond together and they form these

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:16.270
bond together and they form these
 

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.890
bond together and they form these
stretchy things that hold air so this is

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:19.900
stretchy things that hold air so this is
 

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.580
stretchy things that hold air so this is
great

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:20.590
great
 

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.070
great
when you have bread if you take bread

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080
when you have bread if you take bread
 

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.780
when you have bread if you take bread
which is flour water and a couple other

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:24.790
which is flour water and a couple other
 

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.270
which is flour water and a couple other
things and you mix it up you develop all

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:27.280
things and you mix it up you develop all
 

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.740
things and you mix it up you develop all
this gluten and you create a bread

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:28.750
this gluten and you create a bread
 

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.660
this gluten and you create a bread
that's really chewy it has a lot of

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:30.670
that's really chewy it has a lot of
 

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.090
that's really chewy it has a lot of
great heft and tastes really great and

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:33.100
great heft and tastes really great and
 

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.420
great heft and tastes really great and
that's great for bread but when you're

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.430
that's great for bread but when you're
 

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.970
that's great for bread but when you're
making a cake that's the last thing in

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:38.980
making a cake that's the last thing in
 

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.350
making a cake that's the last thing in
the world you want is a cake that's

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360
the world you want is a cake that's
 

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.780
the world you want is a cake that's
chewy and and not tender you want

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:42.790
chewy and and not tender you want
 

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.670
chewy and and not tender you want
something that's light and fluffy what

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:44.680
something that's light and fluffy what
 

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.710
something that's light and fluffy what
sugar does similar to what it does with

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720
sugar does similar to what it does with
 

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.820
sugar does similar to what it does with
these egg foams

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:48.830
these egg foams
 

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.270
these egg foams
is that the sugar ends up protecting

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.280
is that the sugar ends up protecting
 

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.570
is that the sugar ends up protecting
those two protein gluten molecules from

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580
those two protein gluten molecules from
 

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.850
those two protein gluten molecules from
from bonding and so when you're making a

00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860
from bonding and so when you're making a
 

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.350
from bonding and so when you're making a
cake batter if you have a lot of sugar

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360
cake batter if you have a lot of sugar
 

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.150
cake batter if you have a lot of sugar
in it then the sugar is protecting those

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:02.160
in it then the sugar is protecting those
 

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.040
in it then the sugar is protecting those
from bonding and then you have a cake

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.050
from bonding and then you have a cake
 

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.690
from bonding and then you have a cake
that's tender and it doesn't have the

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700
that's tender and it doesn't have the
 

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.120
that's tender and it doesn't have the
ability to hold all of these big pockets

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.130
ability to hold all of these big pockets
 

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.580
ability to hold all of these big pockets
of air which it will give you a chewy

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:10.590
of air which it will give you a chewy
 

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.010
of air which it will give you a chewy
cake let me show you this meringue so

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020
cake let me show you this meringue so
 

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:18.710
cake let me show you this meringue so
this is very different so this was the

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720
this is very different so this was the
 

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.090
this is very different so this was the
same one cup of I'm going to ask my

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100
same one cup of I'm going to ask my
 

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.850
same one cup of I'm going to ask my
friend here does this look different so

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:28.860
friend here does this look different so
 

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.980
friend here does this look different so
do you see how silky that is where's the

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:30.990
do you see how silky that is where's the
 

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.870
do you see how silky that is where's the
camera it's like really silky and much

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880
camera it's like really silky and much
 

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.850
camera it's like really silky and much
more stable and this is what you would

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860
more stable and this is what you would
 

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:45.440
more stable and this is what you would
use to make a dessert with and that's

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:45.450
use to make a dessert with and that's
 

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:56.700
use to make a dessert with and that's
just the addition of sugar okay

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:56.710
 

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.109
okay I'm going to start getting these

00:26:58.109 --> 00:26:58.119
okay I'm going to start getting these
 

00:26:58.119 --> 00:27:04.859
okay I'm going to start getting these
things going that's that one and then

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:04.869
things going that's that one and then
 

00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:09.299
things going that's that one and then
there's that one okay so a couple more

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:09.309
there's that one okay so a couple more
 

00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:11.940
there's that one okay so a couple more
things and then we're going to start

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:11.950
things and then we're going to start
 

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.739
things and then we're going to start
talking about the stages of sugar so

00:27:13.739 --> 00:27:13.749
talking about the stages of sugar so
 

00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:16.259
talking about the stages of sugar so
sugar aids in browning so what this

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:16.269
sugar aids in browning so what this
 

00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:19.470
sugar aids in browning so what this
means is at 310 degrees there are

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480
means is at 310 degrees there are
 

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.169
means is at 310 degrees there are
protein molecules and sugars that

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:22.179
protein molecules and sugars that
 

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:24.690
protein molecules and sugars that
rearrange themselves in a cake batter or

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:24.700
rearrange themselves in a cake batter or
 

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.399
rearrange themselves in a cake batter or
a cookie or whatever into these little

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:26.409
a cookie or whatever into these little
 

00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:27.869
a cookie or whatever into these little
ring lecture this is one of the things I

00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:27.879
ring lecture this is one of the things I
 

00:27:27.879 --> 00:27:29.999
ring lecture this is one of the things I
learned take getting ready for the class

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:30.009
learned take getting ready for the class
 

00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:32.430
learned take getting ready for the class
it it they rearranged themselves into

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440
it it they rearranged themselves into
 

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.169
it it they rearranged themselves into
these little ring like structures that

00:27:34.169 --> 00:27:34.179
these little ring like structures that
 

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:36.659
these little ring like structures that
then reflect light differently to make

00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:36.669
then reflect light differently to make
 

00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:39.029
then reflect light differently to make
something look browner so this is a

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039
something look browner so this is a
 

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:40.799
something look browner so this is a
picture of the sour cream coffee cake at

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:40.809
picture of the sour cream coffee cake at
 

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:44.489
picture of the sour cream coffee cake at
the bakery so it turns out for the new

00:27:44.489 --> 00:27:44.499
the bakery so it turns out for the new
 

00:27:44.499 --> 00:27:46.499
the bakery so it turns out for the new
low sugar baking book I made a sour

00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:46.509
low sugar baking book I made a sour
 

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:48.330
low sugar baking book I made a sour
cream coffee cake this is the exact

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:48.340
cream coffee cake this is the exact
 

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.639
cream coffee cake this is the exact
recipe that we make at the bakery except

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:50.649
recipe that we make at the bakery except
 

00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:52.859
recipe that we make at the bakery except
it has instead of a full cup of sugar it

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:52.869
it has instead of a full cup of sugar it
 

00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:54.899
it has instead of a full cup of sugar it
has six tablespoons of sugar and you can

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:54.909
has six tablespoons of sugar and you can
 

00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:56.249
has six tablespoons of sugar and you can
see the difference in color I mean

00:27:56.249 --> 00:27:56.259
see the difference in color I mean
 

00:27:56.259 --> 00:27:56.999
see the difference in color I mean
there's obviously going to be a

00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:57.009
there's obviously going to be a
 

00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:58.619
there's obviously going to be a
difference in taste but it was such a

00:27:58.619 --> 00:27:58.629
difference in taste but it was such a
 

00:27:58.629 --> 00:28:00.509
difference in taste but it was such a
drastic difference in color that when we

00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519
drastic difference in color that when we
 

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:02.609
drastic difference in color that when we
took this picture for the photo shoot

00:28:02.609 --> 00:28:02.619
took this picture for the photo shoot
 

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:05.159
took this picture for the photo shoot
for the book and the photographer kept

00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:05.169
for the book and the photographer kept
 

00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:07.859
for the book and the photographer kept
trying to get me to put it in the oven

00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:07.869
trying to get me to put it in the oven
 

00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:09.239
trying to get me to put it in the oven
and brown it longer or he tried to

00:28:09.239 --> 00:28:09.249
and brown it longer or he tried to
 

00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:11.340
and brown it longer or he tried to
photoshop it to make it browner and we

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.350
photoshop it to make it browner and we
 

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.499
photoshop it to make it browner and we
knew that this wasn't a super attractive

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:13.509
knew that this wasn't a super attractive
 

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:15.450
knew that this wasn't a super attractive
picture because the one on the left is

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:15.460
picture because the one on the left is
 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.769
picture because the one on the left is
what you're typically used to seeing

00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:16.779
what you're typically used to seeing
 

00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:18.720
what you're typically used to seeing
when you think about a beautiful cake

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:18.730
when you think about a beautiful cake
 

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.850
when you think about a beautiful cake
but the thing is is that when you don't

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:20.860
but the thing is is that when you don't
 

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.440
but the thing is is that when you don't
have a lot of sugar you're never going

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.450
have a lot of sugar you're never going
 

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.119
have a lot of sugar you're never going
to get that browning and so we wanted it

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:24.129
to get that browning and so we wanted it
 

00:28:24.129 --> 00:28:26.190
to get that browning and so we wanted it
to be realistic and so this is the

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200
to be realistic and so this is the
 

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.690
to be realistic and so this is the
picture something like this is what

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:27.700
picture something like this is what
 

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.039
picture something like this is what
you'll see in the book sugar makes

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:29.049
you'll see in the book sugar makes
 

00:28:29.049 --> 00:28:31.470
you'll see in the book sugar makes
pastries crispy and so in something like

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480
pastries crispy and so in something like
 

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.169
pastries crispy and so in something like
a cookie the sugar will liquefy it's in

00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:34.179
a cookie the sugar will liquefy it's in
 

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:35.279
a cookie the sugar will liquefy it's in
the cookie batter it goes into the oven

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:35.289
the cookie batter it goes into the oven
 

00:28:35.289 --> 00:28:37.919
the cookie batter it goes into the oven
it liquefies and then as the water

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:37.929
it liquefies and then as the water
 

00:28:37.929 --> 00:28:40.470
it liquefies and then as the water
evaporates the sugar recrystallizes and

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480
evaporates the sugar recrystallizes and
 

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.330
evaporates the sugar recrystallizes and
then you end up with the sugar with a

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:42.340
then you end up with the sugar with a
 

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.859
then you end up with the sugar with a
cookie that's really crispy so you're

00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:43.869
cookie that's really crispy so you're
 

00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:45.269
cookie that's really crispy so you're
going to get a little bit of a crispy

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279
going to get a little bit of a crispy
 

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.310
going to get a little bit of a crispy
sugar cookie and it's crispy because of

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320
sugar cookie and it's crispy because of
 

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.379
sugar cookie and it's crispy because of
the sugar again I tried to make a low

00:28:49.379 --> 00:28:49.389
the sugar again I tried to make a low
 

00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:51.869
the sugar again I tried to make a low
sugar sugar cookie for the book and it

00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:51.879
sugar sugar cookie for the book and it
 

00:28:51.879 --> 00:28:54.060
sugar sugar cookie for the book and it
was soft it wasn't that sweet but it was

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.070
was soft it wasn't that sweet but it was
 

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.350
was soft it wasn't that sweet but it was
also just soft and there was no way we

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360
also just soft and there was no way we
 

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.450
also just soft and there was no way we
could get it to crisp up we ended up

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:57.460
could get it to crisp up we ended up
 

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.249
could get it to crisp up we ended up
doing a gingersnap and what we did was

00:28:59.249 --> 00:28:59.259
doing a gingersnap and what we did was
 

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:00.869
doing a gingersnap and what we did was
rather than because it wouldn't crisp up

00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:00.879
rather than because it wouldn't crisp up
 

00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:02.489
rather than because it wouldn't crisp up
because it didn't have any sugar in it

00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:02.499
because it didn't have any sugar in it
 

00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:04.859
because it didn't have any sugar in it
we put it in an oven overnight and we

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:04.869
we put it in an oven overnight and we
 

00:29:04.869 --> 00:29:06.659
we put it in an oven overnight and we
dried it out and then it ended up just

00:29:06.659 --> 00:29:06.669
dried it out and then it ended up just
 

00:29:06.669 --> 00:29:09.359
dried it out and then it ended up just
being a hard dehydrated cookie so it was

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:09.369
being a hard dehydrated cookie so it was
 

00:29:09.369 --> 00:29:10.470
being a hard dehydrated cookie so it was
sort of crispy

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480
sort of crispy
 

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.280
sort of crispy
I know that sounds really appetizing

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:11.290
I know that sounds really appetizing
 

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.160
I know that sounds really appetizing
doesn't it no it's really good

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.170
doesn't it no it's really good
 

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.250
doesn't it no it's really good
and then finally sugar caramelizes

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:17.260
and then finally sugar caramelizes
 

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.790
and then finally sugar caramelizes
between 356 degrees and 390 degrees

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:20.800
between 356 degrees and 390 degrees
 

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.390
between 356 degrees and 390 degrees
sugar will caramelize and that adds to

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:24.400
sugar will caramelize and that adds to
 

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.610
sugar will caramelize and that adds to
the flavor of a cookie or a cake or a

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:26.620
the flavor of a cookie or a cake or a
 

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.900
the flavor of a cookie or a cake or a
tart shell you get that really nice

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:27.910
tart shell you get that really nice
 

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:33.060
tart shell you get that really nice
toasty nutty aroma okay so the next

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.070
toasty nutty aroma okay so the next
 

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.980
toasty nutty aroma okay so the next
thing we're going to talk about is the

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:34.990
thing we're going to talk about is the
 

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.560
thing we're going to talk about is the
stages of sugar I'm going to come back

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:37.570
stages of sugar I'm going to come back
 

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.170
stages of sugar I'm going to come back
and babysit these guys so when you take

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:40.180
and babysit these guys so when you take
 

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:45.290
and babysit these guys so when you take
sugar and water and make it into a syrup

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:45.300
 

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.500
and you boil it at the various

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:49.510
and you boil it at the various
 

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.890
and you boil it at the various
temperatures that you boil the sugar

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:52.900
temperatures that you boil the sugar
 

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:59.300
temperatures that you boil the sugar
water to it corresponds to it

00:29:59.300 --> 00:29:59.310
water to it corresponds to it
 

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.370
water to it corresponds to it
corresponds to the way the sugar reacts

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:02.380
corresponds to the way the sugar reacts
 

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.210
corresponds to the way the sugar reacts
in cold water and so the first stage is

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220
in cold water and so the first stage is
 

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.860
in cold water and so the first stage is
thread stage this is the easy one you

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:10.870
thread stage this is the easy one you
 

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.070
thread stage this is the easy one you
just boil it at 230 degrees to 235

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080
just boil it at 230 degrees to 235
 

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.630
just boil it at 230 degrees to 235
degrees it's called thread stage if you

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640
degrees it's called thread stage if you
 

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.340
degrees it's called thread stage if you
pour a little bit of this into some

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:17.350
pour a little bit of this into some
 

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.410
pour a little bit of this into some
water you'll get little threads and then

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:19.420
water you'll get little threads and then
 

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.270
water you'll get little threads and then
it goes to the bottom this is used for

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:21.280
it goes to the bottom this is used for
 

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.980
it goes to the bottom this is used for
sweetening iced tea or just glazing

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:22.990
sweetening iced tea or just glazing
 

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:27.680
sweetening iced tea or just glazing
fruits the second stage is softball at

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:27.690
fruits the second stage is softball at
 

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.090
fruits the second stage is softball at
softball which is what I'm taking this

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:30.100
softball which is what I'm taking this
 

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.970
softball which is what I'm taking this
too you can make fudge I'm going to take

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:32.980
too you can make fudge I'm going to take
 

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.670
too you can make fudge I'm going to take
mine between softball and the next one

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:35.680
mine between softball and the next one
 

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.730
mine between softball and the next one
which is firm ball so at firm ball you

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:38.740
which is firm ball so at firm ball you
 

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.920
which is firm ball so at firm ball you
can make caramels so these are the

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:40.930
can make caramels so these are the
 

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.650
can make caramels so these are the
difference in temperatures I'm going go

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:43.660
difference in temperatures I'm going go
 

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.510
difference in temperatures I'm going go
backwards so if you look at softball to

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520
backwards so if you look at softball to
 

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.600
backwards so if you look at softball to
35 to 240 when you take the sugar water

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:48.610
35 to 240 when you take the sugar water
 

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.130
35 to 240 when you take the sugar water
and you put it in cold water you'll get

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:50.140
and you put it in cold water you'll get
 

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.170
and you put it in cold water you'll get
a soft ball that's how it got its name

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:52.180
a soft ball that's how it got its name
 

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.150
a soft ball that's how it got its name
and then with firm ball when you do the

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.160
and then with firm ball when you do the
 

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.530
and then with firm ball when you do the
same thing you get a firm ball and

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:55.540
same thing you get a firm ball and
 

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.240
same thing you get a firm ball and
that's how so you don't need a candy

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.250
that's how so you don't need a candy
 

00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.470
that's how so you don't need a candy
thermometer because you can just use

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480
thermometer because you can just use
 

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.750
thermometer because you can just use
your hands but the thing is is that it's

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760
your hands but the thing is is that it's
 

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.280
your hands but the thing is is that it's
really hot so you have to first freeze

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:02.290
really hot so you have to first freeze
 

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.610
really hot so you have to first freeze
your fingers so that and the other thing

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:05.620
your fingers so that and the other thing
 

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.110
your fingers so that and the other thing
that you can do and I don't know if you

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120
that you can do and I don't know if you
 

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.790
that you can do and I don't know if you
can hear it because I'm talking but when

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:08.800
can hear it because I'm talking but when
 

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.510
can hear it because I'm talking but when
you hear sugar water boil it just sounds

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:12.520
you hear sugar water boil it just sounds
 

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.310
you hear sugar water boil it just sounds
like water at first and then as it

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320
like water at first and then as it
 

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.280
like water at first and then as it
starts to get more and more concentrated

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.290
starts to get more and more concentrated
 

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.890
starts to get more and more concentrated
you can hear it and it starts to thicken

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:19.900
you can hear it and it starts to thicken
 

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.170
you can hear it and it starts to thicken
and when it gets to the right

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:22.180
and when it gets to the right
 

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.250
and when it gets to the right
temperature and this is only because

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:23.260
temperature and this is only because
 

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.180
temperature and this is only because
I've been doing it for you

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.190
I've been doing it for you
 

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.710
I've been doing it for you
Cheers you can actually tell when it's

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720
Cheers you can actually tell when it's
 

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.779
Cheers you can actually tell when it's
hitting about softball stage so that way

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:27.789
hitting about softball stage so that way
 

00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:28.889
hitting about softball stage so that way
you don't have to plunge your finger in

00:31:28.889 --> 00:31:28.899
you don't have to plunge your finger in
 

00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:32.279
you don't have to plunge your finger in
all the time you can wait so can you

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:32.289
all the time you can wait so can you
 

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:35.070
all the time you can wait so can you
hear it it's a little bit slower now so

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080
hear it it's a little bit slower now so
 

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.129
hear it it's a little bit slower now so
now I'm going to take a little bit and

00:31:40.129 --> 00:31:40.139
now I'm going to take a little bit and
 

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:43.499
now I'm going to take a little bit and
now I've gone a little bit too far no

00:31:43.499 --> 00:31:43.509
now I've gone a little bit too far no
 

00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:47.580
now I've gone a little bit too far no
here here we go firm ball you can't

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:47.590
here here we go firm ball you can't
 

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.659
here here we go firm ball you can't
really see that but there's a firm

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:48.669
really see that but there's a firm
 

00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:52.850
really see that but there's a firm
little ball okay now we're going to make

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860
little ball okay now we're going to make
 

00:31:52.860 --> 00:32:04.260
little ball okay now we're going to make
meringue so this is very similar

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:04.270
 

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.150
to the meringue that we made that's

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:06.160
to the meringue that we made that's
 

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.340
to the meringue that we made that's
sitting over there in that bowl except

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.350
sitting over there in that bowl except
 

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.500
sitting over there in that bowl except
that I've cooked the sugar this will

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:10.510
that I've cooked the sugar this will
 

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:14.460
that I've cooked the sugar this will
help make it that meringue is not quite

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.470
help make it that meringue is not quite
 

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:30.150
help make it that meringue is not quite
as stable as this meringue

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:30.160
 

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.310
so I've just taken that sugar syrup and

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320
so I've just taken that sugar syrup and
 

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:41.550
so I've just taken that sugar syrup and
I've poured it into the egg whites I'm

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:41.560
I've poured it into the egg whites I'm
 

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.640
I've poured it into the egg whites I'm
going to take this Italian meringue and

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:44.650
going to take this Italian meringue and
 

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.200
going to take this Italian meringue and
I'm going to throw butter into it and

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.210
I'm going to throw butter into it and
 

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.090
I'm going to throw butter into it and
then that's butter cream and that's what

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.100
then that's butter cream and that's what
 

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.890
then that's butter cream and that's what
you use to frost a cake and that's what

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:49.900
you use to frost a cake and that's what
 

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.360
you use to frost a cake and that's what
you're going to eat is a little little

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:51.370
you're going to eat is a little little
 

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.510
you're going to eat is a little little
bit of buttercream okay so but you have

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:54.520
bit of buttercream okay so but you have
 

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.830
bit of buttercream okay so but you have
to wait until this cools before you can

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840
to wait until this cools before you can
 

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.110
to wait until this cools before you can
add the butter so while that's cooling

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120
add the butter so while that's cooling
 

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.210
add the butter so while that's cooling
I'm going to go back to the slide really

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:00.220
I'm going to go back to the slide really
 

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:04.410
I'm going to go back to the slide really
quick hardball you is to what you use to

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:04.420
quick hardball you is to what you use to
 

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.580
quick hardball you is to what you use to
make marshmallows and then soft crack is

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:10.590
make marshmallows and then soft crack is
 

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:15.270
make marshmallows and then soft crack is
taffy hard crack is lollipops and then

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:15.280
taffy hard crack is lollipops and then
 

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.210
taffy hard crack is lollipops and then
the final stage is caramelization and

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:18.220
the final stage is caramelization and
 

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.490
the final stage is caramelization and
that's when you take the sugar so far

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:20.500
that's when you take the sugar so far
 

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.770
that's when you take the sugar so far
that it starts to turn tan and then it

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:22.780
that it starts to turn tan and then it
 

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.420
that it starts to turn tan and then it
starts to turn brown and you can make

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:24.430
starts to turn brown and you can make
 

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.360
starts to turn brown and you can make
praline and caramel sauce and a whole

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:27.370
praline and caramel sauce and a whole
 

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.430
praline and caramel sauce and a whole
bunch of other things so does that make

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440
bunch of other things so does that make
 

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.910
bunch of other things so does that make
sense all of the stages of sugar and why

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:32.920
sense all of the stages of sugar and why
 

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.410
sense all of the stages of sugar and why
they have the different names okay

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:34.420
they have the different names okay
 

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.640
they have the different names okay
because because it's you can definitely

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:38.650
because because it's you can definitely
 

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.980
because because it's you can definitely
use a candy thermometer but if you know

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:40.990
use a candy thermometer but if you know
 

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.570
use a candy thermometer but if you know
what you're looking for you can you

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:42.580
what you're looking for you can you
 

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.280
what you're looking for you can you
don't have to and you can just use ice

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.290
don't have to and you can just use ice
 

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:45.900
don't have to and you can just use ice
water and then you'll know exactly how

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:45.910
water and then you'll know exactly how
 

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.080
water and then you'll know exactly how
far to take it okay so let's revisit

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.090
far to take it okay so let's revisit
 

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:58.410
far to take it okay so let's revisit
these meringues you can see this one so

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:58.420
these meringues you can see this one so
 

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.670
these meringues you can see this one so
can you see this is the one that was

00:33:59.670 --> 00:33:59.680
can you see this is the one that was
 

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.600
can you see this is the one that was
just egg white and no sugar and it's

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:03.610
just egg white and no sugar and it's
 

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.160
just egg white and no sugar and it's
basically just deflating in front of our

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.170
basically just deflating in front of our
 

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.730
basically just deflating in front of our
very eyes it's very sad

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:08.740
very eyes it's very sad
 

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.840
very eyes it's very sad
useless this has been stabilized with

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:13.850
useless this has been stabilized with
 

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.220
useless this has been stabilized with
sugar so you can see it's still

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.230
sugar so you can see it's still
 

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.020
sugar so you can see it's still
beautiful you can make cookies out of

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.030
beautiful you can make cookies out of
 

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.080
beautiful you can make cookies out of
this you could fold almond flour and

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.090
this you could fold almond flour and
 

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.270
this you could fold almond flour and
make French macaron that's what you

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280
make French macaron that's what you
 

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.930
make French macaron that's what you
would use this for the Italian one which

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:25.940
would use this for the Italian one which
 

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.280
would use this for the Italian one which
is over there we're going to wait until

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:27.290
is over there we're going to wait until
 

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.980
is over there we're going to wait until
it cools and then this one we are going

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:29.990
it cools and then this one we are going
 

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:35.680
it cools and then this one we are going
to make praline praline is when you take

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:35.690
to make praline praline is when you take
 

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.860
to make praline praline is when you take
sugar and you wait until it caramelizes

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.870
sugar and you wait until it caramelizes
 

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.570
sugar and you wait until it caramelizes
so right now it's reaching about firm

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:43.580
so right now it's reaching about firm
 

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.580
so right now it's reaching about firm
ball hard ball because it's really

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:45.590
ball hard ball because it's really
 

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.750
ball hard ball because it's really
really slow in its bubbles and the

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760
really slow in its bubbles and the
 

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.170
really slow in its bubbles and the
bubbles are getting really big they're

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.180
bubbles are getting really big they're
 

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:58.840
bubbles are getting really big they're
very yeah very slow and now it'll slowly

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:58.850
very yeah very slow and now it'll slowly
 

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.420
very yeah very slow and now it'll slowly
start to turn color and as soon as it

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.430
start to turn color and as soon as it
 

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.060
start to turn color and as soon as it
starts to caramelize to make praline you

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.070
starts to caramelize to make praline you
 

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.830
starts to caramelize to make praline you
just pour nuts into it and then pour it

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:05.840
just pour nuts into it and then pour it
 

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.260
just pour nuts into it and then pour it
out onto a sheet tray and then let it

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:08.270
out onto a sheet tray and then let it
 

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:17.390
out onto a sheet tray and then let it
cool

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400
 

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.539
okay so while that one is waiting to

00:35:20.539 --> 00:35:20.549
okay so while that one is waiting to
 

00:35:20.549 --> 00:35:23.630
okay so while that one is waiting to
caramelize we're going to add the butter

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640
caramelize we're going to add the butter
 

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.700
caramelize we're going to add the butter
to this one sorry I don't mean to keep

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:25.710
to this one sorry I don't mean to keep
 

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.609
to this one sorry I don't mean to keep
moving around but can you see how much

00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619
moving around but can you see how much
 

00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:31.069
moving around but can you see how much
this is grown I don't know if you guys

00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079
this is grown I don't know if you guys
 

00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:32.480
this is grown I don't know if you guys
can see that so to make buttercream you

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:32.490
can see that so to make buttercream you
 

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.519
can see that so to make buttercream you
just take the butter and you just throw

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:34.529
just take the butter and you just throw
 

00:35:34.529 --> 00:35:35.769
just take the butter and you just throw
it in

00:35:35.769 --> 00:35:35.779
it in
 

00:35:35.779 --> 00:35:38.989
it in
it's got to be soft butter it can't be

00:35:38.989 --> 00:35:38.999
it's got to be soft butter it can't be
 

00:35:38.999 --> 00:35:40.989
it's got to be soft butter it can't be
too cold or it'll shock the whole thing

00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:40.999
too cold or it'll shock the whole thing
 

00:35:40.999 --> 00:35:43.970
too cold or it'll shock the whole thing
but it can't be melted butter because

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980
but it can't be melted butter because
 

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.529
but it can't be melted butter because
then it won't be stable enough and it's

00:35:48.529 --> 00:35:48.539
then it won't be stable enough and it's
 

00:35:48.539 --> 00:35:58.480
then it won't be stable enough and it's
about a cup of egg whites a cup of sugar

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:58.490
 

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:06.090
and a pound of butter

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.100
 

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.630
it sound like a lot I feel like this is

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640
it sound like a lot I feel like this is
 

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.580
it sound like a lot I feel like this is
such a small amount like I'm almost done

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:13.590
 

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.260
and what will happen is is the butter

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:16.270
and what will happen is is the butter
 

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.450
and what will happen is is the butter
will slowly mix into the meringue and

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:18.460
will slowly mix into the meringue and
 

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.580
will slowly mix into the meringue and
it's going to look broken at first it's

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:20.590
it's going to look broken at first it's
 

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.470
it's going to look broken at first it's
going to look like we messed up and then

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480
going to look like we messed up and then
 

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.990
going to look like we messed up and then
slowly it'll all come together and then

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000
slowly it'll all come together and then
 

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.750
slowly it'll all come together and then
we'll have butter cream okay

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760
we'll have butter cream okay
 

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.490
we'll have butter cream okay
so that one is working and now we're

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.500
so that one is working and now we're
 

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.320
so that one is working and now we're
going to come back here and now you can

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:34.330
going to come back here and now you can
 

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.520
going to come back here and now you can
see you see that how nice that looks

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:37.530
see you see that how nice that looks
 

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.230
see you see that how nice that looks
so I'm just going to swirl this around a

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240
so I'm just going to swirl this around a
 

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:50.460
so I'm just going to swirl this around a
little bit and then add my nuts squirrel

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:50.470
little bit and then add my nuts squirrel
 

00:36:50.470 --> 00:37:08.579
little bit and then add my nuts squirrel
to coat

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:08.589
 

00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:11.189
and probably about 10 or 15 minutes will

00:37:11.189 --> 00:37:11.199
and probably about 10 or 15 minutes will
 

00:37:11.199 --> 00:37:15.150
and probably about 10 or 15 minutes will
cool and it'll be really hard and then

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160
cool and it'll be really hard and then
 

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.329
cool and it'll be really hard and then
you can break it off and some people can

00:37:18.329 --> 00:37:18.339
you can break it off and some people can
 

00:37:18.339 --> 00:37:21.299
you can break it off and some people can
eat it because we only have this much so

00:37:21.299 --> 00:37:21.309
eat it because we only have this much so
 

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:22.979
eat it because we only have this much so
we'll put it right there we're going to

00:37:22.979 --> 00:37:22.989
we'll put it right there we're going to
 

00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:24.929
we'll put it right there we're going to
make caramel sauce and then we're going

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:24.939
make caramel sauce and then we're going
 

00:37:24.939 --> 00:37:29.489
make caramel sauce and then we're going
to finish with croquembouche which is

00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:29.499
to finish with croquembouche which is
 

00:37:29.499 --> 00:37:32.729
to finish with croquembouche which is
the picture that the the beginning of

00:37:32.729 --> 00:37:32.739
the picture that the the beginning of
 

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:42.150
the picture that the the beginning of
the slideshow began with so right now

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160
the slideshow began with so right now
 

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.099
the slideshow began with so right now
I'm just adding water to the sugar to

00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:44.109
I'm just adding water to the sugar to
 

00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:52.049
I'm just adding water to the sugar to
dissolve it and then we're going to take

00:37:52.049 --> 00:37:52.059
dissolve it and then we're going to take
 

00:37:52.059 --> 00:38:00.350
dissolve it and then we're going to take
it just as far as we took that

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:00.360
 

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.140
and this one we're waiting to get a

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:03.150
and this one we're waiting to get a
 

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.640
and this one we're waiting to get a
little bit Brown so that we can make

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:04.650
little bit Brown so that we can make
 

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.320
little bit Brown so that we can make
caramel sauce okay

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.330
caramel sauce okay
 

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.940
caramel sauce okay
so here we go we're going to look at the

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:07.950
so here we go we're going to look at the
 

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:37.160
so here we go we're going to look at the
buttercream and so this is buttercream

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.170
buttercream and so this is buttercream
 

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.080
buttercream and so this is buttercream
and this is what you would use to frost

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.090
and this is what you would use to frost
 

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:45.230
and this is what you would use to frost
a cake so if you want you can make this

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240
a cake so if you want you can make this
 

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.880
a cake so if you want you can make this
ahead of time I know this is a baking

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:46.890
ahead of time I know this is a baking
 

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.740
ahead of time I know this is a baking
class but just so you know if you want

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:48.750
class but just so you know if you want
 

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.880
class but just so you know if you want
you can make this ahead of time store it

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:49.890
you can make this ahead of time store it
 

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.170
you can make this ahead of time store it
in the fridge and then when you want to

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180
in the fridge and then when you want to
 

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.020
in the fridge and then when you want to
reuse it you don't want to use this you

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:54.030
reuse it you don't want to use this you
 

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.140
reuse it you don't want to use this you
actually want to use this to reap a ttle

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:57.150
actually want to use this to reap a ttle
 

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.210
actually want to use this to reap a ttle
it and to make it smooth again it's

00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.220
it and to make it smooth again it's
 

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.440
it and to make it smooth again it's
going to be hard like butter because

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:00.450
going to be hard like butter because
 

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.090
going to be hard like butter because
it's mostly butter so you're going to

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:02.100
it's mostly butter so you're going to
 

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.500
it's mostly butter so you're going to
want to bring it to room temperature and

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:03.510
want to bring it to room temperature and
 

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.500
want to bring it to room temperature and
paddle it and it might break it might

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:06.510
paddle it and it might break it might
 

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.210
paddle it and it might break it might
look curdled but just wait until it

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:08.220
look curdled but just wait until it
 

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.530
look curdled but just wait until it
warms up and then when you paddle it

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540
warms up and then when you paddle it
 

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.240
warms up and then when you paddle it
it'll get smoothing in and then you can

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:11.250
it'll get smoothing in and then you can
 

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:20.150
it'll get smoothing in and then you can
use it any questions no okay because we

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160
use it any questions no okay because we
 

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.620
use it any questions no okay because we
just have to wait for these two things

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:21.630
just have to wait for these two things
 

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.720
just have to wait for these two things
the timing with caramel is a little bit

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:23.730
the timing with caramel is a little bit
 

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.840
the timing with caramel is a little bit
tricky so we're waiting for this to

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:26.850
tricky so we're waiting for this to
 

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.470
tricky so we're waiting for this to
caramelize and then we're going to do

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480
caramelize and then we're going to do
 

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:35.720
caramelize and then we're going to do
the croquembouche with this um that's

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:35.730
the croquembouche with this um that's
 

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:42.920
the croquembouche with this um that's
all I have yeah yeah again so I mean if

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:42.930
all I have yeah yeah again so I mean if
 

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.410
all I have yeah yeah again so I mean if
you noticed on Joanne slides as she was

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420
you noticed on Joanne slides as she was
 

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.060
you noticed on Joanne slides as she was
going from softball to hardball to

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.070
going from softball to hardball to
 

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.380
going from softball to hardball to
whatever they're called what was

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:48.390
whatever they're called what was
 

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.350
whatever they're called what was
increasing was the percentage of sugar

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:51.360
increasing was the percentage of sugar
 

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.940
increasing was the percentage of sugar
that's in the thing and it's really

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:52.950
that's in the thing and it's really
 

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.740
that's in the thing and it's really
dramatic that is only a couple of

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:54.750
dramatic that is only a couple of
 

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.900
dramatic that is only a couple of
degrees and the sugar percentage goes up

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:56.910
degrees and the sugar percentage goes up
 

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.280
degrees and the sugar percentage goes up
from like eighty-five to ninety-five

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.290
from like eighty-five to ninety-five
 

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.620
from like eighty-five to ninety-five
percent so what's the rest of it other

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:00.630
percent so what's the rest of it other
 

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.390
percent so what's the rest of it other
than sugar what else is in there when it

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400
than sugar what else is in there when it
 

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.830
than sugar what else is in there when it
says eighty-five percent sugar what else

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:03.840
says eighty-five percent sugar what else
 

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.560
says eighty-five percent sugar what else
is in the mixture water and so the

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:06.570
is in the mixture water and so the
 

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.940
is in the mixture water and so the
reason that the textures are so

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:07.950
reason that the textures are so
 

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:09.410
reason that the textures are so
different is because you knew you know

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420
different is because you knew you know
 

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.150
different is because you knew you know
if it's all sugar it'll be really hard

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160
if it's all sugar it'll be really hard
 

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.880
if it's all sugar it'll be really hard
but see if 95 percent sugar

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
but see if 95 percent sugar
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.900
but see if 95 percent sugar
the texture is softer 92% it's softer so

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:17.910
the texture is softer 92% it's softer so
 

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:19.340
the texture is softer 92% it's softer so
what you're really doing is controlling

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:19.350
what you're really doing is controlling
 

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.040
what you're really doing is controlling
the water content of the of the mixture

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.050
the water content of the of the mixture
 

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.550
the water content of the of the mixture
so we're going to now make caramel sauce

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560
so we're going to now make caramel sauce
 

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.160
so we're going to now make caramel sauce
so you can see that it's now nice and

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.170
so you can see that it's now nice and
 

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.110
so you can see that it's now nice and
caramelized and one trick again I know

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:30.120
caramelized and one trick again I know
 

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.460
caramelized and one trick again I know
it's not a baking class but just in case

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.470
it's not a baking class but just in case
 

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.200
it's not a baking class but just in case
you guys decide to make something when

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:33.210
you guys decide to make something when
 

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.790
you guys decide to make something when
you make caramel right now it looks

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800
you make caramel right now it looks
 

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.610
you make caramel right now it looks
really Brown but the grill key is what

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:37.620
really Brown but the grill key is what
 

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.320
really Brown but the grill key is what
you want to do is actually tilt the pan

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:39.330
you want to do is actually tilt the pan
 

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.670
you want to do is actually tilt the pan
and then look at the what's what results

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680
and then look at the what's what results
 

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.110
and then look at the what's what results
because that's the true color so I think

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:45.120
because that's the true color so I think
 

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.300
because that's the true color so I think
a lot of bakers they think oh this is

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:47.310
a lot of bakers they think oh this is
 

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.580
a lot of bakers they think oh this is
caramel I'm done but no this isn't this

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:49.590
caramel I'm done but no this isn't this
 

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.990
caramel I'm done but no this isn't this
isn't dark enough what you want to do is

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000
isn't dark enough what you want to do is
 

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.300
isn't dark enough what you want to do is
take it tilt it and then look and then

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:53.310
take it tilt it and then look and then
 

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.710
take it tilt it and then look and then
that fine sheen is how is the true color

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720
that fine sheen is how is the true color
 

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.250
that fine sheen is how is the true color
okay now it's good and then we're going

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260
okay now it's good and then we're going
 

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.570
okay now it's good and then we're going
to add cream but you have to be really

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:02.580
to add cream but you have to be really
 

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.570
to add cream but you have to be really
careful because it's okay and that's

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:08.580
careful because it's okay and that's
 

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.130
careful because it's okay and that's
caramel sauce okay and then this one is

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140
caramel sauce okay and then this one is
 

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.890
caramel sauce okay and then this one is
the last one which is I'm going to do

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900
the last one which is I'm going to do
 

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.210
the last one which is I'm going to do
what's called spinning sugar and that's

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220
what's called spinning sugar and that's
 

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.330
what's called spinning sugar and that's
taking caramel and then creating because

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:20.340
taking caramel and then creating because
 

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.280
taking caramel and then creating because
remember how we talked about softball

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.290
remember how we talked about softball
 

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.500
remember how we talked about softball
firm ball hard ball soft crack hard

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:24.510
firm ball hard ball soft crack hard
 

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.420
firm ball hard ball soft crack hard
crack it turns out at hard crack and

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:26.430
crack it turns out at hard crack and
 

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.160
crack it turns out at hard crack and
beyond what that means is that when the

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.170
beyond what that means is that when the
 

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.490
beyond what that means is that when the
sugar cools it becomes like a crack it

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500
sugar cools it becomes like a crack it
 

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.730
sugar cools it becomes like a crack it
cracks and caramel which is way past

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740
cracks and caramel which is way past
 

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.870
cracks and caramel which is way past
hard crack when you flick it really fast

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880
hard crack when you flick it really fast
 

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.690
hard crack when you flick it really fast
it creates these long sugar strands that

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700
it creates these long sugar strands that
 

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.450
it creates these long sugar strands that
end up looking very beautiful and that's

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460
end up looking very beautiful and that's
 

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.320
end up looking very beautiful and that's
spun sugar and last year when I did it I

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.330
spun sugar and last year when I did it I
 

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.210
spun sugar and last year when I did it I
had a pot of sugar and it crystallized

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:50.220
had a pot of sugar and it crystallized
 

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.620
had a pot of sugar and it crystallized
in the middle of the lecture and it was

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:51.630
in the middle of the lecture and it was
 

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:52.190
in the middle of the lecture and it was
like what do I do

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200
like what do I do
 

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.440
like what do I do
so crystallization of sugar is when

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:54.450
so crystallization of sugar is when
 

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.300
so crystallization of sugar is when
you're doing what we've been doing you

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:56.310
you're doing what we've been doing you
 

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.040
you're doing what we've been doing you
put sugar and water in a pot and you

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.050
put sugar and water in a pot and you
 

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.270
put sugar and water in a pot and you
turn it on and you think you're making

00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280
turn it on and you think you're making
 

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.490
turn it on and you think you're making
you know either softball for a

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500
you know either softball for a
 

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.320
you know either softball for a
buttercream or you're making caramel for

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:03.330
buttercream or you're making caramel for
 

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.330
buttercream or you're making caramel for
caramel sauce and you come and you look

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:05.340
caramel sauce and you come and you look
 

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.800
caramel sauce and you come and you look
at it and all of a sudden I was actually

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:06.810
at it and all of a sudden I was actually
 

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.510
at it and all of a sudden I was actually
worried that that might happen tonight

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520
worried that that might happen tonight
 

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.800
worried that that might happen tonight
but I probably should have let it happen

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:09.810
but I probably should have let it happen
 

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.020
but I probably should have let it happen
so that I could show you guys so when

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.030
so that I could show you guys so when
 

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.340
so that I could show you guys so when
you come back and you look at it turns

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:13.350
you come back and you look at it turns
 

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.710
you come back and you look at it turns
out it starts to have what I don't even

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720
out it starts to have what I don't even
 

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.180
out it starts to have what I don't even
know how to describe it it kind of looks

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:17.190
know how to describe it it kind of looks
 

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.110
know how to describe it it kind of looks
like pieces of ice floating in the sugar

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.120
like pieces of ice floating in the sugar
 

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.330
like pieces of ice floating in the sugar
syrup so everything that you've seen has

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:23.340
syrup so everything that you've seen has
 

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.430
syrup so everything that you've seen has
been perfect everything's boiled this

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440
been perfect everything's boiled this
 

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.020
been perfect everything's boiled this
looks so perfect it's just boiling and

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.030
looks so perfect it's just boiling and
 

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.950
looks so perfect it's just boiling and
boiling

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960
boiling
 

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.319
boiling
but it turns out there's a couple things

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:30.329
but it turns out there's a couple things
 

00:42:30.329 --> 00:42:32.420
but it turns out there's a couple things
that cause crystallization that I know

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.430
that cause crystallization that I know
 

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.400
that cause crystallization that I know
of from a pastry point of view I don't

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:34.410
of from a pastry point of view I don't
 

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.799
of from a pastry point of view I don't
really know what it means from a from a

00:42:36.799 --> 00:42:36.809
really know what it means from a from a
 

00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:39.079
really know what it means from a from a
scientific point of view but if you have

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:39.089
scientific point of view but if you have
 

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:41.690
scientific point of view but if you have
any sugar crystals that are on the side

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700
any sugar crystals that are on the side
 

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.480
any sugar crystals that are on the side
of the pan so when you take sugar and

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:44.490
of the pan so when you take sugar and
 

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.880
of the pan so when you take sugar and
water and you mix them together you

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:46.890
water and you mix them together you
 

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.680
water and you mix them together you
don't want to splash sugar crystals on

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:48.690
don't want to splash sugar crystals on
 

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.299
don't want to splash sugar crystals on
the side so you you may have noticed

00:42:50.299 --> 00:42:50.309
the side so you you may have noticed
 

00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:51.589
the side so you you may have noticed
that when I put the water and I didn't

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599
that when I put the water and I didn't
 

00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:53.299
that when I put the water and I didn't
just pour the water and I very gently

00:42:53.299 --> 00:42:53.309
just pour the water and I very gently
 

00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:54.200
just pour the water and I very gently
put the water in

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:54.210
put the water in
 

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.849
put the water in
I really gently moved the sugar to

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:55.859
I really gently moved the sugar to
 

00:42:55.859 --> 00:42:57.920
I really gently moved the sugar to
dissolve it because if there's any sugar

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:57.930
dissolve it because if there's any sugar
 

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.329
dissolve it because if there's any sugar
crystals on the side then there's a

00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339
crystals on the side then there's a
 

00:42:59.339 --> 00:43:01.370
crystals on the side then there's a
chance that those sugar crystals they're

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380
chance that those sugar crystals they're
 

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.589
chance that those sugar crystals they're
very influential and when this is

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599
very influential and when this is
 

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:05.269
very influential and when this is
happening it's at this point when it

00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:05.279
happening it's at this point when it
 

00:43:05.279 --> 00:43:07.130
happening it's at this point when it
starts to go into softball form ball

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140
starts to go into softball form ball
 

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.930
starts to go into softball form ball
stage that if there's a sugar crystal

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940
stage that if there's a sugar crystal
 

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.269
stage that if there's a sugar crystal
the sugar crystal will fall into the

00:43:11.269 --> 00:43:11.279
the sugar crystal will fall into the
 

00:43:11.279 --> 00:43:13.460
the sugar crystal will fall into the
syrup and it'll just cause this chain

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:13.470
syrup and it'll just cause this chain
 

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.920
syrup and it'll just cause this chain
reaction that will then cause what looks

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:15.930
reaction that will then cause what looks
 

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.039
reaction that will then cause what looks
like ice on the top of it

00:43:19.039 --> 00:43:19.049
like ice on the top of it
 

00:43:19.049 --> 00:43:22.640
like ice on the top of it
and it can happen at any stage the other

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:22.650
and it can happen at any stage the other
 

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.029
and it can happen at any stage the other
times it happens is if you move it so I

00:43:26.029 --> 00:43:26.039
times it happens is if you move it so I
 

00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:26.960
times it happens is if you move it so I
don't know if you've noticed but I won't

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:26.970
don't know if you've noticed but I won't
 

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.940
don't know if you've noticed but I won't
touch this until it starts to caramelize

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:28.950
touch this until it starts to caramelize
 

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.819
touch this until it starts to caramelize
so if you move the sugar syrup while

00:43:31.819 --> 00:43:31.829
so if you move the sugar syrup while
 

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:34.609
so if you move the sugar syrup while
it's spoiling it for some reason jostles

00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619
it's spoiling it for some reason jostles
 

00:43:34.619 --> 00:43:36.979
it's spoiling it for some reason jostles
it and makes it want to crystallize and

00:43:36.979 --> 00:43:36.989
it and makes it want to crystallize and
 

00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:38.479
it and makes it want to crystallize and
so those are two tricks you want to make

00:43:38.479 --> 00:43:38.489
so those are two tricks you want to make
 

00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:39.739
so those are two tricks you want to make
sure that there's no sugar on the edge

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:39.749
sure that there's no sugar on the edge
 

00:43:39.749 --> 00:43:42.410
sure that there's no sugar on the edge
of the pan and then you don't want to

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420
of the pan and then you don't want to
 

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.630
of the pan and then you don't want to
touch it until it caramelizes as soon as

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640
touch it until it caramelizes as soon as
 

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.549
touch it until it caramelizes as soon as
it caramelizes you can touch it and you

00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559
it caramelizes you can touch it and you
 

00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:47.989
it caramelizes you can touch it and you
can swirl it around and even out the

00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:47.999
can swirl it around and even out the
 

00:43:47.999 --> 00:43:50.509
can swirl it around and even out the
caramelization but before then if you

00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:50.519
caramelization but before then if you
 

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:51.589
caramelization but before then if you
touch it there's a chance it will

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599
touch it there's a chance it will
 

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:54.650
touch it there's a chance it will
crystallize some things that you can do

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:54.660
crystallize some things that you can do
 

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.870
crystallize some things that you can do
you can try to just boil it gently and

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880
you can try to just boil it gently and
 

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.239
you can try to just boil it gently and
sometimes it boils away but a lot of

00:43:59.239 --> 00:43:59.249
sometimes it boils away but a lot of
 

00:43:59.249 --> 00:44:01.309
sometimes it boils away but a lot of
times you just have to start over and so

00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319
times you just have to start over and so
 

00:44:01.319 --> 00:44:02.509
times you just have to start over and so
like during the holidays when we're

00:44:02.509 --> 00:44:02.519
like during the holidays when we're
 

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:03.620
like during the holidays when we're
making millions and millions of

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:03.630
making millions and millions of
 

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.009
making millions and millions of
croquembouche

00:44:04.009 --> 00:44:04.019
croquembouche
 

00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:05.930
croquembouche
we have pots of sugar just going on

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940
we have pots of sugar just going on
 

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.289
we have pots of sugar just going on
every stove because one out of every 10

00:44:09.289 --> 00:44:09.299
every stove because one out of every 10
 

00:44:09.299 --> 00:44:11.029
every stove because one out of every 10
ends up crystallizing and then we can't

00:44:11.029 --> 00:44:11.039
ends up crystallizing and then we can't
 

00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:12.140
ends up crystallizing and then we can't
use it so we always have all these

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.150
use it so we always have all these
 

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.479
use it so we always have all these
back-up pots is that how good yeah I

00:44:14.479 --> 00:44:14.489
back-up pots is that how good yeah I
 

00:44:14.489 --> 00:44:16.069
back-up pots is that how good yeah I
think let's let's do this for a sec so

00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079
think let's let's do this for a sec so
 

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.839
think let's let's do this for a sec so
the sugar actually started to

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:17.849
the sugar actually started to
 

00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:21.170
the sugar actually started to
crystallize which is too bad but okay so

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180
crystallize which is too bad but okay so
 

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.150
crystallize which is too bad but okay so
now you can see so this is caramel right

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160
now you can see so this is caramel right
 

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.190
now you can see so this is caramel right
we were we've made it we've let it sit

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200
we were we've made it we've let it sit
 

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.569
we were we've made it we've let it sit
and now it's starting to cool down and

00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579
and now it's starting to cool down and
 

00:44:26.579 --> 00:44:30.739
and now it's starting to cool down and
as it cools it thickens up and then so

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:30.749
as it cools it thickens up and then so
 

00:44:30.749 --> 00:44:32.180
as it cools it thickens up and then so
what I'm doing is I keep lifting it and

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:32.190
what I'm doing is I keep lifting it and
 

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.309
what I'm doing is I keep lifting it and
to see if it'll just fall in one

00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319
to see if it'll just fall in one
 

00:44:34.319 --> 00:44:36.650
to see if it'll just fall in one
continuous strand without breaking and

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660
continuous strand without breaking and
 

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.509
continuous strand without breaking and
then once I feel like it's a nice thick

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:38.519
then once I feel like it's a nice thick
 

00:44:38.519 --> 00:44:40.099
then once I feel like it's a nice thick
layer I'm gonna try not to make too much

00:44:40.099 --> 00:44:40.109
layer I'm gonna try not to make too much
 

00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.839
layer I'm gonna try not to make too much
of a mess

00:44:40.839 --> 00:44:40.849
of a mess
 

00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:44.799
of a mess
way so then what you can do is just do

00:44:44.799 --> 00:44:44.809
way so then what you can do is just do
 

00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:46.690
way so then what you can do is just do
what's called sponger which is you

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:46.700
what's called sponger which is you
 

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:53.960
what's called sponger which is you
basically

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:53.970
 

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.640
so I let a lot of it drip off because I

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:56.650
so I let a lot of it drip off because I
 

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.960
so I let a lot of it drip off because I
don't want clumps of it and then I just

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:57.970
don't want clumps of it and then I just
 

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.240
don't want clumps of it and then I just
flick and you can see that it just

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.250
flick and you can see that it just
 

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.480
flick and you can see that it just
starts to fall because it's past that

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:03.490
starts to fall because it's past that
 

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.840
starts to fall because it's past that
soft crack stage I mean there's a lot of

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:06.850
soft crack stage I mean there's a lot of
 

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.760
soft crack stage I mean there's a lot of
different ways you can do this and

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:08.770
different ways you can do this and
 

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.650
different ways you can do this and
typically you should do this on like a

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:10.660
typically you should do this on like a
 

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.090
typically you should do this on like a
piece of parchment it makes cleanup a

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:12.100
piece of parchment it makes cleanup a
 

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.880
piece of parchment it makes cleanup a
little bit easier I'll do that tomorrow

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:14.890
little bit easier I'll do that tomorrow
 

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.720
little bit easier I'll do that tomorrow
I forgot I'm sorry okay and then so this

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:18.730
I forgot I'm sorry okay and then so this
 

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.100
I forgot I'm sorry okay and then so this
is just the start of it so then you can

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.110
is just the start of it so then you can
 

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.970
is just the start of it so then you can
take all of this sponge sugar and just

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:23.980
take all of this sponge sugar and just
 

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.120
take all of this sponge sugar and just
wrap it around here I'll get this slice

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:27.130
wrap it around here I'll get this slice
 

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.950
wrap it around here I'll get this slice
of it but it's super easy you just hold

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:31.960
of it but it's super easy you just hold
 

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.280
of it but it's super easy you just hold
this and then you flick so you have to

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.290
this and then you flick so you have to
 

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:43.250
this and then you flick so you have to
flick it's a really quick quick flicking

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260
 

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.810
so a lot of times people do this I'm

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:45.820
so a lot of times people do this I'm
 

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.370
so a lot of times people do this I'm
going to show you what not to do so a

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.380
going to show you what not to do so a
 

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:51.450
going to show you what not to do so a
lot of times people will do this okay

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:51.460
lot of times people will do this okay
 

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.260
lot of times people will do this okay
but what you want to do is again let a

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:55.270
but what you want to do is again let a
 

00:45:55.270 --> 00:46:02.730
but what you want to do is again let a
lot of it run off and then just flick

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:02.740
lot of it run off and then just flick
 

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.000
lot of it run off and then just flick
really fast and then as the sugar falls

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.010
really fast and then as the sugar falls
 

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:12.630
really fast and then as the sugar falls
from the utensil it'll form these

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640
from the utensil it'll form these
 

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.000
from the utensil it'll form these
strands that then become spun sugar and

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.010
strands that then become spun sugar and
 

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.090
strands that then become spun sugar and
so then as this gets colder it becomes

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:18.100
so then as this gets colder it becomes
 

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.940
so then as this gets colder it becomes
harder to spin because the the sugar

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:20.950
harder to spin because the the sugar
 

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.510
harder to spin because the the sugar
gets more and more firm and hard and

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520
gets more and more firm and hard and
 

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.610
gets more and more firm and hard and
then you can do what's called pulled

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:26.620
then you can do what's called pulled
 

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.440
then you can do what's called pulled
sugar actually you would never take it

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.450
sugar actually you would never take it
 

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.320
sugar actually you would never take it
to caramel to do pulled sugar but if you

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.330
to caramel to do pulled sugar but if you
 

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.480
to caramel to do pulled sugar but if you
take sugar to a hard crack stage and

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.490
take sugar to a hard crack stage and
 

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:38.250
take sugar to a hard crack stage and
then let it cool it becomes it becomes a

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:38.260
then let it cool it becomes it becomes a
 

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.410
then let it cool it becomes it becomes a
stiffer as it cools and as it becomes

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:40.420
stiffer as it cools and as it becomes
 

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.270
stiffer as it cools and as it becomes
stiffer you can start to lift it up and

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280
stiffer you can start to lift it up and
 

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.500
stiffer you can start to lift it up and
it starts to feel like caramel and you

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:43.510
it starts to feel like caramel and you
 

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.450
it starts to feel like caramel and you
can start to pull it and that's how they

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:45.460
can start to pull it and that's how they
 

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.130
can start to pull it and that's how they
make all those beautiful like flowers

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.140
make all those beautiful like flowers
 

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.350
make all those beautiful like flowers
and birds and butterflies and stuff like

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:49.360
and birds and butterflies and stuff like
 

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.370
and birds and butterflies and stuff like
that so yeah so this is you just keep

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:53.380
that so yeah so this is you just keep
 

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.800
that so yeah so this is you just keep
going until you cover it and as much

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:55.810
going until you cover it and as much
 

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.320
going until you cover it and as much
caramel as you want the tricky thing

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:58.330
caramel as you want the tricky thing
 

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.820
caramel as you want the tricky thing
about croquembouche and about spun sugar

00:46:59.820 --> 00:46:59.830
about croquembouche and about spun sugar
 

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.500
about croquembouche and about spun sugar
is that it's very temperature dependent

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:01.510
is that it's very temperature dependent
 

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.690
is that it's very temperature dependent
it's very humidity dependent and so you

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:03.700
it's very humidity dependent and so you
 

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.760
it's very humidity dependent and so you
actually can make it it will last for

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:05.770
actually can make it it will last for
 

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:06.650
actually can make it it will last for
about an hour

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660
about an hour
 

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.870
about an hour
to two hours and then it just starts to

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880
to two hours and then it just starts to
 

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.730
to two hours and then it just starts to
melt and if it's raining outside you

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:10.740
melt and if it's raining outside you
 

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.960
melt and if it's raining outside you
don't even have that long you probably

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:11.970
don't even have that long you probably
 

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.609
don't even have that long you probably
have like 15 minutes and then it just

00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619
have like 15 minutes and then it just
 

00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:16.220
have like 15 minutes and then it just
starts to melt can I ask you guys a

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:16.230
starts to melt can I ask you guys a
 

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.759
starts to melt can I ask you guys a
question so why do you have to click it

00:47:18.759 --> 00:47:18.769
question so why do you have to click it
 

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:27.680
question so why do you have to click it
anybody know it has to it has to hit our

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:27.690
anybody know it has to it has to hit our
 

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.630
anybody know it has to it has to hit our
air so somebody said cool rapidly so

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640
air so somebody said cool rapidly so
 

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.309
air so somebody said cool rapidly so
when you flick it I think you evaporate

00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319
when you flick it I think you evaporate
 

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:34.039
when you flick it I think you evaporate
the liquid out faster and it solidifies

00:47:34.039 --> 00:47:34.049
the liquid out faster and it solidifies
 

00:47:34.049 --> 00:47:36.470
the liquid out faster and it solidifies
faster if you go like this it doesn't

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480
faster if you go like this it doesn't
 

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.789
faster if you go like this it doesn't
evaporate so probably it's liquid when

00:47:37.789 --> 00:47:37.799
evaporate so probably it's liquid when
 

00:47:37.799 --> 00:47:41.079
evaporate so probably it's liquid when
it comes down if you don't flick it I

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:41.089
it comes down if you don't flick it I
 

00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:44.779
it comes down if you don't flick it I
think because as it cool so if I just

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:44.789
think because as it cool so if I just
 

00:47:44.789 --> 00:47:49.640
think because as it cool so if I just
take it and just move it so you're just

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:49.650
take it and just move it so you're just
 

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.230
take it and just move it so you're just
poured yeah and then it's just pouring

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240
poured yeah and then it's just pouring
 

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.329
poured yeah and then it's just pouring
so it's not really this like it's and

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339
so it's not really this like it's and
 

00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:54.349
so it's not really this like it's and
you move something so there's this

00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359
you move something so there's this
 

00:47:54.359 --> 00:47:55.549
you move something so there's this
wonderful thing experiment we've all

00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559
wonderful thing experiment we've all
 

00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:57.349
wonderful thing experiment we've all
done if you blow on a spoon that's hot

00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359
done if you blow on a spoon that's hot
 

00:47:57.359 --> 00:48:00.170
done if you blow on a spoon that's hot
it cools faster and if you let it and

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180
it cools faster and if you let it and
 

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.460
it cools faster and if you let it and
that's because it evaporated that you

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:01.470
that's because it evaporated that you
 

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.259
that's because it evaporated that you
carry the heat away fast yeah should

00:48:03.259 --> 00:48:03.269
carry the heat away fast yeah should
 

00:48:03.269 --> 00:48:06.829
carry the heat away fast yeah should
evaporates faster okay so should we so I

00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839
evaporates faster okay so should we so I
 

00:48:06.839 --> 00:48:08.120
evaporates faster okay so should we so I
think we should take more questions let

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:08.130
think we should take more questions let
 

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.009
think we should take more questions let
me propose several things first I think

00:48:10.009 --> 00:48:10.019
me propose several things first I think
 

00:48:10.019 --> 00:48:23.069
me propose several things first I think
we should all clap

00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079
 

00:48:23.079 --> 00:48:25.140
you
