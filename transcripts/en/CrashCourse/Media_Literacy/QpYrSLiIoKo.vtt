00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.540
Did you know Finding Dory made 486 million
dollars in 2016?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.880
Or that Barack and Michelle Obama received
65 million dollars in advance of writing their
newest books?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.400
Or that Beyonce made 105 million dollars in
2017?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.020
Those are the big bucks, people.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.300
Sure, media is a form of communication and
the foundation of our shared culture.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.810
But it’s more than a collection of songs
and books and movies and newspapers.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.610
It’s also a lot of money.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.120
The media is a big collection of massive,
money-making industries.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.040
That means most of the media you digest was
made by specific people with specific paychecks.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.340
And that money has a specific impact.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.540
Understanding how and why media is produced, the
business of it all, is key to the full media literacy picture.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.160
If last episode was about your mind on media,
today is all about your media on money.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:04.120
[Theme Music]

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.900
Pretend for a second you’re a superstar movie
director with a string of award-winning hits.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.520
Hollywood anxiously awaits your next film,
but you’re feeling the pressure.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.120
First you’ve got to land on idea – should it be an
original film? A remake? A sequel? About what?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.900
Who’s gonna write it? You? That woman
with the funny webseries you love? A studio hack
paid by the word?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.450
Speaking of studios, who are you going to
work with?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.740
Will they have a say in what you make, and
how it’s written? Or who’s in it?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.440
Then you’ve got to shoot the thing.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.880
Find the perfect cast, build all the sets or find
locations, pay the CGI company, hire a costume
designer, make sure the schedule runs on time.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.360
And then it’s not even over!
Hopefully a distributor will pick it up.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.630
Who will see it?
How will it be advertised?

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.240
Will your cast end up on every late night
show to promote it?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.380
That’s a lot of questions to answer.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.900
So instead of making decisions, you’re sitting
on your couch eating cereal and watching Scandal
reruns pretending your problems don’t exist.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.200
But you’re not a big-shot Hollywood director.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080
(Well if you are – hit me up in the DMs.)

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.140
Anyway: have you ever thought about how much
goes into a movie before it gets to your screen?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.060
Or before a video game gets to the store or
a newspaper onto your doorstep?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.840
Media is made.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.100
Every bit of it is constructed by someone,
or groups of someones.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.060
Each step of the way they’ve made choices,
too, about what to create and how to create it.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.060
And they’ve made those decisions based on
life experiences, preferences and money – who
has it, and how they can make more of it.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.720
But those choices affect you, the consumer.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.880
First, let’s focus on why media is created.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.640
Its purpose, like to entertain, inform or
persuade.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.840
The reason a piece of work is created can
be really helpful in understanding its impact.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.319
An advertisement’s purpose is to convince
the viewer to buy a product.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.180
You see an ad for soda, you know the
company created and paid for it in hopes
that you will buy their soda.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.640
Great, that’s an easy one.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.880
What about movies?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.780
You might say they’re made for entertainment,
duh. They’re for fun.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.020
And yes, movies are made to make money and
entertain.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.440
But if that was their only purpose, a lot more
movies would just be remakes of Titanic, the
greatest and most entertaining film of all time.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.440
Some movies are made to bring up important
topics and encourage cultural conversations.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.960
On the outside, Pixar’s Inside Out looks
like a film made to bring families together
through entertainment.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.060
But if you’ve seen Inside Out you know it’s really
a film designed to make you cry while contemplating
the complexity of human emotion,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.680
and how we’re all so different and yet the same.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
Or think about the film “Get Out.”

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.400
On one level, it’s a horror movie about a man
whose girlfriend’s family wants to kill him.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.200
But along the way, the film unpacks issues
of contemporary racism and how horrifying
the modern world can be to black men.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.100
Every piece of media has many purposes, and they
each impact how the work is made from day one.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.640
If purpose is the “why” of media creation,”
the “what” is focus.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.400
Focus is the topic or subject, what we’re
including (and at the same time excluding)
when we create.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.860
Sometimes deciding what to focus on is the
name of the game – like when a newspaper can
only fit so many stories on the front page.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.520
They’re deciding what news is the most important.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.160
But sometimes focus can be a bit more...manipulative.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.169
Like that soda ad you saw earlier; it didn’t
mention how much sugar each bottle contains
or how it will affect your health.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.780
It just wants you to think about that crisp,
refreshing taste.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.560
Or a government report that touts how many jobs were
created last month, but conveniently leaves out that
most of those jobs were low-paying, temporary ones.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.060
The thing is, the purpose and focus of media
can affect how you think about other people,
especially when they’re not like you.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.700
Let’s head into the Thought Bubble to wrestle
with that a bit.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.910
Media texts have the power to impact your
understanding of things like race, ethnicity, gender,
age, disability, or sexual orientation.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.800
The way they deal with and present these topics
is called representation.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.240
Like everything else, the way different people
and places are represented in media is always
a choice.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.440
And since the mass media is disproportionately
run and created by straight white men, that means
the representations of everyone else can skew
toward stereotype.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.960
Think about a pretty common TV trope, the
“gay BFF” stereotype.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.880
There’s Kurt and Blaine from Glee.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.200
Cameron from Modern Family, Justin from Ugly
Betty.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.600
Or, throwback, Jack McFarlan from Will &amp; Grace
and Stanford from Sex and the City.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.200
What do they all have in common?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.280
Well, as I mentioned, they’re gay men.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.010
They’re all the BFF to a major female character.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.640
Also, they’re all fashion-conscious, they
all love theater.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.700
Most of them have really broad personalities,
too.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.860
Weird how they’re all so...similar.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.380
Media representation of gay men has historically
skewed toward these stereotypical depictions, where
only one type of gay man is found on-screen.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.860
Our brains love familiar things since they’re
easier to understand.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:48.710
So why invest in shows written by and about
complex gay men or women, or LGBTQ people of
color, when you could save time and money by
lazily using stereotypes instead?

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.420
Plus, as a familiar stereotype, this representation
can be used in mainstream media without ruffling
too many conservative feathers.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.580
That means more viewers and more money.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.240
This is a big problem for diverse cultures
that have trouble understanding each other.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.020
When minority groups are frequently stereotyped in
the media, people may start to believe the associated
stereotype is even more true.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.600
They reinforce themselves.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.300
Paying attention to how different groups and
people are represented in the media is critical.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:23.520
Each representation is a choice made by the creator,
sometimes because of money, and they can be used
to positively or negatively impact how we think.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.700
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.200
Of course, every production choice isn’t part of
a grand scheme to sell more pop music or prevent
more women of color from directing films.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.300
The media is a nebulous group of individuals
all doing particular jobs.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:43.040
But there are people and systems at work within
the business of media that help block or perpetuate
certain stereotypes and ideologies.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.860
For instance, cultural theorist Stuart Hall
wrote about how racist ideologies are spread
through the media.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:57.060
He said, “It would be wrong and misleading to see
the media as uniformly and conspiratorially harnessed
to a single, racist conception of the world.”

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.360
The idea of “the media” monolith doesn’t
exist.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.400
If it’s not some grand conspiracy, how do
stereotypes and ideologies like these persist?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.520
That’s right, it’s money again.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.500
Who has it, and where they want to spend it.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.480
If you’ve ever posted on Tumblr or doodled
in a notebook, you were probably able to do
that for free.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.180
But somewhere along the way, someone had to pay for
your internet access and phone or a notebook and pen.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.720
Maybe you paid for it, or your parents did.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.060
But without that money, you couldn’t have
even doodled.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.680
All types of media creation require some kind
of money.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.940
The big, fancy, mass media kind, like publishing
a newspaper or making a movie, requires a lot.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.640
And not everyone has the money to create media.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.700
When you don’t have the money to create
media, sometimes you can get other people
to pay for you to create it.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.380
Like a patron or an investor.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.720
But because media creation costs money, and
not everyone has money, it’s most often done by
people who already have it.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.500
And those who have it often want to spend
it on people and things they already know
will make more money.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.200
How do they decide who to give it to?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.880
They consider who has experience making media
that makes money.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.080
And usually that’s people who have already
had the money to make media to make money.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.360
It’s a cycle that prevents different voices
from creating different kinds of media, keeping
cultural power in the hands of a few.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.640
Critical theorists Theodor Adorno and Max
Horkheimer believed that this closely held,
homogenous mass media was dangerous.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.140
“Culture today is infecting everything with
sameness” they wrote...in 1944.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:30.020
They thought that mass-produced popular
culture created for profit lulled consumers into
passive contentment.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.500
No matter your situation, you’d be happy as a
clam if you could access the easy entertainment
of pop culture.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:43.200
At the same time, it manufactured needs in the
audience – like I need to see this movie, I need
that brand of shampoo to be happy –

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.820
that could only be solved by buying more stuff.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.960
In many ways, social media has helped break this
cycle by lifting up diverse voices and challenging the
ways media is traditionally made.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.800
Social media campaigns have even
thrown the spotlight on negative or non-existent
representations in mass media.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.660
But the mega media players still tend to dominate
the scene.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.180
That’s not to say every creative decision
is based solely on money.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.930
Plenty of decisions are made for practical
reasons, or by people just doing mundane jobs.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.360
Each one may not seem like a big deal,
but when strung together they create all the
media we absorb.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.450
We spend most of our day with media, so it’s
crucial we understand what is created by who,
how, and for what reason.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:28.300
It’s almost as important as constantly reminding
each other that media is created.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.380
It didn’t just appear out of nowhere;
humans did that.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.720
And humans do some weird stuff, especially
for money.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:42.040
Next time on Crash Course Media Literacy
we’re talking about people who do it all for that
cold hard cash: advertisers.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.760
But until then, I’m Jay Smooth.
I’ll see you next time.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.100
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.780
It’s made with the help of all of these nice
people and our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.820
