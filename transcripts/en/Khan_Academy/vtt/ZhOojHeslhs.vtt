00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
- [Instructor] We're told to consider

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.830
the curve given by the equation.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.070
They give this equation.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.210
It can be shown that the
derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.610
is equal to this expression,
and you could figure that out

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.180
with just some implicit differentiation

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.160
and then solving for the
derivative of y with respect to x.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.900
We've done that in other videos.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.890
Write the equation of the horizontal line

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.960
that is tangent to the curve
and is above the x-axis.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
Pause this video, and see
if you can have a go at it.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.300
So let's just make sure
we're visualizing this right.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.250
So let me just draw a
quick and dirty diagram.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.800
If that's my y-axis, this is my x-axis.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.860
I don't know exactly what
that curve looks like,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.350
but imagine you have some type of a curve

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.630
that looks something like this.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.130
Well, there would be two tangent lines

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.560
that are horizontal based
on how I've drawn it.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.280
One might be right over there,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.660
so it might be like there.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.120
And then another one might
be maybe right over here.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.010
And they want the equation
of the horizontal line

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
that is tangent to the curve
and is above the x-axis.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.180
So what do we know?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.180
What is true if this
tangent line is horizontal?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.550
Well, that tells us that, at this point,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.500
dy/dx is equal to zero.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890
In fact, that would be true
at both of these points.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.940
And we know what dy/dx is.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.190
We know that the derivative
of y with respect to x

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.340
is equal to negative
two times x plus three

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.280
over four y to the third
power for any x and y.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.860
And so when will this equal zero?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.970
Well, it's going to equal
zero when our numerator

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.060
is equal to zero and
our denominator isn't.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.450
So when is our numerator going to be zero?

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.520
When x is equal to negative three.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.730
So when x is equal to negative three,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.850
the derivative is equal to zero.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.870
So what is going to be
the corresponding y value

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.780
when x is equal to negative three?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.650
And, if we know that, well, this equation

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.600
is just going to be y
is equal to something.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480
It's going to be that y value.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.550
Well, to figure that out,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.480
we just take this x equals negative three,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.600
substitute it back into
our original equation,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.230
and then solve for y.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.290
So let's do that.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.080
So it's going to be negative three squared

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.230
plus y to the fourth

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.180
plus six times negative
three is equal to seven.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.570
This is nine.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.750
This is negative 18.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.990
And so we're going to get y to the fourth

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.470
minus nine is equal to seven,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.380
or, adding nine to both sides,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.910
we get y to the fourth
power is equal to 16.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.930
And this would tell us that y is going

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.400
to be equal to plus or minus two.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.100
Well, there would be then
two horizontal lines.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.880
One would be y is equal to two.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.810
The other is y is equal to negative two.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.330
But they want us, the equation
of the horizontal line

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.550
that is tangent to the curve
and is above the x-axis,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.130
so only this one is going
to be above the x-axis.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.000
And we're done.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.033
It's going to be y is equal to two.
