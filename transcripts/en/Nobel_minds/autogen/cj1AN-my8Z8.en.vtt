exactly I think that the Nobel Center
should do that was something about the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
should do that was something about the

and say these are the challenges
societal change challenges we need to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
societal change challenges we need to
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260
societal change challenges we need to
address and how can we use both the

address and how can we use both the
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.429
address and how can we use both the
historical inventions but also make sure

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439
historical inventions but also make sure
 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.429
historical inventions but also make sure
everything we do now and in the future
