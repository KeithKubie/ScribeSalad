Mitchell:
Hi, everybody. Welcome.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the Geo fireside chat.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.501
Um, we have, uh, six--
six of us up here onstage--

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:12.501
um, we'll do intros
in a moment--

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.834
and there are various other
Google folks scattered around,

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.033
um, who can also
answer questions.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.167
So, um, uh,
I'll start with Peter.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.167
Birch: [laughs]

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.167
Yes, I'm Peter Birch.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.834
I'm the product manager
for the Google Earth API.

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:29.000
Mitchell: So my name's
Thor Mitchell.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.167
I'm the product manager for
the Maps API and the Places API.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.334
Raub: I'm Susannah Raub,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.167
and I am the tech lead
on the Maps API in Sydney.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.167
Madhavan: I'm Jayant Madhavan,

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:43.667
and I'm the tech lead
of the Fusion Tables team.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.667
Shapley: I'm Rebecca Shapley.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.167
I'm the product manager
for the Fusion Tables team.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.167
Chu: And I'm Dan Chu.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.334
I'm product manager for
our Geo Enterprise products.

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.334
Mitchell: So, uh, we were asked

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:59.334
just to give a-a sort of
brief 30-second summary of, um,

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.334
recent announcements,
stuff that's going on,

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.334
just to provide some context,

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:06.334
uh, and then we'll, uh,

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:08.667
we'll just move into
a sort of town hall-style Q&amp;A.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.834
Um, so on the Maps API side,

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.834
um, our big announcement
was yesterday morning.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:17.501
Uh, we opened up the Places API
for general availability,

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.834
so anybody can go and, uh,
and sign up for a key for that,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.834
and we also integrated, um,
Places into the Maps API,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.667
so there are now, uh,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:27.834
features in the Maps API
for searching for businesses,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:31.334
and also, um, integrated
the Autocomplete functionality

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.501
that is on
the Google Maps Web site

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.167
into the Maps API,

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:37.834
so you can now attach that, um,
to any text field on a Web page

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.167
and get suggestions of--of
addresses and of businesses

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.000
as you type.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.434
Um, uh, yeah.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.667
Shapley: Um,
so with Fusion Tables,

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.834
we actually had, uh,
two exciting announcements,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.834
one with the Maps API.

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.834
Um, you can now
do dynamic styling

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.000
as you use the data
from your Fusion Table

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.501
in a Fusion Tables layer
of the Maps API.

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.000
You can now request that
that data be styled.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.501
Uh, you can change
the color of the polygons

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.501
or--or set the icon for
the points and things like that.

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.667
And you can do that dynamically
in your--in your Web page.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:19.501
And we are also,
at the same time,

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:21.834
uh, opening
for our trusted testers

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.000
the ability to set the style,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.334
uh, and the info window template

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:30.167
for a given table
through, uh, programmatically.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.501
So that means that
if you're sort of preparing

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.834
a number of tables
to have the same--

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.834
to have the same look and feel,

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.667
that'll be easier now.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.000
Birch: Uh, so on
the Earth side, um,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.167
one thing I want to announce
is that--

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:46.501
so last year we were here
talking about how many people

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.501
actually have
the plug-in installed,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:51.501
and we talked about, uh,
100 million computers out there

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:53.834
that, you know, had already
had the plug-in installed.

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.000
Uh, this year, uh,
I'm proud to announce

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.167
that there's now 150 million,
um, installs.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.167
So that basically means that,

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.167
you know,
150 million computers out there

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.167
already have
the plug-in installed, you know.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:07.167
And all the--although
the install flow

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:09.000
is very straightforward,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.167
um, for many of the users,
especially the ones

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:13.167
who are gonna be, you know,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.334
more likely to be using Earth
and Earth API,

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:17.501
um, it's already gonna be
installed there for you.

00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:19.501
Um, the other thing
I should mention

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:21.667
is that, um, that's new
since last year

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.667
is that we now have a v3, um,
extension library,

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:26.834
so if that's kind of
one of those things

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:29.834
that was--was holding you back
from moving over to v3

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.167
or, uh, you know,
sort of part of your factor

00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:34.167
in--in doing a v3,

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:38.167
that's something that, uh,
we're now supporting.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.501
Mitchell: Okay, so--oh, yeah.

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.667
Chu: Yeah, I should probably
just quickly mention.

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.834
Well, this was announced
at Where 2.0.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.834
One of the biggest things--
announcements

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:48.834
that we're excited about
is Earth Builder,

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:51.834
um, a great kind of
in-the-cloud way of kind of, um,

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.834
uploading and styling your, um,
map and vector and imagery data.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.000
Um, and then also in terms of--

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.434
if we're looking kind of over
the course of the last year--

00:04:00.434 --> 00:04:03.000
um, one of the exciting
partnerships we also had

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
with the Fusion Tables team

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
was, um, for
the Maps API Premier,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.834
enabling kind of private,
uh, Fusion Tables layers,

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.701
uh, to be displayed.

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.834
So for many of you
who are familiar

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:15.501
with Fusion Tables layer,

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:17.667
quickly being able to display
data that you've stored

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.334
in a Fusion Table onto
an easy layer in the Maps API,

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:23.167
being able to have that
completely be private, uh,

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.501
as a Premier customer.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:29.834
Mitchell: Okay, so we have
two microphones in the room.

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.834
We have a stand-up mic there,

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.000
and then we have
a roving mic here.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Um, this session
is being recorded,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.667
so, um, please be aware of that
when you're asking questions,

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.167
and also please do wait
for the mic to arrive

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:43.667
before you start asking
your question.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.834
Um...

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:48.501
man: So, um, if you're gonna ask
a question at that mic,

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:51.167
please just try and line up
directly behind that mic

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:53.834
so you're out of line of sight
of the--of the camera.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.667
Mitchell: Yeah.

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.501
Okay, and with that...

00:04:57.501 --> 00:04:59.501
Birch: Who's first?
Mitchell: [laughs]

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:01.334
man: I'm first.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.000
Um, Fusion Tables--

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
um, I have a bunch of data

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.167
that I'd like to get out
on Fusion Tables

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:09.667
and get out to a map
and get it out to the public,

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:12.000
but I really don't want
the public

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.834
to get access
to the underlying data sets.

00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:19.334
Um, should I be concerned
or not?

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:21.834
I'm--I'm not quite sure
what's going on there.

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:24.000
Chu: Well, you should be
concerned because we--

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we have a solution for you,
right.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.167
It's the, uh, the private
Fusion Tables layer.

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.501
We heard that feedback
from a lot of folks, right,

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:32.834
uh, that there's
a kind of balance in terms of

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:35.334
kind of how much access you want
others to have to your data.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:37.501
So, uh, with the--I guess
just to elaborate

00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:40.334
on the private Fusion Tables
layer, um, you can--

00:05:40.334 --> 00:05:42.834
it sounds like you're already
familiar with the ability

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:45.667
to kind of quickly, you know,
reference your Fusion Table

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:47.667
and be able to display that.

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.667
In the past, you were--

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.701
you were basically referring
to the requirement

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.000
to make that table either public
or, um, kind of protected.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Um, now if you are,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
along with Maps API Premier,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
all you--there's basically
a dialog within Fusion Tables.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You can input your client ID,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.334
which is kind of the key
that you're given as you--

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.834
when you sign up as
a Maps API Premier customer,

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:11.667
um, and then that allows you
to leave that table as private,

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.167
um, but still enjoy the benefits
of the Fusion Tables layer.

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.334
man: Okay, thank you.

00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:21.000
man: Uh, my question is
kind of a follow-up to his.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.534
Um, there--there are customers
that need to operate

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.667
in completely
disconnected networks,

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:29.000
but a lot of the technologies
that you guys

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.334
have been showcasing
is very, very exciting.

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:33.501
Is there any
kind of plans whatsoever

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.501
to introduce maybe
some of this technology,

00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:37.501
with the Google Earth
Enterprise team,

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:39.501
um, bring some of these,
you know,

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:42.167
KML rendering especially,
to the Maps API

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.667
or, uh, Fusion Tables to--
on a smaller scale

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.667
to an Enterprise deployment

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.000
that needs to be completely
disconnected from the Web

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
on--on an internal network,
per se?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Birch: Um, so I'll take that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.834
So, I mean, absolutely.

00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:59.200
I think there's a very
long history of, you know,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.667
a lot of our customers,
especially Enterprise customers,

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.167
wanting to be able to work
in a disconnected environment.

00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:06.501
And, you know, with the existing

00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.834
Google Earth Enterprise
Earth client, uh,

00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:11.000
that's completely
possible today.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Um, but with--

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.167
as the thing that Dan mentioned
with Earth Builder,

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:17.167
um, we're really starting

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.667
to bring a lot of these services
to the cloud and allow people

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:22.000
to kind of upload and connect
and serve that way.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.501
But we also recognize the fact
that, you know,

00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:27.334
some number of customers
are gonna want to also be able

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:30.501
to have a disconnected
experience like that.

00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.501
So we don't have
anything specific

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.834
to announce right now on that,
but that is something

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.000
that we're definitely, you know,
very interested in,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.167
and hopefully we'll have
more to talk about.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.834
man: Okay. Thank you.

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.834
Birch: Do you want
to add anything?

00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:45.167
Chu: I guess at the risk
of saying too much.

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.501
I would say, like, there's
probably two responses to that,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.834
is continued kind of innovation
on the Earth Enterprise side,

00:07:49.834 --> 00:07:52.000
like we are kind of continuing
to invest there

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and kind of adding
functionality there.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.334
Like Peter mentioned, it's--
there's some challenges, right,

00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:58.334
with a completely
disconnected environment.

00:07:58.334 --> 00:08:00.434
I think some things
that we've been brainstorming

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:02.667
is kind of like an intermediate
solution, really.

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:05.000
It's kind of more, um,
a solution that allows you

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to be disconnected
most of the time

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.334
but still connect to the cloud
every once in a while.

00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:11.334
And, um, that's, you know,

00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:13.334
that's something we've been
brainstorming about,

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:16.267
not at all kind of
right around the corner yet.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.667
man: Hi.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.501
I wanted to ask a question
about Street View in v3.

00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:28.667
I think this question
comes up a lot.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.667
It's not quite as nice yet,

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:33.000
and I understand people
are hard at work on it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.167
Um, but I've also heard
that the plan

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:37.167
is never to restore
the Flash client,

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.167
and I wonder if that means

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:41.334
that IE will be stuck
in the ghetto forever.

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:43.334
It's never gonna get WebGL.

00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:45.501
Maybe it'll have WebGL
in IE 10.

00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:47.667
But I'm gonna call that "never."
[laughs]

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.667
You know, IE 9 doesn't have it,

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.834
and IE 8 doesn't have
good Canvas support.

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:54.334
Is IE ever going to get good
Street View from Google Maps v3,

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:56.667
and how would that ever happen?

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.834
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]

00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:01.667
Mitchell: I'm inclined to say
that's a question for Microsoft.

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:03.834
But... [laughs]
man: But it's not.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.667
I mean, v2 has great
Street View support in IE.

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:09.000
Mitchell: So we--we made

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
a-a conscious and carefully
considered decision

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that we did not want to maintain

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
two independent
Street View implementations,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.834
um, because--at least
within the API--

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:22.834
because we wanted to--

00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:24.834
we felt that in Maps API v2

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:26.834
where we inherited
the Street View client

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.834
used by the Google Maps Web site

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.834
that we were, um,
somewhat constrained

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:33.167
in terms of the features
we could offer in the API

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:35.501
and that, in a sense, um,

00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:37.501
the Street View implementation
in v2

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.834
was more a question of embedding
a Street View in a page

00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:41.667
rather than actually, um,

00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:44.033
building a full-blown
API experience.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:46.000
And one of the things

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.167
that was obviously missing
from v2 Street View

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:50.501
was you couldn't place a marker
a Street View, right?

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:52.667
You couldn't provided custom
imagery in a Street View.

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:54.667
Now if you think
of this in--in--

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.834
if you think of
the parallel in Maps,

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:58.834
where would the Maps API be

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:01.167
if you couldn't put
a marker on a map, right?

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.000
It was so fundamental.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.334
Um, and you know,
as a team, uh, we, um,

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:07.501
you know, we--we're focused on
JavaScript development,

00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:10.334
um, and we felt like

00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:12.667
to achieve the kind of things
we wanted to do

00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:15.000
and be able to meet
the cross-platform, you know,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.834
commitments we've made,

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:19.167
and particularly to deliver
across all the mobile devices,

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:21.334
which was a big focus of v3,

00:10:21.334 --> 00:10:23.834
we had to do--
we had to sort of,

00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:27.167
um, take jump
to a Web-based solution.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:31.000
Now what's--what's,
you know, difficult

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.501
is obviously right now, um,

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:35.834
HTML doesn't give you
quite the same degree

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:39.000
of kind of graphical,
um, fluidity

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.167
that you would--you know, that
people are used to in--in Flash,

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:44.167
and you know, WebGL

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.501
is certainly our--
our great white hope for that.

00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:49.667
Um, I don't imagine that,

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.701
um, we will--

00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:53.667
uh, you're correct to say

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:56.000
that we don't have any plans
to resurrect the Flash API.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I think, um,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.667
we've seen, you know, a small
amount of demand for that

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.834
but certainly not enough
to justify

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.834
what would be
a significant effort

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.167
in terms of, um,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.334
both skill set,
you know, resourcing,

00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:13.000
um, maintain the two things,
keeping them in sync,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.667
meaning that whenever we want
to introduce one new feature

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:17.667
we have to re-implement it

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.000
in two, you know,
twice in different ways.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.167
Um, my hope is, um,

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:24.667
that WebGL will gain
a significant degree of momentum

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.834
that Microsoft, um, do feel

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.000
it would be worth
implementing it in IE.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.667
man: 10.
Mitchell: Sorry?

00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:33.167
man: In IE 10.
Mitchell: Yes, in IE 10.

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:36.834
Um, so in the meantime,

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.834
I think, um, you know,

00:11:38.834 --> 00:11:41.501
there are things we can look
at doing to, um, potential--

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.834
to potentially improve
the experience in IE 9.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:46.667
One, um, thing also we can do

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:49.501
is, um, we can improve
the experience

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.501
using Canvas
to a limited extent,

00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:53.501
and IE 9 does have
Canvas support.

00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.667
And some of--of our first,
uh, implementations

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.334
of HTML Street View

00:11:57.334 --> 00:12:00.000
were Canvas-based
rather than, um, WebGL-based,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
so there is some hope there

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.167
that we can, um, at least
improve the experience,

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:06.334
if not make it as good as WebGL.

00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:08.667
But to a certain extent
I also feel like, um,

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:12.167
just from
a-a technical perspective,

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:14.501
as a company we look
to drive the Web forward,

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:18.167
and, um, there's a limit to
the amount of which I want to--

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.334
or I'm comfortable
sort of pandering

00:12:20.334 --> 00:12:23.334
to, um, data technology, right.

00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:26.334
I'd like to--I'd like to be part
of the movement

00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:28.667
to push the Web forward.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.200
And if we can make
a case for, um,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.334
if we can make the case
for WebGL stronger,

00:12:33.334 --> 00:12:35.667
um, then I think, you know,
I'd like to do that.

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.501
man: Uh, well, then
I guess my last question is,

00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.834
the Web site is currently
using the Flash version.

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:42.501
This is awkward.

00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:44.834
I feel like Google hasn't made
that decision very consistently

00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:46.834
that, you know,
if the right decision

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:49.000
for Google Maps's Web Site
is to use Flash,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.334
isn't the right decision for
my Web site also to use Flash?

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:55.667
Mitchell: So this comes back
down to the, um,

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:57.834
you know, the question,
as I mentioned,

00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:00.000
of what do you expect of an API

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.501
versus what--what do you expect
of the Web site,

00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:04.667
and um,

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:07.501
clearly the, uh,

00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:10.334
the focus for the Web site
has been, up to now,

00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:14.167
um, you know,
just broad availability, right.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:16.501
Um...
man: I want broad availability.

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:18.167
Mitchell: Sure. Sure.

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:21.167
But at the same time, you know,
we don't feel like we can offer

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.834
the features we want to offer,
um, in the API

00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:26.167
and deliver what is actually
a, you know, an experience

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:28.000
that allows you to do

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.167
flexible and interesting
and new and creative things

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:32.501
that aren't just dropping
a Street View into a page,

00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:35.000
um, if we stick with,
um, with the Flash-based client.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.501
So I think that, um,

00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:40.667
I-I--the--the Flash-based client

00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:42.834
used by the Web site,

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:45.667
um, is essentially,
um, frozen now,

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.334
um, and I think that, uh,

00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:52.334
it is--it's inevitable that
at some point that will change,

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:54.334
um, and in a sense

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.667
we are just a little ahead
of the curve there.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:59.100
man: Thank you.

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.501
man: Hi, guys.

00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:06.834
Thanks for taking the time
to come talk to all of us.

00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:08.834
I actually have
a bunch of questions,

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.200
so I'm going to periodically
step away from the microphone

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.167
so other people can talk.
[laughter]

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.334
man: Um, but, uh,
all of my questions

00:14:15.334 --> 00:14:17.334
are pretty much regarding
the Places API,

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:19.501
so the rest of you
can take a nap

00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:21.667
or drink some water
if you'd like.

00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:24.000
Um, first of all, I noticed that
there was a mention that--

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.167
and there's API support
for check-ins on the--

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:28.167
the Places API,

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.334
and that that information
is used for ranking.

00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:32.167
And I was curious

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:34.501
if you could get
into a little bit more detail

00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:36.501
as to, uh,
that check-in functionality

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.667
as well as what
other services are feeding

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:42.267
that check-in information into
the ranking of the Places API.

00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:47.000
Mitchell: So right now

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.834
the--the check-in service
that Places API has

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.667
is essentially a way

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:54.834
that developers
can signal check-ins to us

00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:56.834
in order for us to factor that

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:58.834
into the rankings
we deliver to them.

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:01.000
man: Mm-hmm.
Mitchell: Um, it is unrelated

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.167
to, for example,
the check-in feature

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:05.334
that was recently introduced
in Latitude,

00:15:05.334 --> 00:15:07.434
um, because the check-in feature
in Latitude

00:15:07.434 --> 00:15:09.501
is associated with
individual Google accounts

00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.834
rather than specific API
developers or API applications.

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.000
Um, I--

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.667
right now, um, if you--

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:21.167
if we have no, um,
if we have no check-ins,

00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:23.167
like, if you haven't
submitted check-ins

00:15:23.167 --> 00:15:25.167
or a relatively low volume
of check-ins

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:27.167
through the Places API,

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:29.334
your rank is based
purely on the same algorithm

00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:31.334
that's used for Google Maps,

00:15:31.334 --> 00:15:33.334
and that algorithm is, um, uh,

00:15:33.334 --> 00:15:35.501
takes signals from
a wide variety of sources,

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.834
and, um, you know, check-ins
are one such source.

00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:39.667
So, um, there--

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.834
we do expect that you'll get
reasonable ranking

00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:43.834
that will actually
be well-suited

00:15:43.834 --> 00:15:45.667
to check-in applications

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:47.667
even without providing
check-in signals,

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.000
but it will be sort of
a generic check-in ranking.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It won't be specific
to your application.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.834
So if your application

00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:56.000
is targeting a very specific
type of business,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.501
um, you won't necessarily see
those types of business

00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:00.767
prioritized over others,
which is what you will see

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:04.334
if you, um, if you submit
those check-in signals to us.

00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:07.000
man: And I think the tail end
of that question is--

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.501
there are obviously a number of
Google or Google-backed services

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.501
that do offer
check-in functionality.

00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:14.334
Are those check-ins flowing
into the Places API,

00:16:14.334 --> 00:16:16.667
or is the Places API
only going to use check-ins

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.501
that are explicitly made
through the Places API?

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:22.834
Mitchell: The--the
check-in-based ranking we do

00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.834
is per application.

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:26.834
So, um, we don't--

00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:28.834
we don't aggregate check-ins
across applications

00:16:28.834 --> 00:16:30.834
because we don't want
one rogue application

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:32.834
to be able to gain...
man: Mm-hmm.

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:34.834
Mitchell:
the ranking algorithm.

00:16:34.834 --> 00:16:37.000
So, um, the--the ranking--

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the re-ranking you'll see we do

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
is based purely on the check-ins
that you have submitted to us.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
man: Okay.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.667
Though there is some--I think
you just mentioned also earlier

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.167
that there is some level
of global check-in data

00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:51.000
that was used, right?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.334
Mitchell: The--there is, um,

00:16:53.334 --> 00:16:56.501
so Google has a check-in product
built into Latitude...

00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:58.200
man: Mm-hmm.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.601
Mitchell: and that is available
across all Android devices now--

00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:03.167
it comes as part of Google Maps
and Google Places on Android--

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:05.501
Um, and that is generating,
you know, check-in information

00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:08.667
that Google uses
as a-a ranking signal

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:10.834
for its sort of--
for the ranking algorithm

00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:13.000
used across all of its products.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.167
Um, it's, um, so essentially

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.334
it's just part of
this broader ranking scheme

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:19.501
that takes in all number
of different signals.

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.167
So, um, it's not--
it's also not--

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.167
man: So Latitude check-ins
are for Google.

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:26.167
Mitchell: I should mention,
though, that the--

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:28.167
that ranking algorithm
is not real time

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:30.334
in the same way
that Places API are.

00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:32.367
So we take ranking signals
from Latitude

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:34.667
and various other sources,
and we take them in aggregate

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:36.667
to figure out
which places are popular,

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.167
but we don't do things like, um,
figure out that there's been

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:41.667
a sudden increase in check-in
signals from that service.

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:44.000
It helps us to understand
which bars are popular

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.667
compared to other bars,

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:47.667
but it doesn't help us
understand

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:49.834
that a game has just started
at the ballpark,

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.000
which is what
the Places API can do.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.167
man: Okay, so Places API
is a real time--

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.167
Places API check-ins
are real time

00:17:56.167 --> 00:17:58.167
affect the ranking
of your services...

00:17:58.167 --> 00:18:00.100
Mitchell: Yes.
man: whereas in services

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.334
like Latitude,
and I don't know it Hot--

00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:04.667
I guess that is now part--
Latitude and Hotpot are one.

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:07.000
SCVNGR--do those also flow into,
like, this global ranking

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
even though it's not real time?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.167
Mitchell: No, because SCVNGR
are a Places API partner,

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.334
so their ranking--their check-in
signals will only affect

00:18:13.334 --> 00:18:15.334
the ranking
of their own application.

00:18:15.334 --> 00:18:17.934
man: Okay. Great.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:22.667
man: Thank you
for being here, guys.

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:25.000
Um, this question

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.334
wasn't answered by your team
last year or the year before,

00:18:28.334 --> 00:18:30.501
but maybe this year
you guys can answer it.

00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:32.501
Um, I'm a GWT user,

00:18:32.501 --> 00:18:34.667
and, um, I'm stuck in v2

00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:38.534
because, um, there haven't been
bindings programmed

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:42.167
by the Google team for v3,

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:45.501
and we received word
from the GWT guys

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:47.501
who had done it previously

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:49.501
hat they probably
wouldn't be doing it

00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.501
and don't expect it to happen.

00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:53.667
I'm wondering if maybe
you guys will reconsider,

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.000
since I'm stuck in v2...
[laughs]

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.667
or you can at least
impress upon the GWT team,

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.667
the guys who are doing
the GWT Google API stuff,

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:05.167
to move on that.

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:08.334
Raub: I would say put a feature
request on the issue tracker,

00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:11.000
'cause that's our best way to
track interest in these things,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.033
and it's certainly something
that is possible,

00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:15.167
and so if we see that
there's great interest,

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:17.667
we can prioritize that.

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:19.834
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:21.834
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]
Okay.

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:23.834
Well, then we're taking that
into consideration.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:25.834
man: [laughs]
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:28.667
man: [laughs]

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.834
man: Okay, question number two--

00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:33.167
um, I'll start with, uh,
probably a stupid one.

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:35.334
So I'm sorry, I did miss
the announcement yesterday,

00:19:35.334 --> 00:19:37.167
so I may ask questions

00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:39.334
that you answered already
earlier at this conference.

00:19:39.334 --> 00:19:41.501
But there was a mentioning
of listings providers.

00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:43.501
I was wondering--
it's sort of like

00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:45.701
a throwaway sentence at
the bottom of the requirements,

00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:47.667
like, you will need
to show that.

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:49.834
Could you go into
a little bit more detail

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:51.834
as to who
the listing partners are

00:19:51.834 --> 00:19:54.501
and what kind of data consumers
of the API will need to display?

00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:57.167
Mitchell: If I were to, uh,

00:19:57.167 --> 00:19:59.501
give you the complete list
of listing partners,

00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:02.334
we would probably
run out of time. [laughs]

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:04.501
man: So these are people--
these are companies

00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:06.834
that you've received listing
information from, I believe...

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:08.834
Mitchell: Right. So--
man: So it's not

00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:10.834
like advertising
or a monetization strategy.

00:20:10.834 --> 00:20:13.000
Mitchell: So we--we license, um,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
uh, we license
local listings data

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.834
from an extremely large number
of sources globally.

00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:21.000
Um, one of the things that, uh,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.334
we see as a-a key strength
with this API

00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:26.334
is--is our global coverage,

00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:28.667
and so to achieve that, um,
we have to work with

00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:31.000
a very large number of partners
around the world.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.834
Um, in some cases
those partnerships, um,

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:38.667
uh, require that
attribution is shown

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:41.667
for the companies concerned
when their data is used,

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:44.000
um, and to assist
in--in doing this

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.834
we provide
that attribution string

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:49.334
with the place search results
in those cases.

00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:51.334
Now this isn't always the case.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.667
In the U.S., for example,
it's not the case,

00:20:53.667 --> 00:20:56.167
but it is the case in the U.K.
and Canada and Australia.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:59.334
Um, so we would deliver that
as an HTML string that contains

00:20:59.334 --> 00:21:02.000
the wording, um, "agreed"
and a link to their site,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.167
um, and we just ask
that developers include

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:06.334
that sort of--
you know, for example,

00:21:06.334 --> 00:21:09.667
at the bottom of the listings,
um, just underneath,

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:11.667
um, in a similar way

00:21:11.667 --> 00:21:14.601
that you have the copyrights
at the bottom of a Google Map.

00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:18.834
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:21.167
man: Go ahead.
I don't want to dominate.

00:21:21.167 --> 00:21:23.167
man: I don't either. [laughs]

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:27.167
Um, so with polygon feature--

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:29.667
or polygon editing, um,

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:32.167
we can edit the outer boundary

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.667
but not any interior boundaries.

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:37.000
I'm wondering
if that's on your radar

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.434
to allow editing of holes
within a polygon.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Raub: When a hole
already exists,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.334
or when, like,
when it's a solid polygon,

00:21:48.334 --> 00:21:50.334
and you want to add a hole?

00:21:50.334 --> 00:21:53.000
man: Um, okay, make this
a 2-part question. [laughs]

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Raub: [laughs] Or both.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.501
man: Yeah, let's start with--
with whether one already exists.

00:21:57.501 --> 00:22:00.667
Raub: Um, so we don't have
poly editing yet

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:03.334
in the v3 API,

00:22:03.334 --> 00:22:06.667
um, but I assure you that if
you have a hole in the middle--

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:09.167
when we do have the feature, if
you have a hole in the middle,

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:11.334
you'll be able to edit
those points as well.

00:22:11.334 --> 00:22:13.334
In terms of adding a hole,

00:22:13.334 --> 00:22:15.334
I'd say it's not
something that--

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.334
that I haven't thought through
such things,

00:22:17.334 --> 00:22:19.334
how you would
do that necessarily.

00:22:19.334 --> 00:22:22.834
Um... maybe.

00:22:22.834 --> 00:22:25.167
Do you have another...

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:27.334
Mitchell: Yeah, um,
also it's worth mentioning,

00:22:27.334 --> 00:22:29.334
we have, um, stated publicly

00:22:29.334 --> 00:22:31.334
we are working on
poly line editing,

00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:34.667
um, and so it should be coming
fairly soon.

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:37.167
I think, um, when you look
at the list of v2 features

00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:39.334
that we want to bring forward
to v3

00:22:39.334 --> 00:22:41.667
and the things that are stopping
people from moving v3,

00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:43.667
that's one of last
remaining things.

00:22:43.667 --> 00:22:46.167
Um, I'm certainly open

00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:48.667
to--to looking into ways
we can do, you know,

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.667
we can implement adding holes.

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.000
My initial instinctive

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
not-very-carefully-
thought-through concern

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
is that users
wouldn't necessarily

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
expect to be able to do that,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.100
and so it might be hard to make
it discoverable as a feature.

00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:08.834
Birch: Just a general comment.

00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:11.167
This is a chat, so you know,
if you're here,

00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:13.167
um, if you have questions,

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:15.501
you want to learn a little bit
more about our APIs,

00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:17.834
this is a really great chance
for you to come up

00:23:17.834 --> 00:23:20.000
and, you know, there's no, uh,
too stupid question

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
or too hard a question.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.167
You know, we'll do
our best to answer it.

00:23:24.167 --> 00:23:26.334
But please take advantage
of the time to ask

00:23:26.334 --> 00:23:28.334
about kind of our products.

00:23:28.334 --> 00:23:30.501
Just real quick question--
how many people here

00:23:30.501 --> 00:23:32.667
have actually used Fusion Tables
in a site?

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:34.667
Wow. That's great.

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:38.167
Um, how about, um, v3?

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:41.501
How many people have
actually developed in v3?

00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:45.334
And then, how about--
are you still using v2?

00:23:45.334 --> 00:23:47.167
Okay.

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:50.501
Uh, how about Earth API?
All right. Great.

00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:53.501
[laughter]

00:23:53.501 --> 00:23:55.501
Birch: Yeah, um, okay, great.

00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:57.501
Let me guess,
more Places questions.

00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.501
man: Yeah, well,
actually I should--

00:23:59.501 --> 00:24:01.667
I forgot to say this
at the beginning.

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.834
But congratulations
on launch of the Places API.

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.501
It looks fantastic,

00:24:05.501 --> 00:24:07.834
and it's going to be
a great resource for, I think,

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:09.501
a lot of developers.

00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.834
So just wanted to make sure that
that was clear.

00:24:11.834 --> 00:24:14.000
And I just had all these
very targeted questions.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Um, so part of the Places API

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.167
is also the ability
to filter in categories,

00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:20.501
and I was curious where that
category information came from,

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.501
if that came from
the listings providers,

00:24:22.501 --> 00:24:24.667
or if that was generated
by the Google system

00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:26.667
and how that involves over time.

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:28.834
Mitchell: Um, it was actually
a significant effort, um,

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.000
that was not done
by the API team

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
but done by another team
at Google,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.501
um, to decide on a, um,

00:24:35.501 --> 00:24:38.667
a single consistent
worldwide category scheme,

00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:42.501
um, and then map all of
the disparate category schemes

00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:44.834
from all over the different
data files we work with

00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:46.667
onto that category scheme.

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:48.834
So it is a, um,
a Google-specific scheme,

00:24:48.834 --> 00:24:52.334
but, um, it--it's one
that has had a, you know,

00:24:52.334 --> 00:24:56.334
a lot of thought, a lot of time,
a lot of effort put into it.

00:24:56.334 --> 00:24:58.334
man: We have a question
over here.

00:24:58.334 --> 00:25:00.267
man: Hi, guys.

00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:03.000
I was wondering if you would,
uh, consider, uh,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.667
allowing people
on using the Maps API

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:08.667
in JavaScript or in Android

00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:11.834
to control caching of map tiles

00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:14.167
so that we could save,
uh, regions

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:16.601
that we knew we would want.

00:25:19.033 --> 00:25:21.834
[laughter]

00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:24.834
Mitchell: Um, I believe

00:25:24.834 --> 00:25:27.334
there is an open issue
requesting--

00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:29.501
requesting offline caching.

00:25:29.501 --> 00:25:31.667
It's something that
we're aware would be useful

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:33.667
particularly on mobile
and particularly in places

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.834
where the network
is perhaps not as reliable

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:38.334
as we would like it to be
or not always available.

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:41.334
There are very specific, um,

00:25:41.334 --> 00:25:43.501
sort of
licensing considerations around

00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:45.834
that we need to be careful
to protect.

00:25:45.834 --> 00:25:48.501
So we can't provide
a-a mechanism

00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:50.501
by which you could, um,

00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.534
aggregate, you know,
large volumes of tiles

00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:54.501
and use them outside
of the application.

00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:57.167
So if we can find a way to allow
you to pre-cache tiles

00:25:57.167 --> 00:26:00.601
such that they are,
um, you know,

00:26:00.601 --> 00:26:03.834
um, you're restricted to using
them within the application

00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:05.834
in which they were cached,

00:26:05.834 --> 00:26:07.834
then it's something
that we could,

00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:09.834
you know, we can look
into doing.

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:12.000
But it's not something,
to be honest with you,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.501
it's not something that we have
done a lot of work on yet.

00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:17.501
I think, uh, if--
as Susannah says,

00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.667
you know, a lot of what we do

00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:22.334
is driven by the amount
of interest we see on the group

00:26:22.334 --> 00:26:24.334
and the issue tracker
for specific things.

00:26:24.334 --> 00:26:26.334
Um, so I would say
definitely, um,

00:26:26.334 --> 00:26:28.334
register your interest in that,

00:26:28.334 --> 00:26:30.667
and if it bubbles up,
then it will, you know,

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:33.501
we will prioritize it
accordingly.

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:36.000
man: Uh, I have a nicer question
I hope this time.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
[laughter]
man: Uh, the, uh,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.334
so I--you made some remarks
about, you know,

00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:43.501
one of the few remaining issues
that keep people on v2.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.667
Uh, I wanted to hear
your thoughts

00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:47.834
on what the current
top priorities are,

00:26:47.834 --> 00:26:50.667
what people are saying about
why they can't move to v3.

00:26:50.667 --> 00:26:53.000
You might guess for us
it's Street View,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.767
but I'm curious to hear what it
is in your minds and priorities.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:02.000
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.167
Mitchell: Yeah, Susannah
makes a good point,

00:27:04.167 --> 00:27:06.334
which is that you're--
the people in this room

00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:08.667
are probably in a better
position to say than--than me.

00:27:08.667 --> 00:27:11.834
We--we saw throughout
last year--

00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:14.334
you know, when we did the--
the graduation announcement

00:27:14.334 --> 00:27:16.334
last year at Google I/O,

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:18.501
there were certainly, um,
a reasonable number of people

00:27:18.501 --> 00:27:20.667
who felt that, um,

00:27:20.667 --> 00:27:22.667
who were disappointed to find

00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:25.167
that the features they needed
to migrate were not ready yet,

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:27.834
and it was--it was
a difficult decision.

00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:30.834
Do we wait until every single
feature is implemented,

00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:33.033
or do we only wait
until the majority--

00:27:33.033 --> 00:27:35.167
the features used
by the majority of sites

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:37.167
are implemented?

00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:39.501
Um, and we chose to--to go
for the latter route

00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:41.834
just because we--we were keen
to get that process started,

00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:44.167
to get people thinking about v3
and interested in v3

00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:46.167
and working towards it.

00:27:46.167 --> 00:27:48.501
Um, and since then we've been
trying to tick off,

00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:50.501
you know, one thing
after another,

00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:53.334
um, and I think we've made
a lot of good progress there.

00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:56.334
Um, you know,
the 45-degree imagery launch

00:27:56.334 --> 00:27:58.667
was one of them, for example,
a fairly recent one that...

00:27:58.667 --> 00:28:00.767
man: Awesome. Thank you.
Mitchell: Yeah, that

00:28:00.767 --> 00:28:03.167
was definitely something
that we were keen to get done.

00:28:03.167 --> 00:28:05.167
Um, I'm trying to think.

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:07.501
There was a bunch of things
that fell into this category.

00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:09.501
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]
Mitchell: Yeah.

00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:11.167
Raub: Travel directions.

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:13.334
Mitchell: Travel directions
wasn't in v2, was it? Yeah.

00:28:13.334 --> 00:28:15.334
So, um, so poly licensing
certainly is--is

00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:17.501
the one, the--sort of
the one big one,

00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:19.501
if you like, that I see.

00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:21.167
Um, hang on.

00:28:21.167 --> 00:28:23.501
And, um, there are a few things
I should mention, though,

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:25.501
that will never come into v3,

00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:27.834
and that's mostly things that
were sort of utility classes

00:28:27.834 --> 00:28:29.834
and things that we had in v2

00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.834
because back when
v2 was launched

00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:33.834
there was no jQuery
and suchlike.

00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:36.167
Raub: So people in the room--
because this is a chat--

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:38.334
people in the room
who raised their hands

00:28:38.334 --> 00:28:40.334
that they're still using v2,
why?

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:42.167
So it's Street View.

00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:44.167
We've heard poly editing
and GWT bindings.

00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:47.000
man: [speaking indistinctly]
Raub: Yeah.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Mitchell: Yeah,
that was another one.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.100
Yeah, that's since--
Raub: That's done.

00:28:53.334 --> 00:28:55.667
Mitchell: Okay, this is
very heartening. [laughs]

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.667
Raub: So we'll work on
those things.

00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:59.667
man: [speaking indistinct]

00:28:59.667 --> 00:29:02.000
Raub: And one of the things
that I think we should also note

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.167
is that when we're bringing
these features to v3

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:06.334
we're trying to bring them
better than they were,

00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:08.000
so we're not necessarily--

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.334
some of the things may be
taking us a little longer,

00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:12.534
'cause we're not trying
to do a direct port.

00:29:12.534 --> 00:29:14.501
We want it to be better.

00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:16.667
So Street View--you're
not happy with Street View,

00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:19.167
but to us Street View is a way
better API than it was in v2.

00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:21.501
Um, there's--you can do a lot
more with it in the API.

00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:23.667
So we're trying to make that
a priority

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:25.834
is to improve the features
that were in v2

00:29:25.834 --> 00:29:27.834
when we bring them across.

00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:30.000
man: I have more questions,
but we'll trade.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
[laughter]

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.167
man: So I actually also
have a similar question

00:29:34.167 --> 00:29:36.167
to the question before, before,

00:29:36.167 --> 00:29:39.334
um, about caching
of the Places API responses.

00:29:39.334 --> 00:29:41.334
I didn't see much detail
about it

00:29:41.334 --> 00:29:43.334
on the maintenance
description page.

00:29:43.334 --> 00:29:45.667
I was wondering if you could go
into more detail

00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:47.667
as to how long you can cache,

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:50.167
what the nature of the caching
is, rights granted, et cetera.

00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:52.834
Mitchell: Yeah,
so the Places API inherits--

00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:56.167
um, the Places API
is just part of the Maps API,

00:29:56.167 --> 00:29:58.167
and consequently it's covered by

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:00.667
the existing Earth and Maps API
terms of service.

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:03.167
Um, and the--

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:05.667
therefore the--the caching
restrictions that apply

00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:08.000
to Geocoding, that apply
to directions, et cetera,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.834
um, just carry over
into the Places API.

00:30:10.834 --> 00:30:14.334
Um, and what
we basically say is that,

00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:16.834
um, we understand that it's
important for applications

00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:20.334
to be able to cache,
um, small amounts of data,

00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:24.167
um, in order to ensure
their application performs well,

00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:26.667
um, and in order to, uh,

00:30:26.667 --> 00:30:29.000
in order to build some
of the--the features

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
that we know people need
to build.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.334
For example, it's very hard
to build a store finder

00:30:33.334 --> 00:30:35.501
if you can't cache
in Geocoding information

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:37.501
about the locations
of those stores.

00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:39.667
Um, what we don't permit is, um,

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:43.667
is sort of bulk offline,
um, download of data

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:47.667
and use of data outside
of a Maps API application.

00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:50.167
Um, we don't publish a,

00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:52.534
um, specific number in terms of

00:30:52.534 --> 00:30:54.834
"you're allowed to cache
this data for x days."

00:30:54.834 --> 00:30:57.834
Um, it's something we're
looking into whether we can do,

00:30:57.834 --> 00:31:00.267
'cause I-I realize
that would be helpful.

00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:03.000
Um, but what you can do

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.501
is we do provide a--something
we call a Places API reference,

00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:09.667
which is a handle on the place
that is opaque

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.334
so it doesn't represent, um,

00:31:12.334 --> 00:31:14.834
any useful data
in and of itself,

00:31:14.834 --> 00:31:18.334
but allows you to retrieve
updated information

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:20.334
for that place at anytime
in the future,

00:31:20.334 --> 00:31:22.667
and we've worked very hard
to make sure those things

00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:24.501
are resilient to changes.

00:31:24.501 --> 00:31:27.834
So what you--
you are entitled to do

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:30.000
is cache the data that you need,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.834
um, and then as long as you
refresh that data regularly,

00:31:32.834 --> 00:31:35.834
as long as you don't use that
data outside of the application,

00:31:35.834 --> 00:31:38.000
and as long as if you ever, um,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.834
cease providing that application
or move to a different source

00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:44.434
then you dispose of that data,
then that's okay.

00:31:48.501 --> 00:31:50.167
man: All right.

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:53.501
Um, uh, I had a question
about Terrain View.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:56.834
Uh, Terrain View is gorgeous.
Uh, it looks great.

00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:59.367
It's a really elegant way
of sort of getting a sense

00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:01.667
of the slopes
that are in the geography.

00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:04.167
Um, it has a limit
on its zoom level.

00:32:04.167 --> 00:32:06.501
You can't zoom in
past a certain point,

00:32:06.501 --> 00:32:09.167
um, which is regrettable

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:11.334
because in some
usability tests we ran

00:32:11.334 --> 00:32:13.334
users did not understand
that Terrain View

00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:15.501
was the reason why
they couldn't zoom in,

00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:17.501
and they were just like,

00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:19.834
"Oh, I guess I just
can't just zoom in."

00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:21.834
I'm like, "No,
just switch views."

00:32:21.834 --> 00:32:24.167
But you can't tell them that
in a usability test,

00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:26.334
and you can't tell them that
in the world.

00:32:26.334 --> 00:32:28.667
Uh, what can we do about that?
Can we switch to Map View

00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:31.000
just at the moment they want
to zoom in a little further?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.200
Especially now when you can
recolor the map tiles,

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.501
they can look just like
terrain tiles, just no shading.

00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:37.501
Birch: Um, so I'll take that.

00:32:37.501 --> 00:32:39.667
So I think, you know,
one of the challenges

00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:42.000
is that the level of data that
we have is somewhat limited.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
And there was
a conscious decision to--

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.167
you know, basically every level
that you go down

00:32:46.167 --> 00:32:48.167
increases,
you know, "espentially,"

00:32:48.167 --> 00:32:51.334
you know, exponentially
increases the amount of data

00:32:51.334 --> 00:32:53.501
that's necessary to actually
serve out that data.

00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:55.501
So there was
some conscious decisions

00:32:55.501 --> 00:32:57.667
about how far down
we want to do that,

00:32:57.667 --> 00:32:59.667
and part of it's based on

00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:02.000
kind of the overall usage of--
of the terrain layer as well.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.167
Um, so, I mean,
it's good feedback to hear,

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:05.834
and I guess--

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:08.000
man: We'd definitely use
the terrain layer more

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.167
if, I mean, really at all...
Birch: Yeah.

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:12.501
man: you know, if we didn't have
this usability problem.

00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.501
People think they just
can't zoom in,

00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:16.501
like, they're just trapped.

00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:18.501
Is there--I mean,
how does Google--

00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:20.834
I mean, I think
on Google Maps' Web site,

00:33:20.834 --> 00:33:23.334
yeah, you just have a limit on
the zoom level, and that's it,

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.334
and I think--as a result

00:33:25.334 --> 00:33:27.667
I think people don't use Terrain
as much as they could.

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:30.334
Um, can we just glue the map
layer down at the bottom

00:33:30.334 --> 00:33:32.501
as, like, if you zoom in
a little further?

00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:34.667
I just want regular--
Birch: So you're saying once--

00:33:34.667 --> 00:33:36.834
I mean, I assume
you want terrain layers

00:33:36.834 --> 00:33:39.033
further down in the hierarchy
as opposed to

00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:41.334
once you get to a certain point
you switch back over.

00:33:41.334 --> 00:33:43.501
man: That'd be awesome,
but as a fallback,

00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:45.501
if I can't get that,

00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:47.501
and it seems reasonable
that I couldn't...

00:33:47.501 --> 00:33:49.334
Birch: Okay.
man: Uh, yeah,

00:33:49.334 --> 00:33:51.501
I just want to switch
to regular old maps.

00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:53.501
Microsoft Virtual Earth
does something very similar.

00:33:53.501 --> 00:33:55.834
They have a "shaded view,"
which is Terrain View.

00:33:55.834 --> 00:33:58.167
But yeah, they also have a limit
on--on how far you can go.

00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:00.267
Once you go past that limit,
you wouldn't notice.

00:34:00.267 --> 00:34:03.334
The shades just go away,
and they're in a regular map.

00:34:03.334 --> 00:34:05.334
Raub: So with the API,

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:08.000
there should be ways that you
can listen to the map-type ID

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.501
that has been selected
and then--in the zoom level.

00:34:10.501 --> 00:34:14.033
Um, it's possible that you will
lose one level of terrain

00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:16.501
if you listen to that
and switch to map

00:34:16.501 --> 00:34:20.000
as soon as that farthest
terrain level is available.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
man: It's a good idea.
The zoom control

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
represents you at the--
Raub: Yeah.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
man: You're basically
at maximum now.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.167
And maybe I can be like,
"Oh, well,

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.501
if you crank it up to maximum,
it gets a little taller."

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:33.667
But it looks like
you can't zoom in

00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:35.667
if you're looking
at the zoom control.

00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:37.834
And I don't think
we can control that?

00:34:37.834 --> 00:34:39.834
Raub: You can't. That's true.

00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:42.167
Um, it would be interesting
to see somebody hack this up

00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:44.501
in the API because there should
be a way to work around it.

00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:47.033
If this is your number one
feature that you need,

00:34:47.033 --> 00:34:49.167
the zoom control
is a very simple control.

00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:51.501
man: No, it's Street View.
But it's the number two.

00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:53.167
Raub: Number two.

00:34:53.167 --> 00:34:55.334
But the zoom control
is a very simple control,

00:34:55.334 --> 00:34:57.501
and if you want this kind
of custom functionality,

00:34:57.501 --> 00:34:59.834
I mean, that's what the API
is there for, is to do that.

00:34:59.834 --> 00:35:02.067
And I agree that we're giving
you this limitation.

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:04.167
man: You were suggesting
drawing my own zoom control,

00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:06.334
is that what you were...
Raub: If you want.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:08.501
I mean, if this is critical...
man: Mm-hmm.

00:35:08.501 --> 00:35:10.667
Raub: that's one way
to work around it.

00:35:10.667 --> 00:35:12.834
And then send us this,
and be like,

00:35:12.834 --> 00:35:15.167
"This is what I did. This is
how it should work." Um...

00:35:15.167 --> 00:35:17.334
Mitchell: One option--
I know this isn't ideal,

00:35:17.334 --> 00:35:19.367
but it may be better
than nothing--

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.834
is if you were to switch to one
of the smaller zoom controls,

00:35:21.834 --> 00:35:24.834
you won't have the slider.
Um, and I don't know.

00:35:24.834 --> 00:35:26.834
Personally I find these days

00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:28.834
I don't tend to use
the slider much.

00:35:28.834 --> 00:35:30.834
I tend to use
the mouse scroll wheel

00:35:30.834 --> 00:35:32.834
or something like that
to zoom in.

00:35:32.834 --> 00:35:35.767
So if your concern is that
the visual indicator

00:35:35.767 --> 00:35:38.834
of your zoom level isn't
reflecting the behavior you want

00:35:38.834 --> 00:35:40.834
or the behavior
you've even implemented,

00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:42.834
if you implemented
an automatic switch over

00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:45.167
to a different map type
when you reach that limit,

00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:47.334
then that's a possibility.

00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:50.000
Um, also I think--I believe--

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.501
although, you know, I'm happy to
check this for you afterwards--

00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:55.501
that the maximum zoom level
for Terrain is fixed,

00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:57.501
um, globally.
Raub: Yes.

00:35:57.501 --> 00:35:59.667
Mitchell: Oh, okay.
Susannah tells me that is.

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:02.000
So unlike, for example,
Satellite View,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.167
where we had this problem
in the past where

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:06.501
the maximum satellite zoom level
changes as you go around,

00:36:06.501 --> 00:36:08.501
and we had
to implement a service

00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:10.501
called getMaxZoomLevel()

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.834
that actually tells you what
the maximum is at any point.

00:36:12.834 --> 00:36:15.334
With Terrain, you know, okay, if
someone wants to go beyond 15,

00:36:15.334 --> 00:36:17.334
or whatever the figure is,

00:36:17.334 --> 00:36:19.834
then you need to switch
at that point to something else.

00:36:19.834 --> 00:36:23.667
man: Thanks.

00:36:23.667 --> 00:36:25.667
man: I'm gonna ask
some dumb questions

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:27.667
because I'm here to learn.

00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:31.334
Uh, I work in an industry where
we provide our own terrain.

00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:33.334
It's usually design.

00:36:33.334 --> 00:36:36.501
So some earth modeling software
is going to create a design

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:39.000
for a new whatever it is,
parking lot or whatever.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.334
So in Google Earth,
we'd like to replace

00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:45.000
the terrain that's coming in
with designed terrain.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.667
Is that possible?

00:36:47.667 --> 00:36:50.000
Birch: Um, so it's not possible,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.667
but it's something that a lot
of people have asked about.

00:36:52.667 --> 00:36:54.667
man: Okay.
Birch: So, um,

00:36:54.667 --> 00:36:57.000
so I'm gonna ask you
how you want to use it.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.033
So one question is, what--

00:36:59.033 --> 00:37:01.100
what format would you expect
that terrain?

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.834
Like, how would you like
to be able to bring that in

00:37:03.834 --> 00:37:05.834
and have your terrain displayed?

00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:08.167
man: Well, we have TIN models
and grid models, so...

00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:10.167
Birch: TIN and grid?
man: Yeah.

00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:12.501
But we can do multi-resolution
in grid as well.

00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:15.000
Birch: Um, and TIN is vector
format, is that correct?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.501
man: Yeah, triangular mesh.
Birch: Yep.

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:21.501
Um, do you ever use any
kind of raster-based map data?

00:37:21.501 --> 00:37:23.501
man: Yeah, that's what
we call grid.

00:37:23.501 --> 00:37:25.167
Birch: Okay.

00:37:25.167 --> 00:37:27.501
So of those two, which would be
more important to you?

00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:29.501
man: Um, it doesn't matter.

00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:31.501
We regularly go between
grid-based software

00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:33.534
and TIN-based software,

00:37:33.534 --> 00:37:37.167
so we can raster as a TIN,
um, if we have a TIN source.

00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:39.000
Um...

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.334
Birch: How big, um...

00:37:41.334 --> 00:37:43.834
I'm just gonna pick your brain
for as long as I can here.

00:37:43.834 --> 00:37:46.501
Um, how big of a terrain patch

00:37:46.501 --> 00:37:49.000
would you typically, uh, have?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.834
man: It can range--we could have
long highway projects

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:53.834
or--or mine projects

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:56.000
or small parking lot projects,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
so you know, you could talk

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.434
square miles to,
you know, just square meters.

00:38:00.434 --> 00:38:03.501
It ranges quite large.

00:38:03.501 --> 00:38:05.501
Birch: So could it be that

00:38:05.501 --> 00:38:07.667
that one single file
might be too big?

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:10.167
'Cause one of the things that we
provide in Earth and Earth API

00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:12.167
is this idea of regionation,
right,

00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.167
where you have sort of
a progressive--

00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:16.167
is that something that would be

00:38:16.167 --> 00:38:18.167
sort of essential
to your application?

00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:21.167
man: We have some, um, uh,
multi-resolution techniques

00:38:21.167 --> 00:38:23.501
and technologies that we already
use in our own applications...

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.167
Birch: Mm-hmm.

00:38:25.167 --> 00:38:27.334
man: um, that we could serve up,
you know.

00:38:27.334 --> 00:38:30.667
Uh, essentially the patch
is at the resolution

00:38:30.667 --> 00:38:32.501
dependent on the viewer.

00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:34.501
Um...
[speaking indistinctly]

00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:38.000
almost as if we could
just say substitute

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.834
or--or just give us
that information

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:42.834
in terms of proximity

00:38:42.834 --> 00:38:46.667
and do not bother drawing
that--that surface

00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:49.667
and let us just pop one
in there.

00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:51.667
Birch: And if you had--

00:38:51.667 --> 00:38:53.834
I assume that you're talking
about absolute heights?

00:38:53.834 --> 00:38:56.000
man: Yeah, this is
all engineered data, so it's--

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.167
Birch: And then what would
you expect to happen

00:38:58.167 --> 00:39:00.267
at a seam between where
we're providing data

00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:02.834
and you're providing data if
there happens to be a mismatch?

00:39:02.834 --> 00:39:04.834
man: Yeah, we run
into that already.

00:39:04.834 --> 00:39:06.834
Um, we'll have a site limit,

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.501
and then beyond the boundaries
of a site,

00:39:09.501 --> 00:39:11.501
the engineer doesn't
care much anyway...

00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:13.701
Birch: Mm-hmm.
man: So we'll just paste in,

00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:15.834
you know, an aerial photo
that's pretty rough

00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:19.000
um, from whatever GIS source.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And the user doesn't care

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.667
because they're not
going everywhere.

00:39:23.667 --> 00:39:25.667
They're just going
on their site.

00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:27.667
So that boundary can be rough,

00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:30.000
or, you know, you could have
some kind of, um,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.667
uh, cliff edge
or rough, you know.

00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:37.334
It--it can look pretty bad.
But they don't care.

00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:40.000
Birch: Um, is this something
that you would hope

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.334
to be able to use in a Web site
through the Google Earth APIs

00:39:43.334 --> 00:39:45.501
or something where you would
have data files

00:39:45.501 --> 00:39:47.501
like a KML or something else

00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:50.000
that you'd want to be able to,
uh, view in Google Earth?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.200
man: Well, we use KML right now.
We can--we can export to KML

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.334
and then augment
the Google Earth view

00:39:55.334 --> 00:39:57.100
to show entering data.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.167
So we're doing that already.

00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:01.501
The first part of your question,
could you repeat that?

00:40:01.501 --> 00:40:04.334
Birch: Yeah, I was just asking
where would you want to use it,

00:40:04.334 --> 00:40:07.167
whether it's in a Web site
or in just a KML file.

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:09.667
man: Web sites are fine, because
it has to do with collaboration

00:40:09.667 --> 00:40:12.501
of, you know, subcontractors
with contractors and owners

00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:15.334
and D.O.T.s
and things like that,

00:40:15.334 --> 00:40:18.334
so you know, having it
on a Web site is great,

00:40:18.334 --> 00:40:20.367
'cause they can all
collaborate over it,

00:40:20.367 --> 00:40:22.834
and they can, you know, point
and talk and what have you.

00:40:22.834 --> 00:40:25.501
So from a visualization point
of view it can exist on the Web.

00:40:25.501 --> 00:40:27.167
That's fine.
Birch: Okay.

00:40:27.167 --> 00:40:29.167
Well, anyway,
that's great feedback.

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:31.501
Again, it's something that we
hear a lot about, and I'd love

00:40:31.501 --> 00:40:33.834
to maybe even afterwards talk
a little bit more about,

00:40:33.834 --> 00:40:36.167
just use cases and if we were to
do that, what would be useful.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.167
And just in general
for anyone here,

00:40:38.167 --> 00:40:41.167
um, we'd love to hear about
what we aren't doing, right.

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:43.167
I mean, people have been
pretty quiet,

00:40:43.167 --> 00:40:45.667
so we assume that means that
we're doing everything great,

00:40:45.667 --> 00:40:48.667
and you know, we don't really
need to sweat too much.

00:40:48.667 --> 00:40:50.667
But my guess is
there's things that

00:40:50.667 --> 00:40:53.033
either are really inconvenient
in what we have today,

00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:55.167
and you have
to kind of work around,

00:40:55.167 --> 00:40:56.834
or there's things

00:40:56.834 --> 00:40:59.167
that you really wish
we would be able to do.

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:01.501
And maybe it's the number one
thing on the issue tracker,

00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:03.667
and we just need to get to it.

00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:06.000
Maybe it's something that,
you know, isn't there at all.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
We'd love to hear about it.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Anyway, thanks very much
for the feedback.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
man: Yeah, one other side...
Birch: Sure.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.167
tangent comment.
I heard in one of the sessions

00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:16.334
you can show real-time data
within Google Earth

00:41:16.334 --> 00:41:18.334
through some KML network
called...

00:41:18.334 --> 00:41:20.334
Birch: Network links? Yeah.
man: Yeah.

00:41:20.334 --> 00:41:22.334
So I'm unfamiliar with that,

00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:24.667
so I'll be going off
and learning more about that.

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:26.701
Um, but the comment was made

00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:28.834
that you can do that
through Google Maps.

00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:31.000
The Google Maps implement
a subsection of the KML.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.167
And I was just wondering
for a map route,

00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:36.667
are you just sort of on your own
to do your own thing,

00:41:36.667 --> 00:41:39.167
or is there a recommendation

00:41:39.167 --> 00:41:43.000
for real-time data
on Google Maps?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.167
Birch: You want to take that
or...

00:41:45.167 --> 00:41:47.167
Raub: [speaking indistinctly]

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:49.167
Birch: Well, I mean,
first of all,

00:41:49.167 --> 00:41:51.501
you always have the option of
doing things through JavaScript

00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:53.667
to create markers, right.
man: Yeah. Right.

00:41:53.667 --> 00:41:55.834
Birch: So the feature
that he's talking about

00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:57.834
is the idea of network links,

00:41:57.834 --> 00:42:01.334
which is basically a little
KML file that will specify--

00:42:01.334 --> 00:42:03.334
it's basically a pointer
to somewhere else

00:42:03.334 --> 00:42:05.334
that will then specify
a refresh rate

00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:08.334
or, uh, you know, under what
circumstances it will refresh.

00:42:08.334 --> 00:42:10.834
So just some examples of that
would be, you know,

00:42:10.834 --> 00:42:13.167
we have, like,
a U.S.G.S. earthquake map

00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:15.834
that allows you to see
earthquakes in the last hour,

00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:17.834
last day, and last week,

00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:20.000
um, and if you just have
that file loaded,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
it's just updating, you know,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.167
whether it's every five minutes
or ten minutes

00:42:24.167 --> 00:42:26.167
or whatever
the author specifies.

00:42:26.167 --> 00:42:28.167
Um, same thing--we have, like,
a flight--

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:30.501
airplanes and flight layer
where you can actually see

00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:32.834
all the flights in the U.S.
and where they are,

00:42:32.834 --> 00:42:35.167
um, and that's just being
updated all the time.

00:42:35.167 --> 00:42:37.167
Um, when you're doing that
in Maps--

00:42:37.167 --> 00:42:39.667
um, yeah, so there are
some differences

00:42:39.667 --> 00:42:41.834
and some things
that aren't supported

00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:43.834
when you use pure KML,

00:42:43.834 --> 00:42:45.834
and that's something that,
um, you know,

00:42:45.834 --> 00:42:48.334
we need to do a better job of--
of certain things.

00:42:48.334 --> 00:42:51.167
Um, you do have, of course,
the flexibility

00:42:51.167 --> 00:42:52.834
that, because it's JavaScript,

00:42:52.834 --> 00:42:55.167
you can actually
go off and fetch new data

00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.334
and, you know, basically go
into the DOM and--

00:42:57.334 --> 00:42:59.501
or you know, go and change
those markers

00:42:59.501 --> 00:43:01.667
or move those markers
based on that feedback.

00:43:01.667 --> 00:43:03.667
Shapley: Or you can
use Fusion Tables.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.801
Birch: Use Fusion Tables.
man: Oh, like a dynamic...

00:43:05.801 --> 00:43:07.968
Shapley: So if you're willing
to venture a little bit outside

00:43:07.968 --> 00:43:10.801
of your standard KML format,
Fusion Tables is basically

00:43:10.801 --> 00:43:12.934
a tabular data format
in the cloud.

00:43:12.934 --> 00:43:15.968
When you describe a feature,
you do describe it with KML,

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:17.934
um, and then you can have

00:43:17.934 --> 00:43:19.934
other attribute data
as well in that table.

00:43:19.934 --> 00:43:22.033
Um, and then you can use
the Fusion Tables layer

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:24.934
with the Google Maps API,
and every time that page loads,

00:43:24.934 --> 00:43:27.200
it'll go and look
at your data set and say,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.234
"Hey, what should
I be showing now?"

00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:31.234
So if you want to go ahead
and use

00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:34.834
the Fusion Tables SQL API to
change the data in that table,

00:43:34.834 --> 00:43:36.501
dynamically...
man: Okay.

00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:38.501
Shapley: then every time
that page loads

00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:40.534
it'll show what
it should be showing.

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:42.834
man: Now what kind of refresh
rate are you talking about

00:43:42.834 --> 00:43:44.901
that would be acceptable?
I mean, I can go to 10 hertz,

00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:47.067
and I don't think
that'll be a good thing, right?

00:43:47.067 --> 00:43:49.234
Birch: Yeah, so it is
only on refresh,

00:43:49.234 --> 00:43:51.667
or can you as a developer say,
"I want this to be, you know,

00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:54.000
updating every 15 seconds."
Madhavan: It's always live.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.801
Shapley: No, you need
to reload the page.

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:59.434
Madhavan: On the browser
you got to do it.

00:43:59.434 --> 00:44:03.167
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:05.334
Shapley: For a couple seconds,
yeah.

00:44:05.334 --> 00:44:07.334
man: [speaking indistinctly]

00:44:07.334 --> 00:44:09.501
Madhavan:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:11.667
Raub: Yeah, we, um...

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:15.334
We implemented a-a map using
the API in Fusion Tables in KML,

00:44:15.334 --> 00:44:17.000
all of it,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.334
um, for some of the disasters
that occurred in Australia,

00:44:19.334 --> 00:44:21.501
and so we had to actually
reload the--the--

00:44:21.501 --> 00:44:23.667
I think we were using KML
at that point--

00:44:23.667 --> 00:44:25.667
but reload the KML files,

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:28.000
and same thing if we had been
using Fusion Tables,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.167
we would need to reload
every five minutes

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.167
and worry about caching.
man: Okay.

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:34.667
Raub: So it's not built in yet.
man: Okay.

00:44:34.667 --> 00:44:36.667
One more dumb question,

00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:38.667
again, 'cause
I'm here to learn--

00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:42.334
so for instance, like, Google
Enterprise, Google Premier,

00:44:42.334 --> 00:44:44.501
and then there seems to be
some separation between

00:44:44.501 --> 00:44:46.501
maybe what you guys are doing,

00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.501
and maybe that's
a different group

00:44:48.501 --> 00:44:50.501
that's Premier and Enterprise,

00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:53.501
and there's some,
maybe some catching up

00:44:53.501 --> 00:44:55.501
one needs to do to the other.

00:44:55.501 --> 00:44:58.167
And it feels like I might be in
the Premier, Enterprise space.

00:44:58.167 --> 00:45:00.267
[microphone feedback whines]

00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:03.167
man: So I just need
to figure out what, you know,

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.834
for someone like me

00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:07.501
who's trying to figure out
how to work with Google

00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:09.167
where's my entry point?

00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:11.167
Who do I talk to?

00:45:11.167 --> 00:45:13.167
Chu: So I--I'd say it does sound

00:45:13.167 --> 00:45:15.334
like Google Enterprise would be
the right entry point,

00:45:15.334 --> 00:45:17.334
so to your first question, like,

00:45:17.334 --> 00:45:19.834
kind of what's the connection
between kind of the consumer

00:45:19.834 --> 00:45:21.834
and Enterprise offerings like...
man: Yeah.

00:45:21.834 --> 00:45:24.167
Chu: Obviously it's kind of
a very cohesive team

00:45:24.167 --> 00:45:26.667
and really the--the goal
of the Google Enterprise team

00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:29.667
was literally, you know, people
saw the consumer offerings,

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:32.501
had kind of more
businesslike needs

00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:34.667
and needed, like,
an SLA technical support,

00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:37.667
more advanced kind of, um,
quotas and whatnot,

00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:40.334
um, and we wanted to be able
to support that, right,

00:45:40.334 --> 00:45:42.334
and take that same technology.

00:45:42.334 --> 00:45:44.667
And so if you look at,
for instance, Maps API,

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:46.501
uh, the consumer

00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:48.667
and then the Maps API Premier
offering, right,

00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:50.834
the real differences
are kind of the terms,

00:45:50.834 --> 00:45:53.033
um, in terms of enabling
kind of internal sites,

00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:54.667
uh, paid offerings--

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:56.667
Uh, you can do that
with Premier--

00:45:56.667 --> 00:45:59.000
and that's not something that's
really in the consumer offering,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.334
uh, 24/5 technical support,

00:46:01.334 --> 00:46:03.667
99.9% SLA,

00:46:03.667 --> 00:46:07.000
and then, uh, for instance, in
many of the Web services you get

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.167
kind of much higher
quota limits.

00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:12.501
So typically you get
around 2,500 per day

00:46:12.501 --> 00:46:14.501
on the consumer offering,

00:46:14.501 --> 00:46:16.834
and 100,000 per day--
and you can upgrade from there

00:46:16.834 --> 00:46:19.167
in terms of both queries
per second as well as numbers.

00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:21.501
So that's just say, I mean,
the goal really

00:46:21.501 --> 00:46:24.667
is to kind of offer that
additional level, right,

00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:27.367
in terms of kind of
functionality as well as, um,

00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:29.501
and so things like
private Fusion Tables layers

00:46:29.501 --> 00:46:31.501
was another one that seemed like

00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:33.667
it was more
of an Enterprise use case.

00:46:33.667 --> 00:46:35.834
In terms of kind of the, um,
engagement model,

00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:38.334
that's another one that, um,
like right now

00:46:38.334 --> 00:46:40.834
in order for us to scale
on a consumer side

00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:43.501
we really need to kind of, you
know, interact through forums

00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.334
and kind of the starring
of feature requests and bugs.

00:46:46.334 --> 00:46:49.167
But, um, on the Enterprise side,
um, we def--

00:46:49.167 --> 00:46:51.334
if you go to any
of these products,

00:46:51.334 --> 00:46:53.501
they have kind of like
a "Contact Us" form

00:46:53.501 --> 00:46:55.501
that directly goes
to a sales rep

00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:58.000
who's happy to kind of reach out
either through e-mail and phone

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.300
and directly interact with you
in terms of kind of

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.000
what your needs are.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
We also have
a sales engineer organization

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.501
that can kind of help--help make
that technical decision for you.

00:47:06.501 --> 00:47:08.834
Um, so that would be--
I would recommend that

00:47:08.834 --> 00:47:10.834
as--as a great engagement model.

00:47:10.834 --> 00:47:12.667
man: Okay.

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:14.834
How am I doing?
man: Great. All right.

00:47:14.834 --> 00:47:17.000
Shapley: We've got
a new gentleman in the back.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.167
Maybe he can go ahead
and ask his question.

00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:20.834
man: Question as well.

00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:23.000
man: It's a Fusion Table
question.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.167
man: Okay, so, uh, the, uh,

00:47:25.167 --> 00:47:27.167
the current Android Map app

00:47:27.167 --> 00:47:30.000
is--is vector-based, right,
at least in the U.S.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Is that right for that data,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.033
or is that worldwide yet,

00:47:34.033 --> 00:47:36.334
or is there a plan
for that to go global?

00:47:36.334 --> 00:47:38.501
man: [speaking indistinctly]
man: It's worldwide.

00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.167
When will developers be able
to have access to that same--

00:47:41.167 --> 00:47:44.501
instead of tiles
but having vector,

00:47:44.501 --> 00:47:48.000
you know, vector-based mapping
inside their apps?

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.167
Mitchell: This is specifically
Android--Android apps?

00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:53.167
man: Well, Android, initially,

00:47:53.167 --> 00:47:56.334
but then across platform,
iOS and other...

00:47:56.334 --> 00:47:58.834
Mitchell:
So the Android Maps API

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:01.167
is part of the Android platform,

00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:03.167
the Android
development platform.

00:48:03.167 --> 00:48:05.501
Um, that's not a-a--
that's not something

00:48:05.501 --> 00:48:08.000
that us folks here
are directly involved in.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.667
Um, but I know that, um,

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:13.167
that there are, uh,

00:48:13.167 --> 00:48:15.501
there are discussions
in progress as to how to bring

00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:17.667
the vector rendering
into the Android Maps API.

00:48:17.667 --> 00:48:20.167
It's obviously something
that developers are demanding

00:48:20.167 --> 00:48:22.167
and that we want to provide

00:48:22.167 --> 00:48:24.501
Android developers with the same
freedom and flexibility

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.834
that they see
in the native application.

00:48:26.834 --> 00:48:29.000
As far as the Web-based APIs
are concerned,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.667
um, the benefits--potential
benefits and opportunities

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.834
of vector rendering
are very clear,

00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:37.167
um, but we are at the mercy

00:48:37.167 --> 00:48:39.501
of--of browser performance
there right now.

00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:41.834
So it's something that
we're keeping an eye on.

00:48:41.834 --> 00:48:44.334
Um, it's something that, um,
we're all excited about,

00:48:44.334 --> 00:48:46.834
the possibilities there,

00:48:46.834 --> 00:48:49.334
um, and as soon as it reaches
the point

00:48:49.334 --> 00:48:53.334
where we feel we can deliver
an acceptable user experience,

00:48:53.334 --> 00:48:55.167
um, in that way,

00:48:55.167 --> 00:48:57.167
then, you know, it's something
that we'll--

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:59.000
we'll start looking at.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
man: And just
one follow-up question--

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
regarding the Elevation API,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.167
is there--is there still
an effort to continually

00:49:05.167 --> 00:49:09.167
get granular, more fine-grain
data on the Elevation side,

00:49:09.167 --> 00:49:11.167
or are we at an area

00:49:11.167 --> 00:49:13.834
where it doesn't make
feasible sense to go deep--

00:49:13.834 --> 00:49:17.000
you know, more accurate data?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.167
Birch: Um, so that's something
that, you know,

00:49:19.167 --> 00:49:22.334
we're always trying to get more
data and get more updates.

00:49:22.334 --> 00:49:24.834
Um, so I think, you know,

00:49:24.834 --> 00:49:27.167
um, it's really a matter

00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:29.501
about getting access
to higher-quality data, right,

00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:31.834
so depending of where you are,
like, you know,

00:49:31.834 --> 00:49:34.167
globally the resolution
isn't as good as in the U.S.,

00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:36.167
and then in certain areas
we'll have

00:49:36.167 --> 00:49:38.501
kind of like what's happened
with--with imagery, right.

00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:40.834
It kind of starts off
with a lower resolution,

00:49:40.834 --> 00:49:42.834
and then over time
we can potentially

00:49:42.834 --> 00:49:44.834
get higher resolution in set.

00:49:44.834 --> 00:49:47.701
So, um, you know,
I expect that quality

00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:49.667
to be getting better over time,

00:49:49.667 --> 00:49:53.167
especially as we get access
to new sources of terrain data.

00:49:53.167 --> 00:49:56.334
man: Okay, thanks.

00:49:56.334 --> 00:49:58.334
man:
It's a Fusion Table question.

00:49:58.334 --> 00:50:01.000
When are we going to be able
to do OR queries

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
and--I know it's number two
on the issues list.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.834
Shapley: Can--can you say
a little bit more about

00:50:07.834 --> 00:50:09.834
how you would use it?

00:50:09.834 --> 00:50:12.834
man: Like, for, um, plotting
contaminants on a map,

00:50:12.834 --> 00:50:16.834
like, where contaminate
equals mercury OR PCPs

00:50:16.834 --> 00:50:19.000
for this county.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Shapley: So--so...

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
man: It's issue number 49
on the...

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.834
Madhavan:
[speaking indistinctly]

00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:27.167
Shapley: It's, yeah, it's right
there at the top of the list,

00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:29.167
and that hasn't escaped us.

00:50:29.167 --> 00:50:31.167
We definitely see it there.
[laughs]

00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:33.167
Mitchell: Just one
other comment on that.

00:50:33.167 --> 00:50:35.501
Um, as far as plotting
on a map is concerned,

00:50:35.501 --> 00:50:38.000
you can add more than one Fusion
Table layer to a given map,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.501
so you can add up to five Fusion
Table layers on any one map.

00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:42.834
So that is a way you can say--

00:50:42.834 --> 00:50:45.167
you know, you can have
one layer for one contaminant,

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:47.000
one layer for another.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.667
Another approach,

00:50:48.667 --> 00:50:51.000
which is sort of an extension
of the same idea,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.167
is that the dynamic styling
of Fusion Table layers

00:50:53.167 --> 00:50:55.000
that we announced yesterday

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
would allow you to,
for example,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.167
say "I'd like to render
a Fusion Table layer

00:50:59.167 --> 00:51:00.834
"of all the contaminants,

00:51:00.834 --> 00:51:03.167
"and I'd like to render
the mercury in this color,

00:51:03.167 --> 00:51:05.501
and I'd like to render"
so on and so on and so on.

00:51:05.501 --> 00:51:07.667
man: But that's also eliminated
the five, though, right?

00:51:07.667 --> 00:51:09.501
Mitchell: So it's limited

00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:11.667
to five style rolls
within a single layer

00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:14.000
and up to, um,
I forget right now--

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.501
five layers, one of which can be
styled with up to five rolls.

00:51:16.501 --> 00:51:18.501
So by combining
the two approaches,

00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.501
I think you can get to nine.

00:51:20.501 --> 00:51:23.334
[laughter]

00:51:23.334 --> 00:51:26.834
man: I have one more--
I'm sorry--one final--

00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:29.000
Mitchell: For
the folks at the back,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.334
there are a lot of empty chairs
if you'd like to...

00:51:32.334 --> 00:51:34.334
man: Easy question, I think.

00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:37.501
Um, Places API mentions

00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:39.501
that if you set up
billing information

00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:41.834
you can go up to 100,000
requests per day,

00:51:41.834 --> 00:51:44.667
uh, and presumably
if you start exceeding that

00:51:44.667 --> 00:51:47.167
there will at some point be
a billing structure

00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:49.000
and pricing system.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.167
I was curious
if you could shed any light

00:51:51.167 --> 00:51:53.501
on what that will look like
when it's announced.

00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:56.000
Mitchell: The requirement
to enable billing

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.167
is actually primarily driven by

00:51:58.167 --> 00:52:00.834
the need for us to strongly
identify developers.

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:03.334
Um, we did have a, um,

00:52:03.334 --> 00:52:06.000
a previous offering called
the AJAX search API

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
that offered some
local search features.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Um, we had some difficulties
there with, um, abuse,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
like specifically
anonymous abuse.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.334
So we wanted to be a little more
careful this time,

00:52:15.334 --> 00:52:18.834
so we asked people
to go through that--that check,

00:52:18.834 --> 00:52:21.667
um, just so that we can provide

00:52:21.667 --> 00:52:24.167
the kind of levels of quality
that we'd like to provide.

00:52:24.167 --> 00:52:27.000
We don't actually have
a current plan

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.501
to, um, to implement billing.

00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:32.667
I think we're more interested
at the moment in just--

00:52:32.667 --> 00:52:36.167
um, if there are sites
that are generating

00:52:36.167 --> 00:52:38.667
more than 100,000 Places API
requests a day,

00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:42.167
um, they sound like interesting
strategic partners for us,

00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:45.667
um, and we'd be interested
in--in talking to them about,

00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:48.000
you know, what they're doing
and what their needs are

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.167
and ways in which
we can work with them

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:52.167
and they can work with us,

00:52:52.167 --> 00:52:54.334
and that's the model
that we're taking right now

00:52:54.334 --> 00:52:56.334
in terms of what to do

00:52:56.334 --> 00:52:58.834
if people come to us and ask us
or those kind of volumes.

00:52:58.834 --> 00:53:01.167
I think--okay, um,
one last question.

00:53:01.167 --> 00:53:03.000
Yes, go for it.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.667
man: All right, this is
a transition from v2 to v3.

00:53:05.667 --> 00:53:08.667
Um, the Street View overlay

00:53:08.667 --> 00:53:11.167
and map.ad overlay--

00:53:11.167 --> 00:53:13.334
um, how do I do that in v3?

00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:16.667
I just want the blue lines
on the map just to show up.

00:53:16.667 --> 00:53:19.167
I had two lines of code
to do it in v2,

00:53:19.167 --> 00:53:21.334
and I don't know how
to do it in v3.

00:53:21.334 --> 00:53:23.167
Mitchell: So, yeah.

00:53:23.167 --> 00:53:25.667
So right now the--the lines
appear automatically

00:53:25.667 --> 00:53:27.334
as you drag Pegman,

00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:29.334
but you're saying
you'd like it to appear--

00:53:29.334 --> 00:53:31.667
man: I'm not using your Pegman.
I want my own Pegman.

00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:33.834
Mitchell: Yeah, that's--I've
seen a few requests for that.

00:53:33.834 --> 00:53:36.667
Um, so I'm pretty sure, again,
that there is an open issue

00:53:36.667 --> 00:53:38.501
for that, so just flag it.

00:53:38.501 --> 00:53:40.701
But you're quite right.
Right now it's not possible.

00:53:40.701 --> 00:53:43.834
man: Okay, that's why
it's not there.

00:53:43.834 --> 00:53:46.834
Mitchell: Okay, thank you
very much, everybody.
