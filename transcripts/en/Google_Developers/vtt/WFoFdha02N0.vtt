BEN MCMAHAN: Hi,
I'm Ben McMahan.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm a tech lead on the
Google Doodle team.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.050
I have a quick question.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.620
How many of you have ever
played a Doodle game?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.720
So quite a few of you.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.520
Well, making a game
on the Google homepage

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.440
has some interesting
unique challenges.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.340
So let's look at the homepage.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.800
First, like every kind of
person, from every country,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.050
with every kind of interest
and screen configuration

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.780
you can think of, goes
to the Google homepage.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.360
And second of all, they
didn't come to play a game.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.179
They came to do a search,
like if my rash is contagious

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:37.720
or something.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.750
So we're inherently
distracting right here,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.764
and so we still have to
do right by the user.

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:46.180
So we've learned
a lot of lessons.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.192
Like, one obvious one is
go straight to your game.

00:00:49.192 --> 00:00:51.400
So a couple of years ago,
we had this idea, oh, we'll

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.800
let them pick a team
and have their score go

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.690
to some global score
count for that team.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.650
But there are two things
wrong that we found out.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.630
One is half our users
left on this screen,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.182
because they had no idea
what they were going to get.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:05.140
And the other problem--

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.780
and we could have known this
just looking at YouTube data--

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.250
is one of them
holds a cat, so we

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.095
should have known
all of them would

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.303
have picked that one anyways.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:12.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.280
So to help us learn
all these lessons,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.840
I've come up with
a bunch of F-words.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.760
Because people take
F-words very seriously.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.370
So the first one
is to be friendly.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.920
And by this, I mean
non-gamer friendly.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.350
So you've got to
keep things simple,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.552
go with paradigms
people already know.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:29.260
It's interesting.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.750
When you make your own game,
you end up playing it a lot.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.860
And you get really
good at your game,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.640
way more than a user will,
being only able to play it

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.556
for one day, right?

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.930
So you've got to anchor yourself
with a lot of play tests

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.346
and user studies
[? with ?] people

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:43.840
who have never played the game--

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.870
and even better, if you can
make it a diverse set of people,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.600
outside of your normal
demographic comfort zone.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.550
I was lucky last year,
I playtested a lot

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.080
with my five-year-old.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.740
And I was instantly able to tell
exactly how much dexterity you

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.920
need to play any of the games.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.690
Next, you have,
like, five seconds

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.940
tops to do something enjoyable.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.100
It could be just a
really cute character,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520
or the first hill you go over,
something amazing happens.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.497
If you think about it,
in our context, people

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:13.830
after about five seconds are
like, no, wait, wait, wait,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.550
I really do need
to do that search.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.470
I'm going to go back
and go do that search.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.970
And that's great,
but they shouldn't

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.678
feel like they wasted
their five seconds.

00:02:20.678 --> 00:02:23.590
They should have gotten
something out of it.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.090
Next, it should be fun to fail.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.550
A lot of games have a challenge.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.900
Otherwise it's not as fun.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.370
But that also means
a lot of people

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.840
are going to fail when
you think about everyone

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.050
playing your game.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.690
So just make sure
that that's fun.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.232
A lot of times, we just
make something funny happen.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:39.190
Like, for example, in
this game, the watermelon

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.880
does squish the strawberry.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.917
And on the opposite side,
when people are doing well,

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.250
you know, go into a frenzy mode.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.880
Reward them.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.160
Make them feel special.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.650
So if they hit something
perfectly three times,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.780
just go nuts.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.890
I think NBA Jam did
this perfectly with its

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.370
you're-on-fire mechanic.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.390
And a quick word
on tutorials-- so

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.330
we do in-game tutorials
because of a previous lesson.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.880
But we also try to
do it without text.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.480
And this is a great
confirmation that you've made

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.230
a simple and friendly game.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.630
Because if a non-gamer
can come to your game

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.880
and learn how to play
it without any text,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.872
you've probably kept it
simple and intuitive.

00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:17.080
Now, we don't always succeed.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.660
Last year, we had
this Halloween game

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.880
where you had to draw
a symbol over a ghost

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.870
to get it to disappear.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.760
And we just couldn't find a way
with user studies to do that.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.090
So these are more goals than
rules, but still a useful one.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.665
And our final F-word kind of
over-arches all the F-words--

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:36.260
is feelings.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.290
And there's this great
quote by Maya Angelou.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.830
You know, people will
forget what you say.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.550
They'll even forget
what you did.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.502
But they'll never forget
how you made them feel.

00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:46.960
So it's a good idea
to just go over

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.540
every screen, every
choice, every challenge,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.550
and just ask yourself,
how am I making

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.170
our users feel right now?

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.570
And you'll find some low-hanging
fruit to improve your game.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.540
So in conclusion,
if you want to make

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.510
a game that can appeal to,
say, like a billion people,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.570
don't forget to encourage
your team to use more F-words.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.440
Thank you.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.640
