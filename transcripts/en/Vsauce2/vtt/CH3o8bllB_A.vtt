00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.720
An artificial island that rises with the sea.
And This is NOT what you think it is!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.519
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.529
Several of these creatures referred to as
"blind snakes" were recently discovered in

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.460
Brazil. Engineers found the meter long creature
after draining a hydroelectric dam spanning

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.820
a river connected to the Amazon. Biologists
say that despite looking like snakes, they actually

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.800
aren't reptiles, and are more closely related
to salamanders and frogs.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.600
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon created a snake
robot. These modular snakes can navigate a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.820
variety of terrain from poles to networks
of pipes, allowing it access to locations that

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.050
people and machinery otherwise cannot use.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.719
CAT TUNNEL SOFA.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.899
If you want to interact with plants there's
botanics interacticus. The sensing technology

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.620
treats plants as an electrical circuit so
each different type of plant creates unique

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.620
interactive properties. The idea is to stretch
the limits of what we can interact with.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.660
Using police composite sketch software and
descriptions from Bram Stoker's Dracula - this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.730
is what it says Count Dracula looks like.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.470
Now meet Stompy. The giant, rideable, walking
robot. This open-source, 18ft wide, 4,000

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.250
pound, 6-legged hydraulic robot is currently
in development by Project Hexapod, and if

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.450
they raise enough money they hope to build
an entire zoo of giant rideable robots.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.890
Identifying pastries in a second is this new
point-of-sale system in Tokyo. It recognizes

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.400
shapes and colors to identify baked goods,
allowing cashiers unfamiliar with the products

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.700
to still quickly ring up items. And they say
the system could be eventually be used to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.360
distinguish vegetables and medicine.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.110
I'm a moth, and here I am. I'm a moth, and now
I'm a tree.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.810
Instantly deodorizing dirty diapers is this
activated charcoal system. The material is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.640
called mesopore activated charcoal which has
larger pores than normal charcoal to absorb

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.890
a variety of odors. And is currently developed
for hospitals, but they're working on a home

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.590
model.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.160
Finally, Future Forms of Life is a short film
based on Theo Jansen's kinetic sculptures...

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.160
I'm gonna leave you with Fire Breathing at
2000 frames per second. And as always thanks

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.590
for watching.
