-Ugh.

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.536
Oh, cheer up, dummy.
Your book is a huge success.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.205
Everybody loves you.
You just won a Golden Globe.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:09.809
If you can't be happy tonight,
maybe you'll never be
happy again.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.145
I'm sorry, is that supposed
to be encouraging?
Because it's super-bleak.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.047
Vincent Adultman.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.883
-How are things
at the old nine-to-five?
-Good.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:20.153
I went
to the stock market today.
I did a business.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.121
I keep telling him
he works too hard.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.791
Come on, Vincent, let's get away
from the rat race.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.660
Take a cruise someplace wet
and Latin.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.962
I mean, can you imagine
this body in a swimsuit?

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.697
I literally cannot.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.800
Vincent, let's do a lap.
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.034
Whoa. Easy, easy.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.836
I got to hand it to Diane.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.805
This book has been everything
she said it would be.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.773
Yeah, she knows
what she's doing.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.642
How is Diane?
I haven't seen her in a while.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.744
Oh, well, the book's been huge
for her, too.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.679
She's practically as famous
as I am now.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:49.115
-And how are you?
-Well, it's been really hard--

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:52.685
Erica, is that you?
Who let you out
of the burn ward?

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.021
Ugh.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.224
Hey, did Vincent seem
extra weird to you last night?

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.127
Well, he's still three kids
in a trench coat, so, no.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.563
We're going through
a rough patch.
It's hard, you know?

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.199
He's works a fulltime job
at the business factory,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.435
so when he gets home,
he just wants to unwind
by watching R-rated movies.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.271
-(SIGHS) I thought I was ready
for a real adult relationship.

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.539
-But--
-(SNORES)

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.409
Enough about me.
BoJack, you are on fire.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.744
Oh, are we talking
about me again?

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.747
We have an offer on the table
for you to play the bad guy
in the new James Bond.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.117
-Ehh.
-I agree. Total garbage.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.519 line:0%
But this, it's a new drama
from the Coen Brothers.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.187
A western
about a one-horse town.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.323
And you're the horse.
What do you think?

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.658
I think now's the time
to finally make "Secretariat."

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.194
Aren't you a little, um,
very too old?

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:37.597
You asked me
what I wanted to do.
That's all I've ever wanted.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.167
And if I can't get it now,
then all of this
has been for nothing.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.136
Oh, fish. Of course!

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.171
Why would you ever
make things easy for me

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.340
when instead,
you could make things
incredibly difficult?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.442
Laura, clear out
the rest of my day.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.210
I have to push
a boulder up a hill,

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.713
and then have it roll over me
time and time again

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.448
with no regard for my wellbeing.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.250
Attagirl.
