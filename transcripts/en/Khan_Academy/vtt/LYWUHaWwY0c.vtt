00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.160
Here's another problem that
Kortaggio sent me and,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.030
like the other two, this
is quite interesting.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.550
Although, I think you'll start
to see a pattern forming

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.500
in how these are solved.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.880
And that's the whole point, not
just to show you neat problems,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.240
but also to give you an
intuition of how to solve it.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.200
So what does it say?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.470
It says Alice is 100 meters
from Bill and Bill is 300

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.020
meters away from Chelsea.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.910
Maybe this is a bit of a
Clintonian reference, but who

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.660
knows, or maybe they just
wanted people with starting

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.350
names a, b, and c.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.750
So let's draw that out.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.520
So Alice is 100 meters
from Bill-- all right.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.830
Alice is 100 meters from Bill--
and actually he drew a little

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.450
diagram, so we know that also
Chelsea is to the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.280
right of Bill.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.415
So let's see, the diagram he
sent me looks like this.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.830
So you have Alice.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.940
And then 100 meters
away you have Bill.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.450
And then 300 meters to the
right of that you have Chelsea.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.820
This distance right
here is 100 meters.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.510
And then this distance
right there is 300 meters.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.460
And the problem tells us they
are all facing east and are

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.030
standing on the same line.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.600
Fair enough.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.960
We'll say that's east.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.690
So they're all facing in
that direction standing

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.650
in the same line.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.890
They all travel to the
east at constant speeds.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.220
OK, but they don't say that
they're all traveling

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.175
at the same speed.

00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:27.810
Each individual
speed is constant.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.815
So this could be velocity of
Alice, lowercase a, velocity

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:38.210
of Bill, and then this is
the velocity of Chelsea.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.820
Alright, they all travel
east at constant speeds.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.940
In 6 minutes, Alice
overtakes Bill.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.980
So what has to happen?

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.390
Let me do this in another color
and write down what that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.310
equation would look like.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.630
So I'll do it in green.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.700
In 6 minutes, Alice
overtakes Bill.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.290
This tells the distance that
Alice travels in 6 minutes.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.890
So what's the distance that
Alice travels in 6 minutes?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.350
It would be the velocity
of Alice times 6.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.170
And she overtakes Bill.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.430
So that means she goes 100
meters more than Bill went.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.290
So that means she went 100
meters plus the distance that

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.790
Bill went in that 6 minutes.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.700
And the distance that Bill
went in 6 minutes is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.380
velocity of Bill times 6.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.960
Right?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.810
This tell us in 6 minutes,
Alice went 100 meters more

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.260
than however far Bill
went in 6 minutes.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.310
That's that equation there.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.270
We got it from
this information.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.480
And then the next thing,
this problem tells us, in

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.830
another 6 minutes Alice
overtakes Chelsea.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.200
So from the beginning of
our time, it essentially

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.190
takes 12 minutes.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.730
Right?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.070
6 minutes to overtake Bill
and then another 6 minutes

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.910
to overtake Chelsea.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.080
So 12 minutes to
overtake Chelsea.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.620
So we could write that as the
distance that Alice travels

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.950
in 12 minutes is equal to--

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.450
Well, she has to
overtake Chelsea.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.340
That means she made up 400
meters of distance, so that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.560
she traveled 400 more meters.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.870
So the distance that Alice
travels is going to be 400

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.260
meters more than the distance
that Chelsea travels

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.300
in 12 minutes.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.990
And remember, distance is just
equal to rate times time.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.280
Right?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.400
So in 12 minutes this is how
far-- oh sorry --this is how

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.650
far Chelsea travels,
that's a c.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.860
And this is how far Alice
travels, and she is going

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.670
to travel 400 meters more.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.130
OK, that's what those
two equations tell us.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.890
And what is their question?

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.510
They're asking us, how many
minutes did it take Bill

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.210
to overtake Chelsea?

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.550
How many minutes did it take
Bill to overtake Chelsea?

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.950
All right, so let's say we
want to know time in minutes.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.450
How long does it take Bill
to overtake Chelsea?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.600
Let's say we know
that it's time, t.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.250
So that tells us that the
velocity of Bill times this

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.300
time is going to be equal to
--for him to overtake Chelsea,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.370
he has to travel 300 meters
more than her in that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.390
same amount of time.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.080
So he has to go 300 meters
more than how far Chelsea

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.360
travels in that time.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.270
So that's what this is, and
then we essentially are just

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.200
trying to solve for this time.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.150
We want to be able
to solve for this.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.190
Let's solve this equation.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.620
Remember, all these equations
really have the same form.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.410
In order for this person
to overtake this

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.710
person in 6 minutes.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.770
That means in 6 minutes she
would have to travel 100

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.100
meters more than him.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.360
In 12 minutes she would
have to travel 400 meters

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.020
more than Chelsea.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.090
And then in t minutes-- and
that's what we're going to have

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.850
to solve the problem for --b is
going to have to travel

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.150
300 meters more than
Chelsea right there.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.800
We just solve for t, so
let's just solve for t.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.440
So what do you get?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.750
You get vbt minus vct
is equal to 300.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.240
I just subtracted Chelsea's
velocity times time from

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.060
both sides of the equation.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.380
We can factor out the
time, so let's do that.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.590
So you get vb minus vc times
time-- I'm just factoring out

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.180
the time --is equal to 300.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:25.310
Or time is equal to
300/vb minus vc.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.580
So if we could somehow figure
out what this is equal

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.680
to, then we would have
solved our problem.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.450
Let's see if we can use
the other information.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.750
Let's see, if we solve for vb
here and solved for vc here,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.330
hopefully the va's
will cancel out.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.900
And I suspect they will,
otherwise this problem

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.440
would not be solvable.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.330
So let's do that.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.510
Let's rewrite this
equation up here.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.845
Let's solve for vb,
for Bill's velocity.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.920
Let's see, if we divide both
sides by 6-- well, let's

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.780
subtract 100 from both sides.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.180
So you have Bill's velocity
times 6-- that's just that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.250
--is equal to 6 times
Alice's velocity minus 100.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.470
All I did is I subtracted
100 from both sides of

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.090
this equation and I
swapped the sides.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.530
Divide both sides by 6.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.890
You got the velocity of Bill
is equal to the velocity

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.360
of Alice minus 100/6.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.160
100/6 or 50/3-- I'll just
keep it as a 100/6.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.700
Fair enough.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.480
Let's see if we can do the same
thing with this equation.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.670
If we subtract 400 from both
sides, we get 12 times

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:44.490
Chelsea's velocity is equal
to 12 times Alice's

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.580
velocity minus 400.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.780
Divide both sides of
this equation by 12.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.790
You get Chelsea's velocity
is equal to Alice's

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.170
velocity minus 400/12.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.150
All right.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.170
So let's if we can substitute
this back in for vb, and

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.680
substitute this back in for vc.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.530
And hopefully the
va's cancel out.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.780
It already looks
like they should.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.050
So our time, the time that it
takes for Bill to overtake

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.920
Chelsea-- remember that's what
t was, it's always good to

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.250
remind yourself what this whole
problem was about to begin

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.340
with --is equal to 300/vb.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.460
Well instead of vb
let's write this.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:38.900
Va, the velocity of Alice,
minus 100/6 minus vc.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.890
So minus this right here.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:47.730
Minus va minus 400/12.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.710
This should simplify to
t-- I'll just arbitrarily

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.880
switch colors.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.370
t is equal to 300/va
minus-- what's 100/6?

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.290
100/6 is the same
thing as 50/3.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.420
Distribute the minus sign.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.400
Minus va-- we can already see
these are going to cancel out

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.610
--minus times a minus plus
400/12 is the same thing

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.560
is 200/6 or 100/3.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.460
Right?

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.950
Plus 100/3.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.300
These two cancel
out, va minus va.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.640
So then we're left with
t is equal to 300 over

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.300
100/3 minus 50/3.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.640
Right?

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.030
Or I could say minus 50/3 plus
100/3, but either way, minus

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.480
50/3 plus 100/3 is just 50/3.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.380
Did I do that right?

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.990
If I divide the top and the
bottom by 4, I get this.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.400
And then sure, this is
a 100/3 and than 50/3.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.790
And so when you divide by a
fraction that's the same thing

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.210
is multiplying by its inverse.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.550
300 times 3/50 over 1.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.800
And then we can cancel out
some terms, so we don't have

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.010
to multiply big numbers.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.470
So if we divide the top and the
bottom by 50 that becomes 1,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:13.550
this becomes 6, and then we're
left with t is equal to 6 times

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.340
3/1, which is 18, and all the
time units we were working with

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.070
the whole time were in minutes.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.795
And we're done.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.330
That was a little hairier than
the other two, but notice we

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.190
were able to solve it by just
algebraically writing down the

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.670
information that they actually
gave us in the problem and just

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.580
seeing what we have to solve
for and then substituting back

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.250
in and then miraculously
things canceled out.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.700
And in general, if you're given
a nice problem like this you

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.480
can normally just, you know,
march forward knowing that if

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.650
you do things correctly
probably nice things will

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.220
happen and terms
will cancel out.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.830
But I thought you would find
that interesting and once

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.230
again, thanks to Kortaggio
for that problem.
