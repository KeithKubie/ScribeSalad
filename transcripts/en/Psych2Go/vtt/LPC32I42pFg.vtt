00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.500
Confidence is sexy

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.440
A guy who can sweep you off your feet without a moment's hesitation is every woman's dream

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.420
However, there are also shy guys out there who are waiting to be noticed, but how do you know if they like you?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.240
1 - He looks at you when you're not looking

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.860
Shy guys typically don't want to be caught looking at you because confrontation is not their forte

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.980
Instead he resorts to admiring you from afar

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.260
Engaging with someone you like is terrifying and shy people are often afraid of being rejected or judged so they rarely open up

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.640
Consequently it's hard to tell when a shy guy actually likes you, however once in a while

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.200
You may pick up on signs like subtle eye contact which indicates his interest?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
2 - He tries to talk to you, but looks very uncomfortable

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.840
A shy guy usually stays within his group of friends

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.629
So when he leaves them to approach you, chances are he likes you, he might not have anything to say or appear very awkward

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.480
But it probably takes him a lot of bravery

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960
3 - He treats you differently

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.680
As mentioned before shy guys will rarely approach you unless they're interested in you

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.660
When a shy guy likes you he'll go out of his way to get your attention, or do favors for you.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.780
He'll treat you differently from how he treats others, whether it's grabbing an extra cup of coffee for you, or bragging about you to his friends

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
4 - He opens up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.940
Introverted or reserved guys usually keep to themselves and rarely share personal details with others

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.380
If a guy like this starts to open up to you, that means he likes you and isn't afraid of being judged by you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.840
He'll reveal hidden interest in personal details he doesn't like to share with others.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.140
You're special to him and he wants you to know that he trusts you

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.140
5 - He seems annoyed when you talk with other guys

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.840
Since trusting others is hard for shy guys, when he opens up to you, your bond becomes special to him

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.880
When you talk to other guys he may feel insecure and get annoyed

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.100
He might even start distancing himself in fear of getting hurt or losing you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360
6 - He shows interest in things you do

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.560
A shy guy rarely steps out of his comfort zone

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.340
so if he starts getting involved in something you like

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.080
chances are he likes you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.560
If you sense that this is the case and you like him to, be sure to encourage him to do those things more

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.820
7 - He tries to talk to you over the internet

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.780
Shy guys feel a lot more comfortable communicating over the web

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.940
because then they feel like they won't be judged for how they look, talk, or express their body language

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.240
If you notice a shy guy communicating with you over the internet often he's probably interested in you

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.460
If you like him as well, and want to move the relationship forward try calling him or meeting up

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.480
8 - His friends tease him when you're around

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.840
Guys to who are shy will often keep their feelings to themselves

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.700
But their close friends can usually tell what's happening?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.020
If you start to feel that his friends are acting strange when you're around him, they probably know something is up

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.000
So you should confront them about it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.540
9 - He seems interested in you, but never really makes a move

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.160
Shy guys are often too afraid of rejection to put themselves out there and make a move on a girl

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.940
They'll talk to you and show signs of interest, but they're likely to wait for you to make the first move

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.660
10 - He stands up for you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.720
Have you ever been in a really embarrassing situation

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.500
and suddenly a guy you weren't exactly close with tries to save you

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.020
Chances are that guy had liked you for a while, and showing his interest with a bold act of courage

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.440
This isn't easy but he wants you to know that you are worth the risk and definitely worth fighting for

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.700
11 - He remembers little things about you

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.660
A shy guy will remember the small details about your life

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.940
Like the name of your pet hamster you had when you were five or your favorite pizza toppings

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.940
He'll try to downplay it when you say "Wow, you remembered!" because he doesn't want to make his feelings obvious

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.940
But at the same time he'll feel proud that you appreciated it

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.760
12 - He tried to act more social than he is

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.860
Shy guys will sometimes try to act as social as possible to get a girl's attention

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.280
To show her that he's not that shy

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.240
If a guy who usually keeps himself suddenly tries to become a social butterfly around you he's interested in you

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.580
13 - He's confident at first, but then stops talking to you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.900
Often guys with shy personalities will come off as confident and personable at first

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.120
However once he gets comfortable he might start second-guessing himself and distance himself from you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.080
shy guys are full of mixed signals and confusion

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.080
14 - His body language

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.140
Pay attention to the way a shy guy expresses himself with his body language

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.240
If he's fidgeting with his hands, can't stay still, or won't make eye contact when he's talking to you, chances are he likes you

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.540
15 - He tries to talk to your friends and get closer to them

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.320
Shy guys will usually try to engage your friends in conversations, and try to become closer to them to gain your attention

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.760
their goal is always to make you notice them in subtle ways

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.400
A guy that likes you will suddenly start asking your friends about you and leave hints with them

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.660
16 - He genuinely cares about you and listens to you

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.720
It's really hard to get a guy to pay attention to you

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.960
much less listen to what's going on in your life

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.960
So if you have a guy friend who really cares about you, listen to your problems, and gives you great advice

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.220
There's a chance you might like you, but is too afraid to say anything

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.700
