00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:03.409
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.430
&gt;&gt;Audience: Hello.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430
[laughter]

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.170
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I'm going to introduce Aisha
really quickly. I'm not gonna go too far into

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.050
her Bio because I really want us to have time
to have a unique conversation.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.050
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Because it's very meager.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.050
[laughter]

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.410
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And I don't know if you guys
have ever tried this, and I know that you've

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.230
already heard this joke, but you can Google
me.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.230
[laughter]

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.690
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So. I don't know if you know
how to use it. We work here. We don't use

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.690
Google, c'mon.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.690
[laughter]

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.790
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: We just have it all in our
heads magically.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.540
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: But the problem, people,
people think we are Google. That's the problem.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.540
Ask us all kind of things.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.820
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So we come to you and we're
like, so I need to get to 917 North 24th Street.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.820
[laughter]

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.820
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Exactly.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.960
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: If you could, if you could
drop a pin, that would be great.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.960
[laughter]

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.980
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Search nearby for some restaurants.
That would be awesome too.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.980
[laughter]

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.659
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: So that actually says more
that her Bio does.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:50.659
[laughter]

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.659
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: But really quickly, she was
actually the first African-American and female

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.379
host on E!'s Talk Soup. I don't know how many
of you guys used to watch that.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.379
[clapping and cheering]

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.010
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: But that was one of my favorite
shows.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.010
[clapping]

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.260
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: After Talk Soup she moved
into television and film rolls. She was also

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860
the first African-American to play an extended
character role on Friends.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.300
[whooping and clapping]

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.550
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Which I was really excited
about.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.000
[clapping and laughing]

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.700
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I think we were all really
exited about that. She played on the Ghost

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.981
Whisperer, CSI, 24, Nip/Tuck, Curb Your Enthusiasm,
Rio 911, The Boondocks and many, many more.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.159
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So many more. Like three or
four more than that. Three or four.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.159
[ laughter]

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.080
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You wanna talk about those
three or four more?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: At least.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.250
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: So, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
go back a little bit. Far back. Two years

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
ago. And talk about when you returned to your
stand-up roots.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.250
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.280
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You created a, a DVD called
Aisha Tyler Is Lit.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.280
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yes.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yeah.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.140
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Live at the Fillmore.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.140
[laughter}

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.250
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: And you also wrote, directed
and starred in a viral Rap video.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, hmmm.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.250
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Called Nowassitall.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.520
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um hmm.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.400
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Can we play that really quickly?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:03:47.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, we're gonna see it. That's
very exciting.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:05:41.919
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: We're gonna see it.

00:05:41.919 --> 00:06:27.700
&gt;&gt;[audience murmurs]

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:50.599
[laughter]

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.190
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, it's awesome. We're actually
going to the real internet.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.190
[laughter]

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:07.979
[music begins] [coughing] [singing] Well let
me tell you my life story and how it came

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:24.349
to pass that I'm a fine black woman, but I
have no ass. When I was a little girl I was

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:38.990
the only black kid in my class. I was begging
and a pleading just to get a hall pass. Six

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:49.090
feet tall, sportin' at least three inches
of glass and even way back in the day I didn't

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.719
have much of an ass. I used to stumble 'round
the playground on size 12 feet, other kids

00:07:54.719 --> 00:08:00.160
thought I was weird 'cause my family didn't
eat meat. They used to tease me out at recess

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:09.550
while I ate my pickled beets and all the black
girls in my hood would jump me out in the

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:18.379
street. You talk like a white girl. Oh my
God, I do not, that is so bogus. Shut up.

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:22.470
No, I don't got it but I want it. No ass at
all. If I was stuffed then I would flaunt

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.780
it. No ass at all. I turn around, it's kind
of funny, no ass at all. No ass at all. None.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.120
Now I'm a grown black woman and I'm supposed
to act real hard and drive a pimped out Escalade

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.490
filled with pumped up body guards. And flash
my chocolate digits stacked with platinum

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.219
diamond rings, carry designer snake-skin bags
and have my orthodontia bling. But I'm really

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:40.909
not a pimp and I, I don't have any hoe and
when I drive my hybrid car, well, sometimes

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.010
I pick my nose. If you wanna fight me, well
then I'd probably have to say no. But get

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.399
me on an Xbox, I'll bust your ass on Halo.
I really can't rap, obviously my flow's completely

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:55.690
wack. I can't jump for jack, I'm really only
kind of half black. I use s-a-t words like

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.951
ohmahgosh, and checksum. If my street cred
came in dollars, I couldn't buy a pack of

00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:04.839
gum. No, I don't have it, just a little, no
ass at all. And when I waggle, it don't wiggle,

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:09.260
no ass at all. My chocolate puddin' doesn't
jiggle, no ass at all. No ass at all. Born

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:16.070
and raised in San Francisco, that's the city
by the bay, and you don't really have to ask

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.040
me, yes, I have a friend that's gay. When
I go out with my crew we like to see a nice

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.240
movie, maybe get a super burrito from a chill
dude named Chuy . I like a nice plate of sushi

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.280
with a good bottle of wine. And I'm super
fond of onion bagels, yes, I think they're

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:37.190
mighty fine. If you need a mensch to help
you, I'm the kindest boss. I'm a bad ass shiksa

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:44.580
dipped in chocolate sauce. But I, I still
ain't got no onion booty, ain't no junk back

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.690
in my trunk, and if you ask me point blank,
I would admit, it's pretty bunk. If there

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.750
was a pillow or a cream to make my booty larger,
I'd try it, face it, my ship's more flat than

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.330
Angelina's on a diet. Ain't no shake come
with these fries, no ass at all. And when

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.500
I pass avert your eyes, no ass at all. My
ship been cut way down to size , no ass at

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.670
all. No ass at all. Damn. Now my badonka don't
realy donk. My lady lumps just ain't no fun,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.360
I ain't got no buns hun, your anaconda won't
want none. There's no motor in the back of

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.200
my Honda, though I am a mocha fox. When white
boys check my back side, they say one word,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.070
hmm lox . I was born a poor black girl and
I've had to bust my ass through strife . I'm

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.810
not complaining, I love comedy, I love my
family, I love my life. Though I'm grateful

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.430
to have made reality out many of my wishes.
One dream just won't come true, I wish I could

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.850
be more bootylicious. No, I don't have it,
just a little, no ass at all. And when I waggle,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:35.450
it don't wiggle, no ass at all. My chocolate
puddin' doesn't jiggle, no ass at all. No

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:43.149
ass at all. Damn. No, I don't have it, just
a little, no ass at all. And when I waggle,

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:48.160
it don't wiggle, no ass at all. My friends
are trying not to giggle, no ass at all. No

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.610
ass at all. Shit . [music ends]

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.839
[clapping and cheering]

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.709
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: That was an exciting video.

00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:57.320
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I was so excited that the internet
worked, wow!

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320
[laughter]

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: So were we.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.150
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: As a native of the San Francisco
Bay area, I suffer from a similar disorder.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.150
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yes.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.070
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It's not that bad, but I
definitely can't compete

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.590
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Nothing can be as bad as mine.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:14.490
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: with some of the audience,
so. Tell us why you made that video and what

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.130
messages you hoped to convey.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.459
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, wow, so heady so early
in a conversation.

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:20.459
[laughter]

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:24.579
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, I had some money left over
from making my comedy special and I just was

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:29.940
I was just tired of hookers and blow and thought
I would spend it in some other way. No. Here's

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.940
why.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.940
[laughter]

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.630
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I mean, I am in the entertainment
business. You know, I grew up here and I was

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.380
born in the city, but I spent a good amount
of time in the east bay and I was often, for

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.769
most of my childhood and probably until about
sophomore year in high school, the only, or

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:47.470
one of two or three black people in my school.
And, um, so I was kind of an outsider in that

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:53.550
I went to an all-white school and I lived
in a black neighborhood. And the kids in my

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:59.880
school didn't really particularly relate to
me and the girls in my neighborhood, you've

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:07.170
already seen how they felt about me, and so,
uh, I always had to kind of explain myself

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.130
and articulate who I was and I really, when
I was younger, it was really, uh, you know,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:21.130
I was definitely in a lot of ways socially
odd and a little bit of a pariah. I was a

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.759
loner and I was a big reader. My parents didn't
believe in television, so there's pretty much

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:30.420
no better combination for being really, really
popular and cool than being a six feet tall,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.620
only black, vegetarian kid in your school
who doesn't have a TV. That's good.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.620
[laughter]

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.639
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I was like, hey, you guys wanna
read together?

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.639
[laughter]

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:45.660
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Could do some middle earth
discussions. Silmarillion anybody? Anybody?

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.660
Uh, so.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660
[laughter]

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:54.610
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It, but over time it became
like a, like my red badge of courage. I'm

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.529
a weird kid and I'm proud of how different
I am and it also was a little bit of a manifesto.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:06.810
I wanted to kind of, this was my first special,
and I wanted to tell my story, and tell it

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.750
first, so I didn't have to tell it inside
the show. I wanted to be able to talk about

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:16.480
other things. But when I first started doing
stand up and I would get up in front of a

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.300
crowd, I had to spend five minutes being like,
this is why I talk like this, this is why

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:30.360
I act like this, you know. This is who I am
and getting people to kind of come along because

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.170
you know I think for better or worse the explosion
of comedy and the explosion of diversity in

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.910
comedy has given rise to a lot of really great
things and then one of the negative things

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:47.180
is that people really want to categorize you.
If you're a black comic, you talk about these

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:55.570
things. If you're a female comic, you talk
about these things. And I don't do any of

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.610
that and people would, I'd get up and they'd
be like, what in the world is wrong with that

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.160
momma right here? You know and ah.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
[laughter]

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.500
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know, I just didn't want
to have to, I just wanted to, to just do the

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.449
manifesto at the top of the show so that I
could just get into other ideas and other,

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:21.350
and other concepts. And we did it, you know,
the comedy special, the way that it happened

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:29.920
was I got a deal with a company where they
were like, here's how much money you have

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:36.899
to spend and you can spend it any way you
want, and, um, I thought, again, hookers and

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:38.790
blow, ahhhhhh, ohhhhhh, 50-50. Um.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.790
[laughter]

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.330
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: But I thought instead of paying
a producer, I'll produce this whole thing

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.880
myself and use the extra money to add some
value, add some creative value and so, when

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.449
we were gonna do this, Comedy Central's like,
nobody likes music videos, people always change

00:14:52.449 --> 00:14:56.490
the channel the minute they come on, no one's
gonna watch this. And we had, we had like

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.779
we opened, my show played after a Chris Rock
rerun and like had the highest number after

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:03.870
any Chris Rock show, you know. Usually people
watch Chris Rock and then, I don't know, run

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.030
off to just, I don't know, I don't know what
people do after they watch Chris.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.030
[laughter]

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.889
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Run into the streets, scream,
take their clothes off, you know. Chris makes

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:13.829
me feel awesome and crazy, but everybody stayed
and and and the video's been really popular

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:18.339
and it was great. It was a nice thing to be
able to have something that I had written

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:22.551
and I directed it, produced it, I edited it.
I cut it. I posted it. I did everything. So

00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:26.600
it was also a great creative process for me.
Yeah, it was really fun.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.820
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Congratulations on that.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.820
[clapping]

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.590
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Thank you. Thank you. It looks
way. We shot it in HD by the way. That was

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.779
not really the best version that you could
have seen it. Grainy pop up ads for Lady Gaga

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:35.779
videos, but whatever.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:36.779
[laughter]

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:38.790
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You guys can can look up
the HD version as well online.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.790
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.620
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Let's talk about your podcast.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.170
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh yeah, let's talk about my
podcast.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.710
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Podcast. Girl on Guy with
Aisha Tyler.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.710
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.090
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It's a show about stuff guys
love, brought to you by the ultimate guy's

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.090
girl

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.090
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I didn't write that.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.220
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Well, somebody did. I don't,
I don't

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.200
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I might have written it under
a pen name.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.959
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It kind of

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:01.959
[laughter]

00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:02.959
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Sounded like you maybe.

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:03.959
[laughter]

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:06.089
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Video games, action movies,
drinking, comic books, sex, blowing shit up,

00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:10.029
all of that good stuff. And it is already
the top downloaded pod, one of the top downloaded

00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:11.490
podcasts on iTunes and Zune .

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.850
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, yeah, it's doing really
well. Yeah, it's only five, it debuted, uh,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.040
I don't really know how this happened. I'm
waiting for a shoe, I'm waiting for whatever

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.540
the other shoe is to drop, just the devil
just

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.000
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Which shoe?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.850
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: the demon at my doorstep. You
know, just like

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.960
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Big shoe?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.410
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: The show it's had, we've had
five episodes. I thought, I'm gonna do this

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:42.000
for a year or two and then hopefully it'll
catch on. It debuted at number four out of

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.959
all comedy podcasts and it pretty much is
hovering between, it was at number one for

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:51.790
a little while. We kind of, here's what happens.
Your show downloads on a Tuesday, it goes

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.509
to number one, then that guy's show downloads
on a Wednesday and then it goes to number

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:05.290
one. So we're in this kind of pitched battle
for nothing by the way, I don't know if you

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.290
know this.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.290
[laughter]

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Podcasts are free.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.290
[laughter]

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.069
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, we're in a pitch battle
for who can spend more of their own money

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.140
on shit for other people.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140
[laughter]

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.459
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: But, um, but it is nice because
it's, I'm the only woman in the top ten comedy

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:24.280
list and that's really gratifying and I'm
really proud of the show and people are responding

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.440
to it really nicely. I mean, this is again
something where I had an idea for a show.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.700
Shall I tell my whole life story?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Please.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.120
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I was born a poor black child.
Um, no. What it is is that we were talking

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.200
about this. My parents divorced when they
were kind of young. And this is, you know,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.530
the kind of the, the divorce battle over kids,
that's something that rich people do. I don't

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.890
know if you've noticed that.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.890
[laughter]

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:53.850
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's the rich people that are
like, you know, you can't have the children

00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:01.440
until you give me the third car, you know.
Poor people are like, you don't have any money,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:09.680
I don't have any money, just take one. Which
one do you want?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680
[laughter]

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.780
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: If I can buy groceries, I'll
buy them. If you can buy them, you buy them.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.840
I don't, I can't even afford this phone conversation
right now.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840
[laughter]

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:27.140
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, my parents, my mom got
my sister and my dad took me and I just was

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.120
raised by a single dad. And he was a great
guy and a really attentive, really loving

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.490
dad, but he was a guy. And so I had this very
guy-oriented childhood. My dad took me, the

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.440
first movie he took me to see was Road Warrior,
which is really

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
[laughter]

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.539
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Great entertaining, just like
for an eight or nine year old girl. That's

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:56.030
a good, that's a good. Daddy, they ripped
they guys hand off with a chain, why? Wanna

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:02.360
sleep with the light on? I don't wanna sleep
ever again, that's what I don't want. And

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:09.280
my dad didn't even have a car, we didn't have
a car until I was in high school, so I grew

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.990
up on the back of a motorcycle and my dad
actually had to build this harness, he had

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:19.010
a custom-built harness to hold me on the bike,
'cause I was such a nerd I would read on his

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:24.120
back. And then I'm like, what's gonna happen
with Frodo and Bilbo? And I would sort of

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.230
start to fly off.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.230
[laughter]

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.510
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, um, sort of to keep me
from death by science fiction, he had to,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:37.500
he had, he had this thing he would strap me
to his back so I could read on his back. So,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.020
I just had this really, really like dude-like
childhood. Also, like, you know, like dads

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.520
have this really simplistic approach to day
care. I mean now, it's nowadays where we're

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.260
like, you know, little Billy's allergic to
peanuts, and, ah, well he's not allergic,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:52.220
he just doesn't like them and he gets hyper
when he eats them and no television if it's

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.220
not Charlie Rose.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.220
[laughter]

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.890
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know back then my dad was
like, "Look, I have a date. I'm dropping you

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.650
off at the arcade with $20 in quarters. Don't
talk to strangers." That was how it was.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.650
[laughter]

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:09.780
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I grew up on video games. I'm
a huge gamer. I played. I was like a big defender.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:18.640
I was a huge defender. We had the Defender
game across the street in the Laundromat from

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:25.570
my house. And that, I just would wear that
shit out. And just, and just the push all

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.100
buttons and just rahhhh, you know I'm like,
tinier kids would come in and I'd go like,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.910
you're not getting on this game until you're
like 11, so just get out of here, leave now.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:34.910
[laughter]

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.110
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So I was just a huge gamer.
And I just wanted to do, I was, I wanted to

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.960
do a show that was about the stuff that I
was into and when I would talk to people about

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:49.380
doing it as a TV show, they would go, ahh,
boys aren't gonna, boys aren't gonna watch

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.770
a girl talk about guy stuff, you know. You
know unless you're gonna take your shirt off.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:53.770
[laughter]

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.470
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Sure, guys wanna hear you talk
with your shirt off, that's what they want.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.860
OK. So at every strip club they're like, I'd
like to play $20 so we could talk about raising

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.500
the debt ceiling; that would be great. If
you could sit on my lap while we discuss world

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.570
politics, that would be really

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.570
[laughter]

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.970
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, uh, I just said I'm gonna
make this show. And I just made the show.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.419
And, and, and people really love it and I
think it has a different, it feels different

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:12.980
than a lot of other podcasts in that it's
a one-on-one conversation, not just with men.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:18.529
It's, it's, it's about guy stuff, but I do
have women on the show as well and I talk

00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:24.250
with a lot of female comedians because probably
95 percent of our time we're the only woman

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:30.240
in the work context that we're in and its,
I've been to comedy clubs where I look at

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.830
their calendar for the year and there are
51 weeks of guys and me. So we have a very

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.970
specific kind of life and I just wanted to
make a show that came from the perspective

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:52.590
and it's been great and people love it because
they get to come on and talk about their lives

00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:00.440
and not talk about their work. I mean, I think
you do 30 interviews about a project and it's

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.600
just refreshing to sit down and just talk
about who you are and how you got to where

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:09.060
you are right now, so. And we curse a lot.
Whee. There's no FCC in the interwebs.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.060
[laughter]

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.580
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So it's great.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.530
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Wonderful. Speaking of video
games.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.210
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Uh huh.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.720
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I saw in the interview that
you actually play a voice in Halo Reach.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.800
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Uh huh, uh huh.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.880
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: How many of you guys play
Halo?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Anybody play Halo? Anybody
heard of Halo? Anybody?

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.990
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I'm pretty sure that there's
somebody that plays Halo.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.550
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Anybody ever break a bone and
have to wear a halo?

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.550
[laughter]

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.100
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, I'm a huge, Halo was
probably my gateway drug back into gaming.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.020
I stopped playing for a long time and then
I started playing the first Halo game and

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:44.830
uh, I don't even remember that year. I think
I blacked out, really, just.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.860
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Really? [chuckling]

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.730
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's really, it's really sad
to be a grown woman with a mortgage and be

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.960
up at 4:00 on a Tuesday trying to kill digital
aliens. That's just

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.960
[laughter]

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.789
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That makes you want to reconsider
your whole, all your life choices up to that

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:55.789
point.

00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:56.789
[laughter]

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:59.070
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: But I will say, you guys are
all here safe and sound right now 'cause of

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.409
shit I did on Halo last night. That's all
I'm saying.

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:03.409
[laughter]

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:13.390
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I save the universe every day
so you can come here and eat organic nut things.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.390
[laughter]

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.370
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: And you're preparing for
the zombie invasion?

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.970
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I am ready for the zombie apocalypse
by the way, fully prepared. If it goes down,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.720
I've got crossbows. I'm ready to go. I've
got a sawed-off. I got a hammer.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.340
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: That's what I'm talking about.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.340
[laughter]

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.679
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Sometimes you need a hammer.
Sometimes you want to kill a zombie with no

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:28.679
noise.

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:29.679
[laughter]

00:23:29.679 --> 00:23:30.679
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: There are times, there are
times when it, that call for silence, you

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:33.120
know what I mean, and that's when a hammer
comes in very handy.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.140
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Very nice.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.470
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: The zombies are dumb, but they're
also slow, and that what's great about zombies.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.029
I prefer a zombie apocalypse to an alien invasion
if we had to get into it, I think. Aliens,

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:47.399
all, they seem fast, right? How come they
never an alien movie about like blobs coming

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:48.429
down and just.

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:49.429
[laughter]

00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.070
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Like you're just like, there's
aliens! And they're just like, yeah, we're

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:59.440
here. We're gonna, we're gonna fuck you up
at some point.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.440
[laughter]

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.070
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Really like a four-hour movie.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:09.279
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Maybe not as exciting, I
don't know.

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:13.420
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Not so exciting. We're just
like, we're like, what's that new coffee table?

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.799
It's an alien. They don't move very quickly.
A year is like 4,000 of our years.

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:20.630
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: We should be ready for them
with your hammer.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.010
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: We've got plenty of time. We've
got plenty of time. Yeah, and then we'll hit

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.039
'em with a hammer.

00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:27.039
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Awesome.

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.039
[laughter]

00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:31.410
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Another project you have
is that you are currently a voice as the super

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.550
sexy spy Lana Kane.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.550
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.560
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: On Archer.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.090
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Archer. Yeah. I love that show
so much.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.870
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Which is the highest rated
show in FX history. Which is pretty awesome.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:40.870
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's pretty exciting.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.770
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You have, you've had a lot
of firsts.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.610
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I've had a lot of firsts.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.779
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: First woman, first African
American, it's all wonderful.

00:24:46.779 --> 00:24:51.000
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I don't really know how it
happened. I don't know, do any of you guys

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.280
listen to the Nerdist podcast? Anybody here?
Anybody?

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.570
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: There was a hand back there.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:04.279
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Nice. I, I, I don't wanna be,
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna state the

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:09.490
obvious, but I'm confused that there's one
guy at Google who's heard of the Nerdist podcast.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.490
[laughter]

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.490
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Scary.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.520
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: There's one guy that admitted
it, but there's many more in the audience.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.679
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh. It's OK. You guys are cooler
than I expected. It's awesome. We're into

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:23.110
the sex and guns podcast, bitches. Bam!. Um,
so, ah, but Chris, Chris was, Chris just sent

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.260
me an e-mail and he was like, he was like
took a picture, you know a little screen grab

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:33.220
of my show at number one on iTunes and he
said, "Look at you." And I said, "I have no

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:46.840
idea how this happened." And I really don't.
I have no idea how all these firsts happened.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:26:05.309
I did it. I'm not running around thinking
that I'm gonna be a trailblazer. I think,

00:26:05.309 --> 00:26:30.549
um, I'm just trying to do stuff that I'm interested
in and that I'm excited about and that feel

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:42.429
compelling to me. You know, I think the entertainment
business is shot through with originality,

00:26:42.429 --> 00:26:47.789
um, [audience laughs] and, uh, yes, driven,
just driven by the, by a desire to be new

00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:56.100
and different. And I just, I just, I just
felt like I wanted to find a way to be excited

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:06.470
every time when I got up from work. You know
this business, people always go, "Well, how

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:11.440
do you pick your projects? How do you choose,
you know, these original things? How did you

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.350
become such a ground breaker?" I'm like, look,
the person who can say yes to jobs is Tom

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:29.160
Cruise. That's the guy whose like, "I'd like
to do this." The rest of us are like, "Please,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:43.940
sir, may I have some more? I'm so hungry.
I'd like to make enough to make my SAG minimum

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:52.789
for health insurance this year, please."

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:54.269
[laughter]

00:27:54.269 --> 00:28:01.299
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: "I'll be on, I'll be an extra
on Jersey Shore. Please, so hungry." So I

00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:06.820
don't know that I've chosen to be a ground
breaker, I've just been lucky. Um, and, that

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:14.980
some things have come along that have been
interesting and exciting. I've said no to

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:25.240
some things. I've said no to some things that
I thought might not be the best use of my

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:39.840
talent. You know. But, but I don't know how,
I don't know how that happened. You know,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:52.260
I just, Friends was, I didn't think, like,
I'm gonna go be the first black girl on Friends,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.390
I'd made a little flag, you know, yeah, here
we go everybody, you know?

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.390
[laughter]

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:57.390
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's not like that at all.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.789
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: We all did that, though.
We celebrated.

00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:05.769
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean,
afterwards you kind of look back and you look

00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:11.570
at whatever it is, you're just trying to do
good work and then you look back and you see

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.500
that maybe the assembled body of the work
that you've created is, is bigger than the

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:26.722
sum of any one part that you know that you
were making at the time. Um. That was a show

00:29:26.722 --> 00:29:31.100
that I was a fan of and, uh, and I went and
I auditioned for it and the reason I think,

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.470
one of the big reasons I think I got it was
because I had seen every episode of Friends

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.380
when I went in there, you know? So I knew,
I was like I know what, I know what these

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.360
guys want, you know? But it wasn't like I
thought I'm gonna change the world. And it

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.690
wasn't a role that was written for an African
American actress. I auditioned, yeah, no,

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.520
it wasn't written African American, not in
the text, they auditioned, it was me, three

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.460
other Caucasian actresses and an Asian actress.
I mean it was, they were just looking for

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.440
the right person and with, with Archer, again,
it was like I got this script. It was an amazing

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.210
script for a tiny show that I was sure nobody
was ever gonna see.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.210
[laughter]

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:06.260
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Mainly 'cause I got to say
the word ballslappiest in the pilot.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260
[laughter]

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.549
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I was like this is not getting
on television. Does anybody? Anybody? You

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:16.740
guys have like a standards and practices group?
And we still feel that way. You know we went

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:22.720
to Comic-Con last year with a show and it
was a room of about this many people and then

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.350
we went there this year and it was an airplane
hanger of people. And it was so exciting and

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:32.179
it wasn't like, "We're so awesome." It was
like, if this is all the people that ever

00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:34.940
watch our show, this is plenty, this is so
great, you know.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.940
[laughter}

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.430
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, this is enough. I'm happy
now. So I just, I, I, you know I also feel

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:48.289
like having been such a weird kid and such
a kind of an outsider my whole life, I'm very

00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:51.309
comfortable being in that place and I think
if you're comfortable being an outsider and

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:55.980
you embrace it, the likelihood is much higher
that you're gonna make work to please yourself

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.990
and not other people and therefore that work
will stand out and, and will be compelling,

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:08.300
you know. I don't, I don't wanna be everybody's
friend, I just wanna be all the weird kids'

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.780
friends. You know. They're just.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.550
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You're at Google, so.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.100
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, sweet. It's a whole campus
full of weird kids.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.100
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Exactly.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.100
[laughter]

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.429
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Who by the way, I tell people
now, you know, like they would say what would

00:31:20.429 --> 00:31:24.200
you say to like the teenage you or what would
you say to kids like you? And I'm like, you

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.440
know, and this is not my idea, this is an
old saw, but all the kids I went to with,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.990
like hung out with in high school or saw in
high school that were like hot, and they were

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.110
having sex. Who has sex in high school? Who
has sex in college?

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.110
[laughter]

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.059
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Who has sex in their 20's?
No, um,

00:31:38.059 --> 00:31:39.059
[laughter]

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:42.289
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: All the kids that were super
cool in high school, like popular and good

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:47.710
looking, like, they never had to try. You
know what I mean? They never had to try to

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:52.690
fit in. They never had to try to be smart
or be funny. They never had to try to make

00:31:52.690 --> 00:32:01.940
their ideas heard. It just was very easy for
them. Their life was very much a lay up. And

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.899
those are the people that when they get out
in the real world, it's very, very difficult

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:13.789
for them. You know? They, they just everything
feels very easy and for the kids that really

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:20.799
struggle, that really, you know, felt like,
there's only, there's nobody like me, those

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:28.340
are the kids that strike out and they do original
things and they do, you know and they do stuff

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:35.149
like, uh, Google, and they create new ideas
and they create new businesses because you

00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:41.610
know they don't, they feel like no one's gonna
like this. Well, no one already likes me.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:42.610
[laughter]

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.559
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know what I mean? You know?

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:45.559
[laughter]

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:50.430
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I'm good with the pariah shit.
It's OK. You know, so.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.430
[laughter]

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.210
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: As they eat their Ramen noodles.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.210
[laughter]

00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:01.590
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: In the corner. Uh, so, so for
me it's just been, I'm really trying. And

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.080
now maybe there's a part of me that feels
like, like there's this you know there's a

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.460
community online of different kinds of people
that have come up now around the stuff that

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.160
I've done or that are excited about the stuff
that I've done. Like I wanna make it cool

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.230
for, uh, for little, for little girls to like
stuff that no little girls shouldn't like.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:29.190
And I wanna make it cool for little kids who
are you know not white to like stuff that

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:35.400
like not-white kids aren't supposed to like.
Like I listened to punk rock and I skated

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.570
and I, and you know I listened to heavy metal
when I was in high school, mainly 'cause I

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:45.120
was sick of people telling me, "Black kids
don't skate and black kids don't like heavy

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.470
metal. And black." It was like, go shove it!
I'm gonna set this on fire and then I'm gonna

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.510
shove it for you.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.510
[laughter]

00:33:52.510 --> 00:34:00.269
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know I just hated that.
I hated being told what I need, what I should,

00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:13.390
should do and how to fit in. So for me I just,
I want it to be OK to be weird, to be a weird

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:18.360
kid, you know, and also to be a really weird
adult. I think you that you know that's good.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.460
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I think you've accomplished
that.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.380
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: To embrace your weirdness,
yeah.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.050
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I think you've accomplished
that.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:27.780
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: What's that? Have I accomplished
that?

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.830
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I think so.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.750
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Well, I'm really weird.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:34.750
[laughter]

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.840
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I know that part. Yeah, I'm
OK with that. Yeah. And now I just, it's just

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.260
too late. You just get to a point in your
life you say no really, I'm so tired, I'm

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:49.940
just so tired. I could try to change, but
I, bad, Breaking Bad is coming on. I'll change

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.940
in a week or two, I just. I've gotta go back
and watch all of Game of Thrones again. Then

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.460
I'll change. I'll change after that. Yeah.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.640
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I love that show.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.220
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. Ned, why did they
do it to Ned? Oh my God. There's the best

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.900
YouTube video. OK. So here's a good example
of this.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.900
[laughter]

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.580
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: First let me say that Aahhhh!
[squeals]

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.580
[laughter]

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.260
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That was 8-year old Aisha coming
out.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.410
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You got a little exited.
You got a little excited. It's fine.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:23.810
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I get so excited about Game
of Thrones; I'm gonna start crying.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.410
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It's OK. It's alright.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:30.210
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, um, Game of Thrones made
me so crazy. And, it was all I could think

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.230
about, talk about, anybody else? Nobody? And
uh the second to last episode, does anyone,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:37.860
I don't want to. Spoiler alert. Um, if you,
if you were in a like a worm hole up until

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:43.120
then, yeah, cover your ears. If you haven't
seen it, leave the room. You do know you can

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.110
download it on the internet. So um and also
this isn't in my joke but like the whole thing

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.610
where I like posted something about it like
four days after the second-to-last episode

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.660
happened, so I'm like Aisha spoiler alert.
I was like there's already a spoiler out there

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.660
it's called the book. But. Is my mic off?
Is it off?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.660
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: We'll switch. Here.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.660
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I broke it.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Switch.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.660
[laughter]
[taps mic]

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.660
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: OK good. So, um, so uh, so
the second-to-last episode something very

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:06.600
terrible happens to Ed Stark and ah, and then
like we were there was like this five minute

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.600
thing in the, in the, on the couch where you
just stared at the TV like you couldn't believe

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.830
it, like you were just waiting for like magical
elves to come and be like, "No, he's not dead.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:24.180
Do dah do dah do do." You know like Ewoks,
do dah do dah do jub jub. And um, and then

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:29.620
it was like it was so upsetting so why we
like mourned for a little while as nerds are

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:37.020
want to do and we went away, we played a little
Braid, a little bit of Portal 2 and we eased

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:44.830
through it. And um, there's this video on
the internet and it just shows you how diverse

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:52.210
kind of nerddom is now 'cause there, it's
this, this black guy, one of my people, and

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:59.960
he is so upset, he is so upset about, about
Ned dying and his friend is filming him and

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:08.220
the guy is going crazy. He's like, he's using,
he's using a specific word that my people

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.300
like to use occasionally. And ah, but I'm
not gonna use that word. He's just going,

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.000
"They killed my brother Ned, they killed my
brother Ned." And he's like, his friend's

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.880
like, "It's like somebody really died."

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880
[Laughter]

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.360
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's the best thing. And he's
kicking things and I'm like, that's how I

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.720
feel right now. They killed Ned.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: It's horrible.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.593
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So yes. This, being a nerd
is very hard. We're just so much more emotional

00:37:29.593 --> 00:37:31.070
than regular people, you know. We, suspension
of disbelief is not a joke with nerds, that's

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.070
what I'm saying.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.070
[laughter]

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.070
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Alright. You OK now?

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:38.360
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: No, I'm not, I'm really not
OK now.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360
[laughter]

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.610
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I'm working through it, but
I'm not OK. No.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:44.610
[laughter]

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.070
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Sweating. I knocked my chair
over.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.070
[laughter]

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:52.370
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Just imagine that I was this
exact girl, this exact size, and I was eight.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.370
That's

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:54.370
[laughter]

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.370
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You can just. Yes. Why won't
anybody play with me?

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.370
[laughter]

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.370
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's pretty much how it was,
so

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:58.370
[laughter]

00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:59.370
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Thank you. That, I mean, that's

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.600
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: That's real nice.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.720
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That's only mildly hyperbolic,
I want you to know. Alright.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720
[laughter]

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.320
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: I'm gonna wait for them to
calm down in the front over there.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320
[laughter]

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.190
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Let's bring it down a little
bit.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:15.850
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: We can, can we? Can we bring
it down? Is it possible?

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.940
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Let's bring it down a little
bit.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.000
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I don't think so.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.440
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: And talk about how you're
also an author.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.430
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I am an author. I wrote a book.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.270
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You're a contributor to Glamour
magazine. You write about the media's unrealistic

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:32.570
portrayal of feminine beauty.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.871
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I do that.

00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:37.560
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You're a comedic columnist
for the Entertainment Weekly and you wrote

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:47.430
a book called Swerve: Reckless Observations
of a Post-Modern Girl.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.740
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, hum.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:55.510
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Could you please tell us
what that's about?

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.390
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I don't know.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.390
[laughter]

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:08.040
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, you know, I ah, I, yes,
I, I wanted to write. The reason the book

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:17.020
came about was because I was doing these stand
up shows and my stand up was very much like

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.640
a conversation, it's not like a series of
jokes. I just kind of talk with the audience

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.210
and I really want it to feel like we're having
a conversation as a, as a group. But what

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.340
happened is that we'd have these great conversations
with fans after the show and, and they were

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:35.410
in much more long form and more sprawling
and I just wanted to have that kind of conversation

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:41.870
with people in, about things that I knew I
wasn't gonna be able to really fit into a

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:52.450
like the one-hour show that I do. So I, I,
it was, it's a, and also at the time I think

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:58.850
I had just read Chuck Klosterman's first book,
Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs, which is the best

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:06.990
book ever. Oh my God, if you haven't read
it, you have it read it right now. He's like

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.400
so amazing. 'Cause he kind of does, he's one
of these people that kind of synthesizes,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.050
kind of socio-cultural analysis and like big-thinking
ideas with like really, really low culture

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:19.490
stuff. You know what I mean? And, ah, you
know, so he's just, there's like, you know

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.791
this stuff about serial killers and stuff
about cereal, you know what I mean, in the

00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:23.791
same book. And, um.

00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:24.791
[laughter]

00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:26.620
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And it's almost, almost rhyming.
And uh, so I just, I loved that and I wanted

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:32.660
to write a book that was in that vein, so
Swerve is a, is a collection of essays about

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.930
popular culture from my point of view and
there is some kind of, it's not a how-to book,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.630
it's not a self-help book, it's not an autobiography.
It's really just kind of the same socio-cultural

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:47.630
analysis that I do. I sound so much smarter
than I am. Learn like five big words, just

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.720
sprinkle them liberally throughout a conversation.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720
[laughter]

00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:01.220
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That I do in my act which is
just talking about who we are as a culture

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:13.460
and how we see things as a culture and kind
of turning it on its head. So, ah, but it's

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:18.210
everything from talking about, God I don't
even have, the book is here somewhere, but

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:24.880
everything from using the Art of War as a
dating manual, to um

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.880
[laughter]

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.620
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yes. It's really effective.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.570
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You want to elaborate on
that one?

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.960
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Either you're gonna get laid
or somebody's gonna die. One or the other.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960
[laughter]

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:54.960
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Um, siege techniques very good
when trying to pick up on a guy or a girl.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:04.800
Um, and ah, and also just about like the kind
of the rise of the music video and the music

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.380
video culture and what that's doing to the
way that we see ourselves and the way that

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.130
we relate to each other. But they're all funny.
They're all funny essays and there's a lot

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:20.920
of drinking stories in there. I'm a comedian,
so it's all gonna end with drinking at some

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.870
point. Because we get booze for free. Uh huh.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.870
[laughter]

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.040
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I don't know if you knew that
about our job. In the beginning they just

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.120
pay you in chicken wings and lite beer, that's
just, you know, yeah.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120
[laughter]

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.770
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: A classy way to make a living.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:36.330
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Very classy. Um, if we have
any live questions in the room, go ahead and

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.090
line up at the mic. In the meantime, I'm going
to ask a question from our dory page.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.090
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: From who?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.090
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Our dory page.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:42.090
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Your what page?

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.610
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: That's our internal tool.
You can see the questions up there. So those

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:45.720
are people that submitted questions online.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.810
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: OK, what did you call it?

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.810
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Dory.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.010
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Dory. What is that? Is that
an acronym?

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.430
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: We name our tools stuff.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.340
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Like a person, like the fish?

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.970
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Yeah. Like Nemo.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:00.880
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You guys have a lot of time
on your hands here at Google.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880
[laughter]

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Alright. I'm ready.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.890
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You ready?

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:12.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Alright. What good versus
bad advice have you been given about how to

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.510
succeed as a woman, a woman of color in the
industry? Who have been your best mentors?

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.940
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oooohhhhhh. Uh, wow, OK. I
will say, the, the. I'm gonna answer that

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.950
in two parts, the second part first. Uh, my
best mentors have been my parents, and specifically

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.630
my father. Um, my dad grew up in Pittsburgh,
which wasn't really a hoppin' town back then

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.290
and hasn't really improved much since then.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.290
[laughter]

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:38.440
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And, ah, Detroit looks at Pittsburgh,
and goes man, you gotta get your shit together.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440
And uh

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440
[laughter]

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.930
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And, but and he was in a family
with, his dad died when he was very young

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.580
and he was the only man, four sisters and
his mom, and just, you know, in poverty, and

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.300
didn't make it past the eighth grade and was,
you know, had to really struggle when he was

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.960
a teenager and then just completely remade
his life. And my father is such an optimist.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.170
He's not a Pollyanna, you know, he's not,
he's not like an idealist. He is somebody

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:07.170
who just doesn't quit. And what that translates
to when you're a little kid is, "I know you

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.360
broke your arm, suck that shit up." But, ah

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360
[laughter]

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.270
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: What it translates to as an
adult is that you're the architect of your

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:20.860
own destiny and you can do anything that you
wanna do. And my dad would he had a lot of

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:25.610
he's a big aphorism guy, he's got a lot of
sayings. I don't know, do dads go to a class

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.440
when there like, you know what I mean? Like
your wife is pregnant, there's like a secret,

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:38.740
OK you gotta come up with some sayings. We're
gonna pitch some stuff out today. But my dad

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.230
had a lot. His favorite was, "Keep your grades
and you drawers up." That was his favorite

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.230
one.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:44.230
[laughter]

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.230
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Classic. It holds up even to
this day, really right? So.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.230
[laughter]

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.180
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And he would give me a big
speech when I would leave the house and it

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:53.770
had along the lines of, "What are you gonna
do today?" And I'd have to go, he'd say, "Whose

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:59.560
day is it." And I'd say, "It's my day." And
then he'd say, "What are you gonna do?" And

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.310
I'd say, "Grab it by the balls." Uh, so.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.310
[laughter]

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.190
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Again super appropriate when
you're eight.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:06.190
[laughter]

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:11.970
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So. And we always joked that
my father is such a forward-looking person

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:19.910
that if his house was on fire, he would go
get marshmallows and a stick. Do you know

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.910
what I mean?

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:21.910
[laughter]

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:26.300
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: He's that guy. He just cannot
be, he cannot be defeated, you know? And so,

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:32.000
he's probably my biggest mentor. In the business,
I would love to say, I would love to say that

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.730
there have been women who have mentored me,
but there, it's mostly been men. I, assuming

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.330
they were all trying to sleep with me.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.330
[laughter]

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:37.330
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Most likely.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.190
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Most likely. Oh, they lost
out big time. Ha ha. Who won? Me!

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.190
[laughter]

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.280
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: No, you know, mainly because
comedy is dominated by men. I've had women

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:47.290
who've been really good friends and good supporters.
But when I was looking forward it was mostly

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:53.110
guys and a couple of comedians that really
I remember vividly a comedian named Tom Rhodes,

00:45:53.110 --> 00:46:00.980
who I don't think he's a bay area native,
but he's lived here for a long time and he's

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:08.350
incredibly smart and incredibly funny and
would let me come and do like a guest set,

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:14.810
which is where you go to their show and do
a few minutes on their show and he was just

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:20.050
incredibly, like you know, encouraging. I
remember going to him once and I was like,

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:28.220
"Well, just tell me what to do, like to be
like you? Like how do I get to where you are?"

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:37.590
And he's like, you just gotta keep getting
on the stage. And I was like, "You just don't

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.500
want me to know." You know.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.500
[laughter]

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.750
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: But, you know, it was true.
It was just like an athlete. You know the

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:49.160
way you win races is by running races and,
um, so he was incredibly helpful. George Lopez

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:55.340
has been really, really kind to me over the
years. And, yeah, I mean, you know, this is

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.760
a self-starting business, comedy. It's not
like a business where you get a job and you

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.330
work and you build up equity and a reputation
and you move forward and unless you touch

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:08.070
somebody on the boobs inappropriately or set
your desk on fire, you're gonna move forward.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.540
You know what I mean? My job is a job where
you can be the CEO, and then be fired and

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.620
be the assistant, and then be the CEO again
and be fired and be assistant, then be the

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.230
CEO a third time and then, and then flame
out miserably because you wrote a check to

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.810
a whore in Las Vegas for $30,000. I don't
know who that is. Who did that?

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.810
[laughter]

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.450
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You know who that is.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.820
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, Charlie Sheen. So, um.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.970
[laughter]

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:36.520
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's not a meritocracy, my
business at all. That doesn't that mean hard

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:42.980
work isn't valuable, but it's not what, a
lot of times talented, hard-working people

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:51.460
don't get ahead, and awful, terrible, half-naked
drunks get a fourth season of their show on

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.430
MTV. Who could that be? Jersey Shore. So,
uh.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:54.430
[laughter]

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.350
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You have to, you have to believe
in yourself. And be unwavering in your belief

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:05.850
that you have something to contribute. And
there aren't a lot of people, not that they're

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:13.370
selfish, but they're just, it's such a every
man and woman for themselves kind of a business

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:19.780
that it's rare for someone to kind of take
you under their wing. You mostly, it's more

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:27.070
of a foxhole mentality. Like we're all, people
are always like, hey, get my movie made. I'm

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:31.450
like, dude I can't get my movie made, so,
um, you know, I'll take you out to lunch.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:35.980
So we do a lot of, there's a lot of kind of
like, you know what I mean, lateral collaboration

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.290
I think in my business, yeah.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.900
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Very nice. OK. Do we have
a question?

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:47.050
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #1: Hi, Aisha, my
name's Belinda.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.050
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Hi, Belinda.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.450
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #1: It's a pleasure
to meet you, for.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:51.450
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Thank you.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:56.650
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #1: I have a statement.
It's very quick because I know a lot of people

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:06.880
have questions, but I first noticed you when
you were hosting Talk Soup and you immediately

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:25.870
jumped out at me because I saw my daughter
in you. My daughter is a, is a theater major

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:31.810
and she's been interested in performing arts
for, you know, from year one, from her birth.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:36.000
And, you know, and I've always used you as
a role model for her and it's like, look at

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.850
Aisha Tyler. And the reason why is because
she's grown up here in the bay area. She's

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:45.140
sort of the outsider. Doesn't fit into the
stereotypes of black females or in particularly

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:50.370
in her direction in performing arts. So basically
I just wanted to quickly say thank you for

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:57.900
being true to yourself and you know, because
it means so much for other people who also

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.430
want to be true to themselves. So thank you
very much.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.510
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That's really kind. Thank you
so much.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.510
[clapping]

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.510
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: Uh.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:06.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I wonder if you play video
games?

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:07.650
[laughter]

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.830
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: A little, a little
Halo.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.740
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: A little bit? OK.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.740
[laughter]

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:17.150
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: So I just wanna
know what's going on with season three, Archer?

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:23.510
If you have any comments for if it's gonna
stay like as, as good, if it's, you know.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:29.580
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Is it gonna stay as, is it
gonna suck? Is that your question?

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.580
[laughter]

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:35.610
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Please don't suck. Um, well
we're working on season three right now. And

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:40.380
it's gonna be friggin' awesome. And it's,
yes, it's gonna be great. Our show is, I don't,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:45.070
I am just a happy, like, bus rider on our
show. The guy who created it, Adam Reed, is

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:49.540
a genius. He writes amazing scripts. He writes
the entire show by himself. When we got our

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:53.630
second season order, they were like, "Hey,
now you're a big man, you can hire you know

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.970
oompa loompas to write the show." You know?
And no one can, no one could really write

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.620
the show the way that Adam wrote it, so now
Adam writes everything, which I'm sure he

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.710
really regrets, except for when he's lying
on a big bag of money.

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:03.710
[laughter]

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:04.710
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, but it's. He's amazing.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:07.660
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: So are you, are
you just the voice then?

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.590
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I'm just the voice. Here's
how the show works. He writes an amazing script.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.550
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: So you're not just.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.020
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I'm just the voice.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.020
[laughter]

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.020
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I also sweep up.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.020
[laughter]

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.570
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: [laughing] It's OK. Adam writes
these amazing scripts and then it's, we get

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.750
in the room and we each record our parts completely
separate from each other. But what we do a

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:31.520
lot of is say it a million times, say it this
way, say it that way, add this word, change

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:38.100
that word, now go nuts. So we do a lot of
ad-libbing in the, and they animate to what

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:44.030
we've recorded. So we do a lot of ad-libbing
in the recording process. And a lot of things

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.730
that we've said in casual conversation end
up in following episodes because it's really,

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.850
we're a comedy troupe, you know, and we've
really started to figure out each other's

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:58.380
tempo and voice, so. But I, but I wish I could
take credit for the show. If I could, I guarantee

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:04.390
you I would. But we're doing, it's a, it's
a larger season this season. We had 13 episodes

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:09.540
last season, it's gonna be 16 this season.
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, you gotta check it out.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540
[clapping]

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.680
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: The first episode airs September
15. Yeah.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.960
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: Cool, thanks.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Very nice

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Hi.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.480
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #2: Hi, um, hi, I'm
Jana. I actually just graduated from Dartmouth.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.700
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh my God, that's awesome.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.700
[clapping]

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:29.340
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #2: I brought this,
it's probably a six out of ten on the tacky

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.840
scale, but I brought it anyway.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.540
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: That's adorable, no it's like
a 10 on a 10 on the awesome scale.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.540
[laughter]

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.940
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #2: Thank you. I
just wanted to know about your experience

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.300
at Dartmouth and how it impacted you. I just
came from there and so, it's an interesting

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:46.600
place to be sometimes as a black female, but
how it impacted you in your pursuit of your

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600
career.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.710
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I found my husband there.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:49.710
[laughter]

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:54.890
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know, not that I was planning
on getting married. God. Did you guys know

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.100
you have to that for, like, ever? Uh, wow.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100
[laughter]

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.460
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's like, are you still here?
Really? OK. Nothing in the garage you want

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.460
to do?

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.460
[laughter]

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.580
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: [laughing] My husband and I
just had our 17th wedding anniversary. So,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.580
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.580
[clapping]

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.580
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Congratulations.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.390
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, I know. Thank you. In
Hollywood years it's like a double diamond

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.390
platinum.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:16.390
[laughter]

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:22.450
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Ah, you know, I really loved
Dartmouth. But I will say this. You know I

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:30.790
grew up in a very progressive place, obviously
I grew up in the bay area, and Dartmouth,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:34.920
when I went, was even more conservative than
it is now. It was infamous for conservatism.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.490
It was right around the time of South African
divestment, and a lot of students were protesting

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.790
and they built like this big shantytown on
the green at Dartmouth and the really like

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:47.950
arch-conservative group of kids like sledgehammered
it down in the middle of the night and almost

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:52.280
killed somebody that was sleeping inside.
I mean it was a really intense place to go

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.300
to school. My high school counselor said,
"Don't got there, because you're gonna martyr

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:01.160
your college career." And then I said, "I'm
going to set this on fire and shove it up

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.840
your butt." And I went there immediately.
Yeah. So, um, don't ever tell me not what

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.730
to do. You know what I mean? I'll do it. Except
for if you tell me something stupid and then

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.490
I won't do it. I mean like. But I, I loved
it maybe because I was such an outsider, again

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.500
I really embrace that and I liked being so
different. I think I wore Birkenstocks for

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:20.480
the entire freshman year, through the winter,
by the way, that takes commitment. I'd like

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.990
the ugly wool socks, I was like, I'm a hippie,
ahhh, you know and just walk around with an

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:27.790
avocado in my hand, you know, who wants some
of this?

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:28.790
[laughter]

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.320
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, um, I, I really embraced
that my outsiderness and I made a point of

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.990
making a point. I think. But what I loved
about Dartmouth was that it's a smaller school

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:39.860
and I, you can really make a mark there, you
can really, it's a, you can be a big fish

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:44.720
in a small pond, and also I was a big snowboarder,
so I spent a lot of time snowboarding there.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.720
Yeah, and I taught snowboarding. Dartmouth
has its own "mountain." And by mountain, I

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.720
mean that if you put some plywood off that
deck out there, pretty much replicate it here.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.140
So, but I loved that part about it. I was
a founding member of the Rockappellas, so

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.430
I was really into singing. Yeah. I was a weird
kid, but it was a good place to be a weird

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.480
kid. You know, it's, sometimes it's nice to
go to a place where you where you're not quite

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.960
right in the middle of the bull's eye of the
main stream. You know what I mean? Because

00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.590
you just are forced to look at yourself and
how you wanna make your life choices a little

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:02.410
bit harder. So I liked that. And I found my
people. I was in the Tabard. If you guys don't

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:06.690
know about the Tabard. One person knows about
the Tabard. OK. So, yes, the one from Canterbury

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:07.740
Tales. There was a fraternity, I'm telling
you all about stuff you didn't ask about.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.740
[laughter]

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.740
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Just continuing a theme. The
Tabard was, the Tabard was formerly a fraternity

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:10.740
called Sigma Chi, which on the national level
is very, like intensely conservative, yeah,

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.740
very conservative. And in the, oh, it's gonna
get all political, whee. OK, so in the '70s

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:12.740
it was, you couldn't get into the fraternity
if you were black or Jewish and Dartmouth

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.740
told the fraternity, if you don't start admitting
Blacks and Jews, we're gonna kick you off

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.860
of campus. And they said, "We've never heard
of Blacks or Jews, what is this that you talk

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.860
about?"

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:16.860
[laughter]

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.860
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, then they nattied their
bow tie and strode away. So, uh.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.860
[laughter]

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.770
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Dartmouth did kick them off
of campus and the result was that Sigma Chi

00:55:20.770 --> 00:55:24.030
became the Tabard and it was just jam-packed
with Blacks and Jews. And women and hippies.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.290
And it became this really liberal fraternity
that also had women, so it was a co-ed fraternity.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.230
Nobody was having sex though. Hmmm. [laughter]
And it became like this kind of paragon of

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.210
progressivism and it was a really cool place
to join because if you weren't a big joiner

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:31.050
that was the place that you could join and
feel like you were a part of a group of people

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.180
that was like you. But it was very open, I
mean there were very conservative people in

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.090
the Tabard and very liberal people in the
Tabard and it was really a place that embraced

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:36.230
otherness. No matter who you were you could
be a part and there was no judgment and it

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.290
was a great, great place. It smelled like
feet though, let me tell you that right now.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.290
So like.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:39.290
[laughter]

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:40.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Hippies, not big on the hygiene.
Alright. [laughing] It's nice to meet you.

00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:41.290
Did you like it there?

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:42.290
&gt;&gt;Female audience member #2: I loved it.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, it's so great. Yeah,
it's awesome. A lot of drinking.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.290
[laughter]

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.290
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Alright, we'll take another
Dory question really quick.

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:46.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, OK, a Dory question.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:47.290
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You've taken on Ann Coulter.
Who else would you like to debate?

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:48.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, God. Well, I just had a
big Twitter fight with Andrew Breitbart online

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.290
this week. Yeah.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.290
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Nice.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I know. He's a d-bag. Um.

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.290
[laughter]

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:53.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: They're so angry. Why are they
so angry? Do you ever think about that? Do

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.290
you ever think like do we seem that angry?
Do I seem, I don't know, I think I'm a pretty

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.290
happy person.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:56.290
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: You're not angry.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:57.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: No, I'm not angry at all. I
love everybody. Um, I do a radio show on Tuesday

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.290
mornings and it's a syndicated show, the Stephanie
Miller Show, and they have a, she has a segment

00:55:58.290 --> 00:55:59.290
called Tuesdays with Tyler every Tuesday morning,
and, I, yes, and I really will say, I

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.290
[clapping]

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.290
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, thank you. I, um, radio's
still around, what? Terrestrial radio? Where

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:02.290
does that come from? OK. So, I actually, I
am a progressive but I really do believe in

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:03.290
civil, civil civic debate. I think that you
can disagree with people in a thoughtful,

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:04.290
considered way and not resort to name calling.
I really do believe in that. I don't know

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.290
why I'm such a dumb idealist, but, um, I think
I can disagree with you and we can argue our

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:06.900
point. I'm confident enough in where I stand
to not feel like I have to force it down your

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.650
throat or call you names because we don't
agree. So, but, on that particular day, they

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.590
had played a quote from Rush Limbaugh that
was essentially the equivalent of that the

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:12.590
President is trying to turn America into a
middle-eastern fiefdom or something and, and

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:13.650
he likes to eat babies. It was something like
that. And all I said was, oh, catch on fire,

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:14.650
d-bag. And, ah,

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:15.650
[laughter]

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:16.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Which isn't even the most artful
comeback, really, is it? I'm not proud of

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:17.650
it. If I'd given, if I'd had some time I could
have written something better, but then the

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:18.650
internet lit up and I quote, "Lefty, violent
lefty liberal slut, Aisha Tyler." I was like,

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:19.650
slut? What?

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:20.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Ohhhh.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:21.650
[laughter]

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:22.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Really? Why? Um, my husband
would be interested to find that out. The

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.650
husband that I've been with for 19, since
I was 19. I'm like I wish I was, I wish I

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:24.650
could be slutty in my house, that would be
great. Right? Like, hey you and me, more than

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:25.650
once a month? Let's do this. Um.

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:26.650
[laughter]

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:27.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Anybody else been married for
17 years, come on, this isn't news. Um.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:28.650
[laughter]

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:29.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, it was so, it went so extreme
so quickly and so lefty violent liberal slut

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:30.650
who eats babies, Aisha Tyler, wishes, wants,
wants to kill, wishes murder on Rush Limbaugh

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.650
by immolation. And I was like, what?

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.650
[laughter]

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:33.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: The worst I, the worst I wish
was that he would spontaneously combust, which

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:34.650
isn't even really like a, I think we've proved
on Snopes that that could never happen, so.

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:35.650
It's like if I said, "Suck an egg." Someone
would say, "She's trying to murder him with

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.650
salmonella." You know what I mean? Like I.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.650
[laughter]

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: There's no way. There's no
winning.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:39.650
[laughter]

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:40.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: So, Andrew Breitbart said,
"I hope Aisha Tyler blanks in a blank." And,

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:41.650
ah, and, ah, and then someone wrote, "You
should have Andrew Breitbart on your show."

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.650
And then I said, "I would love that if I thought
that Andrew Breitbart was the kind of man

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.650
brave enough to have a civil conversation
with someone he disagrees with."

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Hmmm.

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Oh, zinger.

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:46.650
[laughter]

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:47.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: And he has not responded, 'cause
he's a pussy.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:48.650
[laughter and clapping]

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to bleep. This is gonna be, here's Aisha Tyler,

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:50.650
booooooooo. Thank you for coming to Google.
Goodnight.

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:51.650
[laughter]

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:52.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: One last question.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:53.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: Hi, Aisha. My name's
Curtis.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:54.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Hi Curtis.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: So my question assumes
that as a comedian, social media has been

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:56.650
a big boon for you.

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:57.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I think so.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: It seems like five
or six years ago, as long as you didn't steal

00:56:58.650 --> 00:56:59.650
somebody else's material and didn't talk smack
about them unless they stole material, you

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.650
were done. But these days it seems like you,
as a comedian, might have an obligation to

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.650
cross promote everybody else's podcast and
book and show

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:02.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Hmmmm.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:03.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: And tweets and on
and on and on and that other people, so other

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:04.650
people will do the same for you.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:05.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Right.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:06.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: Is that a correct
perception?

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: You know I think that's really
very perceptive, very astute. Maybe I would

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:08.650
use different language and not so much talk
about obligation as opportunity, in that the

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:09.650
successful podcast community is actually relatively
small. There are obviously a jillion podcasts,

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:10.650
but the podcasts that are "winning" for lack
of a better word, thanks Charlie Sheen.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:11.650
[laughter]

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:12.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Is, is very, for so many things
really, is very narrow and actually Chris

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:13.650
Hardwick said it best in that if one boat
rises in the podcast verse, which is also

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.650
his word, I don't want to say that I took
that, it's his word, we all rise. So if you

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.650
have a show that's successful, it really does
elevate all the other podcasts. And there

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:16.650
are, I'm sure there's some great ones that
no one has heard of, but the ones that are

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:17.650
at the top are generally pretty well produced
and pretty interesting. So, yeah, if you have

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:18.650
a friend who has got a show, I've never said,
"Hey, put me on your show and I'll put you

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.650
on my show." But mainly I've just called people
that I know or they've called me and you know,

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:20.650
I'm gonna do your show, why wouldn't, why
wouldn't we do that for each other, you know?

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:21.650
And there are shows that like, I just did
Sklarbro Country, which is a fantastic podcast,

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:22.650
it's a sports-oriented podcast, really well
produced. Way more like radio than my little

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:23.650
crappy thing that I do, but, ah. They, I just
was listening to their show and I tweeted,

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:24.650
"Oh my God, I'm listening to Sklarbro Country
and it's hilarious." And then they called

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.650
like three days later and said hey come on
the show. So there's that nice kind of supportive

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:26.650
thing. I think you want people who are talented
and funny to win and if you do them a favor

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.650
they want to do it back for you. So like I
just did Chris' show and he's coming on my

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:28.650
show in about a week and, and I think, I think
right now because it's still, it's, it's,

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:29.650
it's finally kind of getting some teeth, podcasting,
but it's still relatively new for the rest

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.650
of the world. I don't know what the numbers
are, but I feel like it's maybe 20 percent

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:31.650
of the country has downloaded or listened
to a podcast at some point. That's, I don't

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:32.650
know, I don't know what critical mass, I don't
know, does somebody have an algorithm in here?

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:33.650
Somebody?

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:34.650
[laughter]

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:35.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Anybody at Google have an algorithm?

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:36.650
[laughter]

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:37.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: For working out like what,
like when that's gonna be like a real number?

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:38.650
But I think, you know, again, you've got somebody
who's got a successful show, you go on their

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.650
show, that helps your show and vice versa.
And, and, so for me right now, 'cause I've

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:40.650
either done or I'm gonna do most of the big
podcasts, I just did The Nerdist, I did, Curly

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:41.650
just came on my show. I don't know if I'm
ever gonna do Mark's show. He's a shut-in

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:42.650
and an odd fellow. But you know if he asks,
I would do it. I would absolutely do it and

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:43.650
I would have him on if he wanted to come on
my show because I think it just, it helps

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:44.650
all of us and also I do one thing in the context
of my show. You know, my show is it's own

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.650
animal. I think the way that nerd, that, that
podcasts win is to really find a very clear,

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.650
a very clear path and approach for your show.
That's like, you know, people know this is

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:47.650
the experience I'm gonna have when I listen
to this podcast. And try to find something

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:48.650
that's definitive. So the experience you're
gonna have with me on my show is very different

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:49.650
than when I'm on someone else's show and vice
versa. You know what I mean? You're gonna

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:50.650
get a totally different experience and different
information from someone depending on the

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:51.650
context, so in that way I think they, they
complement. Right now the podcasts that are

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.650
doing well, that are interesting, they really
do complement each other and they're all kind

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:53.650
of parts of a pie.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:54.650
&gt;&gt;Male audience member 2: Thank you.

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:55.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It was nice talking with you.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:56.650
[laughter]

00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:57.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Thank you. I wanna make a
quick announcement. You are going to be at

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.650
Tres Agaves in San Francisco tomorrow.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:57:59.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Just drinking, just drinking.
Really, anybody? Anybody?

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: Doing a Valencia fund raiser.
And from what I understand the show is sold

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:01.650
out.

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:02.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Yeah, the show is sold out,
but if I could just say one minute about it,

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.650
if you guys don't know about 826 Valencia,
this is a charity that Dave Eggers, the genius

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:04.650
writer, yes, one person reads books. That's
awesome. Two people, alright. Hey, and e-readers

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.650
are really killing us. Uh, so Dave Eggers
created this charity called 826 Valencia that

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:06.650
tutors underprivileged youth. Provides totally
free tutoring and also kind of mentors them

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:07.650
to help tutor other kids when they get a little
older. Teachers and all kinds of other people

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.650
volunteer, help kids with their reading and
writing skills. They put out this quarterly

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:09.650
publications where kids get their work published
in a book. If you know anything about Dave

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:10.650
Eggers in print McSweeney's, if any of you
have ever seen the McSweeney's Quarterly or

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:11.650
The Believer, he is an incredible believer,
not just in the concept of the printed word,

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:12.650
but in beautifully printed books and magazines.
Like everything he makes is so pretty. Like

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:13.650
I buy The Believer, I have a Believer from
three years ago. It's just sitting. I'm not

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:14.650
opening it. What? Spindle the spine? So he's
got this amazing charity, it's now I think

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:15.650
in five American cities. It's incredibly successful
and incredibly effective in terms of the amount

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.650
of money that's donated that's turned directly
into helping kids. And they have an associated

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:17.650
charity called ScholarMatch that finds scholarship
money for kids for talented high school kids

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:18.650
who have gotten into college and can't afford
to go. So these are kids that are in four-year,

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:19.650
they've gotten into a four-year school and
they can't. I don't if you. I don't even know

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:20.650
what it costs. What do you do to pay for school
now? Literally, sell blood? I don't even understand

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.650
how. I graduated with a mortgage and that
was 20 years ago. So I don't know how, I don't

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.650
know how kids do it. So this charity, a lot
of times the kids' goals is only a couple

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.650
of thousand dollars, that's all they need,
$2,000 or $3,000, so like a $20 donation or

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:24.650
a $50 donation is a big, big deal for ScholarMatch.
So if you want to, you know, go online and

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:25.650
visit the ScholarMatch.org site or visit 826
Valencia site and see what they're doing.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:26.650
This is a guy who, you know, lost his parents
when he was young and then turned it into

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:27.650
a really, exploited his own tragedy for profit.
And uh, that's really, that's the American

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:28.650
way, isn't it? So and now he's doing stuff
for other kids and it's just, he's rah, he's

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:29.650
awesome. So the charity, the event's sold
out but you can still give and they'll be

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:30.650
other ones. Keep an eye out, 'cause ScholarMatch
does lots of fundraisers and they're great.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:31.650
And Adam Savage is gonna be there. What? And
then we're gonna blow some stuff up.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:32.650
[laughter]

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:33.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: Know what? MythBusters is so
awesome.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: It's amazing how small it is
when you put it in a bag.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.650
[laughter]

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:47.650
&gt;&gt;Aisha Tyler: I bet there's some porn in
it.

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:48.650

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:52.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: So if you look under your
chair and you have a yellow Post-It, you are

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:53.650

or other, so.

[laughter]

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:55.650
&gt;&gt;LaFawn Bailey: If you have something there's
some chairs in the back, there might be something

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:56.650
under there.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:56.666
