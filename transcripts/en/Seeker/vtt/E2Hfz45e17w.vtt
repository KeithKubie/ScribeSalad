00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.139
Scientists may have developed gene therapy
that effectively prevents AIDS.

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.389
But HIV may have mutated to bypass the new
defenses.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.419
Gah, HIV, you are such a piece of sh-

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:24.050
Hello viewers, I hope you’re healthy and
well out there, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.390
Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute
believe they are on track to a gene therapy

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.810
that will effectively render most strains
of HIV impotent.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.199
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus works by
targeting CD4+ T Cells, which are white blood

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.330
cells that play a key role in your adaptive
immune system - that’s the part that helps

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.450
you fight infections.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.760
HIV latches onto them by grabbing onto the
CD4 protein on the T cell’s surface, and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.550
then clamping down on another receptor called
CCR5.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.699
Once it’s in position, it inserts its own
RNA into the cell, tricking it into making

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.059
more viruses.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.090
It basically turns the good guy cells into
zombies.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.000
Once enough T Cells are turned, the infected
person’s immune system is compromised and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.680
vulnerable and they have Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, or AIDS.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.210
Unfortunately no effective vaccine has been
developed yet.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.119
The problem with retroviruses like HIV is
they change and adapt quickly.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.079
It’s like whack-a-mole with the deadliest
mole ever.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.020
And of course there are many strands, so a
vaccine against one strand probably won’t

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.590
be effective against others.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.060
Now though scientists think they’re on to
something.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.430
Dr. Michael Farzan and other researchers say
they’ve created a tiny strand of DNA which,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.369
when injected into muscle tissue, stimulates
the cells to synthesize a claw-shaped protein.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.229
For proteins, shapes are everything, and this
claw is HIV’s worst nightmare.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.700
It’s simple enough that even if the virus
changes, it likely won’t be able to shake

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
the claw.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.999
The protein works by latching on to the CD4
and CCR5 binding sites on the virus, leaving

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.439
it adrift and unable to latch on to T Cells.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.009
If it can’t latch on, it can’t replicate.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.520
Eventually it’s broken down and disposed
of harmlessly.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.079
This isn’t just some flash in the test tube
either.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.430
They’ve already been testing this on 4 monkeys
by giving them the gene therapy and then injecting

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.690
them with a strain of HIV for lab monkeys,
called the Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380
After nearly a year, the Macaques are A-OK.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.210
Now they’re looking to treat infected monkeys
to see if it can stop the virus from replicating

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.210
further.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.410
If that’s a success, they’re looking to
begin human trials.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.800
Don’t worry, they won’t be injecting humans
with HIV to test it, they’ll be giving the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.070
protein and gene to those either with HIV
or those at high risk.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.060
As always, nothing is guaranteed until it
happens, but it looks promising.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.910
Of course, the world being what it is, researchers
in Cuba believe they have found a new strain

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.290
of HIV that skips the CCR5 bonding site and
goes straight for the one known as CXCR4.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.280
Normally HIV transitions to the CXCR4 protein
after years, during which time the host is

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.580
relatively healthy.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.060
Once it switches though the descent to AIDS
begins.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.620
This new strand, which researchers believe
is the combination of several other HIV subtypes,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.340
fast tracks AIDS leading to earlier death.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.620
It’s no more infectious than its predecessors,
but it might render this new treatment ineffective.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.330
So, one step forward and one step back?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.950
But keeping things on the positive tip - if
scientists can keep that new strain from spreading,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.270
then we may have an effective treatment for
all the other variants of HIV in the pipeline.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.950
One day HIV may be some terrifying disease
that only exists in history books and memories,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.620
like polio is to our grandparents.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.930
I hope I’m around to see that day.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.370
While this isn’t technically a vaccine,
I’m sure the public will think of it as

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.000
such and of course, there will be skeptics.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.520
Here to say once again that vaccines do not
cause autism is Trace, because apparently

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.470
that still needs to be said.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.640
check it out over here.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.350
What’s your reaction to the news?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.350
Hopeful?

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.350
Skeptical?

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.350
What are your reasons?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.760
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
