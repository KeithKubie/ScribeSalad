[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.770
GLORYROSE DY: What we do is we
teach different communities.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.755
Especially those
who are off grid,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:13.250
those who don't have
access to technology,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.010
even computers and
smartphones, we

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.670
teach them how to
make digital stories.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.520
So digital stories
are videos, actually,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.726
in the form of storytelling.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.210
GLORYPEARL DY: When
we were acknowledged

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.810
for a social good by
Smart Pay it Forward,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.050
it was there that we
learned that other-- there

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.820
was an opportunity
to be sustainable.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.980
We can't just do
this as volunteers.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.890
We need to have resources.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.050
We were also recognized by
British Council Ideation Camp.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.307
And there we learned
about how to turn this--

00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:50.390
GLORYROSE DY: Social good.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.973
GLORYPEARL DY:
--company-- social good

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:53.340
into a social enterprise.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510
So there we built,
really, a business model

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.090
helping, doing
the digital story,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.770
and people-centered
design, and trying

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.610
to look for opportunities
for financial sustainability.
