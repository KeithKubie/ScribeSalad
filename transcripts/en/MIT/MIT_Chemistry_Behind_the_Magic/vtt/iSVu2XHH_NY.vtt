JESSICA HARROP: Hi,
I'm Jessica and I'm

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.853
going to be talking about
a chemical demonstration

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:14.030
today that I like to call
"Death of a Gummy Bear."

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.760
We eat these little
guys all the time

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.410
and our bodies
break down the sugar

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.837
in a series of
chemical reactions.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:26.420
But what happens when you break
down the sugar in a gummy bear

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.340
outside of our bodies?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.130
Well, MIT'S Dr. John
Dolhun is going to show us.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.350
Here he is at the Cambridge
Science Festival at MIT.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.740
JOHN DOLHUN: Now I'm
going to actually

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.470
be combusting a gummy candy.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.301
And my wife said, please
don't tell them it's a bear.

00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:46.800
Guess what?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.240
It's a bear.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.740
And I'm going to
eat one right now.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.450
And I'm eating a gummy candy.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.028
It's sugar.

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:02.690
And I'm going to chew on it, and
eat it, and what do you think's

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.262
going to happen to it?

00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:05.720
AUDIENCE: It's
going to break down.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.170
JOHN DOLHUN: It's going to
break down into carbon dioxide.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.830
Tomorrow I'm going to
be breathing out CO2.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.330
I'm going to be perspiring.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.210
Water is going to be coming out.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.090
And I'm going to
make a lot of energy,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.160
and I'm going to take that
energy and store it up as ATP,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.280
and it's going to help me clean
all these dishes tomorrow.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.620
I don't want to think
about that but I'm

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.260
going to need the energy.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.020
And now I'm going to
do this same reaction

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740
inside of a test tube.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.800
And I want you to compare
what you just saw.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.570
You didn't see a lot
of smoke and fire

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.090
coming out of my mouth, did you?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.065
Not yet, OK.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.690
So Clifton, you can.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
Clifton's going to play
a little rondo or music

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.580
while I set this reaction up.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:29.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.500
JESSICA HARROP: So what
is Dr. Dolhun doing?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.500
First, he put some solid
potassium chlorate in a test

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.780
tube and heated it up.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.885
The heat causes the solid
to melt and become a liquid.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.390
So this little
triangle means heat.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.320
It turned from a
solid to a liquid.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.560
As it's being heated, the liquid
potassium chlorate immediately

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.220
starts breaking down into two
products, potassium chloride

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.370
and oxygen. Now potassium
chloride is a solid

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.230
and the oxygen is a gas.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.070
Looks like this.

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.050
Now let's see what happens when
Dr. Dolhun adds the gummy bear.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:42.685
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:44.650
So let's break down
what just happened.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.930
The sugar from the
gummy bear and oxygen

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.960
reacted to produce
carbon dioxide and water,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.709
releasing a lot of
energy as heat and light.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.250
This is what that
looks like, and I'm

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.296
going to draw sucrose,
or sugar, in red

00:03:57.296 --> 00:03:58.670
because it's from
the gummy bear.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.500
This reaction is
probably familiar to you.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.960
It's a combustion
reaction, which

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.750
is when a fuel reacts with
oxygen to produce carbon

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.630
dioxide and water and at
the same time, releasing

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.160
a bunch of energy.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.019
So why is so much
energy released

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.820
and where does it come from?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.010
To show you, I'm going
to draw the structures.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.040
Now, if you're unfamiliar with
organic chemistry notation,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.800
each of the lines between the
elements that I'm going to draw

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.080
represents a
covalent bond, which

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.555
is the sharing of two
electrons between two atoms.

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:37.430
So let me draw those.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.300
So here are the reactants
and here are the products.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.480
Now by looking at the number
of bonds and the type of bonds,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.990
so a carbon bonded to an
oxygen, or a carbon bonded

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.010
to a carbon, and a single
bond versus a double bond,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.750
you can calculate
the energy difference

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.690
between the left side of
the reaction, the reactants,

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.940
and the right side,
or the products.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.220
Now all combustion
reactions have more energy

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.800
stored in the reactants
than the products,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.130
so as the reaction progresses,
this energy has to go somewhere

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.770
and it's released
as heat and light.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.380
Now the amount of energy
released from this explosion

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.630
is exactly the same as
the amount of energy

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.310
that would be
released in my body

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.290
when I eat this gummy bear.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.630
The difference is that
proteins in my body

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.390
are set up in pathways
that extract the energy

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.460
in small, manageable bundles.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.320
So I power my
everyday activities

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.740
like dancing and running,
but I don't explode.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.050
Evolution has trained
biological systems

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.660
to efficiently extract
energy from our environment.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.620
That's it for me today.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.578
I'll see you next time.

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:51.600
