00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.752
I'm Mark Campana.

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm 41 years old, and
I'm from Akron, Ohio.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.174
My day job is personal trainer.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.302
When I'm not training
other people, I'm at home,

00:00:11.302 --> 00:00:13.263
and I'm making knives.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.891
I have made probably
over 200 knives.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.688
And that doesn't include the
pile that nobody gets to see.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.481
I'm pretty confident
that I could win.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.067
Honestly, the hardest part
for this competition for me

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.861
isn't going to be
any of the obstacles.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.821
It's going to be me.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.613
Who made this knife?

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.198
I made it.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.659
This is a beast of a
blade, but it's not unwieldy.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.869
Do you have a weight on this?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:36.995
I have no idea.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.872
I just know that
it is not light.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.081
What have you got here?

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.458
Just an etching.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.084
Honestly, it doesn't
mean anything.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.711
I just think it looks cool.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.713
You know, sometimes that's
on purpose all of itself.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.756
That's it.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.590
Excited to see you swing it.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.759
I'm excited myself.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.012
This is a plastic
tube filled with wax.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:55.847
And it can very easily shatter.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.975
And this is a lot of
blade to slow down.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.227
It's not that this blade
will have any difficulty

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.812
generating the power.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.814
It's that I know I'm going
to contact a light object,

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.900
and I've to be able to
bring it to a safe stop.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.990
Good luck, because your
knife makes the cut.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.117
Thank you.

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.411
I'm absolutely ready
to face Knife Fight.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.788
I'm going to destroy it.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.581
NARRATOR: Next up, Mark Cantana.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.542
I tell you what,
this personal trainer

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.712
with this big, bad blade
is looking for victims

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.048
as he steps up to Knife Fight.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.927
This is a modified
chopper, 16 and 1/2 inches,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.179
three pounds of cutting power.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.889
It will chop like an axe.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.057
Let's talk about power.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:40.892
As he steps up
the trifecta, he's

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.561
going to have to be powerful.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.230
One strike right
through the rope.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.107
Look how he drops his
balance he dops his base.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.776
He's a personal trainer.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.612
He knows body mechanics.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.696
But this is technique.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:54.864
He's not really making that--

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.574
Boom!

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.952
He broke the apparatus
holding the two-by-four.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.662
That's a penalty.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.164
He has to cut the object in
half, and he did not do that.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:03.998
He broke the chain.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.500
One penalty.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.335
If you just use proper
technique with that power,

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.045
he will cut through, no problem.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.256
Just like that, boom, right
through the last two-by-four.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:13.675
He's moving on to box cutter.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:14.968
Wow.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.511
I like how he's dug
up on his handle.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.929
But look at that power.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.265
That blade almost split
the box halfway through.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.683
Look at his accuracy.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:25.019
He's able to hit the box
almost in the same area.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.521
He is fierce.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.022
Boom!

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:29.232
Tell you what, that might
be the hardest strike

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.984
those boxes have taken off.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.652
Moving on to the second box.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.362
Oh, powerful strike
right into that box.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.114
Look at that power!

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:37.866
He's very calculated.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.702
He waits for the proper time for
that box to get in the position

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.997
that he employs power.
Boom!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.747
There he goes.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:45.707
He's moving on.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.292
Next up, the Decapitator.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:49.002
We've seen a lot of
people fail at this.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.130
This definitely is
a hard apparatus.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.092
I like how he's taking his
time, studying the objects.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.136
Notice how he's using
his hip line now.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.554
Uh oh.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.223
Took his eyes off the
last couple of targets.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.350
Now he has to get it
completely horizontal.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.144
He's got to concentrate
on the follow-through,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.604
keep it straight.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.355
OK, he got it.
- Nice.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:13.067
Now he adjusts his accuracy.

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:14.319
He went right through it.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.695
Beautiful job.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.113
Steps up to Thrice.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.073
He should be able to
punch through this ice

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:20.241
block, no issue.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:23.161
That blade, the
geometry is there.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.662
Wow.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:26.581
Two slices right
through the first block.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:27.790
Look at that power.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.168
One slice right
through the second,m

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.295
and right through the third.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.338
Beautiful job.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.256
Mark Campana destroys Thrice.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.718
Moving on-- Lifeline.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.262
It's all about angles,
attack, and accuracy.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.642
Remember-- one strike
through, or you're going home.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.310
Boom, right through the chicken.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.519
He's got to take his time.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.812
He's studying the objective.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:50.813
That he is.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.190
A proper base.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.276
Boom, right through,
great Follow-through OK,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.152
cut the rope.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.153
This is hard.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.363
He needs to hit with speed.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.030
Very quick.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.037
Oh!

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.290
Taken down by the
two-edged rope.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.541
He had the proper blade.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.876
He has proper strength.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.378
But I think he went
about it wrong.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.047
It's all about coming
in at a steep angle

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.925
to let gravity take
over, and then speed.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.135
Unfortunately, that's
not what he did there.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:23.012
My knife can cut the rope.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:26.391
It was my technique that screwed
me up on that last thing.
