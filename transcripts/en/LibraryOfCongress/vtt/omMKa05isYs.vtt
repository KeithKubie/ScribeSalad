&gt;&gt; Marisa Bellack: Hello.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm Marisa Bellack.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.220
I'm an editor at "The Washington
Post," a charter sponsor

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.810
of the Library of Congress
National Book Festival.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.020
I'm pleased to introduce Ellen
Hopkins, bestselling author

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.570
of 14 young adult novels
and four adult novels.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.220
Ellen fields a lot of
questions about how

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160
to become a successful
fiction writer but her path

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.960
to success wasn't
necessarily typical.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.270
Although she published her first
poem in a newspaper at age 9,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.170
in 1964, she didn't start
writing for a living

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.360
until her mid 30s and she
didn't publish her first novel

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.020
until age 49, in 2004.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.120
Along the way, she ran
a catering service,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.820
owned a video store,
showed horses,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.380
freelanced for newspapers
and magazines,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.770
and wrote 20 nonfiction
books for children.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.490
You may have noticed
that gritty novels

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.990
about difficult subjects
have become a thing

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.510
in the world of young
adult books.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.140
But they were relatively
uncommon when Ellen got going

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.910
and that's not what
she set out to write.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.470
As you may well know, her
first explosive novel,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.100
"Crank" was loosely based

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.860
on her daughter's
experience with crystal meth.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.110
Ellen chose to tell the story

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.980
from a fictional
daughter's perspective

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.760
to better understand her
real daughter's decisions

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.000
and to examine the role
she played as a mother.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.750
She began the novel in
prose but switched to verse

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.930
because she has said
in interviews,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.770
"Poetry is so interior.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.060
It was the right way of getting
into Kristina/Bree's skin.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.020
Since then, Ellen has written
on topics ranging from abuse

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.770
to suicide to AIDS
to teen pregnancy.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.730
Her newest book "People Kill
People," officially out Tuesday

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.830
and we think there may be
some copies here today,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.710
delves into school
violence, white supremacy

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.490
and other timely issues.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.760
I imagine she'll say
more about that today.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.710
Before we dive into our
discussion, I'm supposed

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.010
to mention that the Library

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.520
of Congress has been
the Festival host

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.330
since it began 18 years ago.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.350
I want to thank festival
Co-Chairman David Rubenstein

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.760
and the many sponsors who
made this event possible.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.030
You can support the
festival with a donation.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.950
There's information
in your program.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.160
Please note, too, that there
will be time for questions

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.000
after Ellen's remarks and anyone

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.600
who asks a question
will be filmed

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.570
for the Library's archives.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.310
And for those who are
interested, Ellen is scheduled

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.590
for a book signing session from
4:00 to 5:00 this afternoon.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.510
Now please help me
welcome Ellen Hopkins.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.120
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: And please
help me thank the not fake news.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.130
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.260
Okay, how many of you
guys follow me online?

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.780
Really? You guys are
scared of me, aren't you?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.330
I don't blame you because
I am a political beast.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.900
So I first of all before I
talk about me or my books,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.870
I really want to tell you how
grateful I am to be in DC today.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.660
This, you know, this place,
like I live in Nevada.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.230
I live in Northern Nevada,
not Las Vegas, okay.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.990
There's a whole different --
And yes, it snows in Nevada.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.120
So when you're back there, you
know, we tend to look at DC

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.730
as like this monstrosity.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.560
It's so, at least now, I
mean our political space is

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.060
so contentious and it's like and
-- I think we need to really,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.350
really find ways to come back
together as much as we can.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.400
I hope our books will
start to do that again.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.730
But I was in the hotel
room this morning

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.850
when Mr. McCain's funeral was on

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.010
and I couldn't tear myself
away from it, you know.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.240
It was like to watch people from
both sides of the aisle be able

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.810
to come into this space
and to honor a man

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.110
who was able to do that.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.150
For me, I really feel honored
to be here today to have shared

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.450
in that space somehow.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.580
I don't know, I know that's
kind of weird and kind

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.380
of a weird thing to talk about
but I really wanted to say that.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.510
And so I do write
-- I write books.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.050
You know, there's
this new article

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.350
in "The Wall Street Journal,"

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.990
you guys seen it,
The darkness of YA.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.370
Well, you know, being a teen is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.640
like not the easiest
thing to be.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.830
You know, I mean seriously.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.630
My childhood, my teenage
years, they weren't that easy

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.730
but teens today, the things
they're experiencing are harder.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.240
I didn't worry about guns
coming into my school.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.170
That was not a concern
at all, you know.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.850
Now we're teaching
elementary kids how to zigzag

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.140
down the hallways, you
know, and it's like, okay,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.570
we need to change things.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.600
And I think books are a way
to be able to bring people

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.830
to open eyes to problems

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.130
that our kids are
experiencing every single day.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.660
So I hope the parents out
there will read my books

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.800
with their young people and
open up lines of dialogue

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.410
and discussion because
that's how we are going

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.770
to change things and make
things better for our kids.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.700
And don't be afraid of books.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.610
Books are a safe, safe
space to explore addiction,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.410
to explore abuse, to
explore gun violence,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.390
which is what I'm here with,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.660
"People Kill People,"
brand new book.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.390
I wanted to explore gun
violence because it's something

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.060
that our kids are
experiencing every day,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.040
a fear of this in their lives.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.510
And so we need to figure
out why this is happening,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.980
who it's happening to and
who the perpetrators are

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.030
so that we can hopefully
turn this around.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.550
I'm going to read a little
bit for you and I'm going

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.280
to read my author note
because I want you

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.950
to know why I chose to do this.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.130
This is the author's note.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.310
I grew up with guns.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.850
My dad who was both a hunter

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.180
and an avid collector taught
me to respect firearms.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.240
I am, in fact, an excellent
shot and at another time

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.000
in my life enjoyed
target shooting.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.360
I could even do black
powder rifles.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.660
Have you ever tried those?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.960
They're like weird.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.190
Today, however, I
don't own a gun

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.850
and as an animal
lover would only hunt

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.640
if it was that or go hungry.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.150
I respect the Second Amendment

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.200
but we must address the
gun violence problem

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.500
in the United States.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.480
Statistics show a steep
rise in gun-related deaths

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.890
and injuries since 2014.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.420
In 2017, as of November 6th,
more than 13,000 people had died

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.200
as a result of non-suicide
gun violence

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.410
with an average 93 Americans
killed by guns every day.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.710
The yearend total would be

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.020
around 18,000 non-suicide gun
deaths, up 4000 from 2016.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.390
Suicides generally account
for 62% of gun-related deaths,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.740
which would put the total
figure at more than 47,000.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.880
Mass shootings, three or
more deaths per incident,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.240
also show a precipitous
upward trend.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.950
Young people are
often involved both

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.430
as victims and perpetrators.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.030
While the outcome of
stricter gun control continues

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.430
to be debated, I felt
it was important to try

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.570
and understand why
someone might be compelled

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.960
to pull the trigger.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.260
This is what authors do.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.560
We ask why.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.570
Why are people prone
to violence?

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.730
Why do people seek revenge?

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.930
Why do people hate
or fear or despair?

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.130
Why do people kill people?

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.740
If we can understand the whys,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.620
perhaps we can begin
to solve the problem.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.920
The characters you'll meet

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.280
in these pages have powerful
life situations driving them

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.800
in negative directions, any
one of them in a precise moment

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.210
in time might decide to
pick up the gun and fire it.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.810
If they seem familiar,
it's because they are,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.170
at least in some small way,
inspired by stories that pop

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.100
up in news feeds every day.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.330
They are fictional but real.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.550
My editor made me put
a disclaimer in there.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.850
Views do reflect my own.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.970
I would hope that
you would know that.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.340
So on my dad, my dad
was an amazing man.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.100
He was the hardest
working person I ever met

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.070
and he was a weekend alcoholic.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.290
By that I mean he
never touched a drop

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.810
from church Sunday
until Friday night.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.470
Friday night until church
Sunday, he was wiped out.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.240
So he was a responsible
gun owner.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.760
He kept his guns locked up.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.770
I only saw them come
out on a few occasions

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.150
when he went hunting or on two
occasions when he was drunk.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.660
He put a loaded pistol
to my mom's head.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.960
He didn't pull the trigger.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.530
She was able to talk him down

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.770
but that was something
I witnessed as a child.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.460
So all it takes is the wrong
time, you know, the wrong second

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.060
for something to go all wrong.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.990
I'm going to read a
little bit for you.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.750
So all 13 of my YA before
this one were written in verse

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.680
and they were all first person.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.030
Every book I've written up until
this one I wrote first person.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.550
This book, the narrator
is omniscient

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.940
and the narrator is the
voice of violence as seducer.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.300
The six characters you'll meet

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.490
in the book are all
written in second person.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.230
So I invite you onto
the page, you,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.830
to become those six characters.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.830
I was going to do the
whole thing omniscient

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.890
and then I kept wanting
to address the reader.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.380
I kept wanting to talk to
you as these characters.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.230
And so I said -- First, I had to
rewrite the first 10,000 words

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.290
in second person but I wanted
to address you and to invite you

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.030
to become these people so
you could into their heads

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.990
and into their spaces and
become these characters,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.420
which I want it to be an
uncomfortable experience

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.720
for you.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.110
So I don't think you're going to
be comfortable reading this book

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.410
and that's not what
it's here for.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.040
But we'll start in
the voice of violence.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.230
You, yeah you, come
here, please.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.580
I need to ask you something.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.130
Have you ever felt the
desire to hurt someone,

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.520
I mean pummel them, wound
them, watch them bleed?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.160
Did you? Would you?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.460
Could you?

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.650
If I were the gambling type,
I'd put my money on yes.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.950
See, there's this thing
inside every one of you,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.950
the collective human
call toward violence.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.390
All it takes is one singular
moment to encourage it into play

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.610
and the lamb transforms,
becomes the lion.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.570
Take it one step further.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.570
Have you ever thought about
killing someone, I mean,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.490
poisoning them, bludgeoning
them,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.080
grabbing a well-honed knife
and carving them to pieces?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.520
Chances are you haven't,
wouldn't,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.280
couldn't follow through,
contemplate.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.990
What's required to become
the catalyst for death?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.240
A moral compass sprung
and spinning haywire,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.740
antifreeze flowing
through your veins,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.160
or perhaps nothing
more than circumstance?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.680
In that instant when the
lamb unleashes its roar,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.070
would you heed the
call or instead defer

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.340
to the quivering
voice of reason?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.530
Like dawn and dusk, existence

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:21.160
and demise are inextricably
linked as per the grand scheme,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.580
either drafted by some
all-powerful architect

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.600
or randomly designed.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.650
Perhaps this is the
true knowledge of Eden,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.220
not the mechanics of procreation
but the promise that once time

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.520
on Earth is nothing more

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.490
than a journey toward
inevitable departure.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.970
Surely the ancient ones who bore
witness to birth in the wilds

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.870
and death from claw or club or
predation by creatures too small

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.900
for the eye to identify,
we're aware of nature's plot.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.420
As their spines uncurled
and they drew upright

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.260
to run discovered the value
of flint, the power of spear

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.710
and arrow, the lust
for blood billowed

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.000
like a black-bellied cloud.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.610
Oh, to wield a weapon
mercilessly extinguish a

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.680
beating heart.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.080
The millennia crept forward,
dawn to dusk to dawn to dusk

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.890
and humankind shed its
fur, fashioned clothes,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.640
deserted its caves in
favor of villages, cities.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.090
But even as people learned to
plant, harness sunlight and rain

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.520
to nurture garden fields, their
passion for the hunt remained.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.590
They killed in the name of
survival, protection, vengeance.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.840
They killed in response to
lust, jealousy, despair.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.680
They killed for the
thrill, the simple pleasure

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.760
of witnessing bloodshed.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.200
Think for one delicious moment
how they would've watched

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.460
in wide-eyed reverence the
advent of gunpowder marvel

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.800
at the fire [inaudible]-,
its relentless evolution

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.540
from crude spear-driven flame
thrower into a fierce weapon,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.140
able to discharge 1000
flesh-ripping metal projectiles

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.590
in 60 lethal seconds.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.330
Ponder their amazement at
a machine with the ability

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.600
to level entire villages, infant
to ancient in mere minutes.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.150
They would've fallen
on their knees

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.600
and lifted their
arms in worship.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.300
Now you understand the
talent of a firearm

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.180
but perhaps you're
unaware of the force

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.250
to feeling its seductiveness.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.600
You know how sometimes
you hear a whisper fall

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.380
over your shoulder but then you
turn to search for the source,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.420
find nothing but
landscape behind you?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.580
So then you tell yourself
it was just a case

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.320
of hyperactive imagination,
convince yourself

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.460
that sentiments don't
materialize out of thin air

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.940
but the truth, at least
as I like to tell it,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.300
is that the voices
who speak to you

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.970
from inside your head have taken
up permanent residence there.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.200
Some shout warning
prodding you to take cover,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.660
flee or brandish a weapon.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.830
Others murmur haunting you
with poetry, like mine.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.020
So the voice of violence
is in verse.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.970
The six characters are in prose.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.330
I'm trying to grow
my readers up.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.650
So if you guys go back to
my first books, you know --

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.850
How many of you guys started
with me with like "Crank"

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.440
or "Burned" back then?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.640
So you guys know as I've moved
along, like those earlier books,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.620
there's more white space
on the page, right.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.960
And I've kind of -- And there's
less stylistic verse on the page

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.960
and that's because I'm
wanting to grow my readers up.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.080
So the early books were like
very simple to read, I think,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.190
although the verse for
very linear readers,

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.970
like for older readers, it's
hard to get to the verse

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.540
as storytelling because we're
taught to read like this.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.610
Young people, their
brains pick up knowledge

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.300
in a different way now
because of computers

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.600
and the way computers come on

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.420
and the way they use
their phones and stuff.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.950
So their brains are actually
hardwired a little differently.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.980
They're actually a little
more open to the idea of kind

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:51.290
of alternative formatting
visual interest on the page.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:56.020
So it's been a pleasure for me
to be able to bring nonreaders

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.270
and reluctant readers to
books through that kind

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.230
of more visual interest.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.050
But then I also want
them to become readers.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.390
So if you go all
the way through,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.790
the verse becomes denser and
then you're going to start

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.070
to get some prose from me.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:16.940
Like the book I'm writing
now, it's almost all prose.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.210
Yes, I am writing a new book.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.970
The 2019 book, which, okay,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.260
let's talk about that
just for a minute.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:31.010
So this book is a change for me
and the book I'm writing now,

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.020
which the name might change.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.140
Right now it's called
"Sanctuary Highway."

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.350
It's set in near future,
near future as in like day

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.440
after tomorrow, if this
country keeps moving

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.660
in the direction it's
trying to move in.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.850
So it's a very political
beast underneath it but it's

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.400
about a group of kids who
end up together having to try

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.920
to escape the country
into Canada, basically.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.670
And I hope my kids
never have to do that

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.070
and I hope your kids
never have to do that

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.510
and I hope we don't ever
have to try to save our kids

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.660
from being rounded
up and locked up.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.920
So that's what I'm doing now.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.890
What else is going
on in my life?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.750
Well, let's see.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.110
So if you follow me at all,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.280
you guys have been
around with Kristina.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.690
You know that she's got --

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.330
The real Kristina is my daughter
Krystal [assumed spelling].

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.710
She now has had seven children.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.700
Only one lives with her.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.000
So we adopted the first.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.110
So Hunter, the baby in the
back of "Crank," he's now 21

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:47.700
and he's the least ambitious kid
you have ever met in your life.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.950
I'm like, "Are you ever
going to have a real job?"

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.380
He's like, "I'm thinking
about living in my car."

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.680
I'm like, "Really?

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.200
Not in my driveway."

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.780
Yeah, okay, have fun with that.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.360
No, he's actually, he's
a musician, so he's going

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.520
on the circuit, the
festival circuit.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.310
I'm like, yeah, okay, good.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.950
Then there are two others.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:16.060
So the two -- So if you read
"Fallout," right, that book was

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.580
from his point of
view, Hunter, right.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.190
And then two other girls, they
live with their paternal aunts,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.650
one in Phoenix, one in
way Southern California.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.930
Five years ago, my daughter
had a major relapse,

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.790
like where I had to go down and
pull her kids out of a very bad,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.640
bad, bad, ugly situation.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.450
So we took guardianship
of the kids.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.580
They were then three,
four, and nine.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.600
We still have them and they
are now eight, nine, and 14.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.930
One just started high school.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.710
Yes! I was hoping to have
another kid in high school!

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.740
At least it keeps me close
to my readers, right.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.600
So there's that and then
she had a baby in jail

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.510
after I took the kids
and so he's with her now.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.070
She's actually doing
pretty well now.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.850
She's had a job for a while.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.150
He's three.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.110
So she's had the same job
for a couple years and she's,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.860
as far as I know,
doing pretty well.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.220
But she also married the abuser
that was abusing these children

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.280
and so they will
not go back to her.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.220
They don't want to
go back to her but --

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.970
So that's kind of where she is

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.270
but that also kind
of changed my life.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.690
You know, it's like, I
was like going full bore

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.170
and then it was like,
put the brakes on.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.150
Let's stay for a while
and take care of kids,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.600
get behind on writing
projects, piss off my publisher.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.450
What else happened with that?

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.710
So that slowed me down a
little bit but now I'm kind

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.700
of like back into like
this whole kind of needing

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.410
to move forward and
to keep going

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.550
until I write some cool books.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.060
I'm not supposed
to talk about it

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.560
but there might be
a movie coming.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.200
I haven't signed
the contracts yet,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.630
so I'm not actually
supposed to share that.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.510
It's "Crank."

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.270
[ Applause ]

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.050
And for those of you who
are worried about it,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.950
I get total script approval.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.250
I get cast approval.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.860
I get to like make sure that
movie is what it needs to be.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.090
So I'm excited about that.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.390
That's coming up.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.170
And that's moving into
kind of a new space, too.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.490
So that's kind of fun.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.020
So I'm trying to
grow as a writer.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.360
I'm trying to grow my readers.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.270
And I'm trying to be what you
guys, give you guys new things,

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.500
give you guys what you want from
me but also be true to myself.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:44.000
So yeah. How close are we here?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.740
Time wise?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:51.520
Fifteen minutes to
go but including Q&amp;A?

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.550
Okay. So let's do some Q&amp;A.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.050
How about that?

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.350
It's really hard to see.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.650
Come on, you guys
have questions.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.950
I know you do.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.250
Come on. You can
ask me anything.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:11.500
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.220
Okay. Who's first?

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.520
I can't see.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.830
These lights are like
really bright in my eyes.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.230
So you guys, let's go over
here because I saw you.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:33.270
&gt;&gt; Okay. So in my local library,
I noticed that a few years ago

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.040
that they didn't have
your book "Tricks."

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.460
So I contacted them about
it because it's odd.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.170
They had all of your
other books.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.970
And it appears that
it's being challenged.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:48.520
How do I counteract that?

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Well,
you can, okay, so --

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.480
I don't doubt that
book's being challenged.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.640
That book -- I mean,
as far as my books go,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.720
as far as content goes,
that one goes as far,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.880
if you don't know what "Tricks"
is, it deals and the sequel

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.070
"Traffick," they deal

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.780
with domestic minor
sex trafficking,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.860
so teen prostitution.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.250
You could start a petition.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.880
I can give you letters--
Like if you email me,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.990
I can send you letters
from readers about why

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.770
that book is important to
them, what it meant to them,

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.210
how it helped them through.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.470
And for me, I wanted to explore
teen prostitution because I live

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:33.210
in Reno and there was an
FBI bust there, a big raid.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.860
They came in and
they took 23 kids,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.700
all under the age of 12, out.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.850
And so domestic minor sex
trafficking, the average age,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.130
the average age of a
young person trafficked

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.430
in is 12 years old.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.740
That's the average age.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:56.400
So it's important that we
understand possible victims,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.280
like shopping mall kids who
like could be victimized easily,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.410
what perpetrators look like.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.340
I just had an article come
out in "VOYA Magazine"

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.430
and the big thing is libraries
are now one of the places

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.190
that the traffickers
target because they look

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.730
for vulnerable kids and a lot

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.810
of vulnerable kids
end up in libraries.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.450
So that might be a
way of looking at it,

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.500
of approaching them as well.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.340
In fact, if you -- I can
send you that article

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.770
and it might be interesting for
your librarian to look at it

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.770
and read it because "VOYA" is
very much involved with trying

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.690
to change that as part of that.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.990
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.290
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins:
But that content,

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.970
it's difficult content for sure.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.460
Also, "Traffick" which is so --
"Tricks" is about five kids --

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.150
&gt;&gt; They don't have that either.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.450
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins:
"Tricks" is about five kids

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.150
from all different parts
of the country who end

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.250
up on the streets of Las
Vegas turning tricks, right.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.570
"Traffick" is about
what happens to them

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.970
after they're pulled out.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.270
Can they go back.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.570
Can they find love?

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:00.870
Will their parents
take them back?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.800
So it's about -- One's
about victimization

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.740
and the other is
about survivorship.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.350
And so there is a way
out and there is hope.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.650
And I worked with a lot

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.920
of survivors helping them write
their own stories, draw pictures

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.960
if they couldn't write,
and so they shared a lot

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.350
of really interesting stories,
many of which are reflected

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.530
in that book, in "Traffick."

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.260
Thank you so much.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.790
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins:
Okay, over there.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what advice would
you give someone who people

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.750
who are close to them
are starting to go

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.840
down that same path as "Crank?"

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.530
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: So what's
really, really hard is

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.150
to watch a friend go
that way or a relative.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.830
For those people, they
have to know that you care

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.710
about them a lot but that
you can't enable that.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.010
And it's really,
really important

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.310
that you don't enable that.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.710
So like there are family --

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.160
You can't give them money

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.960
because the money will
go there, you know.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.290
Even if they say it's
going to rent or whatever,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.890
to let them know that give
them a copy of a book like that

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.440
or like "Tweak" or
like, you know,

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.940
that really shows how far you
can fall if you choose that path

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.440
and it doesn't take very long.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.050
You can tell their parents.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.790
I mean, if you want
to get that involved,

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.620
it depends on how close
you are to their family

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.440
of if the whole family
knows anyway, I mean,

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.390
really sometimes it takes a
real intervention to be able

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.180
to save them because once
-- So like for my daughter,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.270
she started at 16,
17 years old, right.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.050
She is now 38 years old and so
it's been that long of a journey

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.510
for her in and out of that.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.620
Even if you get help, it
will always call to you.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.390
And your life, your
dreams, they go.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.380
So talk to them about their
dreams and what they want

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.450
and then see if you can talk
to them about how taking

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.440
that route is going to
take that dream away.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.950
For my daughter, it was her
dream was computer animation

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.750
and she was on a fast
track to a full scholarship

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.780
at the Art Institute of Seattle
and that's all gone to her now.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.900
She can't do it anymore.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.360
So especially that kind of
drug, I mean, it's brain damage.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.660
There are a lot of
different things

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.970
that go wrong when
you go that way.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.790
&gt;&gt; First, I would
like to say thank you

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:28.430
because your book has helped
me help other people in, like,

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.040
my community and my
neighborhood so first I want

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.340
to give you a thank
you, Ms. Hopkins.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:35.100
Second, I would like to ask you
where you draw your inspiration

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.560
from for all these books?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.130
Like, do they come
straight from all the things

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.400
that are happening like social
media and in like the world

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.630
or do they come from
like personal experience

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.450
or like survivor stories?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.960
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: It's
a mixture of both.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.710
So, I mean, a lot of
it is social media.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.290
You know, I was really
early to social media.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.750
When I started doing this,
when "Crank" came out,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.280
the only social medial
platform out there was My Space.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.490
That gives you an idea
how long ago it was.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.320
Right? But I discovered very
quickly the value of being able

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.110
to connect online with
my readers, one on one,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.760
like it's a private space.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.370
So they would come to
me and share stories.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.690
And I do, I have, I keep reader
letters and there are many,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.730
many, many and some of them
are just they are devastating.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.120
Those seem to come to
me like after midnight.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.420
I don't know why.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.170
It's like, because
I'm tired, you know,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:28.470
too many glasses of wine.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.640
I'm crying for these kids.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.490
But social media is one
way and I do, I get stories

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.680
and people want to share
their stories with me.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.530
A lot of times it is family.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.830
It's friends.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.130
It might be something
I see on the news.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.990
You know, there are lots of
ways that I gather inspiration

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.460
or think about new
stories or whatever.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.060
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Yep.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:57.280
&gt;&gt; So I've been reading
your books since like 2007

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.700
and I was lucky because my
dad bought like "Crank, Glass,

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.680
and Impulse" all at
the same time and I was

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.490
like that never happens
but so, yeah.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.200
But the thing is, now looking on
the shelves and seeing the books

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.680
and I noticed that covers
have changed and like

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.710
to me it feels less
impactful because like "Crank"

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.860
and "Glass," you know, were like
first covers and so now I'm just

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.870
like and so like I want
to know why that happened

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.280
and how you feel about it.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.490
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins:
So cover design is

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.880
like not up to me at all.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.750
That's a publisher decision.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:36.640
I had the same designer for
the first several books.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.340
And then my publisher was like,
let's update you, let's like,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.420
you know, try to
draw new readers

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.020
in because maybe those covers
are something they've seen

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.030
for such a long time
that they've kind

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.330
of just dismissed them.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.630
Do you know what I mean?

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.930
I mean, there are also
readers that will open it up

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.470
and see verse and that's it.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.630
They don't -- They're not
even going to do that.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.220
So covers, although I think,
I mean, that's a cover.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.870
Yeah? I mean, it tells
you exactly what it is.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.250
And you know why it's like that?

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.900
Because big book
stores, Barnes &amp; Noble,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.010
won't let young adult
have an actual picture

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.320
of a gun on a cover.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.360
So book stories, did you know
book stores actually do have

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.940
input into cover design?

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.940
If they like see a cover and
they think it's not going

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.460
to like look good on
their bookshelves,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.980
they will actually go back to
the publisher and say this needs

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.550
to change for some reason.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.850
It's interesting.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.930
But yeah, cover is not
up to me so much anymore.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.230
I can veto it.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.630
If it's something I
really hated, I could say,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.730
yeah, I don't think so.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.660
&gt;&gt; I recently had a
debate with a friend

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.960
about like the differences

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.390
between young adult
books and fiction books.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.740
And I was wondering
if in your experience,

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.800
like how do you decide
that when you sit

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.630
down to write something that's
it's going to be intended

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.250
for children versus for adults.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.050
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: So the
difference between YA and adult

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:02.830
that I can see is that
adult is more reflective.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.430
It's like looking back often.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.730
You know what I mean?

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.510
It's like -- Okay,
so I put it this way.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.660
So young people have this
amount of experience.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.130
Right? At 16, you
have this much.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.760
As an adult, you know,
that starts to widen.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.750
And by the time you
get ancient like me,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:23.150
it's like I got so
much experience.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.490
But it's a reflective thing.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.790
So it's like looking back.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.820
So I can judge today by
this many yesterdays.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.510
Young people can judge today
by this many yesterdays.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.340
So writing for young people
is more about discovery,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.530
learning who you are, figuring
out where you want to go.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:44.240
Writing for adults is
more like regret, I guess.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.030
I really should've
gotten together

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.050
with that guy instead
of that guy.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.250
You know what I mean?

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.720
So I think that's
the difference.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.800
And also there's a
pacing difference.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.580
So if you want to
write for young people,

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.550
it's a different kind of pacing.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.730
It has to be a little faster.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.600
The plot needs to be
less heavy, I guess.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.900
I don't know.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.180
There's a lot of different
things but it's really

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.740
about discovery versus
reflection.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.060
&gt;&gt; Hi. So you talked about
how in your first few books,

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.880
your verse was more
simplistic and you wanted

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.570
to catch younger readers and
now you've moved into prose

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.990
and you're writing a
book almost all in prose.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.470
Do you find the two, verse and
prose, very different to write

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.090
or do you them similar?

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.080
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: I actually
prefer writing in verse.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.370
Verse is, it's every word
has count has the page.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.260
There's a lot of -- It's
a lot more difficult

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.560
to write in verse.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.970
I will tell you that for a
fact because you have to --

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.360
Every single word has to count.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.830
So it's word choice.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:51.420
It's deciding what can, what
one word can take the place

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.190
of like a whole sentence,
maybe, sometimes.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.310
So I'm going to actually --
I'm going to write in verse.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.080
I'm going to do a middle grade
novel because this one child

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.030
of ours, the one that
just started high school,

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.400
he came to us with
PTSD, like because

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.360
of early childhood trauma from
like the boyfriends and stuff.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.780
So when he first got to us,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.890
he would like have daily throw
himself on the floor meltdowns,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.840
screaming into his hoodie.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.440
So he'd go to school and
when he started school

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.490
in this new school, everybody
thought he was the freak

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.060
but nobody wanted to know why.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.360
You know what I mean?

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.640
So I want to write a
book for kids like him,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.070
for the classmates
of kids like him

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:38.500
so they can understand there's
a reason why kids might be

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.800
in that kind of space.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.100
And I will tell you,
those things used

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.290
to happen three or
four times a day.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:46.180
They don't happen at
all anymore, seriously.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.190
I mean, and it was a slow
change, like a slow change.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:50.750
And like last year,
I would say it would

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.440
like once every couple weeks.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.160
This year, like it's done.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.440
So they can come around.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.740
They can change.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:02.550
And they should be allowed
to change and to have friends

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.430
that accept them but I think
verse is going to be the way

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:09.170
to tell that story because it's,
again, such an interior story.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.990
So verse is like, it's

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.200
like really viewing
this world, right.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.670
Prose is like describing
the world.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.950
This is like viewing the world.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.250
And, you know, there are a lot

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.010
of giant successful
verse novels out now.

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.660
Jason Reynolds books, you know,
Jacqueline Woodson's books,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.310
those great making rhymes.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.480
Those books are like
great, great in verse books.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.070
So I'm going to go back
to it for that book

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.560
and then we'll see
because, you know,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.580
I do want to have a wider
audience and there are kids

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.880
like they look at verse

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.180
and they're like,
unh-uh, not for me.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.140
Right? So I want both
because I'm hopeful

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.320
that my writing will
attract both eventually

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.470
and like the prose
lovers will go to verse

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.690
and the verse lovers
will go to prose.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:53.510
And then everybody can love me.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.030
I think -- Are we done?

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Three minutes.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.830
I got time.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.080
&gt;&gt; So how or why did you
decide to make a book or series

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.750
out of your family story instead
of just keeping it private?

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.100
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: So why did I
choose to write "Crank" instead

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.510
of just keeping it
as a private story?

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.030
Because my daughter was the kid

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.800
that we just expected
her to be like somebody.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.100
You know what I mean?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.400
I mean, she has talent.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.190
She was a straight
A plus student.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.510
She has 150 IQ, like
brilliant kid.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:35.000
And then you made
one wrong choice.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.650
You know, she chose to go
with this guy and to get high

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:43.020
and her entire, all her dreams
dissolved with that one choice.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.340
I needed to write that book --
Well, first I needed to write it

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.610
for me to figure out why.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.620
But then I needed to write it
for teens because I wanted --

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.290
I knew if I could just turn
one kid or two kids away

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.830
from that choice, it would mean
something really special to me.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:04.890
And now it's been, I'm
serious, tens of thousands

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.180
of young people that I've
gotten messages from and emails

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.020
from and, you know, and they
tweet me and they Instagram me

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.230
and whatever and that I've
been able to make that kind

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:20.750
of difference in somebody else's
life made it all worthwhile.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:24.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.280
[ Applause ]

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.580
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Thank you.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.060
Alright, well okay, so
then I guess I'm done here

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.680
because they're like -- Is there
one more question somewhere?

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.180
Yeah.

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.640
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just wanted to
give the kids a chance first

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.340
because I've been reading
your books since I was

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.940
in middle school and I'm
a master student now.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.710
So you're like, whew, you're
like part of my childhood

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.970
and seeing you in the flesh
just I'm nervous and everything.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:56.940
I have had a question
since I was a child,

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.700
since I started reading
your books

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.000
of how the heck do
you deal with it?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.350
How do you deal with writing of
such difficult heavy subjects

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.570
and you as a human being, you've
been doing this for decades now,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:15.200
like how do you cope with
so much pain and make it

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.780
so beautiful and easy to
understand and easy to connect

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.180
with for anyone that
reads your books?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.700
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Again, I think
it's just a matter of being able

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.580
to take some of that on myself
for so many other people,

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.660
that I actually feel
I have a relationship

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.960
with the creator and, you know,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.080
I think I was put
here to do what I do.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.040
And so, He gives it back.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.340
Do you know what I mean?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.630
So my life, I've been so blessed
in so many ways that I feel

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.150
like if I can bless
some other lives

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.950
that I'm doing what
I was put here to do.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.390
&gt;&gt; I agree with that.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.760
Thank you so much
for everything.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.060
&gt;&gt; Ellen Hopkins: Thank you.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.360
Okay, I'm wrapping it up.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.340
I got the sign here, wrap it up.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.640
So you guys come.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.650
I'll sign some books for you
downstairs at 4:00 o'clock.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.950
Catch me in the hallway
if you want.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.250
I'm not going anywhere.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:08.230
If you got other questions, I'll
be here and just thank you guys

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.140
for being with me
on this journey.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.440
I love you [applause].
