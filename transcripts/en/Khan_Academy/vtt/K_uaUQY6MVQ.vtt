00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.755
We're on problem 135.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.640
I just did some pilates, so I'm
slightly out of breath.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.190
If x is less than 0, is
y greater than 0?

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.460
All right, statement number
1, x/y is less than 0.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.620
So this is actually
pretty useful.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.050
They're telling us that x
is a negative number.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.960
So we have a negative here, and
we're dividing it by some

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.220
other number.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.990
They're telling us that
the resulting

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.630
number is still negative.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.340
So we have a negative
divided by something

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.770
is equal to a negative.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.660
So I think you learned when you
learned negative numbers,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.740
if y was negative-- well,
if y was 0 this would be

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.800
undefined-- and if y is
negative, if this was a

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.400
negative, then when you divide
a negative by a negative, you

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.440
would have a positive.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.530
So y has to be a positive
number, and it can't be 0.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.660
So this actually tells us.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.550
Statement 1 alone tells us that
y is greater than 0 just

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.780
based on the fact that
you have a negative.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.620
It's just telling you that
a negative divided

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.780
by y is still negative.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.020
This whole thing is
still negative.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.470
So y has to be a positive.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.750
Statement number 2 tells us y
minus x is greater than 0.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.030
Let's see, add x
to both sides.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.880
That tells us that y
is greater than x.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.910
Well that's not enough.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.460
It says if x is 0, is
y greater than 0?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.610
Maybe x is equal to minus 10
and y is equal to minus 9.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.440
So in this case, y wouldn't
be greater than 0.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.400
Or maybe x is equal to minus 10
and y is equal to plus 9.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.460
Both of these would satisfy
this condition.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.570
So we don't know.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.280
This doesn't tell us any
information on whether y is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.630
greater than 0.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.060
So statement 1 alone us
sufficient, and statement 2

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.280
doesn't do much for us.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.732
Problem 135, no, I already
did 135, 136.

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.190
They've drawn a circle there,
so I guess I'll

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.570
draw a circle as well.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.820
So that's the circle.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:45.290
They have a center like that
and then it's like that.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.630
There's a right angle
right here.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.240
They call this O.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.840
They call this X.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.240
They call this Z.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.860
Then they actually connect
those two points.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.290
Then they call this, this point
right here, that's Y.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.130
Let's see what they're asking.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.670
What is the circumference
of the circle

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.900
above with center O?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.530
So they just want to know
the circumference.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.630
So if we could figure out
a radius, then we know

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.750
circumference is 2 pi
times the radius,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.630
and we'd be all set.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.590
So let's see what information
they give us.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.250
Statement number 1, the
perimeter of triangle OXZ is

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:35.290
20 plus 10 square roots of 2.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.960
Now this is interesting.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.410
What do we know about this?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.970
Well we know that it's going to
be an isosceles triangle.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.480
We know that if this length
right here is X, that this

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.910
length is also going to be X,
because this is a circle.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.570
The radius is constant, and each
of these sides are the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.930
radius of the circle.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.140
So those are both
going to be x.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.910
What is this going to be?

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.350
We just know from Pythagorean
theorem, x squared plus x

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.980
squared is going to be equal
to that side squared.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.740
Let's call that c squared.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.500
So you get 2x squared is equal
to c squared or c-- I'm

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.240
calling this side right here
c-- is equal to the square

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.279
root of 2, x times the
square root of 2.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.709
Whatever x is.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.450
So the perimeter of this entire
triangle is going to be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.620
two x's, x plus x, so it's going
to be 2x plus x square

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.870
roots of 2.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.280
Statement 1 told us that this
perimeter is equal to this

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.860
right here.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.390
It's going to be equal to 20
plus 10 square roots of 2.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.300
Well I think you could do a
little pattern matching here

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.200
and solve for x.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.830
This is actually, even though
it might not look completely

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.740
like it, this is a
linear equation.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.790
You can solve for it.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.340
Immediately that should be, oh,
statement 1 is sufficient.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.780
But you can just do a little
pattern matching and say,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.910
well, this works when
x is equal to 10.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.840
So actually, we are able to
figure out what x is equal to.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.960
Then as I said before, x is
the radius of this circle.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.500
Then the circumference of the
circle, which is what the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.720
whole question is about, that's
2 pi times the radius.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.200
Circumference is 2 pi
times the radius.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.360
We just figured out
the radius is 10.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.980
So it equals 20 pi.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.310
So statement 1 is sufficient.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.650
What does statement 2 do?

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.160
Statement 2, the length
of arc XYZ is 5 pi.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.910
XYZ is 5 pi.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.860
So they're telling us that
this length is 5 pi.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.030
Well do we know what proportion
that is of the

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.790
entire circumference?

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.140
Well sure, because they tell
us that this is 90 degrees

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.440
right here.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.020
This is 90 degrees of 360
degrees of a circle.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.090
So this, the arc length right
here, is exactly going to be

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.165
1/4 of the circle.

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:02.010
We know that because 90
degrees is 1/4 of 360.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.250
So 5 pi is going to be equal
to 1/4 times the

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.300
circumference.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.990
Or that the circumference is
going to be equal to 20 pi.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.890
So each statement independently,
statement 1 or

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.920
statement 2, independently, is
sufficient to answer this

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.950
question, the circumference
of the circle.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.950
137, what is the value
of a to the fourth

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.200
minus b to the fourth?

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.350
Immediately just even looking,
one thing I'm tempted to do is

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.050
rewrite this as a
squared squared

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.420
minus b squared squared.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.070
Because I just glanced at
statement 1 and they had

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.810
squares there.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.060
So I'm going to do that.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.420
Let me do different letters.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.290
You know that x squared minus y
squared is equal to x plus y

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.540
times x minus y.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.160
So here, x is a squared
and y is b squared.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.300
So this is going to be equal
to-- this is just the

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.600
original, this is going to be
equal to a to the squared-- a

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.620
squared plus b squared times
a squared minus b squared.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.980
Then we could simplified
this again.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.230
So this is going to be equal to
a squared plus b squared.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:29.880
We could simplify this as a
plus b times a minus b.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.110
I think that's going to be
helpful just glancing at the

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.950
two statements that
they gave us.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:46.270
So statement 1 tells us that a
squared minus b squared is

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.280
equal to 16.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.600
So that tells us that just
this is equal to 16.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.130
That is equal to 16.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.920
That doesn't help me much
because I don't know what a

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.930
squared plus b squared
is going to be.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.860
It just tells me the difference

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.440
between these two squares.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.620
I don't know whether they're
integers or anything.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:16.590
Statement 2 tells me that
a plus b is equal to 8.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:23.190
Once again, that doesn't help
me tremendously by itself.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.440
If I just know that a plus b
is equal to 8, and I don't

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.720
know what a minus b
is, I don't know

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.430
what all of this is.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.180
But when I use them together,
this is interesting.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:39.539
Because we know that a plus b
times a minus b is equal to a

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.070
squared minus b squared.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.710
Well they just told us that
a plus b is equal to 8.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.620
So a plus b is equal to 8.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.890
So 8 times a minus b is going to
be equal to a squared minus

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.640
b squared, which statement
one told us was 16.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.180
So that actually tells us that
a minus b is equal to 2.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.410
So now we have two equations
with two unknowns, and we

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.680
could solve for a and b.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.530
If we can solve for a and b,
then we can definitely tell

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.360
you what a to the fourth minus
b to the fourth is.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.520
Just to show you that,
let me do it.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.660
So let's see, a minus
b is equal to 2.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.650
Add these equations.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.720
2a is equal to 10.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.260
a is equal to 5.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.450
Then if a is equal to
5, b is equal to 3.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.950
So our original statement,
a to the

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.410
fourth is 5 to the fourth.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.690
5 to the fourth minus
3 to the fourth.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.690
So whatever-- that's what?

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.610
625 minus 81, I think.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.120
It doesn't matter.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.170
You can figure it out.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.150
So both statements combined
are sufficient

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.050
to answer this question.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.300
See you in the next video.
