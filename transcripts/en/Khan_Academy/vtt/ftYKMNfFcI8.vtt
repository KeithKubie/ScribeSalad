00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.557
- [Instructor] This, right over here,

00:00:01.557 --> 00:00:03.823
is a scratch pad on Khan Academy,

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:07.956
created by Khan Academy
user Charlotte Auen.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:11.250
And, what you see here, is
a simulation that allows

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.868
us to keep sampling from
our gumball machine,

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.949
and start approximating
the sampling distribution

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.718
of the sample proportion.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:22.628
So, her simulation focuses on
green gumballs, but we talked

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:25.208
about yellow before, and
the yellow gumballs, we said

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:29.375
60% were yellow, so let's
make 60% here green.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.193
And then, let's take samples of ten,

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:34.931
just like we did before.

00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:37.146
And then, let's just
start with one sample.

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:39.207
So, we're gonna draw one
sample, and what we wanna show,

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:40.334
is we wanna show the percentages.

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:43.453
Which if the proportion of
each sample, that are green.

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:47.009
So, if we draw that first
sample, notice out of the ten,

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.495
five ended up being green,
and then it plotted that right

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:52.047
over here, under 50%.

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:55.461
We have one situation where
50% were green, now let's do

00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.321
another sample, so this
sample 60% are green.

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.597
And so, let's keep going.

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:03.080
Let's draw another sample.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.135
And now that one, we have,
we have 50% are green,

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:10.272
and so notice now we see
here on this distribution;

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:13.474
two of them had 50% green.

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:15.973
Now, we could keep drawing samples,

00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:18.440
and let's just really increase.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.555
So, we're gonna do 50
samples of ten at a time.

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.400
And so, here, we can
quickly get to a fairly

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.883
large number of samples.

00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:29.431
So here, we're over a thousand samples.

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.048
And, what's interesting here,

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:34.551
is we're seeing experimentally,
that our sample;

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.806
the mean of our sample proportion here,

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.688
is zero point six two.

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:41.925
What we calculated, a few
minutes ago, was that it should

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.442
be zero point six.

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:46.813
We also see that the standard
deviation of our sample

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:49.314
proportion, is zero point one six.

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:51.068
And what we calculated was approximately

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:52.727
zero point one five.

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:55.043
And as we draw more and more
samples, we should get even

00:01:55.043 --> 00:01:57.734
closer, and closer to those values.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.971
And, we see that, for the most
part, we are getting closer,

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.727
and closer, in fact,
now that it's rounded,

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.466
we are at exactly those values,

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.718
that we had calculated before.

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:09.915
Now, one interesting thing to observe is,

00:02:09.915 --> 00:02:13.602
when your population proportion
is not too close to zero,

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:15.157
and not too close to one,

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:18.591
this looks pretty close
to a normal distribution.

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:19.790
And that makes sense.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.451
Because, we saw the relation
between the sampling

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.532
distribution of the sample proportion,

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:27.682
and a binomial random variable.

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:32.163
But, what if our population
proportion is closer to zero?

00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:36.369
So, let's say our population
proportion is ten percent.

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.698
Zero point one.

00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:38.969
What do you think the
distribution is going

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.540
to look like then?

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.139
Well, we know that the mean
of our sampling distribution

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.566
is going to be ten percent,
and so you could imagine

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.320
that the distribution is
going to be right skewed.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.363
But, let's actually see that.

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:54.196
So, here we see that our distribution

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.196
is indeed, right skewed.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.535
And that makes sense.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:02.414
Because, you can only get
values from zero to one,

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:05.869
and if your mean is closer
to zero, then you're gonna

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.902
see the meat of your distribution
here, and then you're

00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:09.617
gonna see a long tail to the right.

00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:12.441
Which creates that right skew.

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:16.748
And, if your population
proportion was close to one,

00:03:16.748 --> 00:03:18.487
well, you can imagine the
opposite is going to happen.

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:21.137
You're going to end up with a left skew.

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:25.220
And, we indeed, see right
over here, a left skew.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:30.196
Now, the other interesting
thing to appreciate is,

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:34.599
the larger your samples, the
smaller the standard deviation.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.317
And so, let's do a population proportion

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.105
that is right in-between.

00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:43.972
And so, here, this is similar
to what we saw before,

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:46.688
this is looking roughly normal.

00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:49.459
But now, and that's when
we had sample size of ten,

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.368
but, what if we have a
sample size of 50 every time?

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:58.535
Well, notice, now it looks like
a much tighter distribution.

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.632
This isn't even going
all the way to one yet,

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:06.718
but it is a much tighter distribution.

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:09.858
And, the reason why that made
sense, the standard deviation

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:13.568
of your sample proportion,
it is inversely proportional

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:15.736
to the square root of "n".

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:17.309
And, so, that makes sense.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.337
So, hopefully you have a good
intuition now, for the sample

00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:23.486
proportion, it's distribution,
the sampling distribution

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:26.685
of the sample proportion
that you can calculate it's

00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:30.188
mean, and its' standard deviation.

00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:31.360
And you feel good about it,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.341
because we saw it in a simulation.
