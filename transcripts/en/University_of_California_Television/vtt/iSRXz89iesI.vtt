00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:01.754
(woosh)

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:04.171
(soft chime)

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.350
- I've been doing this for--
- the Shriver lecture

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.310
- The Shriver lecture,
which is associated with

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.310
an award it's to recognize
someone or a group

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.910
in the community, excuse
me, that has contributed

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.280
significantly to the lives
of people with disabilities

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.600
and to acknowledge their contribution

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
and to recognize all that they have given

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440
us and so this year it is Susan Mizner

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.667
from the ACLU is doing the Shriver lecture

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.180
and after that we are going
to a few minute ceremony

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.180
to present the award and
then we have wine and cheese.

00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.701
(laughter)

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.180
So please stay put and thank you so much

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.593
for being here and for all that you do.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.430
And you are gonna sit here,
I'm gonna sit right here.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.263
- Okay,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.483
and where's the button?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.300
Okay, so my disclosure slide.

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:28.430
I was trying to figure out how to explain

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.700
where we are politically to a conference

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.160
of health care professionals

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.260
and one of my colleagues has talked about

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.340
what we are going through
right now as a stress test

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.340
for democracy, so this
last year has seen attacks

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.740
on muslims, on medicaid, on
immigrants, on trans people,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.870
on the right of women
to control their bodies.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.820
But it's also seen attacks
on what is the core

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.990
foundation of our democracy.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.180
It's seen attacks on the courts,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.260
trying to delegitimatize the court,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.680
it's seen attacks on the right to protest

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.073
and on our free press.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.620
So after 13 months I think
the good news is that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.150
the patient is holding up pretty well.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.233
Our democracy has been,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.826
solid our courts have pushed
back on the ban of muslims

00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:29.826
on DOCA recipients and
resisted so far on encroaching

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.890
further on a woman's right to choose.

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.650
And our protests and our advocacy

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.650
and I say this collectively
not just the ACLU has so far

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.090
presented, prevented
medicaid from being gutted

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.090
by block grants and has
prevented politicians

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.333
and police police from stifling the press.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.490
Most importantly our
populous the lifeblood

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.840
of our democracy is more invigorated

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.590
and aerobic than ever.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.360
I don't think we've seen
a time with this much

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.770
political engagement since the 1960s

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.770
when I see some people
who were active back then.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.820
So as I review just a few
of the things going on,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.833
I will pause and in that,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.220
spirit of involvement note
a few ways that you may

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.830
be able to participate in pushing back on

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.560
some of the civil liberties threats

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.453
to people with disabilities.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.740
So Lucy and Jerry asked me to talk about

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.890
a few things we couldn't
actually narrow it down

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.360
so I'm actually going to do a grand solum

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.070
through education and adversive discipline

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.080
the school to prison pipeline,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.670
conservatorship and
supported decision-making

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.863
and then voting.

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:04.854
- [Lucy] In half an hour.

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:07.856
- In half an an hour yes
(audience laughs), it's gonna,

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.555
we're gonna cover it all.

00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:10.747
- [Lucy] Go for it.

00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:11.660
(laughter)

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.300
- Just keepin the stress
on, okay so education

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.330
and adversive discipline,
how many of you have heard

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.003
about restraint and seclusion?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.990
Good, okay so I don't have
to spend a lot of time

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.850
on what it is, it is a pretty significant

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.030
use of force generally against students

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.940
and experts probably
many of you have already

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.650
weighed in on the fact that it, seclusion

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.090
and restraint doesn't
have any educational value

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.240
and should be used only
in emergency situations.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.040
You probably also know
that it is used extremely

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.633
disproportionately on
students with disabilities.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.800
I'll get there, so just a
couple of data points for you.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.380
12% of students in
public schools have IDEA,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.210
so identified as students
with disabilities,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.210
75% of the students who they
use physical restraint on

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850
are those students with disabilities.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.890
Many of you know TASH, which is

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.250
a very great advocacy organization.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.290
They have done a film to
explain from the student's

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.040
perspective what restraint
and seclusion is like.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.680
And I've done just a few snippets here,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.070
if you want to watch the full video,

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.440
and I would encourage you to
it's on stophurtingkids.com.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.971
Pretty easy to remember.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.290
(melancholy music)

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.130
- I crawled out of there, she came back

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.870
and screamed at me, if
you don't stay in there,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.110
I'm going to strap you in that chair

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.513
and lock the door.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.360
- One sat on my leg,
one sat on me other leg,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.830
two sat, two sat people sat on my hands.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.970
One person sat on top
of me you don't do this

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.690
you don't do that you must listen to us

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.430
do what we say.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.230
- He slammed me up against the wall,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.880
arm barred me across the throat

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.920
and lifted up so I couldn't breathe

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.700
and then whispered how am
I supposed to talk to you

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.980
nice and slow so you can understand?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.203
- One particular day
we went to see my son,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.810
and we were gonna give him a haircut.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.237
So we took off his
shirt and he was covered

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.310
with bruises and abrasions,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.023
15 to 20 on his body, everywhere.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.560
- Yet rest ignored me as I'm locked away

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.920
in hidden rooms that pointed
loudly I'm worthless.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.713
I wanted to tell the
agony, but I could not.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.686
(calm music)

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.020
- At my old school from
second to seventh grade

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.180
I was like an awesome student,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.530
I had great grades I had
perfect attendance awards for

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.130
from second grade to seventh
grade for every nine weeks.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.680
I mean I excelled in
history because that is part

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.330
of my Asperger's Syndrome.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.380
I have a photographic memory
that's also the reason why

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.140
I can't forget what
happened to me in school.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.490
When I was 13 my family
moved seven miles away

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.050
to a new school district,
I was being placed in ISS

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.120
almost every school day, I
spent 35 consecutive days

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.520
in a storage, what used
to be a storage room

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.260
under the weight room in
the basement of my school.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.460
It was concrete and
there's two metal doors

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.930
that were padlocked from the outside,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.323
there was no windows, and no heat.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.610
And the only person who
had a key to that padlock

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.110
was the principal, you
could scream in there

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.090
no one would hear you.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.610
Must students did not even know

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.373
I was present at school that day.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.461
They'd see me at the end of the day,

00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:01.880
getting on the bus and they'd
be like where was you all day?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.200
In the basement.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.980
I remember I was in study skills one time

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.790
and I heard my friend in there

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.640
and he wasn't allowed out and
he was saying I need to use

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.970
the bathroom, I need to use the bathroom

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.280
and he defecated and urinated on himself.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.893
And he was he never came
back to school after that.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.490
- So I wanna emphasize that
these aren't isolated incidents

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.210
since the department of
education has started collecting

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.970
data on the use of restraint
and seclusion in schools

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.660
we know that they are tens
of thousands of incidents

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.900
around the country
including in California.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.330
And the research that's
been done in California

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.750
is we have plenty of it
in the public schools,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.187
but the most frequent use of restraint

00:08:53.187 --> 00:08:56.540
and seclusion is in what's
called non public schools.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.140
These aren't private schools
where you pay $40,000

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.470
worth of tuition and try
to get your kid in there,

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.840
these are schools that
are run by non profits

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.520
but are set up solely for the purpose

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.610
of taking students with disabilities

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.260
that the mainstream school
classroom has decided

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.350
don't fit there, and they send them to.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.180
They use public money and send them to

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.163
these non public schools.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.370
We have found that
because they're segregated

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.010
because many of the students
have limited verbal skills

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.150
it is a breeding ground for abuse.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.150
And even, this slide I
should just run through

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.210
briefly, which is that
a survey that TASH did

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.630
of parents who had kids with
developmental disabilities

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.630
found that most of the
kids had been subjected

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.110
to restrain and seclusion,
most of them had had

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.130
an injury a physical injury,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.560
but virtually all of them
reported emotional trauma.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.140
So even when there aren't broken bones

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.600
scrapes, bruises, lacerations
which happen frequently.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.863
The emotional trauma is significant

00:10:18.863 --> 00:10:23.020
and really pushes kids out of school,

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.910
as she was saying at the
end you know the one kid

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.450
who defecated on himself
in seclusion it's very

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.563
hard to be going back
to school after that.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.340
So here's what we're
trying to do about it,

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.480
in California there's a
school district I won't name

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.200
we're still in settlement
discussions with them.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.030
But they had a very high rate of restraint

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.233
and seclusion especially in
their segregated classrooms.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.510
When we threatened a lawsuit
with the disability rights

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.190
of California and DREDF
they said you know,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.210
no we're trying to do better.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.060
We want to work with you
and so we have been working

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.760
with them over the last
year and a half two years.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.870
For a how to improve their practices

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.330
and we hope that they will be a model for

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.793
how to do a better job of this.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.280
I also want to mention
AB 2657 new legislation

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.220
that's been introduced on
California in this part of my talk

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.860
I have to report as lobbying
time because it is saying

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.713
that we support this legislation.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.270
It is not drastic
legislation it's not banning

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.320
the use of restraint and
seclusion but it is installing

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.320
the federal guidelines so
that it is only allowed,

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.760
when a child or someone
else is in imminent danger

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.543
of serious physical injury.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.540
It's not allowed as a form of discipline,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.540
as a form of control, and it is it sets up

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.110
procedures if you use
it for how to report,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.320
how to work with the child and the family,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.930
and how to make sure that the
circumstances that brought

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.530
about the restraint and
seclusion aren't replicated

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.623
so that you don't do it more than once.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.610
We ask of you as health professionals,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.610
I know you're mandatory
reporters, ask about the child's

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.940
willingness to go to school
sometimes there aren't

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.435
indicators but when there are,

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:31.600
also consider that it may not be because

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.600
of falling or family but
because there is abuse at school

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and I'd also ask you to
consider supporting AB 2657.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.230
We really need medical
professionals to weigh in,

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.150
you have much more weight than lawyers

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.513
in talking to the legislature about this.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.480
Okay so shool to prison pipeline

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.200
if you're pushed out of
school the chances are likely

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.200
that you will be pushed into the prison,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.173
jail, incarceral system.

00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:13.690
We know that police and
people with disabilities

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.080
don't mix well, people
who have been trained

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.080
to command and control
are not really the people

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.510
who know how to respond
when people don't react

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.770
the way that they expect them to.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.320
People who don't respond
quickly, people who don't behave,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.440
people who don't behave
in the way that their

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.580
training has told them
people should behave.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.060
So we know that people with
disabilities get killed

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.550
by the police much more
frequently than people

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.500
without disabilities we know
that people are incarcerated,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.340
more than half of the people
who are in our prisons

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.150
have one disability or another.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.490
Psychiatric disabilities, are the highest

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.000
but cognitive disabilities,
developmental disabilities

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
especially ADHD is also prevalent in five

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.243
to six times the rate in
the public population.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:16.530
So we are advocating for
alternatives to police

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.150
in responding to people who are in crisis.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.420
Different police training not additional

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.710
but different to reorient
them from the start

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.810
and we are fighting against registries,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.240
I don't know if I've heard
of any in California,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.050
but in places around the
country police have been

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.620
telling families with
kids who have disabilities

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.240
we want you to register your child,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.490
so we know when we go to your household

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.830
not to kill him basically

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.130
and we don't really like that model.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.820
We think that the police
should take that on themselves

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.460
we know that with registries
like this it's generally

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.360
wealth white families
that take advantage of it

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.313
and that benefit from it.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.760
Okay, so kids with
disabilities are entering the

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.260
juvenile justice system
at five times the rate

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.923
than other youth in
the general population.

00:15:22.685 --> 00:15:27.185
We are working to stem that,
we are working especially

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.360
in schools to try and
prevent schools from feeding

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.410
the juvenile population
one of the biggest barriers

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.620
is what we're all seeing
which is the drive to have

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.230
more police in schools
and it's understandable.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.230
But we have been
advocating for I'll explain

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.693
what we've been advocating
for, thank you very much.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.840
Police are in schools
not just in high schools

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.930
but in middle schools and
in elementary schools.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.680
And what that looks like
is what I'm going to

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.080
show you in this next video.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.203
- [Deputy] Here we are.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.227
- [Student] No get off of me stop it!

00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:17.250
- I'm going to articulate this for people,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.240
who don't see
- You don't get

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.668
to swing at me like that.

00:16:19.668 --> 00:16:20.501
- [Student] Get off!

00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:21.550
- A Kentucky deputy sheriff
- You don't get to

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.309
swing at me like that.
- I still wanna say stop

00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:25.320
- Is handcuffing,
- You can do what we've

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.623
asked you to,
- an eight year old boy.

00:16:27.623 --> 00:16:29.082
- [Deputy] Or you can
suffer the consequences.

00:16:29.082 --> 00:16:30.137
- [Student] Ow no that hurts, stop!

00:16:30.137 --> 00:16:31.171
- [Deputy] Now sit down in that chair

00:16:31.171 --> 00:16:32.004
like I've asked you to.

00:16:32.902 --> 00:16:34.735
- [Student] I'm sorry!

00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:38.367
(student crying)

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.290
- I promise you that I still have not,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.290
I've watched this probably 25 times,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.950
the actual video goes on for 15 minutes

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.750
and you would think that
with a video like that

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.730
you would take it to the sheriff

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.100
and say you've got a rogue
sheriff deputy out here

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.030
and you gotta pull him in
and get him some training.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.293
We, our colleagues, our
co-council did that,

00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:45.903
the sheriff said absolutely not.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.053
This deputy did exactly
what he was supposed to do,

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.840
we found out through discovery
that he had handcuffed

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.970
some, between 10 and 15
children in the year that

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.493
he'd been doing this work.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.610
That they asserted in their papers,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.340
because of course we sued that these eight

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.888
and nine year old kids committing felonies

00:18:11.888 --> 00:18:13.526
(audience laughter)

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:18.030
and have doubled down,
this is litigation that's

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.670
been going on for two and a half years.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.520
We have gotten a good
judgment from the court

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.520
in the sixth circuit
that this was an unlawful

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.580
restraint it was excessive force by law

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.850
we didn't have to go to court on that.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.580
But they won't settle they
are planning to appeal this

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.630
to the supreme court.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.507
So we--

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.823
it's pretty bad,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.390
they're furious that we have this video,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.390
it's and the video was
taken by school staff

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.842
to show the mother how
difficult the child was being.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.821
(audience laughter)

00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:08.738
(audience chatter)

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.980
So handcuffing happens around the country,

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.790
again another one of
these things that now that

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.790
we're collecting we know happens
tens of thousands of times

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.940
primarily against kids with disabilities,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.193
especially kids of
color with disabilities.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.320
This trial in Kentucky
we hope will eventually

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.120
send a bit of a message we're also working

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.160
in Michigan with communities
in Flint to say look

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.610
we just don't want police
in elementary schools.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.653
We can have the argument
about how they are

00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:54.150
or are not in high schools
but in elementary schools

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.750
there's no place for them

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.340
and we would like your support there.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.260
And we're also for those
schools where the communities

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.410
are divided where some parents feel that

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.620
high schools are dangerous
and they want police there.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.260
We're trying to develop
model agreements so that

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.530
police are clear that they're
not there to discipline

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.590
children that they're only there,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.173
if there's a danger or crime
that they need to intervene on.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.470
Okay 11 minutes left, conservatorships

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.820
and supported decision making.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.110
What I usually come and
talk with you about,

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:37.110
so first of all conservatorships
are as most of you know

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.110
they are called guardianships
in other parts of the country

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:45.050
are a huge deprivation of an
individual's civil liberties.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.690
It essentially takes legal personhood

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.610
away from the individual,
if we're gonna take

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.380
that extreme a step a
step that some have called

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.540
the most significant
deprivation of civil liberties

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.830
aside from the death penalty,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.810
we think you should
have a right to counsel.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.090
So in Utah we are trying out this argument

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.670
we don't know if we will
win yet, we'll learn a lot

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.433
from the experience and we'll keep trying.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.220
Because we think that anyone
who is being threatened

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.560
with conservatorship or guardianship

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.980
should have a counsel to
represent their stated interests.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.360
Not what their best interests
are which is what happens

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.340
in many states, and in many circumstances,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.440
that's already have someone
else substitute their

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.080
decision making for
the individual but have

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.777
a counsel represent
their stated interests.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.350
We're also promoting
supported decision-making,

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.340
which all of you I think have heard about

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.410
a few times now, now that you've got this

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.930
under your wing and thank
you we're starting to

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.300
work more with our own
kind in the legal system.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.220
Judges so we're working
with the judicial council

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.710
to try and help judges
understand what supported

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:01.220
decision-making is to
try and encourage them

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.710
to urge that people try
supported decision-making

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.560
before imposing a conservatorship.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.570
As the law actually requires,

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.330
because in California
you have to use the least

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.903
restrictive measure possible.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.740
And we're developing more resources,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.230
the MIND Institute has just
finished a series of videos

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.580
and they are available on our website

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.423
and the MIND Institute's website.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.420
Okay finally voting, it
seems important to end here

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.763
it being the foundation of our democracy.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.680
But 41 states have laws
that disenfranchise people

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.430
because of their disability status

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.420
and four states have laws
that disenfranchise people

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.860
who are idiots, so that is just such a

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.080
an opportunity for satire,
of who would qualify.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.240
(laughter)

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.490
To be disenfranchised
in those states but is,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.630
just to be clear it is usually enforced

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.780
against people with
developmental disabilities.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.650
So in California almost
everyone who is put under

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.250
a conservatorship also automatically lost

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:26.250
their right to vote, the
solution was to amend

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:29.100
the California electoral code

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.960
and the standard that
the disability community

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.750
has come up with which I think
is just a superb standard

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.750
is that anyone who
expresses a desire to vote

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.570
with or without accommodations
should be able to vote.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.050
So whether the expression
needs an accommodation

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.620
or being able to vote
needs an accommodation,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.933
that's the criteria we need to use.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.970
So the law has been updated
thanks to my colleague

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.440
Claudia Center and we just
need to get the word out.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.480
Our affiliates have been
doing that but to the extent

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.480
that you can, we would like your help.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.650
Also online voter
registration huge benefit

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.880
to the disability community,
you don't have to go down

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.870
fill out a form by hand,
make sure that they've got it

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.760
right because the forms
that are filled out by hand

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.830
are then translated and typed by people

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.610
who can't necessarily read your writing.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.530
But for people who need
assistive technology,

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.730
to use websites almost all of the websites

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.370
that were completed are inaccessible.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:45.070
So we did a report showing what
the most common errors were

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.000
sent it to all the secretaries of states,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.870
have been encouraging people to update

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.660
their websites we're making progress

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.303
and in New York we decided to sue,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.770
the wrong state to sue and we
knew that they actually fight

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.330
every lawsuit tooth and nail
but we didn't want to seem

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.220
partisan and they're a democratic state.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.220
So that's where we sued, and
they have already improved

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.930
their website quite a bit

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.553
and we are in settlement
negotiations there.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.980
I would encourage you, I
know you are not one of the

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.950
offices that is required by the

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.920
national voter registration
act to help your clients

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.280
come in to register to vote,

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.480
but if you can, if you have
the time ask them if they're

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.170
interested in voting, let
them know that they can

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:38.170
register online and please
let us know if you hear

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.740
of any problems.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.940
We want to make sure that
this system is working

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.840
even in California where we assume

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.430
and think most things
are going well California

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.360
was the only state that the website

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.810
was accessible to start with.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.313
Okay so,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.420
the Statue of Liberty is
the symbol for the ACLU

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.420
and for the country, and I use
her to just begin my thanks.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.950
I'm really appreciative
of this the Shriver Award

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.770
we knowledge that it's
not just to recognize

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.470
the little bit of work that the new

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.860
disability rights project,
that the ACLU is doing

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.990
but really the work that
my colleagues at the ACLU

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.000
are doing and the community is doing.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.468
To fight this, incredible
stress test to our democracy.

00:26:36.468 --> 00:26:37.550
(laughter)

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.820
So I want to thank you
for all of your work,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.583
and I've be happy to answer questions.

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:46.809
(applause)
