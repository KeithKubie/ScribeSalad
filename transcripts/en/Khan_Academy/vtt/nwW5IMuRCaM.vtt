00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.090
We're on problem 8.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.070
How many more degrees of arc are
there in 1/4 of a circle

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.020
than 1/5 of a circle?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.730
All right.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.400
So 1/4 of a circle has
how many degrees?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
So it's 1/4 times the degrees
in a circle, so that's 360

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.460
degrees which is
equal to what?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.860
What's 360 divided by 4?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.510
That's 90 degrees.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.840
Right?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.580
1/4 times 360 is 90 degrees.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.200
So that's 1/4 of a circle.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.090
1/5 fifth of a circle times
360 it equals what?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.850
360 divided by 5 which is
equal to 72, right?

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.490
35 right.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.090
72.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.870
So that equals 72 degrees.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.470
That's in 1/5 of a circle.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.560
And they're asking, how many
more degrees of an arc are

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.890
there in 1/4 of a
circle than 1/5?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.760
So what's 90 minus 72?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.020
That's 18 degrees.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.120
That's answer B.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.100
Next problem.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.220
Problem 9.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.140
Let me draw the axes.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.640
And then they have a curve that
looks something like this

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.080
which goes to the origin and
looks like it's symmetric.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.040
It goes like this and
it keeps going.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.715
And they tell us this is the
point minus 6 common 0.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:37.580
And they tell us-- well
do they tell us?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.710
They have this point and they
say that this is 1.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.920
This is the point 7
comma 6 up here.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.480
7 comma 6.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.360
And they're saying that
this is 6 comma 0.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.560
Although they don't draw a
little point there, which

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
makes me a little suspicious.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.550
Maybe they just forgot.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.060
Based on the graph of the
function f above, what are the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.430
values of x for which
f of x is negative?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.930
So when is f of x negative?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.850
Well, it's negative
in this range.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.280
From here to here.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.100
That's when it's negative.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.860
So what values of x
are its negative?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.470
Well, at 0 it's 0, so
0 doesn't count.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.300
So x has to be greater than 0.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.510
Because we can't count 0,
because at 0 the function is

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.040
actually 0 and we want to know
negative and 0 isn't a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.550
negative number.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.450
And what does x have
to be less than?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.240
Well this is point 6.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.020
So x has to be less than 6.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.640
So that is choice B.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.380
Not too hard, huh?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.010
You just had to say, when does
it dip below the x-axis?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.370
Well when x is between
0 and 6.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.620
Next problem.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.340
Let me switch colors.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.230
In the figure above-- oh what do
I have to draw-- the figure

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.910
above shows the dimensions of
a pedestal constructed of 4

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.610
layers of marble.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.440
Each layer is a rectangular
solid that is 1 foot high and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.530
has a square base.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.910
How many cubic feet of marble--
yes I have to draw

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.616
this-- so at the top I have
cube that looks like that.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:18.630
It's 1 by 1 by 1, then they
have another marble-- that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.330
looks like this.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.280
It's 1 high and then, of
course, it's 2 wide.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.700
Right, so let's just start doing
the volumes immediately.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.230
The volume of the
top one is 1.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.230
The volume of the second
one is what?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.730
It's 2 by 2 by 1.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.360
It's 2 times 2 times
1 which equals 4.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.704
The volume of the next
one is what?

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:42.670
It goes out like this.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.570
It's 3 by 3 by 1, right?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.710
So what is its volume?

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.982
3 by 3 by 1.

00:03:56.982 --> 00:03:58.870
So it equals 9.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.880
I think you start seeing
the pattern here.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.820
And then finally we have
the fourth one.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.390
The fourth one looks
like that.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.180
I'm not going to draw it fully,
you get the point.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.250
It's going to be 4 by 4 by 1.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.970
Which is equal to 16.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.480
So the volume of all of them
combined is 1 plus 4 plus 9

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.980
plus 16 that's 5
plus 9 plus 16.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.440
14 plus 16.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.790
That equals 30 and
that's choice C.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.290
Next problem.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.890
Problem 11.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.780
If x and y are positive integers
and 4 to the 2x is

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.600
equal to 2y, what is
x in terms of y?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.150
Whenever you see something like
this-- when you see a 4

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.550
and a 2-- just convert them
all to the same base.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.070
So how do you write 4 as 2 to
some power is 4, right?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.700
How do you write 4 as an
exponential expression with 2?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.240
My brain is malfunctioning.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.870
Well that's the same thing
is 2 squared, right?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.695
So that's 2 squared times 2 to
the x is equal to 2 the y.

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:19.280
And we add exponents when
we multiply two numbers

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.965
with the same base.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:24.690
So that's 2 to the 2 plus x is
equal to y-- sorry is equal to

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.350
2 to the y.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.780
So 2 plus x must equal y.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.230
And they do this all the time
on the SAT so you should

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.190
really-- these are easy problems
if you just remember

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.210
to do this and remember
exponent rules.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.810
And they want x in terms of y.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.230
So subtract 2 from both sides.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.250
You get x is equal
to y minus 2.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.570
And that is choice A.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.400
Next problem.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.650
Problem 12.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.960
If the degree measures of the
angles of a triangle are the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.840
ratio of 2 to 3 to 4, how many
degrees does the measure of

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.760
the largest angle exceed the
measure of the smallest angle?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.090
So let's say that the smallest
angle is-- I don't know--

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.920
let's say the smallest
angle is 2x.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.130
Then the middle angle
is going to be 3x.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.870
And then the largest angle
is going to be 4x.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.380
If I were to draw a triangle
it would look like this.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.180
2x, 3x, 4x.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.625
4x, not 45.

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:29.310
4x.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.780
And they all have to add up to
180 because they're the angles

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.050
of a triangle.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.270
So 2x plus 3x x plus 4x
is going to equal 180.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.870
And what is this?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.200
This is 2 plus 3 which
is 5, plus 4 is 9.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.940
So 9x is equal to 180.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.990
x is equal to 20.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.640
So the smallest angle is going
to be 40 degrees and the

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.680
largest angle is going to
be 80 degrees, right?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.770
4 times 20.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.240
And they want to know, by how
many degrees does the measure

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.500
of the largest angle
exceed the measure

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.340
the smallest angle?

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.180
So it's 80 minus 40.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.360
The largest minus the smallest.
80 minus 40 is equal

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.130
to 40 and that is choice C.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.380
Next problem.

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.910
Switch colors.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.920
Problem 13.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.150
The rate for a telephone call
between city A and city B is

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:33.400
$0.50 for the first minute and
$0.30 for each minute or

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.860
portion thereof.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:41.310
So $0.50 for the first minute
and then every extra minute it

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.210
charges $0.30.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.920
So $0.30 for every
extra minute.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.630
So if n is the number of
minutes-- the first minute is

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.160
there, so it's every minute
above the first minute-- so

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.370
that's n minus 1, right?

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.590
If you do it for 2 minutes you
get charged $0.50, and then 2

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.130
minus 1 is 1, so then
plus $0.30.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.150
And this is for n minutes--
I'm assuming n is minutes.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.860
Which of the following functions
describes the cost,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.160
in dollars, of a phone call
between the two cities that

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.780
lasts for n minutes, if n
is a positive integer?

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.460
All right, well.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.600
What did I write here?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.950
What choice is that?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.980
That is choice D.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.070
And once again, how did
I think about this?

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.890
If I say the cost of n minutes--
it's a function of n

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.570
minutes-- it equals, well
the first minute

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.980
is going to be $0.50.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.680
And then for every minute after
the first minute-- so

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.210
every minute after the first
minute can be represented by n

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.370
minus 1, right?

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.299
The second minute-- so 2 minus
1-- I get charged 1 minute

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.770
after the first minute, if
I speak for 2 minutes.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.720
For every minute after the first
minute, I'm going to get

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.840
charged $0.30.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.750
So that's how we did it.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.169
Problem 14.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.750
I don't know if I have--
actually let me just do this

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.840
next video because I have to do
just three more problems so

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.740
I might as well just
do a video for it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.130
I'll see you.
