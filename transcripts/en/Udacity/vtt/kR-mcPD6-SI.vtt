00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Again, a little further definition in existing market incumbents exists.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Customers can name the market. Customers want or need better performance.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it's usually a technology-driven play.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Positioning is driven by the product and how much value customers place on its features.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The risks in an existing market is thinking that the incumbents are dumb.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Typically, incumbents unless they're large corporations that are falling asleep

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
will defend their turf and remember the network effects of an incumbent.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It might mean that it's not only about their product but it might be all the ancillary services

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and third-party offerings they have in their catalog.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And remember, just as you're focused on innovation,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
most incumbents are focused on innovation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So before you jump into an existing market you need to take a look at the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
innovation rate of the incumbents.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, one of the interesting things is trying to figure out what sales looked like

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and what's the adoption rate in a new market.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It turns out one of the interesting curves for startup companies is a technology

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
lifecycle adoption curve popularized by Geoff Moore in a book called Crossing the Chasm.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And Moore postulated that there was a gap, a chasm, between visionaries and the mainstream

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and pragmatic and conservative market.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It turns out though in an existing market that chasm between these early adopters and the mainstream

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
is very small or nonexistent because if you were right entering an existing market

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
your sales curve, the spreadsheet you're putting together for your revenue,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
if you get it correctly should look just like this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're taking market share from incumbents from day one.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In an existing market, if customers react to your hypothesis that what they needed

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
was higher performance and you are correct, this is your revenue curve.

00:01:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Congratulations!
