[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:08.640
So let me make sure I
have this straight, Doc.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.810
Once we have correctly set up
the model notifications and

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.110
delegates, whenever we modify any
managed objects, the views just sync up?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.460
&gt;&gt; That's it, Marty.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.200
The delegate,
the NSFetchResultsController, and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.020
the notifications do all the work for
us.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.630
&gt;&gt; That's fantastic, Doc!

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.950
So now that we've
implemented all this for

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.270
the Messages app, we can go back to the
future and recover my last algorithm.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.770
&gt;&gt; Hold it, Marty.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.790
We're forgetting one thing.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.500
&gt;&gt; What's that, Doc?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.582
Aren't we creating new objects and
letting everything sync up?

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:44.840
&gt;&gt; Yes, Marty but
that's all in volatile memory!

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.890
All this setting and
managing our object models is nice, but

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.200
if we're not saving to disk,
we're not persisting, Marty.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.755
Come on Marty, let's go to XCode.
