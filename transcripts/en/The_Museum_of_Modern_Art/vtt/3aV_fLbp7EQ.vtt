00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:08.040
I've been working on Frank Lloyd Wright since
my MIT doctoral years; on his built and unbuilt

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.800
community designs.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.460
And the object that we're using for the focal
point of my work here is the first site plan

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.409
that he did for Galesburg, sometimes called
Galesburg Country Homes, sometimes called

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.369
The Acres.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.329
&nbsp;
It's a housing development about ten miles

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.329
south of Kalamazoo.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.130
&nbsp;
A group property owners figured that they

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.390
would be able to afford much more land if
they went outside of town.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.840
They bought a large track.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.800
They approached Wright about designing the
subdivision for them, and he agreed to do

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.309
it if he could design some of the houses.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.280
He wouldn't charge them for the subdivision
plan.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.840
&nbsp;
And using the 100 foot survey lines that they

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.109
had, he located at first the centers of all
the lots on these topo vertices.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.960
And then he would slide lots along the lines
in both directions.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.270
So, in fact, every one of the lots is centered
along one of those lines and would be very

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.830
easy to layout in practice.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.210
&nbsp;
When you look very closely, you see these

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.120
secondary little circles.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.850
And it turns out there's 17 or so of those
and each one depicts a choice open to one

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.850
of the communal members.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.380
&nbsp;
So each member would choose one of those lots,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.340
and the other one then would go unbuilt on
and would be communal space.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.790
And so it turns out that there are almost
a million and a half possible configurations

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.790
of this.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.640
But, yet, he's in complete control at the
same time.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.320
It's brilliant.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.820
&nbsp;
The most interesting aspect of the work that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.312
I'm doing that you can literally see here
and that we'll talk about with some of the

00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:51.490
other drawings is the incorporation of movement.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.130
It's the presence of movement and the changing
perspective in his conception of a place or

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.540
an object.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.930
And the relationship of that changing perception
to the landscape.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.030
How it helps you understand the landscape
that you're in and the role of that object

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.030
within it.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.990
Okay, so the question of movement and how
do you see movement in a drawing.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.780
Well, I would think maybe in two ways.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.750
One is this, the sinuous curving, continual
non-stopping nature of these roads.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.540
As you look at the drawing , your eye moves.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.610
Right.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.410
As though you were looking at a vine crawling
up the side of a building.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.860
&nbsp;
You cannot look at this drawing without your

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.000
eye following that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And so it's simulating.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.190
It's not only representing, it's simulating
movement there.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.190
That's one.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.870
&nbsp;
The other as we start to look at some of the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.910
other drawings, and we'll see how he actually
is moving the drawings and moving pieces of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.120
the drawings and moving layers in relation
to one another.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.770
This is the first initial study plan for the
great house known as Wingspread that Wright

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:11.599
designed and built in 1937 for Herbert Johnson
who was the owner of the Johnson Wax Company.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.700
&nbsp;
On this drawing, there's a wonderful little

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.840
diagram drawn here of a kind of an octagonal
central core with four wings spinning off

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.190
eccentrically.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.260
And when he began this drawing, it appears
that he has this octagonal-like core, and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.630
that the first wing follows the orientation
that's in this little diagram.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.250
But then it's cut out and moved and pasted
back in.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.970
And then that position, that relationship
of this wing to the core is duplicated.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.140
&nbsp;
The initial orientation that was lost in that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.550
is maintained in ghost lines and garden walls
and the orientation of a fireplace.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.410
And, in fact, it physically was moved.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.970
And then over the life of this drawing, you'll
notice how it's cut in the corners.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.620
The sheet itself was rotated on the drawing
board.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.370
So it's a very dynamic kind of process that's
going on.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.489
&nbsp;
This cut and paste method is a way of dealing

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.079
with or--or reenacting movement.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.759
And it's a fascinating process for so many
reasons.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.270
&nbsp;
One is that if you've ever designed a building,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.930
you lay out the plan.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.009
You know, typically you tape your sheet down,
it has one orientation.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.949
And you get comfortable and familiar with
that.

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.129
And if you come back to it later and it's
upside down or it's at an angle, it seems

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.039
foreign, and every architect will turn it
back to the original orientation because that's

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.069
what they understand.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.270
That's the imprint it's made on their mind.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.020
&nbsp;
Well, in this project, Wright &nbsp;intentionally

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.360
seems to be subventing that and changing that.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.370
So he's constantly thinking of it in a much
more complex way that becomes a modus operandi

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.699
for some of the later designs.
