important that a school like UCLA really

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.089
leads away by educating students that we
are a larger community than many of us

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
think and that all of us matter for the
world that we're trying to make and so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
we do a good job of educating students
who then become the leaders who then

have this idea the world gets larger and
most of us and hopefully all of us start

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.969

the end as King was teaching us each of

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.079
us needs all of us.
