00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.529
It feels very shameful. horrifying even, to
admit but there are times when we may find

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.120
ourselves daydreaming about a terrible thing
happening to someone close to us. Deep in

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.270
the privacy of our minds, we may feel it would
be a huge relief if a partner or family member

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.890
could just vanish from the face of the earth.
They might be run over at a crossing; their

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.690
plane might go down; they could contract a
rare and quickly fatal illness (it wouldn’t

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.250
hurt at all). It would be hugely sad of course,
but also in certain ways an immense liberation

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.910
and relief. No sooner has this thought crossed
our minds, we’re likely to chase it out

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.350
in horror – and feel deeply guilty about
our depravity. To put our macabre

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.380
imaginings into perspective, the first thing
to remember is how little we know of what

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.780
secretly goes through the minds of other people.
We’re aware of our own darkest thoughts

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.450
but rarely get to hear those of others. It’s
often the case, therefore, that things will

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.840
feel much rarer to us than they are in reality.
It turns out that grim imaginings are very

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.479
common. Counsellors and therapists – who
get to hear more of the hidden workings of

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.909
other people’s minds than anyone else – are
never surprised when a nice, sensible, interesting

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.150
client tentatively reveals an occasional wish
that a loved one would be vapourized. Being

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.579
close to someone necessarily involves a high
degree of what therapists call ‘ambivalence,’

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.470
a blending of deeply negative and positive
thoughts. When people play an outsize role

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.389
in our lives, when they have an enormous emotional
power over us, when our debt to them is immense,

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:46.789
we will both adore and at points resent them
hugely. There will be tenderness and rage;

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.090
attachment and revulsion. They can let us
down like few others can, they know our weakest

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.870
spots, they enchant but also exhaust us. We’re
not actually going to do anything – of course.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.669
We’re not even taking the tiniest preparatory
steps; we would never buy poison or encourage

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:08.860
them to go cliff-walking on stormy evenings.
But there is relief to be found in the odd

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.860
grim daydream nevertheless. Fantasies are
not plans of action. They don’t correspond

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.610
to our real values or intentions. They operate
as momentary escapes from powerful feelings.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.910
We fantasise about the death of a loved one
not because we truly want them gone but because

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.660
being close to them is such a large and therefore
at times tricky part of our lives. Our fantasy

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.560
is a strange but real tribute to the depth
of our bond. The guilt is a symptom that despite

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.380
the inevitable and very real tensions and
disappointments of the relationship, we care

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.760
about them very much. The meaning of the fantasy
isn’t that we are sick. It’s that loving

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.150
someone is never free of frustration. Fortunately,
it’s highly likely that our family member

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.790
or partner also harbours similar occasional fantasies
directed towards us and that they too feel

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.380
terribly ashamed and guilty in exactly the
way we do. This isn’t monstrosity either,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.700
just further evidence of the beautiful and
surprising subtleties of love.
