00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.780
In the last video, I showed
you that the definition of

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.189
efficiency, eta, is the work
that we do given the amount of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.450
heat we are given
to work with.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.020
And we showed that for an
engine, that could also be

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.390
rewritten as 1 minus Q2 over
Q1, or essentially, 1 minus

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570
the heat we output from our
engine divided by the amount

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.570
of heat we input from
our engine.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.940
Now we applied this formula to
a Carnot cycle, and we said,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.946
hey, for a Carnot engine,
we could get an

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:34.240
efficiency of this.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.490
So let me write this here.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.310
So the efficiency for Carnot,
eta for Carnot, is 1

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.800
minus T2 over T1.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.060
To get this result, we had to
use the fact that we were

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.290
dealing with the Carnot cycle
to use, you know, we were

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.902
moving along these isotherms,
and so I was able to take the

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:52.500
natural log of them and do all
of that, and I was able to get

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.140
this for the efficiency
of a Carnot engine.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.040
And let me be very clear.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.360
This is the efficiency that
can only be attained by a

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.030
Carnot engine.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.560
The other definitions of
efficiency-- so when I just

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.710
defined efficiency as equal to
the work performed divided by

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.280
the heat, let me call it the
heat input-- or when I defined

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.690
it as the net heat in.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.610
So Q1 minus Q2 over Q1.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.510
This applies to all
heat engines.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.370
This is true for all
heat engines,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.090
including the Carnot engine.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.940
A heat engine is an engine
that operates on heat.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.320
I probably should have said
that a while ago.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.740
And this engine that I made,
this Carnot engine, is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.930
definitely a engine that is
operating on heat, because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810
it's taking heat here,
and later it releases

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.590
the heat down here.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.180
The cycle just shows what's
happening to that engine.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.450
And I just want to make
that distinction, too.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.730
The engine is the actual
physical thing.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.660
The cycle just describes
what's happening to it.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.540
So with that said, I said that
this is only true for a Carnot

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.150
heat engine.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.848
Now, what I'm about to embark
on-- and I don't know if I'm

00:02:04.848 --> 00:02:05.830
going to finish it
in this video.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.520
It might take into the next
video to do it properly-- is

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.690
to show you that if we're
operating a heat engine

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.560
between two temperature
sources-- so I have my hot

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.240
temperature source, I'll call
that TH for T hot, and it's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.830
transferring some heat, Q1, and
some other heat is coming

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.410
out at Q2, and I'm performing
some work, and then my other

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.770
cold temperature reservoir,
I'll call that T

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.820
cold, is down here.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.670
And that's where I'm releasing
the heat, too.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.770
I'm going to show over the next
few videos that the most

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.960
efficient engine is this
theoretical Carnot engine.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.520
That no engine can get more
efficient than this.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.650
So if this is a Carnot
engine, this is the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.220
most efficient engine.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.380
Or this is the ideal, where
nothing is lost. Well, I'll go

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.710
into that in more detail.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.510
No engine can get more efficient
than this Carnot

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.670
heat engine.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.900
So to get there, to prove it to
you, I'm just going to play

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.680
with the Carnot engine a little
bit, just to show you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.430
some of the tools that it
has at its disposal.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.970
So one of the things-- let me
just draw a PV diagram.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.400
In the Carnot cycle we've done
so far, we've kind of always

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.330
moved in one direction.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.660
We had our isothermal
expansion.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.100
It went something like that.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.630
That was isothermal.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.670
Then we had our adiabatic
expansion-- and the whole time

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.815
we were going in that
direction-- and

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:57.990
it went like that.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.660
Then we had our isothermal
contraction.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.426
It went something like this.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.230
And then we had our adiabatic
contraction, to get to where

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.500
we were to begin with.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.590
So then we went back
like that.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.960
And the whole time, we
went in this kind

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.519
of clockwise direction.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.800
We went in the clockwise
direction, and we took in heat

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.410
up here-- because we were doing
work-- we took in heat

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.580
to keep our temperature
constant, and then we released

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.650
heat here to keep our
temperature from

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.530
going up from Q2.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.520
And so if I were to draw this
another way-- well, I just did

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.580
one like that, but let
me draw it like this.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.370
I could also depict it like
this, where that's my engine,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.230
this is my hot reservoir--
let me put this as

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.180
T1-- T1 is up here.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.760
It transferred Q1 to
my Carnot engine.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.360
My Carnot engine did some work,
and then left over, it

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.130
transferred into my cold
reservoir, T2,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.580
it transferred Q2.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.490
This is another way of depicting
what went on in this

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.060
Carnot cycle.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.040
And here I've actually
drawn the engine.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.630
Now, one of the tools I want to
show you is that this is a

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.900
reversible reaction.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.810
Or that we can take this and
go the other way around.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.520
And it's dependent upon an
assumption that I threw out a

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.420
long time ago.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.900
So when I first drew these, I
kind of introduced you to the

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.940
idea of a quasistatic process.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.520
And quasistatic just means,
look, you do it really slowly,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.460
so that you can always say that
you're close enough to

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.700
equilibrium that your
macro state

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.300
variables are always defined.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.830
And that was the whole
justification for dealing with

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.370
pebbles like this.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.890
Instead of just doing it
wholesale, instead of just

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.150
moving all the pebbles, and just
getting to this state,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.930
from A to B kind of jumping, I
wanted to do it gradually, so

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.570
that I would be defined at
every point in between.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.760
That's what quasistatic
did for us.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.970
And when I actually made the
video quasistatic processes, I

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.570
said, you know, quasistatic
processes, for the most part,

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.830
are reversible.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.820
And sometimes I used the
words interchangeably.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.480
Now, by definition, our
theoretical Carnot cycle is

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.760
said to be, not only is it
quasistatic, but it is also

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.100
reversible.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.990
Which means at any point in
time-- let's say we've moved a

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.980
couple of pebbles, and we've
gotten right here.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.540
If we want to, if we're in the
mood, we can add some pebbles

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.080
back, and just follow this right
back to where we were.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.040
That's what reversible means.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.770
It means you can reverse
something.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.180
Now, what has to be ideal about
the system in order for

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.930
that to be true?

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.950
Well, it means that the actual
movement of our piston, of

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.720
this movable ceiling, that it
shouldn't have any friction.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.000
Because if some of the heat is
lost to friction, then when we

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.610
go back, we would have lost
some of our heat.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.670
Some heat would have been
destroyed, just going from one

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.360
state forward and back.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.350
So the assumption that we have
to make in order for the

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.530
Carnot cycle to be reversible
is that it's frictionless.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.770
So the Carnot heat engine, this
theoretical engine, is a

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.750
frictionless engine, which is
theoretically impossible.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.150
To be completely frictionless.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
To be-- but we'll talk more
about that in the future.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.800
So if you have a completely
frictionless engine, and it's

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.890
quasistatic, it's
also reversible.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.983
So if we want to do
it reversible,

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:33.250
what does that mean?

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.770
It means I could start in this
state, my state A that I've

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.680
labelled before, but instead
of going around that way, I

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.520
could go around the other way.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.050
So what I could do first, is I
could adiabatically expand

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.960
first-- so maybe let me redraw
it, so I do it the other way.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.810
So I could reverse
this reaction.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.120
And it would happen the
exact same way.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.060
And that's an artifact of that
I'm always in equilibrium, and

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.490
that my system is frictionless,
that I don't

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.050
lose energy just going
back and forth.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.120
So I could start at state
A here, and then I could

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.060
adiabatically contract.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.925
Adiabatic contraction would look
something like this, and

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:15.590
it'll get to that state.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.530
Then I can isothermically
expand.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.780
So I'm going like this.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.300
And as I isothermically expand--
so I'm going like

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.010
this, I'm all along an
isotherm-- I'd doing some

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.710
isothermic expansion-- so in
this case, I'm doing work, but

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.440
I'm doing work isothermically,
right?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.330
At some cold isotherm.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.450
Let's call it T2, right?

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.840
Just like this was T2.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.080
So in this case, if I'm
expanding, and I'm staying at

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.180
T2, and I'm sitting
on top of my T2

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.210
reservoir, heat is coming.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.900
This area under the curve,
the work I'm

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.200
doing, is the heat added.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.080
This is Q2, and that is given
to me by my T2 reservoir.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.460
So everything is going
in reverse.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.060
That's the whole idea.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:17.910
Then I adiabatically contract,
like that, and then I

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:23.800
isothermically contract,
like that, to get

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.480
back where I started.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.840
When I isothermically contract,
what's happening?

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.820
Work is being done to me, so now
all of this area over here

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.090
will be negative.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.040
And in order to keep my
temperature constant, I have

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.580
to release heat.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.740
So I'm releasing heat, but
I'm doing it at a high

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.100
temperature.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.100
So I'm releasing it into
my T1 reservoir.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.330
So it's the exact same thing
as it happened before, but

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.510
since when I go in a reverse
direction, some

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.160
work is being applied.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.570
So now, when you look at it this
way, when you figure out

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.930
all of the areas,
the area in here

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.720
will actually be negative.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.530
And the reason why I'm saying
that is because the positive

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.380
work values are going
to be this.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.320
This is going to be the
positive, what I'm doing in

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.420
blue right here.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.200
And the negative work
values are going to

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.090
be all of this stuff.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.190
So if you wanted to figure out
the total work done, it's

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.070
going to be negative.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.210
So what's happening, if I run
the Carnot cycle in reverse--

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.300
so I'll call it the Carnot
refrigerator.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.790
No, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.870
I'll call it Carnot reverse.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.740
But it's handy that R also
stands for refrigerator.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.820
This is the Carnot engine.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:42.170
It does work by using heat, by
taking advantage of the heat

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.170
difference between this hot--
you could view this as the T

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.040
hot and the T cold.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.640
Now, a reverse Carnot engine, or
maybe you call it a Carnot

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.990
refrigerator, does
the opposite.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.830
That's exactly what I
just drew over here.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:02.440
What it does is, it starts with
a cold body-- I'll call

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.970
that T cold, or T2-- it takes
some smaller amount of heat

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.780
from the cold body.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.550
Some work has to be input
into the system

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.190
in order to do this.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.630
And then it puts more heat-- you
can kind of view it as a

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.250
combination of this work and
this heat taken from the cold

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.060
body-- and it gives it
to the warm body.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.300
Sorry.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.320
This is Q2, and it
gives it Q1.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.090
So everything just happens
completely in reverse.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.180
And that's just a byproduct
of, this is reversible.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.990
So I can just go and I can do,
if this is the way we went

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.740
before, when we're an engine,
if we want to be a

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.560
refrigerator, we go the other
direction, and everything just

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.540
gets reversed.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.600
And I want you to really
understand

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.420
that this is doable.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.670
That there's nothing
wrong with this.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.080
You might say, doesn't this
defy the second law of

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.230
thermodynamics?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.960
We're taking heat from a cold
body to a warm body?

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.640
And my answer will be the
same thing I said

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.030
on my entropy videos.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.020
I said, well, no.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.240
We're applying some work.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.290
This is a refrigerator.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.740
So some work has to be done
in order to do this.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.010
And whatever object that is
doing the work-- it may be

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.150
some, in the case of your
refrigerator, it's a

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.710
compressor.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:19.280
That is adding more entropy to
the universe than the entropy

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.300
that's being destroyed
by our refrigerator.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.100
So this does not defy the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.410
Now, I want to make another
point about the Carnot engine.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.070
Let me take the reverse
Carnot engine.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.530
Let me call it the Carnot
refrigerator.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.610
So if we take that-- and this is
really just more math than

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.860
anything else.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.090
If we're taking in Q2, adding
in some work, and producing

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.380
Q1, we can scale this
up arbitrarily.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:13:03.910
If we take x times Q2 in, and
we put in x times W in, then

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.930
we're going to put x times Q1
into our top reservoir.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.070
And that makes sense,
because these are

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.450
just arbitrary numbers.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.780
For example, if we have two
Carnot engines in parallel,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.870
you can just kind of view that
whole thing as two Carnot

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.630
engines doing it together, so
all of these would be 2s.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.010
If we had three Carnot engines
doing it together, all of

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.520
those would be three, you could
just view them as one

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.020
collective engine.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.090
Now, with that said, I think
I've laid the framework for at

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.820
least the ideas that will let us
show that the Carnot engine

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.060
is the most efficient engine
that's able to be produced.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:46.120
And given that the Carnot
engine's efficiency is this--

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.200
and we're going to prove that
it's the most efficient

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.630
engine-- this becomes the upper
bound on efficiency for

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.080
any engine that anybody
can or will ever make.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.350
And I'll kind of
do the crowning

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.490
touch in the next video.
