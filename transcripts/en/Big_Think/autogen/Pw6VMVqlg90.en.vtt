so we'll start with our first question

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760
so we'll start with our first question
 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.179
so we'll start with our first question
which is kind of an obvious one why is

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189
which is kind of an obvious one why is
 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.189
which is kind of an obvious one why is
the penis shaped I thought you'd never

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199
the penis shaped I thought you'd never
 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.000
the penis shaped I thought you'd never
ask

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010
ask
 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.460
ask
no it's that's the titular title of this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470
no it's that's the titular title of this
 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.450
no it's that's the titular title of this
collection and if you think about the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
collection and if you think about the
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.549
collection and if you think about the
shape of the penis it's not immediately

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559
shape of the penis it's not immediately
 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.229
shape of the penis it's not immediately
apparent why it's shaped the way that it

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239
apparent why it's shaped the way that it
 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.570
apparent why it's shaped the way that it
is it looks very different from penises

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580
is it looks very different from penises
 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.450
is it looks very different from penises
of other primate species and I talked

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
of other primate species and I talked
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.950
of other primate species and I talked
about in the book how I've unfortunately

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960
about in the book how I've unfortunately
 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.799
about in the book how I've unfortunately
seen more gorilla penises and chimpanzee

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809
seen more gorilla penises and chimpanzee
 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.899
seen more gorilla penises and chimpanzee
penises and orangutan penises and I care

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909
penises and orangutan penises and I care
 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.910
penises and orangutan penises and I care
to mention because I used to do research

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
to mention because I used to do research
 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.530
to mention because I used to do research
with them but ours are large basically

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540
with them but ours are large basically
 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.000
with them but ours are large basically
compared especially large compared to

distinctive in its shape I'm gonna have

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170
distinctive in its shape I'm gonna have

to use my hands here I don't know way to

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060
to use my hands here I don't know way to
 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.790
to use my hands here I don't know way to
get around this here but there's the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800
get around this here but there's the
 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.870
get around this here but there's the
sort of mushroom caps or glands it's

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880
sort of mushroom caps or glands it's
 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.430

the long serve rigid shaft I'm talking

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000
the long serve rigid shaft I'm talking
 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.990
the long serve rigid shaft I'm talking
about a tumescent penis of course and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000
about a tumescent penis of course and
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.690
about a tumescent penis of course and
the coronal Ridge which is the sort of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700
the coronal Ridge which is the sort of
 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.900
the coronal Ridge which is the sort of
umbrella lip-lip underneath the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910
umbrella lip-lip underneath the
 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.370
umbrella lip-lip underneath the
underneath the glans head and that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
underneath the glans head and that
 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.170
underneath the glans head and that
really seems to be the key from an

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180
really seems to be the key from an
 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.610
really seems to be the key from an
evolutionary perspective the fact that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620
evolutionary perspective the fact that
 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.430
evolutionary perspective the fact that
we've got this really pronounced coronal

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440
we've got this really pronounced coronal
 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.580
we've got this really pronounced coronal

little again I'm using my hand so I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360
little again I'm using my hand so I
 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.550
little again I'm using my hand so I
don't like doing this but there's a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
don't like doing this but there's a
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.750
don't like doing this but there's a
there's a friend you'll on the sort of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760
there's a friend you'll on the sort of
 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.680
there's a friend you'll on the sort of
thin tab of skin basically so all these

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690
thin tab of skin basically so all these
 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.810
thin tab of skin basically so all these
unique features of the human penis

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820
unique features of the human penis
 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.750
unique features of the human penis
compared to the you know basically sort

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760
compared to the you know basically sort
 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.990
compared to the you know basically sort
of insemination device of chimpanzees is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000
of insemination device of chimpanzees is
 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.380
of insemination device of chimpanzees is
revealing about what it's for so the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
revealing about what it's for so the
 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.649
revealing about what it's for so the
argument is basically that the the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659
argument is basically that the the
 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.500
argument is basically that the the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510
coronal Ridge serves to retract
 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.039
coronal Ridge serves to retract
semen from the vaginal tract that had

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049
semen from the vaginal tract that had
 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.779
semen from the vaginal tract that had
been deposited there from another male

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789
been deposited there from another male
 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.360
been deposited there from another male
that had sex with the same woman and

that had sex with the same woman and
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.400
that had sex with the same woman and
pulls it out basically it's a sperm

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410
pulls it out basically it's a sperm
 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.559
pulls it out basically it's a sperm

other thing you know sighs like I said
it's big compared to other species I

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199
it's big compared to other species I
 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.500
it's big compared to other species I
mean gorillas are you know they're like

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510
mean gorillas are you know they're like
 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.199
mean gorillas are you know they're like
you know they're hung like gnats they're

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209
you know they're hung like gnats they're
 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.970
you know they're hung like gnats they're
450 pound 50 pounds but they're not

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980
450 pound 50 pounds but they're not
 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.530
450 pound 50 pounds but they're not
terribly impressive in that particular

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540
terribly impressive in that particular
 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.610
terribly impressive in that particular
area

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
area
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.670
area
and but ours are large and I've seen

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680
and but ours are large and I've seen
 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.969
and but ours are large and I've seen
some human penises too I must say and

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979
some human penises too I must say and
 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.330
some human penises too I must say and
the the size matters because it matters

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340
the the size matters because it matters
 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.189
the the size matters because it matters
actually more for the man because the

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199
actually more for the man because the
 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.990
actually more for the man because the
deeper you go the largely are the deeper

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000
deeper you go the largely are the deeper
 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.490
deeper you go the largely are the deeper
you're going to go and the more

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
you're going to go and the more
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.659
you're going to go and the more
difficult is going to be for whatever

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669
difficult is going to be for whatever
 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.920
difficult is going to be for whatever
males follow you at least if you're a

males follow you at least if you're a
 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.289
males follow you at least if you're a
heterosexual male to pull out whatever

the scientific literature to understand
them in any meaningful way so you know I

them in any meaningful way so you know I
 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.270
them in any meaningful way so you know I
think and that's actually a good example

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280
think and that's actually a good example
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.700
think and that's actually a good example
that the the female ejaculation point

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710
that the the female ejaculation point
 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.510
that the the female ejaculation point
which is something that sounds

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520
which is something that sounds
 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.430
which is something that sounds
outrageous but in fact you know for a

outrageous but in fact you know for a
 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.210

sexologist thought it was a myth they
 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.760
sexologist thought it was a myth they
didn't think that women could actually

didn't think that women could actually
 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.710
didn't think that women could actually
ejaculate and I'm not talking about just

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720
ejaculate and I'm not talking about just
 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.270
ejaculate and I'm not talking about just
sort of vaginal lubrication I'm talking

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280
sort of vaginal lubrication I'm talking
 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.670
sort of vaginal lubrication I'm talking
about expelling copious amounts of fluid

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
about expelling copious amounts of fluid
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.600
about expelling copious amounts of fluid
very much like a male seminal emission

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610
very much like a male seminal emission
 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.550
very much like a male seminal emission
but many women do report having these

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560
but many women do report having these
 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.760
but many women do report having these
sort of ejaculatory experiences and they

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770
sort of ejaculatory experiences and they
 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.890
sort of ejaculatory experiences and they
thought they were urinating a bit

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900
thought they were urinating a bit
 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.640
thought they were urinating a bit
because they thought that they were

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650
because they thought that they were
 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.159
because they thought that they were
somehow of income you know incontinent

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
somehow of income you know incontinent
 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.260
somehow of income you know incontinent
and the the husbands and the boyfriends

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270
and the the husbands and the boyfriends
 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.089
and the the husbands and the boyfriends
would get upset and why can't you go to

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099
would get upset and why can't you go to
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.350
would get upset and why can't you go to
bathroom before you have sex and they

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360
bathroom before you have sex and they
 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.430
bathroom before you have sex and they
just didn't understand that this was

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440
just didn't understand that this was
 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.120
just didn't understand that this was
actually not urine this was actually a

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130
actually not urine this was actually a
 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.999
actually not urine this was actually a
type of sexual fluid that women

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009
type of sexual fluid that women
 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:19.860
type of sexual fluid that women
experience when they're intensely

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870
experience when they're intensely
 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.860
experience when they're intensely
aroused and it saves marriages I mean I

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870
aroused and it saves marriages I mean I
 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.230
aroused and it saves marriages I mean I
think just having those facts and

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240
think just having those facts and
 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.029
think just having those facts and
understanding that this is not anomalous

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039
understanding that this is not anomalous
 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.010
understanding that this is not anomalous
this is normal this is not something to

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020
this is normal this is not something to
 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.209
this is normal this is not something to
be ashamed of

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219
be ashamed of
 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:33.119
be ashamed of
and looking at it from a very sort of

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129
and looking at it from a very sort of
 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.799
and looking at it from a very sort of
clinical objective perspective that is

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:36.809
clinical objective perspective that is
 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:38.999
clinical objective perspective that is
reduces anxiety to leave the AIT's our

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009
reduces anxiety to leave the AIT's our
 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.469
reduces anxiety to leave the AIT's our
sense of shame and it has practical

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479
sense of shame and it has practical
 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.279
sense of shame and it has practical
consequences for how we interact with

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289
consequences for how we interact with
 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:47.429
consequences for how we interact with
each other yeah and there's something

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:47.439
each other yeah and there's something
 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.869
each other yeah and there's something
you said there that I really wanted to

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879
you said there that I really wanted to
 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:51.899
you said there that I really wanted to
follow up on which is the sense of shame

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909
follow up on which is the sense of shame
 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.949
follow up on which is the sense of shame
that is often part of our conversation

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:55.959
that is often part of our conversation
 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:00.359
that is often part of our conversation
about biology so I'm wondering if having

00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:00.369
about biology so I'm wondering if having
 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.040
about biology so I'm wondering if having
a better understanding of the way

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050
a better understanding of the way
 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.089
a better understanding of the way
biology shapes our motivations and our

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099
biology shapes our motivations and our
 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.549
biology shapes our motivations and our
actions if you think that that will

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:08.559
actions if you think that that will
 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.129
actions if you think that that will
impact the way we talk about sex as a

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139
impact the way we talk about sex as a
 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.070
impact the way we talk about sex as a
culture do you see that happening now do

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080
culture do you see that happening now do
 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.779

you think what do you think about the

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789
you think what do you think about the
 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.100
you think what do you think about the
future I do think so I'm actually this

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110
future I do think so I'm actually this
 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.179

is one of the few areas where I'm

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:18.189
is one of the few areas where I'm
 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:20.159
is one of the few areas where I'm
actually optimistic I'm generally more

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169
actually optimistic I'm generally more
 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.169
actually optimistic I'm generally more
of a pessimist but I think that the more

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:22.179
of a pessimist but I think that the more
 

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:26.459
of a pessimist but I think that the more
we learn and discuss very openly and

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:26.469
we learn and discuss very openly and
 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:29.790
we learn and discuss very openly and
frankly things that are that have

frankly things that are that have
 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.129
frankly things that are that have
historically developmentally been

shameful for us and just get it out

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:34.209
shameful for us and just get it out
 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.329
shameful for us and just get it out
there and talk about it even though it

might have that sort of intrinsic
snicker factor I mean it's fine for

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729
snicker factor I mean it's fine for
 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:40.889
snicker factor I mean it's fine for
people to laugh cuz these are kind of

people to laugh cuz these are kind of
 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.429

today so not a lot has changed really I

today so not a lot has changed really I
 

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:33.719
today so not a lot has changed really I
mean even though we've taken a more

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.189

have a ways to go but you know you

00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:38.709
have a ways to go but you know you
 

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:39.899
have a ways to go but you know you
wouldn't think that your great

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:39.909
wouldn't think that your great
 

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.830
wouldn't think that your great
grandmother for example you know

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:41.840
grandmother for example you know
 

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.240
grandmother for example you know
ever thought about female ejaculation

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.250
ever thought about female ejaculation
 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.950
ever thought about female ejaculation
but you know she probably might have had

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:44.960
but you know she probably might have had
 

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.980
but you know she probably might have had
it herself and it's just not something

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:47.990
it herself and it's just not something
 

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.900
it herself and it's just not something
that we think about in terms of other

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:49.910
that we think about in terms of other
 

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.310
that we think about in terms of other
people but I think it's it has a

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320
people but I think it's it has a
 

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.290
people but I think it's it has a
humanitarian value just being

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:56.300
humanitarian value just being
 

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.480
humanitarian value just being
sympathetic and understanding about

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:58.490
sympathetic and understanding about
 

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.080
sympathetic and understanding about
people's sex lives mm-hmm um and so when

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.090
people's sex lives mm-hmm um and so when
 

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.370
people's sex lives mm-hmm um and so when
it comes to the humanitarian value do

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:06.380
it comes to the humanitarian value do
 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.670
it comes to the humanitarian value do
you see evolutionary psychology and

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680
you see evolutionary psychology and
 

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.220
you see evolutionary psychology and
biology as kind of reductionist or

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.230
 
 

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.060

mechanistic at all
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.620
mechanistic at all
yeah it's both reductionistic

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:17.630
yeah it's both reductionistic
 

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.080
yeah it's both reductionistic
increasingly reductionistic the deeper

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.090
increasingly reductionistic the deeper
 

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.210
increasingly reductionistic the deeper
and more intricate you go in terms of

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:22.220
and more intricate you go in terms of
 

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.840
and more intricate you go in terms of
the mechanisms and explaining particular

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:25.850
the mechanisms and explaining particular
 

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.270
the mechanisms and explaining particular
traits or behavioral patterns or

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:28.280
traits or behavioral patterns or
 

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.160
traits or behavioral patterns or
psychological processes and it's

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.170
psychological processes and it's
 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.750
psychological processes and it's
deterministic all of science is really

think this is part of the reason that

think this is part of the reason that
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.800
think this is part of the reason that

first of all it reminds people that were

first of all it reminds people that were

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:26.900
Easy's you don't like to use word
 

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.140
Easy's you don't like to use word
instinct and I think it's a very loaded

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.150

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:49.580
more deterministic and reductionistic it
 

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.250
more deterministic and reductionistic it
becomes the more people feel like they

have no control over their

that there is such a thing it's free

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.030
that there is such a thing it's free
 

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.820
that there is such a thing it's free
well I think it's an illusion I think

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:57.830
well I think it's an illusion I think
 

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.710
well I think it's an illusion I think
it's a psychological illusion that we

00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720
it's a psychological illusion that we
 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.400
it's a psychological illusion that we
can reflect upon our own mental contents

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.410
can reflect upon our own mental contents
 

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.560
can reflect upon our own mental contents
and you know try to take the perspective

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.570
and you know try to take the perspective
 

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.120
and you know try to take the perspective
of what we would do why we were thinking

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.130
of what we would do why we were thinking
 

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.990
of what we would do why we were thinking
what we're thinking when we made a

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000
what we're thinking when we made a
 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.940
what we're thinking when we made a
decision at the time but in fact it's

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:09.950
decision at the time but in fact it's
 

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.760
decision at the time but in fact it's
all just retrospective and I think it's

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.770
all just retrospective and I think it's
 

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.980
all just retrospective and I think it's
largely a cognitive illusion and simply

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:17.990
largely a cognitive illusion and simply
 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.100
largely a cognitive illusion and simply
knowing this about our ourselves has

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.110
knowing this about our ourselves has
 

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.720
knowing this about our ourselves has
effects we know from psychology

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:22.730
effects we know from psychology
 

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.190
effects we know from psychology
experiments if you tell people that

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200
experiments if you tell people that
 

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.800
experiments if you tell people that
there is no free will and you you couch

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:26.810
there is no free will and you you couch
 

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.310
there is no free will and you you couch
behavioral explanations in terms of

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320
behavioral explanations in terms of
 

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.900
behavioral explanations in terms of
determinism causal determinism it

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:31.910
determinism causal determinism it
 

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.300
determinism causal determinism it
actually genuinely makes them more

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.310
actually genuinely makes them more
 

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.050
actually genuinely makes them more
selfish makes them less altruistic and

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.060
selfish makes them less altruistic and
 

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.880
selfish makes them less altruistic and
it's a it's not effect really I mean

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:39.890
it's a it's not effect really I mean
 

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.500
it's a it's not effect really I mean
social psychology has demonstrated this

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:41.510
social psychology has demonstrated this
 

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.630
social psychology has demonstrated this
that the more people think you don't

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.640
that the more people think you don't
 

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.660
that the more people think you don't
have free will the worse you behave or

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:46.670
have free will the worse you behave or
 

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.270
have free will the worse you behave or
the worse they behave and I don't know

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.280
the worse they behave and I don't know
 

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.160
the worse they behave and I don't know
there's any real you know simple way to

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.170
there's any real you know simple way to
 

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.320
there's any real you know simple way to
get around that problem I think just

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.330
get around that problem I think just
 

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.250
get around that problem I think just
simply understanding how that works and

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:57.260
simply understanding how that works and
 

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.340
simply understanding how that works and
taking stock of why we feel that way can

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:00.350
taking stock of why we feel that way can
 

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.490
taking stock of why we feel that way can
have effects also on our you know our

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:03.500
have effects also on our you know our
 

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.880
have effects also on our you know our
emotional responses to say the freewill

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:06.890
emotional responses to say the freewill
 

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.550
emotional responses to say the freewill
question yeah and you wrote in the book

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.560
question yeah and you wrote in the book
 

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.060
question yeah and you wrote in the book
I remember one scene where you were

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.070
I remember one scene where you were
 

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.280
I remember one scene where you were
particularly talking about a scientific

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.290
particularly talking about a scientific
 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.830
particularly talking about a scientific
paper that you had read and scientists

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:17.840
paper that you had read and scientists
 

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.450
paper that you had read and scientists
mentioned sort of covering up from

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:19.460
mentioned sort of covering up from
 

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.710
mentioned sort of covering up from
people from society the idea that we

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720
people from society the idea that we
 

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.170
people from society the idea that we
don't have fun well yeah yeah so where

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.180
don't have fun well yeah yeah so where
 

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.180
don't have fun well yeah yeah so where
does that leave us what are the larger

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.190
does that leave us what are the larger
 

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.160
does that leave us what are the larger
implications that that that's a big one

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.170
implications that that that's a big one
 

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.550
implications that that that's a big one
I mean I was asked to write a piece in

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560
I mean I was asked to write a piece in
 

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.400
I mean I was asked to write a piece in

about you know what would I recommend
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.110
about you know what would I recommend
basically if some if a scientist

basically if some if a scientist
