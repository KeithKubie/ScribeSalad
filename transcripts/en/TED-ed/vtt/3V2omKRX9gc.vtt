00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Probability is an area of mathematics
that is everywhere.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We hear about it in weather forecasts,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
like there's an 80% chance
of snow tomorrow.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's used in making predictions in sports,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
such as determining the odds
for who will win the Super Bowl.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Probability is also used in helping
to set auto insurance rates

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's what keeps casinos
and lotteries in business.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
How can probability affect you?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's look at a simple
probability problem.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Does it pay to randomly guess
on all 10 questions

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
on a true/ false quiz?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In other words,
if you were to toss a fair coin

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
10 times, and use it
to choose the answers,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
what is the probability
you would get a perfect score?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It seems simple enough. There are only two
possible outcomes for each question.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But with a 10-question true/ false quiz,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
there are lots of possible ways
to write down different combinations

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of Ts and Fs. To understand
how many different combinations,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
let's think about a much smaller
true/ false quiz

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with only two questions.
You could answer

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"true true," or "false false,"
or one of each.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
First "false" then "true,"
or first "true" then "false."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So that's four different ways to write
the answers for a two-question quiz.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What about a 10-question quiz?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, this time, there are too many
to count and list by hand.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
In order to answer this question, we need
to know the fundamental counting principle.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The fundamental counting principle states

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that if there are A possible outcomes
for one event,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and B possible outcomes for another event,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
then there are A times B ways
to pair the outcomes.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Clearly this works
for a two-question true/ false quiz.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There are two different answers
you could write for the first question,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and two different answers you could
write for the second question.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways
to write the answers for a two-question quiz.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now let's consider the 10-question quiz.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
To do this, we just need to extend
the fundamental counting principle a bit.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We need to realize that there are two
possible answers for each of the 10 questions.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the number of possible outcomes is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
2, times 2, times 2, times 2,
times 2, times 2,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Or, a shorter way to say
that is 2 to the 10th power,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which is equal to 1,024.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That means of all the ways
you could write down your Ts and Fs,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
only one of the 1,024 ways would match
the teacher's answer key perfectly.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So the probability of you getting
a perfect score by guessing

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is only 1 out of 1,024,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or about a 10th of a percent.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In fact, what would be
the most common score

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
if you and all your friends
were to always randomly guess

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at every question on
a 10-question true/ false quiz?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well, not everyone would get
exactly 5 out of 10.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But the average score, in the long run,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
would be 5.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
In a situation like this,
there are two possible outcomes:

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a question is right or wrong,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and the probability
of being right by guessing

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is always the same: 1/2.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
To find the average number
you would get right by guessing,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you multiply the number of questions

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
by the probability
of getting the question right.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Hopefully you study for quizzes,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
since it clearly doesn't pay to guess.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But at one point, you probably took
a standardized test like the SAT,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and most people have to guess
on a few questions.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If there are 20 questions
and five possible answers

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for each question, what is the probability
you would get all 20 right

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
by randomly guessing?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And what should you expect
your score to be?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Let's use the ideas from before.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
First, since the probability of getting
a question right by guessing is 1/5,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we would expect to get 1/5
of the 20 questions right.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Yikes - that's only four questions!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Are you thinking that the probability
of getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's find out just how small.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Do you recall the fundamental
counting principle that was stated before?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
With five possible outcomes
for each question,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
we would multiply 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Well, we would just use 5 as a factor

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
20 times, and 5 to the 20th power

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
648 thousand, 625.
Wow - that's huge!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.650
So the probability of getting all questions
correct by randomly guessing

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.982
is about 1 in 95 trillion.
