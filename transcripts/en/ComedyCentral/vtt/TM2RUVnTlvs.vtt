 It's Monday and that means

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.914
 the big game
 against Galveston

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:16.682
 is just a few days away.

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:18.618
 We're praying that new guy,
 Coach Thompson,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.487
 is getting our
 Bronconeers ready for combat.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.289
You the new football
coach down at the high school?

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.124
Yes, sir.
Coach Thompson.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:26.125
This is my wife, Amy.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.193
Hey, y'all.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.062
Coach Crawford
was like family.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.596
You got some
big shoes to fill.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.198
We sure love our
football around here,

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.533
more than anything.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.435
My wife baked you
up a pecan crumb.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.537
Bronconeers.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.406
Ain't it good
to be the coach?

Now, I'm not sure
what you heard about me,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.360
but I do things
a little different

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:03.162
than y'all are used to
here in Stewford Heights.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:04.831
This season, we're gonna
be the first team

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.399
in the county to run
a no-huddle offense.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.568
You don't like that?

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.536
You can just look at my 14-2
record Northeast last year.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.905
Second, we do
two-a-days every day.

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:14.373
Mm-hmm.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.910

go to with me on this one.

No raping?

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.119
But coach, we play football.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.854
My team, my rules.
You don't like it,

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.823
don't let the door rape
you on the way out.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.592
(clipboard slamming on floor)

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.759
Can we rape
at away games?

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.461
What if it's Halloween

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.363
and she's dressed
like a sexy cat?

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:39.232
What if she thinks
it's rape

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.800
(Coach Thompson)
Still no.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.102
What about,
like, a sexy ladybug?

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.103
Mm.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.072
(disappointed sighing)

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.240
A ghost?

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.408
What about a sexy owl?

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.543
(bell ringing)

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.012
Sexy Transformer?

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.814
What if my mom
is the D.A.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.849
and won't prosecute?

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.117
Can I rape?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.118
No, you cannot.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.553
(disappointed sighing)

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.722
What if she's drunk
and has a slight reputation

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.190
and no one's
gonna believe her?

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:05.725
Okay.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.793
The girl said yes to me
the other day,

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:08.794
but it was
about something else.

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:09.795
No.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:10.897
What if the girl said yes

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.199
but then she changes her
mind out of nowhere,

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.534
like a crazy person.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.568
You gotta stop.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.569
No, you gotta stop!

Where did that come from?

(woman)
Hey.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.717
You're that new coach
who don't like raping.

How are our boys supposed to
celebrate when they win?

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.621
Or blow off steam
if they lose?

(hocking a loogie, spitting)

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.959
That's not very
neighborly, ladies.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.728
These folks,
that's just their way, okay?

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.431
You can't bring a wet mule
around a hot corn oven.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.333
Right?

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.036
How about just backing off this
whole no raping thing for now?

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.370
We've been through
this a million ti--

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:52.672
I know we've been
through it and I know

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.040
we have a daughter, okay?

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.210
I know that and I love her,
but I am so tired.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.711
I don't know why,
but I am,

00:02:58.744 --> 00:02:59.846

Hey, Coach, um.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:11.424
Can I come in?

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.326
Sure.

Uh, I'm sorry to bother
you at home, Coach,

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.300
but you're the closest thing
I ever had to a dad

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.770
and I just wanna,
you know, ask.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:26.672
Go ahead, son.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.407
But, like, what if someone
else is raping her, right,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.809
and I'm just, like,
filming it on my phone?

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.245
No, no, it's still a no.
You're just as guilty,

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.113
but you already
knew that, right?

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:35.715

straight, Doc.

ever rape again?

It's about violently dominating
anyone that stands

between you
