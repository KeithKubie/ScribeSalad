00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.050
We're now starting test 7.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.280
And we're on section two.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.039
Let's see, problem
1 is on page 774.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:19.450
So they say set x-- x is equal
to this-- 30, 31, 32, 33.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.320
I haven't read the problem
yet, I'm just

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.900
drawing what they drew.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:33.000
This is 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
Sets x and y are shown above.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.850
How many numbers in set
x are also in set y?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.140
Well hopefully it's fairly
straightforward.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.650
Is 30 in set y?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.356
No.

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:44.840
Then is 31 in set y?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.380
No.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.040
32 is, right?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.660
And so is 33.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.320
1, 2, the answer is 2.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.090
That's choice A.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.370
Not too tough, huh?

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.550
All right, problem number 2.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.630
If Peg traveled 10 miles in 2
hours, and Linda traveled

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.880
twice as far in 1/2 the
time-- So Linda

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.280
traveled twice as far.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.950
So twice as far is 10 miles.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.170
So she traveled 20
miles, right?

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.760
Times 2, that's all I did.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.810
And they say, in 1/2 the time,
so she traveled 20 miles in 1

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.050
hour, right?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.700
I just do the 1/2 here.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.320
20 miles in 1 hour.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.220
What was Linda's average speed
in miles per hour?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.270
She did 20 miles in 1 hour.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.170
Well that's 20 miles per hour.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230
And that's choice C.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.320
Also not a difficult problem.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.880
Not that you should feel bad if
you had it wrong, it's just

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.860
all about practice.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.600
It's all about actually
reading the problem.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.190
I know that might seem
a bit obvious,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.860
but you'd be surprised.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.110
You've even seen me make a
couple of mistakes by not

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.910
reading the problem properly.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.530
OK, problem 3.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.670
My cousin marked this up with a
black marker, so I only hope

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.870
that what I see is
what you see.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.610
So let's see, x is equal to--
she did this when she was in

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.680
sixth grade.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.400
So I'm very proud of her that
she was taking the SAT in

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.985
sixth grade.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:10.684
But anyway, x is equal
to k times k minus 2.

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:13.550
Then x plus 1 is
equal to what?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.400
[COUGH]

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
Excuse me. x plus 1
is equal to what?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.200
So let's just add 1 to both
sides of this equation.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.560
So x plus 1 is equal to k times
k minus 2 plus 1, right?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.110
I just added 1 to both sides
of that equation, and that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.330
equals k squared minus
2k plus 1.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.195
And that is choice-- if I
can read this properly--

00:02:40.195 --> 00:02:43.390
that is choice C.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.730
k squared minus 2k plus 1.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580
Problem number 4.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.240
I should have drank water before
starting this video,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.732
but I will move forward and
complete what I have begun.

00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:59.160
So they draw a graph that looks
something like that.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.370
And then there's a line that
goes something like this.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.450
And then they tell us--
what do they tell us?

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.070
They tell us, well it looks
like, it intersects at this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.270
point, at y equals 1.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.520
So this is the point,
0,1, right?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.750
x is 0, so this is the x-axis.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.590
This is the y-axis.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.420
The figure above shows the graph
of a line of y equals ax

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.040
plus b where a and
b are constants.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.400
Which of the following best
represents the graph of the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.910
line 2a x plus b?

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.500
So let's draw it.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.580
I'm not even going to look
at all the choices.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
What would this look like?

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.420
So it's going to have the
same y intercept, right?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.740
It's going to intersect
at the same point.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.630
That's the y intercept.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.960
Let me draw in this
peach color.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.530
So it's going to intersect
right here.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.650
And its slope is 2 times the
slope of the previous one.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.860
So it's going to be even
a steeper slope.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.750
So the line's going to look
something like this.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.960
It's going to be twice as
steep, so it's going

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.210
to look like this.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.230
All right?

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.060
And all I just have is that
same y intercept, right?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.500
Because the b is still d, but
they've doubled the slope, so

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.070
it's going to go
up even faster.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.130
And so, if you look at all the
choices, we can immediately

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.660
rule out all of the
choices that don't

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.720
have the same y intercept.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.110
And the only choices that have
the same y intercept are

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.140
choices B and C, right?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.060
Only those that intersect
at 0, 1.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.100
And then between B and C, B is
steeper so B is going to be

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.080
our answer, right?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.230
C is actually less steep
than this green line.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.040
Choice C looks something
like this.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.080
So its slope is less than A.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.150
So it's not going to be choice
C, so it has to be choice B.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.370
B goes through the same y
intercept and it is steeper

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.050
than our original green line.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.450
So that's the answer,
choice B.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.350
Next problem, problem 5.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.460
OK, they drew us a triangle.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.302
That's one side.

00:05:09.302 --> 00:05:10.552
That's another side.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.990
They have drawn this-- whoops.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.930
I can't-- OK, there you go.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.516
That's not as nice looking as
I would have liked, but you

00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:19.090
get the point.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.040
That's a right triangle.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.400
They say that this is x.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.940
And the figure above the
perimeter of the triangle is 4

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.400
plus 2 root 2.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.260
What is the value of x?

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.250
So what is the value
of this side?

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.000
Well Pythagorean theorem, the
value of that side is the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.010
square root of x squared
plus x squared.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.600
So that equals, what?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.450
The square root of 2x squared.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.760
You can take the x out, right?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.065
Square root of x squared
is just x.

00:05:52.065 --> 00:05:54.120
So that equals x square
root of 2.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.060
And they actually even tell
you that on the first page

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.630
of-- if you go back to page 774,
they tell you, you have a

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.850
45, 45, 90 triangle, it's
s square roots of 2.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.280
But I like to solve
it every time.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.910
So this is x, this is x, this
is x square root of 2.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.490
So what's the perimeter?

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.330
It's x plus x plus x root 2.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.080
So it's 2x plus x root 2.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.650
That's the perimeter, right?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.910
And they also tell us that,
that equals 4 plus

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.830
2 root to 2, right?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.090
That's for the perimeter.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.355
So you could just do
pattern matching.

00:06:25.355 --> 00:06:28.200
You'd say well, this looks a
lot like x is equal to 2.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.450
And it is, because if x is equal
to 2, this becomes a 2,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.070
and then this becomes
a 4, right?

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.560
So that's our answer,
x is equal to 2.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.910
And that is choice A.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.090
Next problem.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.490
Let me switch colors.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.960
OK.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.640
There's always something
for me to draw.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.760
Well before I draw it, let
me read the question.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.040
The scores on Tuesday's history
test for 16 students

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.710
are shown on the table above.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.180
Sam was the only student
absent on Tuesday.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.640
He'll take the test next week.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.070
If Sam receives a 95 on the
test, what will be the median

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.690
score for the test?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.570
OK.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.990
So they give us a score and
number of students.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.850
So I'm actually going
to write all this,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.800
score and then number.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:30.000
And so 1 kid got 100; two kids
got a 95; 90, four kids got

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.810
it; 85, 1 kid; 80, 3 kids; 75,
2 kids; 70, 2 kids; 65, no

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.250
kids; and then 60, 1 kid.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.670
And then Sam comes along and
gets a 95 on the exam, right?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.680
So before, there's only
2 kids who got a 95.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.950
Now Sam comes along and there's
going to be 3 kids who

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.640
got a 95 on the exam.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.250
So to figure out the median, all
I do is I list out all the

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.080
numbers, and then I pick
the middle number.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.600
That's all the median is.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.480
So one kid got 100.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.380
3 kids got a 95: 95, 95, 95.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:19.160
Four kids got a 90:
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.260
One kid got an 85.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.320
Three kids got an
80: 80, 80, 80.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.370
Two kids got a 75.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.860
Two kids got a 70.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.590
And one kid got a 60.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.350
So how many does that total?

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.340
I could have just added this.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.750
That's actually what
I should have done.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:42.010
But it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.760
13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.990
So there's 17 kids.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.230
So the median is going to be
the number that has eight

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.370
above it and eight below it.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:56.220
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, Bam!

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.840
That's the median, because
there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-- oh,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.810
no, no, that's not the median.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.340
Sorry, sorry, sorry, this
is the median: 85.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.130
Because there's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 above it.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.410
And there are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 below it.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.240
So the answer is 85.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.770
Before Sam came in there, then
the median actually would be--

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.650
you'd have one number
less here, so you'd

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.290
have to move it up.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.230
So it'd probably be 90,
or it'd be an average.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.410
But anyway, we know that
the median is 85.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.950
And that is choice C.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.850
See you in the next video.
