00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.500
For each of these
diagrams, I want

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.950
to think about whether
this blue line represents

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.370
an axis of symmetry.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.740
And the way we can tell is if
on both sides of the blue line

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.172
we essentially
have mirror images.

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:13.880
So let's imagine.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.010
Let's take this top part of
this polygon, the part that

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.596
is above this blue line
here, and let's reflect it

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:22.220
across the blue line--
you could almost

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.060
imagine that it's a reflection
over some type of a lake

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.590
or something-- and see if we
get exactly what we have below.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890
Then this would be
an axis of symmetry.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.770
So this point right over here,
this distance to the blue line,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.830
let's go-- the same
amount on the other side

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.965
would get you right there.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:38.840
And so you immediately
see we start ending up

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.090
with a point that is off
what's actually here in black,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.354
the actual bottom
part of the polygon.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:47.270
So this is a pretty good
clue that this is not

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.103
an axis of symmetry.

00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:51.190
But let's just continue it,
just to go through the exercise.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.790
So this point, if you reflected
it across this blue line,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.240
would get you here.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.600
This point-- I'll do it
in a different color.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.010
This point, if you
were to reflect it

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.440
across this blue
line, it would get

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.940
you-- let me make sure I can
do that relatively straight.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.210
I can do a straighter
job than that.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.690
So if you go about
that distance about it,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.430
and I want to go straight
down into the blue line,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.390
and I'm going to go the same
distance on the other side,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.640
it gets me to
right around there.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.900
And then this point
over here, if I

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.880
were to drop it
straight down, then

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270
if I were to go the same
distance on the other side,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.310
it gets me right around there.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.550
And then finally, this point
gets me right around there.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.260
So its mirror image
of this top part

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.650
would look something like this.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.710
My best attempt to draw
it would look something

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.780
like this, which is very
different than the part

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
of the polygon that's
actually on the other side

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.110
of this blue line.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.180
So in this case, the blue line
is not an axis of symmetry.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.822
So this is no.

00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.210
No, this blue line is
not an axis of symmetry.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.920
Now let's look at it over here.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.110
And our eyes pick this
out very naturally.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.700
Here you can see that it looks
like this blue line really

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.330
divides this polygon in half.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.340
It really does look
like mirror images.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.200
It really does look
like, if you imagine

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.430
that this is some type
of a lake, a still lake,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.900
so I shouldn't
actually draw waves,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.540
but this is some type of a lake,
that this is the reflection.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.760
And we can even go
point by point here.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.430
So this point right over
here is the same distance

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.270
from, if we dropped a
perpendicular to this point

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.720
as this one right over
here; this one over here,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.770
same distance, same distance
as this point right over here;

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.940
and we could do that
for all of the points.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.110
So in this case,
the blue line does

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.475
represent an axis of symmetry.
