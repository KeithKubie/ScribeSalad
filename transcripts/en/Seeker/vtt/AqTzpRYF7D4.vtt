00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.420
I don’t know about you, but when I’m washing
my face I prefer to use some exfoliating scrub.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.770
You know the kind with little beads to make
your face feel squeaky clean.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.340
But those beads go somewhere after they’re
washed down the drain.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.790
And it’s not good!!

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.820
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.090
Microbeads feel great.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.369
I mean my face just feels like a million bucks
after I give it a good scrub.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.910
Those tiny plastic beads are found in other
products like soap and even toothpaste.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.160
But those beads wind up in the environment
after we’re done with them and could do

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.890
some serious damage.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.820
And while a lot of plastic in the ocean comes
from food products like plastic wrap and bottle

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.960
caps, a lot of it is from these small microbeads.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.830
A recent study published in the journal Marine
Pollution Bulletin found if millions of these

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.371
beads get released into the water, the researchers
estimate this could result in up to 80 tonnes

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:47.670
of unnecessary microplastic waste.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.280
Because they’re small and buoyant, they
easily pass through sewage treatment plants.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.590
Basically that’s eight trillion microbeads
entering oceans and lakes every day.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.231
According to a study published in the journal
Environmental Science &amp; Technology.

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:02.530
And that’s just the beads that make it past
the filters at the treatment plants.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.890
Those that don’t make it through wind up
packed in with sludge.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.250
The very nasty mix of waste that’s filtered
out of waste water.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.479
It’s often used as…

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.479
I hope you aren’t eating.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.840
But it’s often used as fertilizer.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840
So it’s spread across fields.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.020
And nearly 800 trillion of those tiny beads
are all trapped in it.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.000
And from there some of the microbeads get
caught up in run off and well..

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.259
And usually they wind up in someone’s stomach.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.640
And that’s bad news.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
A study published in the journal Global Change
Biology found that half of the ocean’s turtles

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.409
ingest plastic.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.619
Another study published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences found

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.580
that 90% of seabirds have plastic in their
stomachs, up from just 10% 30 years ago.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.369
Some researchers think that fish might mistake
the beads for food, eat them, then mistakenly

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.590
think they’re full.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.549
Not to mention that plastic can poison the
animals or lead to blockages in their intestines,

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.200
both potentially deadly!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.631
And the microbeads and other microplastics
can make things even worse, despite their

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:58.810
size they can concentrate toxic chemicals
already present in seawater.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.509
Basically they act like little sponges that
soak up toxins which can accumulate in sea

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.340
life and maybe be passed on to people.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.369
It’s not just microbeads, they’re only
a piece of a much larger problem.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.760
Researchers say there are 360,000 pieces of
plastic for every square mile in most of the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.980
world's oceans.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.090
Another study published in the journal Science
found that as many as 12.7 million metric

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.110
tons of plastic find their way into the ocean
every year.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.150
The most striking result of all this plastic
pollution are giant trash gyres circling on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.200
the surface of oceans.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.720
And when I say giant I mean GIANT.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.760
The most infamous of which is the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.880
It’s estimated to be twice the size of Texas
or some estimates say it’s even the size

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.230
of the US.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.830
Plastic doesn’t biodegrade, instead, things
like microbeads or plastic bottles simply

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.390
break into smaller and smaller pieces.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.180
Most of the Pacific Garbage Patch is made
up of tiny pieces of plastic, so you could

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.040
be standing on a boat and it looks nothing
like a landfill.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.150
Instead, these tiny pieces float right below
the surface, making the water muddy and unclear.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.870
And all this microscopic plastic is doing
some real damage to the inhabitants of those

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.870
waters.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.870
So what do we do?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.970
Well already there’s legislation proposed
the “Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015”

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.519
was introduced to the house earlier this year.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.470
The aim of the bill is to ban cosmetics that
contain synthetic plastic microbeads beginning

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.830
on January 1, 2018.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.349
And even if the legislation doesn’t go through,
some companies have agreed to replace them

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.430
with more natural products.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.540
But even if we could ban microbeads, it still
leaves a lot of plastic floating around.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.620
So researchers recommend “industrialized
countries can take immediate action by reducing

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.940
waste and curbing the growth of single-use
plastic."

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.090
Basically, you know the drill, reduce, reuse
and recycle.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.830
And stop using those face scrubs.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.579
Also if you think biodegradable plastic might
be the answer to our problems, think again

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:59.800
- here’s a video from Trace explaining more.
