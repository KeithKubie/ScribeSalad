00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.970
RETO MEIER: Today we find
out how it feels to be

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.260
the eye in the sky.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: We learn
to stop worrying and

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.770
love the Weather Bomb.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.660
RETO MEIER: And we find out why
this week, neither one of

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.170
us are wearing pants.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.080
All in the next half hour on--

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.670
BOTH: The App Clinic.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.980
RETO MEIER: Today we're looking
at weather apps

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.560
Weather Bomb, Eye in the Sky,
and Should I Wear Pants?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: And then we're
going to dig a little deeper

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.700
into how Weather Bomb renders
its awesome map.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.920
RETO MEIER: So let's
have a look at

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.070
weather apps in general.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.740
What are the things it
really needs in order

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.760
to be a good app?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well obviously,
it needs to tell me today's

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.530
weather, right?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.520
RETO MEIER: That seems like
a pretty good start.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because obviously,
I don't want to get

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.220
out of bed or open the window.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.800
RETO MEIER: Precisely.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.160
That would be too much
to ask, right?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.680
RETO MEIER: You want to be able
to know this stuff before

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.790
you get out of bed.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.000
It would also be nice to know
tomorrow's weather.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: And the seven
day forecast, I

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.730
would go for that.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.035
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.760
All the things which mean that
you no longer are a slave to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.250
the 11 o'clock news.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.040
RETO MEIER: You also want
to have results that are

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.900
localized, right?

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.970
Something which knows where
you are to give you the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.420
weather forecast for the city
that you're in, rather than

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.885
the general state.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:10.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true, but
I don't necessarily want it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.790
too local, because really, what
I want to know is how

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.640
cold or windy is it going to
be at the beach this time.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.340
RETO MEIER: That's true.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.440
Which means you really
want to be able to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.635
have multiple locations.

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Can you tell we're
in northern California?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.143
Because I didn't say how hot
and sunny is it going

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:25.120
to be at the beach.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.620
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.290
And that's the thing where we
are here in sunny sometimes

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.750
northern California, it's an
area of extreme microclimates.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.700
So localization of the weather
is really important, and the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.670
ability to know which direction
you need to drive

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.300
for it to get less foggy is
kind of a killer feature.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.500
RETO MEIER: We're going to take

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.780
things up a little further.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.740
What we really like to see is a
lot of the stuff that you're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.290
used to seeing at the
11 o'clock news.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.150
Things like rich maps with sort
of more meteorological

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.403
information, like topography
charts, satellites, those

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:55.660
sorts of things.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: And also I want to
see maps when I'm choosing

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.030
my location.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.240
RETO MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.630
That way you don't have to know
what city the beach is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.930
in, you just point at
the each, job done.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.949
Anytime I can get away from
putting in text to my mobile

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.770
phone, excellent.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.760
But I don't just want that,
because I'm super lazy, I also

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.330
want widgets.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.070
I want to be able to see the
weather immediately when I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.825
unlock my phone.

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.910
RETO MEIER: In fact, I want to
go a step further and say,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.170
maybe there's a case here for
some rich notifications,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.520
something which has a little sun
or cloud or whatever else,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.070
and there's a really good
example of where you might

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.270
want to use a low priority
notification.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.300
So it doesn't pop up, it doesn't
ping me, but when I

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.400
pull down the slide, I've got
that extra information hand.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Although I didn't
mind knowing what the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.060
temperature is at all times
in my notification bar.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.170
I thought that was kind
of a cool feature.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.860
But of course, none of this is
going to be any good if your

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.650
battery runs down all the time,
and so we're going to go

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.490
ahead and beat this dead
horse one more time--

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.200
all of these things depend on
efficient background updates

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.380
that are done in a way that
won't drain your battery.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.270
RETO MEIER: This is actually
another really good tip here,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.620
is that if you do want to do
your updates, say that you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.250
know that the new weather
forecast comes in once a day,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670
so you want to wake up the phone
at 2:00 AM every morning

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.250
to get that new fresh weather
forecast each day, make sure

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.840
that you're not doing that
at an exact time.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.540
Because what you'll find is that
if everyone else is doing

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.710
the right thing and saying, look
we're not going to start

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.720
anything unless someone turns
on the phone to do this

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.240
update, you know you have to do
it then, suddenly you turn

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.390
on not just one user's device,
but everyone who has your app

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.210
installed at the same time, and
then floods the bandwidth

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.930
with everyone else's
updates as well.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.850
So you want to make sure you're
making that this fuzzy

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.840
is possible.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.760
2:00 AM-ish, plus or minus an
hour, so that you give your

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.880
servers a chance to not get
flooded, as well as the mobile

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.010
phone operator's bandwidth.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.235
IAN NI-LEWIS: If only there
were an API that

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:48.580
would do that for me.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.100
RETO MEIER: Indeed.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.750
Something like an inexact
repeating alarm, perhaps.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.530
I'll have to keep
that in mind.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.120
So let's go ahead and take
a look at our apps.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.970
RETO MEIER: Indeed.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.220
So you can see the icons
at the bottom.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.400
We are going to start
with Weather Bomb.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Bomb-diddy-bomb-
di-bomb-bomb-diddy--

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.480
OK, sorry.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.320
RETO MEIER: So you can see here,
the feature page here,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.530
it is a riot of color.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.740
Which is aptly depicted in their
app icon, which is in

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.089
fact a four color logo of
raindrops, I suppose.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.519
Slightly concerning, the concept
of there being four

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.190
colored raindrops.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.650
But nonetheless, it is
consistent with their overall

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.510
UI or branding, I suppose, which
I guess is multi-color.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.670
I guess that's kind of their
killer feature, is the fact

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.040
that they've got these multiple
overlays over the top

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.540
of their map views, which show
all these rich colors.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.850
RETO MEIER: That said, the
actual feature graphic itself,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.050
again, is falling into that trap
of looking a little bit

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.540
amateurish.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.990
This is not an amateur app.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.810
This has been really well put
together, but look here and it

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.540
just feels a little bit
like the bits are

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.650
pulled together, and--

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it hasn't
gotten within a few miles of a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.490
professional graphic
artist, I think.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.090
At least not the layout--

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.590
each little bit looks
really nice.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.010
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.710
So it's the composition here
that I think could

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.960
use a lot of work.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.860
You want to avoid things like
italicized serifed fonts

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.140
within the feature graphic.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.340
Because again, as things get
smaller and smaller, they're

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.330
going to be harder to read.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.630
In fact, even from just a few
feet away, I'm getting the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.100
impression that I may need to
either clean my glasses, or

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.410
update my prescription, because
I can barely read

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.810
insightful weather there.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is something
that a lot of people

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.200
get wrong, and don't even
realize until you see it on a

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.440
small device.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.540
If your logo, the app name and
your logo is not at least

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.930
twice as big as Weather Bomb
has, you're not going to be

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.270
visible on a lot of devices, and
you're not going to sell.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.110
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.760
And you want to avoid
duplicating things.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.545
There's always a question of
whether you put the apps title

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:48.270
and catch line in the
feature graphic.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.940
There is certainly an argument
for that, but in this case,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.980
it's not really adding anything
to the aesthetic.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.270
Similarly, you want to put the
app icon into feature graphic.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.530
You've already got the
multicolored raindrops, which

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.070
is that branding effect, but
you want to avoid actually

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.160
duplicating content.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.790
Because as you can see here,
you're just sort of seeing the

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.200
same thing repeated over and
over again It just feels like

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.740
things were cut and pasted.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Also, I wouldn't
mind a slightly different

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.210
treatment on the icon itself.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.990
RETO MEIER: The rounded
corners.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: It looks
a little familiar.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.260
Not just the rounded corners
but that little swatch of

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.300
color, like a reflection
across the top.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.580
RETO MEIER: That's
a good point.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: I've seen
that before and

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.040
it wasn't on Android.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.290
RETO MEIER: It's an interesting
opportunity here,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.870
because again, what we're
looking for is a unique

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.370
silhouette, something
which really stands

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.770
out and looks great.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.780
So some sort of treatment here
that just removes the box as a

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.240
first step, and just has the
four raindrops would be an

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.670
interesting place to start.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.970
RETO MEIER: So let's move on.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.540
Let's have a look at
the app itself.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.470
So we're going to bring
up the giant phone.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Giant phone?

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.600
Giant phone?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.740
There we go.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.400
All right, let's pull
the app up.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.530
There's a EULA at the
beginning, which is

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.990
unsurprising.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.960
And then there is a page of text
which took me quite some

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.480
time to get past it
and understand.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.320
Not just to read it, but to
actually figure out how to

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.910
dismiss it.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.120
RETO MEIER: It's like you're
looking here, and it's like,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.670
OK, so this is the wizard,
where's the OK button?

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.300
How do I--

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're going to do
a huge favor for all of our

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.270
viewers and show you how to get
to the second page of this

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.210
Weather Bomb app.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.950
And that is hit the refresh
button which shouldn't be

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.030
there anyway,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.640
RETO MEIER: It's an interesting

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.410
implementation here.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.900
They actually had a countdown
built into the refresh button,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.060
which is interesting.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.160
But really, we're trying to get
to a point now, with app

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.770
design, where we can sort of
banish the refresh button.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.570
A lot of users are still going
to want it there, particularly

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.850
for things like weather or
email, where they're like,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.470
seriously, I want to have
up to the second.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.530
But that's a good thing to put
in something like an overflow

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.250
menu, so that it is there for
people who want it, but

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.050
ideally, no one does.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.320
Everything just refreshes and
does everything for you.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.160
In an app like this, there is
that EULA at the beginning,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.910
which is going to take some time
to someone at least look

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.890
at and dismiss if not
read through.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.710
That's a great time to
do that pre-cacheing.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.220
It only took a few seconds
to bring that first page

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.570
information.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.980
When someone downloads and opens
your app for the first

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.750
time, they hit the icon, bypass
the EULA, and this is

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.050
the first thing that they see,
this is pretty compelling.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: It really is.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.130
RETO MEIER: Compared to a page
full of text with a big bright

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.070
red on black text right
at the start.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.370
It's something you want to get
to awesomeness of your app as

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.409
quickly as possible.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.580
And this looks awesome.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.390
The previous page looked, again,
a little amateurish.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't know if
the author of this app is

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.420
running analytics, but it would
be fascinating to see

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.860
just how much abandonment
there is--

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.160
RETO MEIER: Yeah, what
is the drop of?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know I probably
wouldn't have gone

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.500
through with it if it wasn't
my job to do so.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.450
Which is not a ringing
endorsement.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.630
The app itself did reward my
patience richly though.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.220
RETO MEIER: Yeah, and this
looks really nice.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.760
We were talking about
the nice to have.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.020
I mean they've got a map here
at the start, and it seems

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.740
that if I drag left to right,
it's going to go through the

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.430
time and show this real time
map of satellite--

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.880
I guess it's rainfall
coverage.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.540
That would make more sense.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think you can
actually pick some different--

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.970
RETO MEIER: Oh, nice.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: There was
rain, we've got wind--

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.870
which is always nice to
know in this area.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.810
RETO MEIER: A little
surprising.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.250
Now, the only thing that bugged
me about this map,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.380
actually, was that I had to
pinch to zoom on a reasonably

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.400
small area.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.040
In this case, where I know
exactly where I want to zoom

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.090
to, I really prefer the double
tap to zoom, and it doesn't

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.190
support that.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.370
I wasn't sure why.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.630
RETO MEIER: I wonder if this
is the Android map library

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.350
that they've used here, or if
they've got something custom

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.725
that they've built themselves.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, we'll
see later that it is not the

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.430
Android map library.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.610
RETO MEIER: You've done
some investigation.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.060
Excellent.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.200
Well, we'll look into that.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.050
But certainly the

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.320
functionality here is fantastic.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.000
It is a very busy screen,
which is worth noting.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.490
And in fact, the killer feature
here is really this

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.690
map, which is front
and center.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.220
But once you have the notes on
the bottom and the various

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.880
stuff on top, we've got
a lot of content.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think you
can dismiss the note.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.070
But yeah, I agree completely
that you've got some real

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.750
problems crowding the screen.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.200
And some of these things are
sort of nice to have.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.790
Like maybe you really do want us
to have the graph, but the

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.800
graph up here is really
redundant with the time map.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.740
So it seems like you could
have one or the other

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.000
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.650
Or at least--

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Just give you an
option to view it or not.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.130
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.300
Some way to swipe to dismiss,
or to collapse, or something

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.330
like that, so that you can
really enjoy this really

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:57.050
engaging interaction model.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: I was happy that
it's very easy to drop down

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.900
and pick locations, but it's
relatively difficult to add

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.660
new locations.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.480
I was really hoping that I could
just do something with

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.200
this map to add a location
instead.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.500
It was a little harder.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.380
I've got to go to this other
page, then I've got to hit

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.490
plus, and then I've got
to do a lat long.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.470
Now I think if I--

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.580
no, I don't know how
to get to a map.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.680
RETO MEIER: I don't
think you can.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.160
I think you can search
for places, but you

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.080
can pick off a map.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.780
And that would be a really
interesting view to just allow

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.370
you to just go straight
off the map.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Any time you have
a lat long, you should be

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.570
able to do a map.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.880
It it's like having a date,
you want to also have a

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.290
calendar picker, I think.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.440
RETO MEIER: So this is
interesting as well.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.700
You'll note that every time--
now that we've added a new

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.650
location we get that same
start up screen again.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.630
So again, really here, we
don't need the extra

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.330
instruction, you should really
be a initiating that sync as

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.810
soon as I add the new place in
the expectation that I'm going

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.240
to switch to it at some point.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.620
Otherwise, it's a really
nicely polished app.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.855
Again, you may be underplaying
some of the data.

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:04.530
It's really a question here of
what do you want to emphasize?

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.070
What is the main thing
you want users to

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.970
take away from here?

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.020
Because we have the temperature,
but it's in a

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.260
light gray, and it's absolutely
tiny at the top

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.050
left here, which is arguably
one of the more important

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.000
things you're going to want
to share with users.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.190
So again, just take that
into consideration.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.720
What are people going to want?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.730
What are they going
to want to do?

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.040
And make it as easy
as possible.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now of course,
Weather Bomb is still in beta,

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.890
and the author has mentioned
that he's got a lot of plans

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.130
to add certain things.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.760
So I think that--

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.600
why don't we just ignore some
of the basic layout issues,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.520
and focus on the fact that the
map is a really cool feature.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:38.960
RETO MEIER: Definitely.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're going to
talk about it a little bit

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.650
later, cover it in
more detail.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.000
For now, why don't we go ahead
and move on to Eye in the Sky?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.720
RETO MEIER: OK, let's do that.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.590
So yeah, nicely done.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.010
Great to hear that
it's in beta.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.750
Definitely a promising app.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.555
Let's have a look at
Eye in the Sky.

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:58.420
So this is Eye In Sky
feature page.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.610
This is actually quite good.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's not bad.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.190
RETO MEIER: It's got a
distinctive logo, it's kind of

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.150
an eye-type look.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.160
It would be kind of creepy if it
was a real eye, so I think

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.860
I like the fact that
it's stylized.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.820
And it's in the sky!

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.570
Which is nice.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.590
RETO MEIER: Almost want to
question whether you want to

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.020
call it Eye In Sky or
Eye in the Sky.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.105
IAN NI-LEWIS: I've been
calling it Eye in

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:20.970
the Sky all day long.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.175
RETO MEIER: As have I, which
seems like a small thing--

00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:23.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I've been
singing that Alan Parsons

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.770
Project song, which nobody
but me remembers.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.725
RETO MEIER: That's because
you are old.

00:13:27.725 --> 00:13:28.840
Old, old, old.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Apparently so.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.180
RETO MEIER: So the danger in
having a name which is similar

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.440
to something which people are
familiar with, but actually

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.320
not the same, is that people are
going to search for using

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.550
the name that they
think it is.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.020
So a lot of people are going to
be like, oh Eye in the Sky,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.445
great, search for it, and that
may not be the top result.

00:13:44.445 --> 00:13:46.130
It may be confused with
something else.

popular, then your results

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.810
will bubble up, and all of a
sudden people searching for

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.810
Eye in the Sky will get
to your app instead.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.680
But that actually takes quite
a long time and a lot of

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.440
popularity.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.270
So I wouldn't count on it.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.930
RETO MEIER: Yeah, so you want
to make sure that people are

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.260
going to get what they're
looking for.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.900
And I can see that you've
actually changed the name to

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.490
Eye In Sky Weather, which again,
is going to be helpful

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.860
for people searching
for weather.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.510
You want to be careful with
over-optimizing your titles

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.370
and those sorts of things, but
at the very least, you want to

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.340
make sure that you can take
advantage of that word of

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.210
mouth type discovery.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: By the way, real
quick point on the search

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.990
algorithm, a lot of people
complain during the first

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.940
three or four days their app
is available that typing in

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.610
the app's exact name won't
actually bring that app into

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.050
the first search results,
sometimes not

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.160
even in the top ten.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.710
And this is exactly why, because
we do try to alter the

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.970
user's search phrase, or search
on phrases that have

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.160
resulted in successful
searches in the past.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.530
So there's a really, really
fancy algorithm going on,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.640
based on what we think is going
to please the user the

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.630
most, and it takes a little
while to adjust.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.870
RETO MEIER: So I think the last
comment we want to make

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.020
here again, and you'll see a
lot of these sort of the

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.890
themes recurring as we go
through a lot of these apps,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.680
but again, we've kind of got
this squared off square icon.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.410
Which all it does is bound this
really distinctive and

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:14.380
interesting silhouette.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.700
So again, I think you can get
a lot further in terms of

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.970
creating that really great app
icon by just removing that

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.320
background.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.075
So let's switch to the giant
phone and I have a look at Eye

00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:29.244
In the-- see, I've even written
Eye in the Sky.

00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:32.190
I apologize for mislabeling
here.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.280
Again, we've got the
release notes.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.680
Now this is kind of a
pet peeve of mine.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.180
I don't want to have to dismiss
things, particularly

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.740
because it's release notes here,
strongly suggested if I

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.420
get an update at some point
after I've got this installed,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.450
this is going to come
up again and again.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.960
For most users, you can display
this information on

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.220
Google Play, otherwise
users don't care.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.460
They assume that you're
going to fix bugs and

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.280
those sorts of things.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.386
If they're really interested to
see the specific bug that's

00:15:56.386 --> 00:15:58.840
been fixed, they can do that
on the Google Play listing.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.920
Within the app itself, you want
to make sure they can get

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.210
from hitting the button to
using the app with as few

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.160
steps as possible.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: See, I'm not
with you on that, Reto.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.480
I actually have a different
opinion.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.920
One of my favorite apps, gReader
pro, updates maybe

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.250
once a month, and I really enjoy
having their release

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.436
notes pop up.

00:16:16.436 --> 00:16:20.040
I have my Google Play set to
auto update, so I never

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.970
realize when something's
getting updated.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.380
Of course I don't want to be
bothered for minor bug fixes,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.950
but a lot of times they'll put
in a really cool new feature,

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.600
and I wouldn't know whether
to try that feature.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.030
I wouldn't know how to try
to that feature if they

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.436
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:31.436 --> 00:16:33.800
RETO MEIER: Perhas that's the
key, is that compromise of

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.880
making sure that you only
display it if there are

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.860
significant fixes or significant
new features that

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.980
people may want to take
advantage of.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.970
And certainly displaying it the
first time you launch the

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.590
app seems a little odd.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.500
Lazy, maybe.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.730
RETO MEIER: You've had to
install it at some point from

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.340
somewhere, so likely it
is you know what the

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.770
app currently does.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.770
App itself looks really nice.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.610
I really quite like the
minimalist approach here.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.360
They've got a nice view pager
implementation for being able

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.380
to switch between the current
temperature, 48 hour detailed

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.710
view, and long range forecast,
which is nice.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.530
Again, you can have multiple
locations.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.660
Again here, there's no obvious
way to add locations.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.710
I'm looking for a plus
button here.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:19.900
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.579
IAN NI-LEWIS: Or you know what
I would also accept is a

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.950
magnifying glass here.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:29.740
Because that tells me whatever
is in the area up here at the

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.850
top of the screen is
probably what that

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.330
search is going to do.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.710
RETO MEIER: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think this
places icon will

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.712
actually take you--

00:17:38.712 --> 00:17:39.860
RETO MEIER: It does the same
thing, and it takes us to

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.210
basically what we
were expecting.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.370
So the ability to add manually,
or-- and I'm

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.500
guessing this is going to
take you to your map.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.630
Now we don't have the correct
version of Google Play

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.750
services installed here, because
it's a specially Flash

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.380
device, but nonetheless, it will
take you to the map and

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.420
give you exactly what
you were hoping for.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, so, a few
more button presses than I

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.950
would have hoped, and also a
little bit more tricky than I

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.570
would have hoped.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.650
I saw that plus button and
instinctively pressed it, and

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.370
then was disappointed that
there was no map.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.120
But then I saw the map button,
and oh, that's how you do it

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:10.920
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Could be a
little more intuitive.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.300
RETO MEIER: Otherwise, it's
really nice and simple.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.600
I think that's the main
takeaway here.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.070
It's immediately obvious, all
of the key information is

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.130
right there on the page when
you first start up the app,

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.180
and everything else is
just a swipe away.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.300
There's no refresh on the main
screen, but it is hidden away

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.940
here in the overflow menu if you
desperately want to know

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.730
whether the weather has changed
significantly in the

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.680
last 30 seconds.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now one of things
that this app really

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.570
wins at is widgets.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.110
They have several different
widgets.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.530
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I really
enjoyed their

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.450
widget setup process.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:49.330
I have a couple beefs with it,
but in general, I think that

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.360
they've provided the widgets
that I wanted--

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.760
let's just scroll
over to that.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.376
RETO MEIER: They've
got the preview.

00:18:56.376 --> 00:18:59.260
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ah, yes.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:05.520
And when I place it, I get
this widget configuration

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.280
which shows me the widget
against my wallpaper, so

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.120
exactly how it's going
to appear.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.850
And that's great, because on my
personal phone, I've got a

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.420
photo of my family, and it can
be really difficult to get a

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.320
wallpaper that looks good
and widgets that

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.900
look good with that.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.950
Now one thing I love about this
is that I can set the

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.760
transparency on the widget.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.823
And then see a preview of it.

00:19:30.823 --> 00:19:31.440
RETO MEIER: That's very tidy.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: And my only
quibble is I would love for

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.730
that to not be a dialogue so
that I could see the preview

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.390
at the same time that I'm
picking the transparency,

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.670
instead of right after.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.730
Minor point, it would make
a big difference.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.640
RETO MEIER: It's a quibble, but
it would definitely make a

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.190
big difference.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.770
That's a really nice feature.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: And one more,
except I don't know how to get

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.450
back to their widget
configuration.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.180
RETO MEIER: It's generally
not an easy thing to do.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.620
I think you'll find
you probably have

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.370
to add a new one.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.260
[INAUDIBLE] per widget.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: I will simply
mention that they also have I

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.720
think nine or 10 different skins
that you can put on the

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.040
widget, going from their sort
of minimalist look here, all

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.370
the way up to photo realistic
clouds and sunshine.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.780
In fact, not just sunshine, but
an actual from space photo

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.350
of the sun, which looks a
little bit frightening.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.100
RETO MEIER: That's
kind of nice.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.480
And they've even got the rich
notifications here as well,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.330
which do in fact show you the
current temperature up on the

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:33.935
status bar.

00:20:33.935 --> 00:20:35.255
It's probably a little bit too
small to see, but it's there.

00:20:35.255 --> 00:20:36.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: It is.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.490
You can adjust what it shows,
but I love having the

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.180
temperature there because it
makes me feel like I'm in my

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.920
luxury automobile.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.150
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.690
So we should move on.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.610
We've spent a lot of time on the
first app already, so we

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.940
are running out of time, but
we'll just make a quick note

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.990
of the fact that they have this
ability to upgrade to pro

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.150
to remove ads and support
development on the bottom.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.870
It's actually quite
a nice treatment.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.610
It follows with the general
design aesthetic here, so it

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.030
doesn't feel too aggressive.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.360
And if we follow that through,
goes to Google Play to allow

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.090
to buy a key.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.000
So they've used a key
approach here.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.830
One alternative, which might be
a little bit less intrusive

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.920
for users, is to use in-app
billing to do an

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.540
upgrade that way.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: I really prefer
that, and I'll tell why,

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.800
because the in-app billing will

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.070
follow the user's account.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.010
You don't have to
have two apps.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.730
The one thing that's nice about
having a pro version and

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.090
a free version is that the free
version can ask for the

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.680
permissions necessary for ad
networks, and you don't have

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.990
to add that to the
pro version.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.440
But I feel like the key
policy here is the

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.830
worst of both worlds.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.370
The original app has to ask
for all of the permissions

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:48.870
that the free version needs,
and yet it isn't as easy to

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.330
purchase as in-app purchase
would be.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.840
RETO MEIER: So that may be
something worth looking at.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.240
We have in-app billing version
three now available, which

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.090
makes a lot simpler than
previous versions.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.480
So it's definitely something
you want to investigate to

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.600
help your monetization
efforts.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.510
The last app we want to look
at, we want to give Ian a

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.900
chance to give us some
more deep dive

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.120
information on that map view.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.740
But before we do, possibly one
of my favorite apps from

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.340
today, Should I Wear
Pants Today?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: See, and I looked
at this and I thought,

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.300
wow, this has to be
a British app.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.330
And then I remember that no,
in Britain pants mean

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.270
something different.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.290
But what are Australia?

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.240
RETO MEIER: That would be
a very different app.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know
you call football

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.680
soccer and soccer football.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.260
RETO MEIER: No, we use
the American pants.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: You say soccer?

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:29.950
RETO MEIER: Yeah, well--

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: So pants and
soccer are same in Australia

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.735
as they are in America.

00:22:33.735 --> 00:22:34.480
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.230
It's like in both countries--

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.160
well in all countries, it's
inappropriate to play soccer

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.260
in just your pants,
but nonetheless.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.390
We have a look at the feature
graphic, it's

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.340
actually pretty nice.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.950
I'm not sure that it quite
works as an icon.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.850
It gets a little bit
too crowded.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.590
You want to take that same idea
and perhaps stylize it a

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.910
little, so that you've got a
pair of pants, or trousers as

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.360
they like to say in the UK,
with a question mark.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.920
But actually having that photo
realistic image of the cutoff

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.870
cargos doesn't work quite so
well when get down to it.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: Photo realism
doesn't really work on icons.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.370
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.600
It works great on the feature
graphic, but maybe you want to

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.570
reconsider.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Adobe Illustrator
can vectorize that

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.860
for you in a heartbeat.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.810
RETO MEIER: Boom, very nice.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.110
I do like the fact that they
haven't stuck it on a square

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.020
rounded background.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thank
god for that.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.945
RETO MEIER: Thank
you for that.

00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.480
Let's switch to the
giant phone and

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.410
we'll fire up the app.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.750
And again, they've actually
got a really nice, really

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.640
straightforward UI, which just
looks up what the current

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.920
temperature is, and suggests
what you should wear.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it looks like
today, Reto, you will be

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.280
wearing a blouse and a
pair of hot pants.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.810
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.230
So a Friday?

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yep.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.560
RETO MEIER: You're able to
scroll through here and see

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.790
what you want to wear
today, tomorrow.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.380
Now we are in northern
California, so it is basically

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.425
going to be the exact same
thing between now and I'm

00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:59.620
going to say April
of next year?

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.066
It's hard to say.

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.450
But it's actually really nice.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.030
It still does give you the
temperature in your current

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.160
location at the bottom so that
you can confirm whether or not

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.380
this is stuff that you want.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it
does have the very

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.150
important flip-flop report.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:12.890
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Can you wear
flip-flops today?

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.320
Did it rain last night?

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.980
RETO MEIER: This is what
people are asking.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.610
Now most of the magic actually
happens within the

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.180
preferences.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.360
Now the good news here is that
it does default to things

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.530
which are reasonably sensible.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.950
So you start up the app straight
away, and you get

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.480
what it does.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.190
You either find it amusing and
kind of cool, or you're like,

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.396
yeah, maybe not.

00:24:32.396 --> 00:24:34.440
But here you get to go through
and really add all of this

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.260
customization.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.720
So you can basically set at what
temperature your cut off

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.050
is to be able to wear
cut-offs, and

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:42.910
so on and so forth.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.310
You can select your gender,
you can select your

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.820
temperature units, you can
choose to add a little bit of

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.230
swagger to your look--

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.820
sunglasses at night, if
that's your thing--

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.530
and all of this sort
of stuff and this

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.277
goes through to modify--

00:24:56.277 --> 00:24:58.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's really '80s
pop song day today, isn't it?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.570
RETO MEIER: It kind of is.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.610
We're showing our age,
but nonetheless.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.460
So we really like this, I think
this is really clever.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.290
This is one of those apps which
I think of as being a

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.420
little bit magic, in that it
does something which brings a

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.150
smile to your face.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.750
It elicits that response
where you're like, OK,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.350
that's kind of cool.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: And really my
only quibble is that the

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.060
overall skin is so dark that
I thought it was disabled.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.670
And then I realized it's not
disable, it just apparently

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.590
was drawn by the same guy that
does The Series of Unfortunate

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.330
Events books.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.530
RETO MEIER: So yeah, you may
want to bump up your contrast

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.770
just a little, add a little bit
more color, just so you

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:31.710
can see what's going on.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.220
But these are real nitpicks.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.350
This is a really clever little
app that's really imaginative.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.770
So nicely done.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: It could
be a widget.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.605
RETO MEIER: It could be
a widget, that's true.

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:42.540
It would actually be
really good widget.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.520
I like that.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.890
So with that in mind, we've
got a few minutes left.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.610
Ian has some tips for drawing
things in GL.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, well, I was
intrigued by it Weather

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.010
Bomb's map, and I thought wow,
not only is it pretty, but

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.510
it's also kind of fast.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.260
And so I decided to look
into it a little

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.020
more with GL Traceview.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.300
And I found some interesting
things.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.360
I know we don't have a ton of
time, but I'm just going to

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.485
look a little bit over what
Weather Bomb does.

00:26:11.485 --> 00:26:17.290
Of course, this is Reto's
time to move.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.170
There.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.280
OK, there all right.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.180
We try and we try.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.660
Now, when you open up GL
Traceview on this app, the

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:34.130
first thing you're going to see
is this frame over here

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.210
that's actually everything
but the map.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:41.750
And the reason is that the frame
is being drawn in a GL

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.730
surface view.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.430
The way this works is there is a
windowing system in Android,

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.430
just like there is in any other
modern operating system.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.180
You don't really use it very
often because everything's

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.550
done with activities.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:27:00.630
But in this case, what we have
is a view here that's going to

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.920
actually get a hole
punched it.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.370
In other words, part of it's
going to be transparent and

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.320
there's going to be a window
underneath it, which is

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.350
actually showing the map.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.960
Now this area here is being
drawn in a second context.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.080
It's important to set your
context right up here.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.540
There we go, a little
button there.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.240
And so that's context one,
and let's see how

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.820
the draw the map.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.440
So the first draw call just
draws the map, and you see

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.520
it's about six triangles.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.800
I don't even know why it's
six, it could be two.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:41.610
Next thing that's going to get
drawn is the actual overlay.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.800
This is what made
me intrigued.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.080
Because if you look at some
of these, you can see that

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.690
there's some interesting
artifacts that are basically

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.050
coming out of the process
of coloring this.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.490
And if you've worked much with
GL, you probably know exactly

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.280
what's going on already.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:03.150
What's going on is the author
has overlaid a fine mesh over

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.290
the top of this texture that
contains the map, and then

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.700
used vertex coloring on each
piece of that mesh.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:18.450
Each vertex is actually using
a look up to find-- now,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.530
vertex coloring actually
is slightly wrong.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.660
We're doing a per vertex text
chord into this essentially

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.410
one-dimensional texture that
takes us all away from the

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.600
deep purple up to
the bright red.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.130
And that's our color code for
whatever it is we're looking

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.380
at, in this case, rainfall.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:44.300
So that's going to be the next
step, is drawing that overlay.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.980
Immediately, this sort of set
off alarm bells my head,

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.220
because I thought, well, you've
just overwritten a huge

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.750
number of pixels.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.340
Because all of this area--

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.220
and this is especially important
when you're looking

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.700
at some of the other rainfalls
in areas of the world where it

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.530
rains more-- all of these areas
are actually not being

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:04.350
blended at all.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.810
They're simply replacing
pixels that were there.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.665
But that's not a huge deal.

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:14.150
And in fact, it's not anywhere
close to being the most

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:18.200
expensive thing that
this view does.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.200
But if you want to save a few
cycles on your GPU, you may

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.660
want to remember draw
front to back.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.270
Now you'll have one objection
if you're the

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.205
author of this program.

00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:32.380
You'll probably tell me that
I can't draw front to back

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.660
because I'm blending,
and that is true.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.910
That does introduce
some issues.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.970
But you could actually eliminate
a lot of overdraw by

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:46.680
perhaps stenciling out the areas
that have rainfall or

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.900
have data on them.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.850
But as I said, a really
minor point.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.860
And the only reason I really
bring it up is because there's

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.310
a lot of apps that have
significantly more overdraw

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.400
than this, and still draw
everything back to front, And

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.200
that's a real problem.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.420
want to draw front to back so
that you can take advantage of

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.630
z rejection.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.280
Now, here's step three.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.110
It's a little hard to see what
they've done here, but step

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.220
three is actually drawing the
tiny little dot that tells me

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.620
where I am, and step four
puts a little white

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.220
square inside that dot.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.320
I don't know if you can
see that or not.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.460
So anyway, not a big deal.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.822
Where is the performance
loss coming from?

00:30:30.822 --> 00:30:33.200
Oh, I'm sorry, did I say
performance loss?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.060
I also said that this map
draws really fast.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.790
Yes it does, but how long
does it take to draw?

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.390
17 milliseconds.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.540
That's good enough to mostly
keep us at 60 FPS on a very

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.010
fast device, which is what
I tested this on--

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.270
it was a Nexus 7.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.660
On a slower device, or one
that doesn't have as much

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:57.100
memory bandwidth, or one that
just has different performance

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.740
characteristics, you're going
to run a lot slower.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.900
17 milliseconds is really
on the edge.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.190
It's actually just a little less
than 60 FPS, but that's

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.720
the highest frame
time that I saw.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.630
So, what is eating
up all the time?

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.970
Well it's not actually
the GPU.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.900
Now, you don't see it in this
view, because you have to run

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.330
Systrace to see it, but the GPU
overhead on this is just

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.810
three to four milliseconds,
which isn't bad for something

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.200
that's drawing this
many pixels.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.110
No, what's really eating
up all the time

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.090
is this over here.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.176
One draw call, 17
milliseconds.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.210
That's just one call, and it's
not even the one that touches

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.100
the most pixels.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.110
This is the call to
draw the overlay.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:53.900
So what is it doing wrong?

00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:03.130
Well, the real problem is that
it's not just drawing these

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.520
vertices, it's also memcopying
them, and that's really where

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.020
things get heavy.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.700
There's actually two arrays here
that are being set up.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.300
And then they are being
drawn using this DL

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.600
draw elements call.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.740
One of them is apparently, if
you look at the contents,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.110
probably the weather
information itself.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.610
A bunch of integers, they kind
of cluster in odd ways.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.820
That's probably our weather
information.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.240
That's going to vary
per frame.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.810
Maybe not enough to
justify redoing it

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.420
every frame, but yeah.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.010
But the next one, which is even
larger, is a bunch of

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.540
floats that are probably never
going to vary, because these

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.650
are all the vertices that
go into this mesh.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:53.320
And there's no real reason
to change those ever.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.510
Even if you're zooming the map
in and out, you can just

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.000
change the projection
on those.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.070
So why are we sending
them every frame?

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.690
There's no reason.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.480
Those should go in a vertex
buffer object.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:11.320
So, I think we'll go ahead
and sum up now.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.700
There's nothing wrong with this
app, but it's skirting

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.750
the edge of going from buttery
to janky, and with just a few

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:23.800
very, very slight changes,
it could be far

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.060
into buttery territory.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.960
All right, let's go ahead and
take a closer look at today's

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.040
apps to talk about next steps.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.810
RETO MEIER: That's right, so
we're going to see how close

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.770
they all are to be pure Android,
and to do that, we're

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:42.030
going to pass them through
each of these checklists.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.580
So we can already see that
there's a little bit of work

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.130
needs to be done on
a few these apps.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.290
We haven't had a chance yet to
look at them on tablets.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.670
I'm hoping there's a great
tablet experience,

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.690
particularly for Weather Bomb,
which looks like it could be

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.610
really great immersive sort of
weather exploration tool.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.550
RETO MEIER: So we're going to go
through and have a look at

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:59.290
how each of those things go.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:04.050
And I am going to use my mind
to change the slide.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.800
Until then, you can find our
pure Android collection at

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.659
bit.ly/PureAndroid, and you
can nominate your apps for

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.880
consideration by adding
it to our Trello page.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.630
You can find that by searching
for App Clinic Trello.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.400
We're going to be back next week
looking at kid mode apps,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.420
which I think is a topic
of particular

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.650
interest for yourself.

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed, I will
be showing lots of cute

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.739
pictures of my baby daughter.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.380
But, tune in anyway, because
we'll also be covering apps

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.639
and some interesting things
that you need keep in mind

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.880
when you're developing apps for
children, especially kid

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.050
mode lock screens.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:38.830
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.330
So tune in for that, and also
tune in next Tuesday for

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.889
Android Design in Action.

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: And until
next week, we are

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.360
the eye in the sky--

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.409
RETO MEIER: --looking at you--

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:49.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: --and we
can read your mind.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.080
RETO MEIER: See you
all next week.
