[jazz music playing]

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.080
&gt;&gt;Gopi: Dave Barry has a staggering ambition.
He wants to become the President of the United

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080
States of America.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
[audience chuckles]

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.609
And his highest priority will be to issue
the death penalty to the person responsible

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.000
for making Americans install low-flow toilets.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.739
[audience laughs and claps]

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.119
Good afternoon, Googlers. My name is Gopi
Kallayil. I work in Google marketing and we

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:53.290
all knew this day would finally come and our
young company is prepared for it. We knew

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.750
that one day Dave Barry would visit the Googleplex
and inspect our toilets.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.750
[hehe]

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.010
[audience chuckles]

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.010
[pause]

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.720
Dave, I'm happy to tell you that wherever
you go in the Googleplex, you will find the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.080
total, high-tech, high-flow toilet. And Dave,
I know you're hiding backstage, I am not making

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080
this up.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080
[audience laughs]

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.900
"So who is the real Dave Barry", I asked Google
last night. And since Google knows everything,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.810
it told me that he was elected Class Clown
of his Pleasantville High School class in

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.159
1965.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.520
[pause]

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.470
For 25 years he wrote a syndicated column
that was published in over 500 newspapers,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:55.510
and in 1988 he won the Pulitzer Prize for
Commentary. It left his critics speechless.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.600
[pause]

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.450
And he's written over 30 books as well along
the way. Now, you would think that when you've

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.170
done so much, a man would grow up, and maybe
get a membership card with the AARP, or something.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.340
No, but not Dave. He's gone on to write his
next book and he's here today to tell us about

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.999
it. Dave Barry's, "I'll Mature When I'm Dead:
Dave Barry's Amazing Tales of Adulthood."

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:31.810
I'm delighted to welcome to the Google campus
one of the finest, funniest writers in the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.049
entire world; a man who hopes to become, one
day, the President of the United States of

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:48.810
America. Ladies and gentlemen, here to talk
about his latest book, is Mr. Dave Barry.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.730
[clapping]

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.489
&gt;&gt;Dave: Thank you.

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.419
[clapping]

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.090
Gobi's available for weddings, Bar mitzvahs,
and I thank you for the introduction. I just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.240
want to clarify the toilet thing. I don't
think about them all the time.--

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.969
[man laughs]

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:13.749
I did write a, a number of columns back when
Congress decided to switch to low-flow toilets

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.620
and I didn't realize that, until I-I-I moved
to a house that had them that...and, I, I-I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.790
was u-up-upset cause i-it, it, I mean, now
we're used to it but young people don't realize

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.239
that there was a time this country had great
toilets.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.239
[laughter]

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.370
We had the best toilets in the world. We had
toilets that could suck down a mature sheep.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.370
[laughter]

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.040
But, now we, we have, anyway. I'm not gonna
get too far into the toilets. I think Gobi

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.309
covered that pretty well. This is actually
not my first visit to the Googleplex. This

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:47.139
is my second. The people applauding don't
know why, hehehe, maybe you were there.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.420
I'm in a band of authors called The Rock Bottom
Remainders. And it was Amy Tan, one of our

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.199
founding members, who arranged for us to come
here and perform. And for those who were here

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.199
that night, I'm sorry--

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.199
[laughter]

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.079
But, the idea, the idea, of, of...the band
has been around since 1992 and the original

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.409
idea was, it was going to be a one night thing,
and the idea was to get a bunch of authors

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.339
with musical talent together and play a show
to raise money.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:18.940
It was during a bookseller's convention for
a First Amendment cause and the only flaw

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.090
in that plan was that it-it turns out none
of the authors had any lit-uhh, musical talent.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.050
But we enjoyed playing so much that we, we
just kept together and we still play. And

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.930
as Amy once put it, "I would do this to kill
the whales."

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.410
[laughter]

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.759
Although, to my knowledge no whale has ever
been killed as a result of any, our Remainders

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.430
performance. But we, we, our genre we call
it "Hard Listening Music".

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.430
[laughter]

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.770
And those of you who were here that night
may remember our, we-the, I call our, the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.660
technique we, we play "The Rumor Method" of
music. Which is to say, everybody is holding

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.840
an instrument or, of some kind and everybody's
playing something. And then a rumor goes around

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.060
that there might have been a might have been
a chord change.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.060
[laughter]

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.590
Whoa. Anyway, I'll switch to something else
although not the, the same, necessarily the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.340
same something else. Anyway, so, I went, I
have been here, had a-a nice tour, it was

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.520
impressed as I'm sure everybody is by this
fascinating, huge, complex, mysterious operation.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.840
And I'm, of course, a Googler. I-I'm a l-long-time
user of Google. In fact, I, it has really

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.120
changed my work habits as it, I suppose most
people. When I need to know something I used

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.090
to have to look it up, you know, with an almanac
or something and now I just get on Google

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.639
and like, two hours later I'm looking at something
completely unrelated. And I uhh--

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.639
[laughter]

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.900
As I, I'm, thanks to you guys; I'm wasting
time faster than ever before. And, and I do

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.449
appre.. no, I use Google all the time. What
I need, and I-I've said that I-I need a search

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.180
engine, I need a, a Goog, a special Google
that whatever I type in for a search it returns,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.180
"Get back to work."

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.180
[laughter]

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.860
So if you could work on that. I'm gonna talk
a little bit about my and I was hoping to

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.360
do actually a dramatic reading from it using
somebody in the audience as a foil. But I'll

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.500
get to that in a little.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.840
This is a book of essays. All but one of which
have never appeared anywhere else. Most, most

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.520
of my, a lot of books I, I've written over
the years really just compilations of, of

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.310
newspaper columns. This is not; these are
original essays written for this book but

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.259
the one that the, one exception, the one that
sort of started the idea of, of, in my mind,

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.500
of writing this book and it's really kind
of the same, kind of the same inspiration

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.231
that inspired William Faulkner and Marcel
Proust and, a colonoscopy.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.370
[laughter]

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.740
Now most of you fortunately for yourselves
are too young to have had this experience

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.810
but eventually in life you'll, you'll, you'll
be advised that you need to get a colonoscopy.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.810
I went way, way past the time when you're
supposed to get one. And I and I didn't get

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.990
it.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.430
And then I got a call, actually got an email
from my brother, Sam, who lives in San Francisco,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.759
saying that he had just, he's younger than
I am but much more responsible. And his, his

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.139
email said that he had gotten a colonoscopy
and they had found that he had cancer. And

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.270
they caught it really early and just to clear
that up, he's fine now. They, they treated

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.340
it and he's, he's fine. But it was a little,
it was quite scary. And the email said, "The

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.129
doctors told me that I should contact my siblings
and make sure that they've been screened also."

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:29.150
And he said to me, "I'm sure you've been screened
already", because I'm older than he is.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.610
And of course I hadn't. And the reason I hadn't,
and it's the big fear most people have, it's,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.240
it's the, the, the im-, the impression people
have about a colonoscopy is that it is going

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.659
to be awful because they're gonna stick a
tube 17,000 feet up your butt.

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:43.789
[laughter]

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:49.750
And they are. That's exactly what they do.
In fact, the big danger of the procedure is

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.919
that the tube will go out of you and enter
another patient.

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:52.919
[laughter]

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:59.419
They have a guy with an ax to cut it off in
case it gets loose in the room. But, it's

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:04.279
nothing because it's a lot like the '60s.
They give you drugs--

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.279
[laughter]

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:09.699
and you don't remember it. You don't remember
any of it. I, when I, was, was done, I asked,

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.560
I sin-sincerely didn't know it was done and
it, I felt so good I thought, "Well let's

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.789
do it again while we're"--

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:14.789
[laughter]

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:19.509
That wasn't so bad. The only bad part of the
actual procedure, something to, something

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:25.159
to keep in mind, the procedure room they had,
and this is fairly common I gather in rooms

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:28.029
where this kinds of procedures going on, they
had music playing.

00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:32.760
I think that's supposed to relax you and it
would have except for that when they were

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.630
just putting me under with the stuff and Dr.
Sable was coming toward me with the tube,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.669
the song that came on the PA was "Dancing
Queen"--

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.669
[laughter]

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:48.190
by ABBA. So you, that's really the last song
you want to hear when a guy is coming at you

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.270
with a tube and you're about to be unconscious.
So anyway--

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.270
[laughter]

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.670
ask for the non-ABBA version. The other part,
and I don't want to get too graphic here,

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:02.000
those of you who have been through this experience
will know what I'm talking about. The preparation

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.940
for the colonoscopy is a little bit intense
because they have to clean you out pretty

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.250
good. So they give you nuclear laxative.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.530
[laughter]

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.260
So powerful that you're bowels travel into
the future.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.600
[laughter]

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.450
And you expel food that you have not even
eaten yet.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.450
[laughter]

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.951
Ok. Never, if you've ever seen a space shuttle
launch, that's generally the--

00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:24.320
[laughter]

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320
experience. So anyway--

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320
[laughter]

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.600
enough about that. So anyway, that, that,
so I wrote, I wrote an essay about that. That,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.830
mm-at the time I didn't think about writing
a book of essays, so I wrote a book and it

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.260
ran in Miami Herald and a bunch of other newspapers
and it, and it, and it, became pretty viral

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.060
on the Internet. I got a tre- , a lot, lot
of responses to that, and to this day in fact,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.850
if, when I get on an airplane people like,
some guy ten rows away will go, "Dave, I got

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.860
a colonoscopy!" And, which is not the best
thing to have and--

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.860
[laughter]

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.280
people yelling to you and, with all those
other people wondering, "Why is he telling

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.280
him that?"

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.010
[audience chuckles]

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:03.310
So anyway, I thought that, I kind of enjoyed
that, I hadn't been writing a column for awhile,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.071
I've been doing other things. But I kind of
enjoyed writing that essay and I enjoyed the

00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:10.640
fact that I could write a longer essay and,
and, when I was writing newspaper columns

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.920
they, they had to be about 650 words. Ki-kinda
had to keep them short and so I, I came up

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.680
with the idea, of, of writing a series of
essays and, and turn them into a book and

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.270
that's, that's really what this became; how
this book came to be.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:30.160
One of the topics I talk about extensively
in the book is, is my city. I live in Miami.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.110
I moved there in 1986 from the United States.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.110
[laughter]

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:41.000
And I always feel like, a, sort of an ambassador
for the City of Miami because it has a very

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.840
poor image. Every year the Zogby organization
does a poll where they ask people what their

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.340
impressions are of major metropolitan areas.
Every year Miami does poorly in this poll.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:58.400
The last one I saw, 67 percent of the respondents
said that they thought of Miami as a dangerous,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.180
violent place. And that's really disturbing
to me. I, I want to track those people down

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.180
and kill them.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.480
[laughter]

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.310
Because it's not, I mean, it's like any other
place. There's, there's, there's good and

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.820
there's bad, but really is a, a wonderful
city. So I wrote a chapter in, in the book

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.480
which is a, an essay in the book which is
essentially a visitor's guide to Miami, which

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.820
starts out with my, my proposed solution to
the, the tourism image problem which is a-a

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.370
new tourism promotion campaign based on the
slogan, "Come back to Miami. We weren't shooting

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.370
at you."

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.370
[laughter]

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.370
And

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.370
[clears throat]

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.160
I talk in there about what, what's, things
to do, things not to do, where to go, where

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.370
not to go. My, my main place not to go in
Miami is outdoors.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.370
[laughter]

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:51.140
That can be pretty dangerous. And, and, also
driving, can, is a little hazardous in Miami.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.560
When I first got there I thought, "These people
don't know the law." I now realize that everybody

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.720
in Miami is driving according to the law of
his or her individual country of origin.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.660
[laughter]

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.100
And apparently there's countries where it's
traditional to put on that left turn signal

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.100
first thing in the morning.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.100
[laughter]

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.770
Maybe put it on the night before just to make
sure it's, where. It's the only place I've

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.260
ever lived where the driver's manual shows
you how to give the finger.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.990
[audience chuckles]

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.320
Where people will pass you in a car wash and,
and it, and it, and it, and in addition to

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.450
the, with the people from all the different
cultures, we have a lot of retirees driving

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.070
in South Florida, in, in the mix. Folks who
I think most of them didn't, I think they

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.730
mostly grew up in the New York area, didn't
drive a lot, if at all, most of their lives

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.960
to public transportation. And then they retired,
they lost the vast majority of their sight

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960
and hearing, -

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960
[laughter]

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.090
and they moved to South Florida and got drivers
licenses. Which-

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.090
[laughter]

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.810
down there come with your Happy Meal.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.810
[laughter]

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:53.220
And so y-y-y-you have a lot of kind of oblivious
drivers. I've never lived anywhere where there

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.060
were some, a certain kind of accident happens
so often. It's the kind of accident where

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.500
a car, a motorist, drives into a building.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.840
[laughter]

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.541
Sometimes pretty darn far into the building
and it--

00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:04.630
[laughter]

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.400
it's not the kind of building that sprang
up at the last minute, you know.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400
[laughter]

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.680
The building had been there some time when
the motorist arrived and it-it's on the news

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.880
almost every night. There's a car in a building
and --

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880
[laughter]

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.741
the, the TV guy always says the same thing,
"The driver told police his foot was on the

00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.030
brake when in fact, it was on the accelerator."

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.070
[laughter]

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.930
We have all made that mistake, but how long
does it take you to figure it out?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.930
[laughter]

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.930
You have to wait until you're in the salad
bar.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.070
[laughter]

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:38.350
We had a, a driver, this was about, I think,
it's the year before last and an-n-n-n we,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:44.660
th-the Miami police stopped a 73 year old
man driving a Chevrolet Cobalt. Now that in

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.030
itself is not so weird. It's a 73 year old
man, driving a Chevrolet Cobalt, pulled over

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:54.620
by the police. It's where they stopped him;
Runway 9 Miami International Airport.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:55.720
[laughter]

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.260
This is absolutely true. This man, without
noticing it, had burst through the perimeter

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.950
gates and was on the, now you'd think that
when you're, you see a 737 in your lane--

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.950
[laughter]

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.390
you know you're not on LeJeune Road anymore,
you know, you're, but--

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.390
[laughter]

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.361
apparently this did not occur to this man;
police pull him over. That, and the thing

00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:19.190
about that is that's my airport. I was in
that airport this morning. I can't near a

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.910
plane there with shampoo.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.910
[laughter]

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:29.000
This man was out there with a Cobalt. He must
have had it in one of that clear 1-quart,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
resealable--

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
[laughter]

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.630
plastic bags. So, so driving is not so safe.
Public transportation, on the other hand,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:41.880
is also not necessarily safe in Miami. I can
give you a couple examples. One, this happened

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:49.260
some years ago and it became quite well known.
Some Norwegian tourists landed at Miami International

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:57.730
Airport and got on a hotel c-courtesy shuttle
bus to go to their hotel. And it was hijacked.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:04.640
They were hijacked in a hotel courtesy shuttle
van, which was a big deal back in Norway where

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.970
there is no crime at all. The mo-, like, if
they had a show called "CSI: Norway" the big

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.600
case would involve improperly labeled herring.
So--

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.730
[laughter]

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.780
This was a big deal; the Norwegians. And another
case, a German tourist, this is when we got

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.350
our really bad reputation abroad, a German
tourist checked out--

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.350
[audience member coughs]

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.250
he was staying at a hotel near the airport
and he checked out of the hotel and complained

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.530
about an odor in his room. And they checked
and there was, in fact, a deceased person

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.530
under the bed.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.530
[inaudible audience exclamations]

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.850
And not a recently deceased person; it had
been there awhile, and that, again, big deal

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.200
over in Germany because--

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.780
[laughter]

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.900
they have a lit, higher standards for housecleaning.
You might find a dust bunny but you're not

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.080
going to find an old corpse under--

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.080
[laughter]

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.230
a German hotel bed. It may, if there's a corpse
under a German hotel bed, it's a fresh corpse,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.390
you can bet on it.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.390
[laughter]

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.980
But anyway, despite the fact that he was not
charged for the extra room occupant, they

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.950
made a big deal about that over there in Germany.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.950
[laughter]

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:06.340
But the public transportation that, that I,
the, the story that, that, to me, that sort

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.980
of s-stood out most of all for the general
weirdness of Miami happened last year. And

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.570
on a thing we call the People Mover, which
is a thing that m-moves people around, it's

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.040
like a little, mass transit thing in downtown
Miami. What happened was two homeless guys,

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.160
I believe they were homeless guys, were fishing
in Biscayne Bay, which is bay right next to

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.020
the city, and they caught a six-foot nurse
shark.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.660
Pretty big shark, I mean, for the bay and
they decided they wanted to sell it to some

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:37.230
fish wholesaler. There's some fish wholesalers
by the Miami River downtown about a mile from

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.811
there. And they decided the best way to get
it there: public transportation.

00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:42.811
[laughter]

00:16:42.811 --> 00:16:47.120
So they took this shark onto the People Mover
and set in on the floor. And it really is

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.570
not designed for marine life, the People Mover.
The shark was not doing well but it was still

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.540
alive and commuters got on the, the thing,
and I know this because this woman who's a

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.850
reader of my blog took a picture with her
camera and emailed it to me. I, I thought

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.280
I'd seen everything in Miami but there's a
shark on the People Mover and it's not a dead

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.280
shark.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.429
[laughter]

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:10.589
So we could have had a, a..no-no..fortunately
the shark didn't attack anybody, but we could

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:13.390
have had a shark attack on the People Mover
and that would have been great. That would

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.390
have been the--

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.390
[laughter]

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:20.370
maybe the single best thing that ever happened
in Miami. Well anyway, so that's another essay.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:26.120
The ma- , a lot of the essays in the book
are about men and women; relationships between

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.160
men and women. It's a, a subject I never get
tired of, of writing about and I try to answer

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.870
the question, the fundamental question, why
is it so difficult for men and women to communicate

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.250
with each other? And I spend a lot of time
thinking about that. And I believe I've isolated

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.840
the problem: women.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.840
[laughter]

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:51.630
And so I wrote a couple chapters in there
designed to answer questions that women have

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.750
about men, and part of the point of this is
that these aren't really questions. Women,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.570
there are certain things women ask about men
all the time and implied in the question is

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.720
the answer and the answer is, "because men
are idiots."

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720
[laughter]

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.111
So, what I wanna do is, I would like to read
a, do a little dramatic reading of, of one,

00:18:08.111 --> 00:18:15.850
one part of one essay on men and women where
I'll, I'll answer questions from women, but

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.020
to do that I need a woman to come up here
and play the role of a woman.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.940
Yeah, come on up.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.960
[pause]

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:32.180
And I'll, I hope that I brought it. Yup. It's
exciting, huh? She's already regretting this.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.180
[laughter]

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.140
Let me turn this into a temporary lectern.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.350
Hi! I'm Dave, and you are...

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.270
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Sufficiently female.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yes, you are.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.170
[laughter]

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.170
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Hahahaha.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: But do you have an actual name?

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.170
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Michelle.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: Michelle.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.170
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Hi!

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ok, that's my wife's name. You're
not my...no.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.170
&gt;&gt;Michelle: No.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.170
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ok--

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.170
[laughter]

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.170
because my God, what a coincidence that would...hey
this would be even better, this thing here.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.170
We'll use this thing.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.170
[clunk]

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:03.830
Don't worry; I know what I'm doing. You're
gonna say, "Why is he doing this?"

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.830
[pause]

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.570
There. How's that?

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.630
&gt;&gt;Michelle: That's good.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.460
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ok, well you have to stand on this
side.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Alright.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.460
[laughter]

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.460
&gt;&gt;Dave: Oh, hey!

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.460
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Oh, hey!

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460
&gt;&gt;Dave: Wow.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.460
&gt;&gt;Michelle: I have a mic.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.460
&gt;&gt;Dave: It's true about Google being wealthy.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.460
[audience and Michelle laugh]

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.810
There's two. Ok, you're gonna be the red...

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.480
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Ok, great.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.620
&gt;&gt;Dave: That's good? Make sure you get right,
yeah.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.770
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Oh, ok, yeah [inaudible]

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.730
&gt;&gt;Dave: We still, is she on? The woman's not
on. Michelle, the woman.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.500
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Hello? Ok, awesome. Here we go.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500
[Michelle laughs]

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.531
&gt;&gt;Dave: [ ] Michelles gonna play the part
of the woman, I'll play the part of the man.

00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:36.531
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Ok

00:19:36.531 --> 00:19:37.531
[Dave clears throat]

00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:38.940
&gt;&gt;Dave: Don't be nervous.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.450
&gt;&gt;Michelle: No, I'm fine.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.970
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ok. I'm nervous.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.110
[reads from paper]

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.380
"I recently conducted a survey of women whom
I selected on a scientific basis of being

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.310
either a, 1. Friends of my wife, or 2. On
the Internet.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.840

"I asked these women to submit the questions

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240
who asked"

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:08.570
&gt;&gt;Michelle: "Do wom, do men realize how unfathomably
stupid women think they are and if so, why

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.680
don't they do anything about it?"

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680
[Michelle laughs]

negative tone."

&gt;&gt;Michelle: Hahaha.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.820
&gt;&gt;Dave: "This was typical. Not one woman asked
the question that implied men might have any

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.480
positive qualities. They did not ask, 'How
might', excuse me, "How can men be so darn

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.990
rational all the time?' Or, --

[laughter]

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.570
"Anyway, my hope is that by giving simple,
straightforward answers to these women's questions

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.020
using the Q and A format, I can clear up some
of the misunderstandings women have about

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.050
men. I'll begin with a question that m-m-many
of the women asked. A question that seems

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:49.180
to trouble women in general, more than the
danger of an Earth-asteroid collision."

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:55.960
&gt;&gt;Michelle: "Why don't men put the toilet
seat back down after they pee?"

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.730
&gt;&gt;Dave: Because they care.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.960
[Michelle laughs]

who had to defend the women and children in
their tribe from vis-viscious, savage enemy

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.650
tribes who could attack at any time without
warning to rape and pillage and plunder. So

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.430
these early males had to be constantly vigilant.
They had to pee standing up with their heads

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:21.300
on a swivel. They could not afford to waste
precious seconds aiming the pee-stream or

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.471
putting down the toilet seat.

00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:23.630
[laughter]

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.520

of distraction to strike and perform acts

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.801
of vicious, savage plundering on the women
and children.

[Michelle laughs]

00:21:30.801 --> 00:21:34.800
That was a risk these brave and courageous
and manly warriors of long ago were simply

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.270
unwilling to take. This same protective instinct
is still deeply ingrained in men today, not

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.530
that we expect any thanks.

us, our children, our careers, our relationships.

interest?

your relationship with a man, he listens to
you a lot because he's trying to solve a very

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.440
important problem, namely, getting you to
have sex with him.

your friends, the fruit flies of the Riucu

how he can get you to become naked.

about a specific, clearly defined problem

because he can then use his reasoning skills
to come up with a solution. For example, if

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.380
you tell him that the car motor is making
a funny noise, he will listen intently. Then

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.210

for a few days in case it goes away.

"But when it comes to feelings, the man is
in trouble. Scientists using brain probes

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:07.080
have determined that the average man has approximately
one feeling per hour versus 850 for the average

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.570
woman. So the man is not as comfortable with
feelings as you are. When you pour out your

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.490
feelings to him, he tries to figure out what
the specific problem is so he can take action.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.190
But he quickly becomes confused because there
doesn't seem to be a problem. He doesn't understand

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.190
what you want him to do.

you just want him to listen to you and share

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.580
his feelings in return, you only make it worse.
Because at any given moment he has just the

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:35.670
one feeling and usually along the lines of
'My balls itch.'

"Eventually, the man concludes that for some
reason you periodically have a massive, internal

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.380
buildup of feelings and it must be released
in the direction of another human being. He

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.750
adopts a strategy of monitoring these releases
for key words or phrases, indicating a problem

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:53.480
that he might have something to do about,
such as "fire", "internal bleeding", or "district

for the feelings storm to blow over, maybe

he cares about, they should also be important
to him?"

[audience laughs]

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:29.000
when men had to protect their loved ones by
peeing standing up, they were also responsible

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.730
for feeding their families by hunting. This
meant they had to be constantly scanning the

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.710
environment, always searching for prey."

obsessed with breasts?"

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.760

use visual cues to attract each other for

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.470
the purpose of facilitating reproduction which
is necessary to avoid extinction. For example,

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:58.340
the male peacock drags around an enormous
tail which he displays to the female peacock,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.360
who responds, 'Whoa. That is some large tail
you have. Let's engage in reproductive activity

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.480
in the form of getting it on.'

but this does not bother him. He does not

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.440
think, 'Why is she so obsessed with my tail?
It's just feathers for God's sake. She can't

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.809
even make eye contact with me.'

is the size of a Cheerio.

[laughter]

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.520
"But also because he knows that unless the
female becomes attracted to him, there will

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.820
be no reproduction. And if there is no reproduction
then peacocks will become extinct. So he is

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.750
happy to display this important visual cue
to the opposite gender."

should go around displaying their breasts

Two years ago, I got a high definition TV

and after I set it up, my wife, a woman, complained
that the picture did not look like high definition

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.270
to her. So I made some adjustments in the
form of explaining patiently to her that she

but to roll my eyes in a masculine fashion

TV for about a year, she decided, you know
women get these crazy ideas, to look at the

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.350
to even higher definition.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.790
[Michelle and audience laugh]

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.309
"But my wife was sure it was because of what
she had read in the manual. She even tried

00:28:54.309 --> 00:28:57.940
to show me the manual but, of course, I could
not look directly at it because of the danger

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.220
that my penis would fall off."

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.630
&gt;&gt;Michelle: A-ha!

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.059
[audience laughs]

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.830
"Is that also why men refuse to ask directions?"

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:10.299
&gt;&gt;Dave: "If Man A asks Man B for directions,
Man B, realizing Man A is a weak direction-asking

00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:14.950
type of male who probably also reads owner's
manuals, could decide to attack Man A's village

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.950
and plunder his women.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.950
[audience laughs]

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.670
"Man A is not about to run that kind of risk.
But there's more to it than that. Men are

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.430
explorers; they do not follow the herd. If
everyone says the best way to get to a certain

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.890
mall is to take a certain road because that
is the road the mall is located on, --

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.309
[audience laughs]

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:34.380
"a man wonders if there might be another,
better, as yet undiscovered route to that

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:40.000
same mall. If Columbus, back in 1492, had
taken directions from the so-called experts

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.790
on how to get to India, he would never have
set out in the opposite direction across the

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.790
Atlantic Ocean.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.790
[audience laughs]

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.790
[Michelle laughs]

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.670
"and today there would be no such thing as
Microsoft, Dairy Queen, or syphilis."

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.420
[audience laughs]

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.580
&gt;&gt;Michelle: "So are you basically saying that
all the things that women perceive as flaws,

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.640
women are actually, a, women perceive as flaws
in men, are actually virtues, without which

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.440
the human race would today be facing widespread
misery, destruction, and death and possibly

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.680
even distinc-uh- extinction?"

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.410
&gt;&gt;Dave: "Also, no Dairy Queen."

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.440
[Michelle laughs]

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.360
&gt;&gt;Michelle: "I never realized any of this."

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.030
I have to say that? Ok.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.840
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yes.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:29.950
&gt;&gt;Michelle: Haha. "Now I feel so guilty for
all the time that we women have spent thoughtlessly

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.950
carping about men.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.950
[audience laughs]

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:41.130
"I feel terrible about our insensitivity and
all the pain we must have caused you. I feel--"

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.130
&gt;&gt;Audience member: Stop reading!!

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.130
[laughter]

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.820
&gt;&gt;Michelle: I feel like a small part of me
just died, ha ha.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.820
[continues reading]

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.820
"Excuse me, are you still listening?"

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.820
&gt;&gt;Dave: What?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820
[laughter]

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.820
Ladies and gentlemen, Michelle. Good job.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820
[audience claps]

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:57.030
She will never volunteer for anything ever
again. Well thank you, Michelle, that was

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:03.990
good. You did an excellent job. So, you know
what, why don't we, instead of me talk, I'll

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:09.280
take questions on anything. It can be about
this book or not about this book or if there's

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.810
a problem at home you'd like to share with
the group.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.809
[audience chuckles]

00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:13.809
That's why we're here.

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:14.820
Oh, wait.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.030
&gt;&gt;Gopi: This [inaudible] will make it work.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.030
&gt;&gt;Dave: Gopi's here.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.870
&gt;&gt;Gopi: I know this will shock you, but we
have mic 3 and mic 4.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.990
&gt;&gt;Dave: Wow. Many mikes.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:30.010
&gt;&gt;Gopi: So, you can go up to the mic, identify
yourself, ask a question or post it in [drawrie]

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:38.309
and the link for that is go/askdave. Ok, so
people are a little shy to ask or from other

00:31:38.309 --> 00:31:39.309
parts that are going to be from far away questions.

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:41.490
&gt;&gt;Dave: I see, you want me to answer that
one or is there some--

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:45.040
&gt;&gt;Gopi: Let's..we'll take a question from
Pablo and we'll switch back and forth.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040
&gt;&gt;Dave: Alright.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.590
&gt;&gt;Pablo: This dangerous looking set of green
squares--

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.891
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yes, you have to stand in it.

00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:51.891
[Dave laughs]

00:31:51.891 --> 00:31:53.730
Because I have a switch right here. Che-kung!

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.770
[Pablo laughs]

00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:01.640
&gt;&gt;Pablo: So, so you started writing before
the Internet and now, a-a-and so you had this

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.669
dedicated audience, the newspaper column,
and now you've got all of these other people,

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:13.340
like me, who write things and try to be funny.
Do you feel, do you find you reach out in

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.340
different ways?

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.731
&gt;&gt;Dave: What?

00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:18.040
[laughter]

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.750
No, I mean, I'm not sure I understand the
question to be honest. D-d-do you mean i-if

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.570
I, if I have to write more on the Internet,
or..? Is that your question?

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.309
&gt;&gt;Pablo: Just, do-do-do you find yourself
trying to explore, to explore a little bit

00:32:30.309 --> 00:32:33.460
to catch that audience that's going…

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:40.059
&gt;&gt;Dave: Not, I mean, I like the Internet.
I was, and I think it's here to stay.

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:41.059
[laughter]

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:47.720
But early on I started writing a blog, I mean
it's not a real blog, it's more like random

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.340
links but, but it, its, I've always had a
sort of presence there that I've enjoyed.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.790
I think of that as really different from the
kind of writing I do when I write a book or

00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:02.799
an a, a newspaper column. I never think that
much about reaching any particular audience.

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:06.929
I always figure, well, if somebody else thinks
it's funny, that's good enough. And they'll

00:33:06.929 --> 00:33:14.580
figure out a way to connect. To me, the Internet
has been g-good for me, I think, j-just just

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:20.510
in the sense of reaching more people but I
don't think, like, I don't have a strategy

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.410
for it, or anything else to be honest.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.410
[laughter]

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:28.730
I had the most random career path in the history
of writing. Does that answer your question,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.730
sort of?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.730
&gt;&gt;Pablo: Yeah. Thank you.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.340
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ok, because I didn't understand your
question, I--

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.340
[audience laughs]

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.340
You can ask me state capitals, man, I'm there.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.360
[audience laughs]

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.380
&gt;&gt;Dave: But, ok.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:44.700
&gt;&gt;Tom: Your book this time is about being
mature. I know a previous book was "Dave Barry

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.700
Turns 50"--

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.700
&gt;&gt;Dave: Right.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.700
&gt;&gt;Tom: So, you're in your late 50s, I believe?

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700
&gt;&gt;Dave: 62.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.030
&gt;&gt;Tom: What the hell are you using on your
face to look so young?

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.030
&gt;&gt;Dave: I al--

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.650
&gt;&gt;Tom: Living in Miami, I mean, sun block
5000, or? Hehe.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.799
&gt;&gt;Dave: Well, I don't know the actual number
of my sun block.

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:00.799
[laughs]

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:04.520
But no, I always looked young. When I was
a, it was, its, its good now, it was bad when

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.319
I was young because I looked like, I was the
most hair-hairless person in my high school.

00:34:08.319 --> 00:34:09.319
[audience laughs]

00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:11.500
I was actually voted that.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500
[audience laughs]

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:20.339
No! They, they had. So, I, I, I always looked
like I was in about 4th grade up through,

00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:25.529
and it was, it was, it was, I had a brutal
social life. You know how women are always

00:34:25.529 --> 00:34:29.989
saying that what they really like in a man
is a sense of humor. That was, that was such

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.490
a lie in my high school. Ha ha.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:32.490
[audience laughs]

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:36.599
Because I, I had a sense of humor but that's
pretty much all I had and it wasn't enough.

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:37.599
[audience laughs]

00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:38.599
Not that I'm bitter, I'm not bitter.

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:41.319
[audience laughs]

00:34:41.319 --> 00:34:44.960
Was, was there a question? Oh, sun block.
Probably around a 40 sun block, I don't know.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.440
&gt;&gt;Tom: And this is unrelated to the bad social
life; I didn't know that previously you had

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440
a brother named Sam.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440
&gt;&gt;Dave: I do.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.990
&gt;&gt;Tom: How much teasing did you get from being
Sam and Dave?

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:58.010
&gt;&gt;Dave: Sam and Dave. You know, we're never
in the same place that often, but. He's referring

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.069
to the, there was a b-a-a-rhythm and blues
singing act called Sam and Dave. They were

00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:07.050
actually very good. I saw Sam and Dave perform,
that's how old I am. But, but I started writing

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.931
before the Internet as was pointed out earlier,
also before electricity, I was--

00:35:09.931 --> 00:35:11.589
[audience laughs]

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:18.109
Anyway, we didn't get mocked for being Sam
and Dave. What's your name?

00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:19.109
&gt;&gt;Tom: Tom

00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:20.869
&gt;&gt;Dave: Tom, ok, I can't think of anything
funny to say about that so I'm gonna let you

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:21.869
go, Tom. Yeah.

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.759
&gt;&gt;Red: So, you, you were saying state capitals?
North Dakota?

00:35:24.759 --> 00:35:25.780
&gt;&gt;Dave: North Dakota would be Pierre. Or is
that South Dakota?

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.780
&gt;&gt;Red: South Dakota.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.780
&gt;&gt;Dave: Ahh, there's no--

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.780
&gt;&gt;Red: They named the way street [inaudible]
right?

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:33.960
&gt;&gt;Dave: there's really no difference between
North and South Dakota. It's time somebody

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.990
pointed..I

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.069
[audience laughs]

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:42.589
I, I once got an, I just got to say, I, I
got in so much trouble with North Dakota once.

00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:47.210
I wrote a col- I was looking for something
to write a column about once and I came across

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:53.190
an article in the newspaper that there had
been a, a conference in North Dakota of all

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.460
the state tourism officials and whatever,
trying to figure out how to get, how they

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.589
could improve the state's image because people,
people don't want to go to North Dakota, people

00:35:59.589 --> 00:36:02.190
don't want to stay in North Dakota when they
live there. If you go to north Dakota, they'll

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.339
pull you over and say, "Hey, you wanna be
in the Legislature?"

00:36:04.339 --> 00:36:07.150
[audience laughs]

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:11.519
And, and, so one of the things they talked
about in this conference, this is what I wrote

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:14.530
my column about was, their, they were talking
about ma-maybe they can improve the image

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.750
of the state somehow and one of the things
they considered was changing the name of the

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.769
state from North Dakota to Dakota.

00:36:20.769 --> 00:36:22.739
[audience laughs]

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:26.970
Which is, you know, I don't know, would that
make you want to go there suddenly, instead

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.970
of Hawaii?

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.480
[audience laughs]

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:35.280
So, I wrote a column making fun of that, of,
of North Dakota and that was a huge mistake.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.329
If you don't learn anything else today, learn
this: Do not mess with North Dakota.

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.450
[audience laughs]

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:44.349
First of all, I got an angry letter from everybody
in the state, which is nearly 115 letters.

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:45.980
[audience laughs]

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.940
But second, and this is the really fiendish
part of the North Dakota revenge scheme, they

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:57.619
invited me up there in January and dedicated
a Sewage Lifting Station in my honor. This

00:36:57.619 --> 00:37:02.329
is absolutely true. If you go to Grand Forks,
North Dakota, for any reason, such as your

00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:09.229
plane has crashed there, there is a brick
building and on it, in foot high letters,

00:37:09.229 --> 00:37:15.440
metal letters, it's says, "Dave Barry Lift
Station #16". Really, and inside is the equipment

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:22.359
that lifts the sewage, which is a concept
I do not understand. I would leave the sewage

00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:28.549
down there, you know? In North Dakota, they
lift it. That is how bored they are.

00:37:28.549 --> 00:37:30.339
[audience laughs]

00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:34.589
Anyway, they had this ceremony, and it, it's
honestly the coldest I've ever been in my

00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:38.190
life. It was way below zero, and we're standing,
we actually got a crowd out there and we're

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:41.750
standing in front of it, they put a brown
piece of paper over the, the sign for the

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:47.940
big dedication ceremony and the mayor of Grand
Forks read a proclamation, very eloquently

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.410
comparing my work to the production of human
excrement.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:56.230
And at the big moment, they had me tear the,
the, the piece of paper of it, and I remember

00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.569
seeing the, my name on the sign of this building
and smelling the sewage in the cold North

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:04.210
Dakota air and hearing "powp, powp, powp,
powp, powp, powp", which is the sound of people

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.210
applauding in mittens.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:10.029
[audience laughs]

00:38:10.029 --> 00:38:12.509
That was my North Dakota experience.

00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:17.819
&gt;&gt;Red: Well, I, I had a quick second question
as well. Your "Year in Review" is one of the

00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:23.190
primary ways that I keep track of what happens
from year to year and I'm sure it's the same

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:24.190
for millions of Americans who--

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.190
&gt;&gt;Dave: Which is one thing that's wrong with
this country.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.190
[audience laughs]

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.930
&gt;&gt;Red: I was wondering if you could go into
more detail as to how you create that. Do

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.720
you save snippets throughout the year, like
a giant file folder?

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.739
&gt;&gt;Dave: No, I, I should, b-but it, I do it
pretty much the way I got through college

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:37.961
as an English major, is to wait until the
last minute

00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:38.961
[laughter]

00:38:38.961 --> 00:38:42.460
and take amphetamines. No, no! Noooo!

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.930
[audience laughs]

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:47.710
That would be so wrong, no. I don't even know
where to get them anymore.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.079
[audience laughs]

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:53.900
So, so, but I, I, I do it kind of all at the
end. It actually takes me almost two weeks

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:59.109
of pretty much non-stop, but I get a, I get
a printout of all the, I do a lot of Googling

00:38:59.109 --> 00:39:03.789
during this phase of my year and get a, a,
get a, all the headlines for the year and

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:07.799
then I start trying to come up with jokes
that can, that can be turned into running

00:39:07.799 --> 00:39:12.059
jokes. Like I know now that at some point
there's going to be a, an oil spill section.

00:39:12.059 --> 00:39:15.609
I just don't know what the humor part will
be. It doesn't seem that funny at the moment.

00:39:15.609 --> 00:39:16.640
[audience laughs]

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.869
My solution for that whole thing, by the way,
you're probably saying, "Well, what should

00:39:18.869 --> 00:39:22.010
we do?" We need to relocate the Gulf of Mexico.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.010
[audience laughs]

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.359
It has been nothing but problems, everything
we've had. Hurricanes start there, now there's

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:32.430
oiling. Put it near some other country. That's
my, I, and I'm, I don't really know how specifically

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.329
we do that but I'm more of a big picture guy.

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:35.739
[audience laughs]

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:37.150
&gt;&gt;Red: Thanks.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.970
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yup. Any other...yes?

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:40.970
[pause]

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:44.829
&gt;&gt;Older Male: I, I've been following you a
long time and I really get--

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:45.989
&gt;&gt;Dave: I know, and I'm getting a restraining
order.

00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:46.989
&gt;&gt;Older Male: I know.

00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:48.410
[audience laughs]

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:54.799
I have a 16- year old son who thinks that
I am pretty stodgy and, and, don't know all

00:39:54.799 --> 00:39:59.979
the words that he's insisting that I learn.
I wonder if it's, if you think it's safe to

00:39:59.979 --> 00:40:03.029
introduce him to your book and how would I
best do that?

00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:04.059
&gt;&gt;Dave: Can he read?

00:40:04.059 --> 00:40:05.059
[audience laughs]

00:40:05.059 --> 00:40:06.960
&gt;&gt;Older Male: Yes, he's a very good reader.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.749
&gt;&gt;Dave: Then he's probably pretty familiar
with the whole, the way with the sequentially

00:40:09.749 --> 00:40:10.769
numbered pages and all that.

00:40:10.769 --> 00:40:11.769
[audience laughs]

00:40:11.769 --> 00:40:12.769
&gt;&gt;Older Male: Uhhhh--

00:40:12.769 --> 00:40:13.769
&gt;&gt;Dave: The whole book thing, I mean--

00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:14.769
&gt;&gt;Older Male: Yes, he is.

00:40:14.769 --> 00:40:15.780
&gt;&gt;Dave: I'd just give it to him and say, "Read
this or I'll kill you."

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780
[audience laughs]

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.780
It's time he learned.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.780
&gt;&gt;Older Male: That doesn't work.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.780
[audience laughs]

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.240
&gt;&gt;Dave: No, I know. You know what does? I
tell ya. I believe in parenting by embarrassing.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.279
[audience laughs]

00:40:23.279 --> 00:40:28.710
I, and I-I-I-I've said this for a long time
that the mistake that we make, I, I have two

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:33.369
kids. This is the mistake you make as a parent,
is you try to get their love and respect,

00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:36.430
and that works great until they reach the
age of 12 or 13 months.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.009
[audience laughs]

00:40:39.009 --> 00:40:41.452
The sooner they start to tal, they start to
figure out you're a dork. And by the, by the

00:40:41.452 --> 00:40:45.089
time they're 16, you know, they, you're, they
don't want to be, really they don't want anything

00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:49.680
to do with you. However, you develop, you,
at the same time, an incredible power of embarrassment

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.769
over them; it's very strong. And most parents,
its parents are reluctant to use it. They

00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:56.359
think it's bad when they embarrass their children
but it's actually a very effective control

00:40:56.359 --> 00:41:02.119
technique. If you're in a public place with
it, a, an adolescent child, is giving you

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:04.869
any trouble, just don't say, "You're gonna
be grounded", or something like that, so.

00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:05.869
They ask you

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:06.869
[sings]

00:41:06.869 --> 00:41:07.869
Well, I was just walkin' down the...

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:08.869
[talks]

00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:09.869
Sing! sing!

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:14.729
Boy that will stop them, whatever they're
doing. If you will stop singing, they will

00:41:14.729 --> 00:41:15.790
do anything you want.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.790
[audience laughs]

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:24.099
Alright, they will, try that, try the..when
I found this out, my, my son, Rob, he's now;

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:30.390
he's now 29-years old so I can't really do
these things. But when I learned the power

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:34.390
of embarrassment, how really strong it was.
He was 13. He was in middle school and I got

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:38.510
a call at the Miami Herald from the Oscar
Meyer Corporation saying they were bringing

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.720
the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile to Miami. The
Weinermobile, I'm sure you've seen it, it's

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.969
a giant fiberglass hot dog in a bun with a
loudspeaker, this is sound but of course the

00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:52.109
Weinermobile has been here. Everybody comes
to go.. and it, there are actually six Weinermobiles.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:55.359
I don't know if you knew that. We, this nation
leads the world--

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:56.359
[audience laughs]

00:41:56.359 --> 00:42:04.150
in Weinermobile technology. Although, Iran
is developing one. But anyway, they like to

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.619
get publicity for the Weinermobile so they
call me up at the Miami Herald and say, "We're

00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:12.579
bringing the Weinermobile to Miami. Would
you like to drive it for a day?" And I said,

00:42:12.579 --> 00:42:13.579
"Heck yes."

00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:14.579
[audience chuckles]

00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:17.270
I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted
to pick my son up in middle school.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.510
[audience laughs]

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.630
Because there he is in peer pressure hell,
you don't know. Never forget the moment Rob

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.279
came out of the, of the school, and there's
all these moms in their minivans and looming

00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:31.010
up behind is a really big hot dog--

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.010
[audience laughs]

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.859
with a loudspeaker going, "Rob Barry, please
report to the Weinermobile."

00:42:34.859 --> 00:42:35.859
[audience laughs]

00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:41.130
I'll tell you, if a 13-year old could suffer
a heart attack, he would have. And I know

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:44.920
what you're thinking, at the end of the day
it was fun for you, but you scarred your child

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:49.349
psychologically for life. Yes, but it was
worth it.

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:50.349
[audience laughs]

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:54.049
Maybe you can get the Weinermobile.

00:42:54.049 --> 00:42:55.049
Yes?

00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:56.989
&gt;&gt;Male in Glasses: So, this was alluded to
in the introduction but will you be running

00:42:56.989 --> 00:43:03.219
again in 2012 and do you have anything in
your platform other than the low-flush toilets?

00:43:03.219 --> 00:43:07.240
&gt;&gt;Dave: I, I'm always running in the sense
of accepting contributions.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.219
[audience laughs]

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:14.650
I'm not that active a campaigner. Well I think,
I, I, I think I probably will run. I think

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:19.809
I'll be more aiming at the healthcare situation
this time around. My big, I think they missed

00:43:19.809 --> 00:43:25.809
the, a major opportunity to help the American
public, particularly the one sector in the

00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:30.400
American public. I read with this recent Healthcare
bill, I really don't care what else we do

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.819
about healthcare in this country, but we need
to find a way for the medical profession to

00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:37.340
get to the prostate gland other than the way
they're getting to it now.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.340
[audience laughs]

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:42.059
I'll tell you, what I think we should have;
we need a procedure where the doctor stands

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:45.079
about 80 yards away and goes, "Looks good
from here, Dave."

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:46.079
[audience laughs]

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:49.349
That would be the cornerstone of my candidacy.

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:50.609
[clears throat]

00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:51.609
Yes?

00:43:51.609 --> 00:43:58.690
&gt;&gt;Male in Plaid: Do you find yourself doing
less self-censorship of the subject matter

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:05.319
that you write about since you moved to the
digital world from newspapers?

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:12.239
&gt;&gt;Dave: Definitely, you can, you can, that
was the most limiting, was writing for newspapers.

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:15.549
My column ran a whole lot of newspapers and
every one of them had an editor and every

00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:19.309
one of those editors could cut whatever he
or she wanted to. Some of them very carefully

00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:22.960
went through them and cut out all the funny
parts no matter what I wrote about or left

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.759
just the set-ups and took away all the punch
lines.

00:44:24.759 --> 00:44:26.170
[audience laughs]

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.660
I once wrote a column that the, the joke of
the column was that I had not bothered to

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:36.239
do any research, so I would write like, "As
the old saying goes, a man without woman is

00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:41.210
like a tractor without a (editor, please put
important tractor part here)." And it ran

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.321
that way in most newspapers except for one
paper where the editor went through and looked

00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:46.289
up the important tractor parts. Uuug!

00:44:46.289 --> 00:44:47.799
[audience laughs]

00:44:47.799 --> 00:44:52.469
I got all this mail from the readers saying,
"Boy, that column didn't seem that funny,

00:44:52.469 --> 00:44:53.469
Dave."

00:44:53.469 --> 00:44:55.469
[audience laughs]

00:44:55.469 --> 00:45:01.789
So, but I, I think yeah, you can be much,
much looser on the Internet and, and in books.

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:08.930
Although, I don't know, I-I, I'm not really
famous for being really rough, raw in humor

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:12.589
except for with my friends and I really have
so few of those.

00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:14.650
[audience laughs]

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:21.720
Anyway, anymore? I'm really not sure what
the timing is supposed to be. Yes?

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.319
&gt;&gt;Woman #1: Hi, I was just wondering if you
could speak a little bit about how you got

00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:27.319
your start in comedy writing.

00:45:27.319 --> 00:45:28.319
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah.

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:29.319
&gt;&gt;Woman #1: And maybe what's helped you to
be so successful.

00:45:29.319 --> 00:45:32.250
&gt;&gt;Dave: I, I went, I went, when I got out
of college as an English major, so I, when

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:36.940
I got out of college, I went to Haverford
College in Pennsylvania and I got out with

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.589
no useful skills whatsoever. I mean, unless
you counted being able to name metaphysical

00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:45.700
poets or something. But you never saw an ad
that said, "We're looking for people who can

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:52.440
name metaphysical poets." And there were,
so I, I, went to work for a newspaper called

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.579
the Daily Local News in Westchester, Pennsylvania,
and that was actually the name, "Daily Local

00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:59.700
News", sounds like the newspaper SuperBoy
delivered.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:05.219
And it was, it was one of those, it was a
very small-town paper, like small-time news.

00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:09.800
Like if somebody were to grow a, a zucchini
that looked, that had, looked like Dwight

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.790
Eisenhower or something we'd take a picture
of it and put it on the front page. That was

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:18.579
big news at the Daily Local. We actually,
we had a front page, it's not the best edited

00:46:18.579 --> 00:46:24.030
newspaper in the world, we had a front page
story with the headline once, "Women Beats

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.049
Off Would-be Rapist."

00:46:25.049 --> 00:46:27.829
[audience laughs]

00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:34.979
So anyway, but it was really good training
for me. I, I, I covered everything. I wrote

00:46:34.979 --> 00:46:40.279
obituaries, I went to school board meetings,
and I went to all these, and, but, while I,

00:46:40.279 --> 00:46:44.420
while I did that, once a week I would write
a column, a little column because it was a

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.489
little paper. You could write and do whatever
you want. And I had written some col-, some

00:46:47.489 --> 00:46:51.839
humor columns in high school and college but
this was actually in a real newspaper and

00:46:51.839 --> 00:46:55.529
I liked it. I would write a column and it
would run once a week. They weren't paying

00:46:55.529 --> 00:46:58.869
me to do it but that's what I did.
When I left there to do other things, for

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:04.259
awhile I, I was teaching Effective Writing
seminars to businesspeople, which was a weird

00:47:04.259 --> 00:47:07.830
job but it was, it was good for me. It got
me around the country but I kept writing my

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.519
column for the Daily Local News in Westchester,
Pennsylvania, and they were paying me 22 dollars

00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:15.770
a week to do that. So I was, I was in my 30s
at this point so I clearly, I didn't think

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:21.990
of this as a career option, just write this
little column. And then my son was born and

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:26.921
I wrote an essay about natural childbirth
that ran in the Philadelphia Inquirer. And

00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:33.829
basically, it was a, a, I, the perfect time
for this because I'm a baby boomer and the

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:37.140
baby boomers do everything together and they
always think they're the only ones who ever

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:41.320
did it. And at this point we were having babies
and it never occurred to us that previous

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.819
generations might have done that also.

00:47:42.819 --> 00:47:43.839
[audience laughs]

00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:48.000
It was a big deal; we had babies. And we,
of course, because we were the baby boomers,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.719
we had to think of a special way to have babies.
It was called "natural childbirth" [inaudible]

00:47:52.719 --> 00:47:59.099
the idea was that instead of, like when my
mother had me the system was they gave the

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:02.569
mother drugs, a lot of drugs, and she woke
up when you like, in the fourth grade.

00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:03.569
[audience laughs]

00:48:03.569 --> 00:48:10.810
And it was a damned good system. Everybody,
you know, but then by the time we came along

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:15.390
we had to have a better system and our system
was you wouldn't need drugs because you practiced

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:19.319
these relaxation techniques and breathe in
a certain way. And we went to these classes

00:48:19.319 --> 00:48:23.810
where you breathe and practice and breathe.
And it was, well, when we actually got into

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:28.359
the childbirth part where the baby coming
out part, don't try and tell a woman in that

00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:32.719
situation to just breathe a certain way. Be
glad she doesn't have a revolver if you do

00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:37.170
because basically they're just screaming for
drugs at that point. And so the-there, it

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.450
was a, I remember sitting there in the room
listening to not only my wife but all these

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.630
other women, you know, I have , all going,
"Aaaaaaahhhhh!!", which was not what they

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.630
had, you know.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:51.549
So I wrote an essay about the difference between
the, the childbirth classes and the actual

00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:55.109
childbirth. And it ran in the Philadelphia
Inquirer Sunday magazine and it was the first

00:48:55.109 --> 00:49:01.569
big sale I ever had as a sense-of-humor piece.
And it did really, really well. Everybody,

00:49:01.569 --> 00:49:06.410
all these people my age, all the editors at
all the newspapers were my age, everybody's

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:11.069
going through the same thing, they all thought
it was great. I, I, a couple days after that

00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:15.849
ran, I got a call at home from the editor
at the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine, saying,

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:17.610
"I read the piece on natural childbirth and
I want to reprint it in my magazine." And

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.999
I thought, "Wow, that's pretty cool."

00:49:20.999 --> 00:49:24.849
Now, I had gotten paid 350 dollars, which
is the most I had ever been paid for writing

00:49:24.849 --> 00:49:29.849
something, for that piece. And he says, "How
much do you want for it?" And I think, "Well,

00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:33.609
I already got the 350", so I said, "Well,
how about 50 dollars?"

00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:34.950
[audience laughs]

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.079
And there's this pause, and he goes, "How
about 500 dollars?"

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.079
[audience laughs]

00:49:39.079 --> 00:49:40.549
So I said, "Ok."

00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:41.549
[audience laughs]

00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:48.579
If I'd have been smart, I'd have gone down
to 25 and, and he'd, you know.

00:49:48.579 --> 00:49:49.579
[audience laughs]

00:49:49.579 --> 00:49:52.140
He'd have probably gone to one thousand but
I took the, I took the 500. But anyway, that

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:57.599
was my st- break in two ways. One is that
suddenly more, and after that a whole lot

00:49:57.599 --> 00:50:00.829
of other newspapers wanted to print that.
But also I discovered that, this wonderful

00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:04.589
thing that you could write something and make
more than 22 dollars for it.

00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:09.829
That, that really was how I, I, I, I think
I was just lucky in several ways. I was lucky

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:14.670
because I was in this giant, massive humanity
all going through the same experiences and

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:21.150
I was lucky that I came along when newspapers
were strong and successful and they had magazines,

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:24.200
which they don't have any more. Most of my
career would not be possible now, I don't

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.230
think. You'd have to; you'd have to go some
other way to, to make it as a writer now.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.230
That's, I don't even remember what you're
question was.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.230
[audience laughs]

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.240
I'll stop talking now before I get to--

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:37.400
&gt;&gt;Gopi: You will probably have time for two
questions. We'll take the last one from the

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.030
floor and we've trained our computers to ask
you some questions.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:42.140
&gt;&gt;Dave: Let me ask you, does he just always
have a microphone on when he walks around--

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.150
&gt;&gt;Gopi: This is all, we're all wired. The
whole company is this way.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.150
[Dave laughs]

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.529
&gt;&gt;Dave: That would be so great, yeah?

00:50:47.529 --> 00:50:49.880
&gt;&gt;Blueshirt Man: Dave, who makes you laugh?

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:56.089
&gt;&gt;Dave: Now, a lot of, ok, I'll name a human,
Roy Blount, Jr., who is in my band and is

00:50:56.089 --> 00:51:01.809
the funniest person I know. I just say it
because I just spent a week with him, but

00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:05.959
what really, where I think the really great
humor writing is now is on television. Shows

00:51:05.959 --> 00:51:13.479
like Glee, and The Office, and Parks and Recreation,
and Community. There are all these really

00:51:13.479 --> 00:51:19.770
well-written, 30-Rock, really well-written
sitcoms; much better than they used to be.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.559
There, there was all this talk about the Golden
Age of Comedy and there was, you know M.A.S.H.

00:51:23.559 --> 00:51:27.979
and all that and All in the Family. This is
way, way more golden. Where we are right now

00:51:27.979 --> 00:51:32.960
is fabulous. I don't know who they are though.
I, I guess I know the South Park guys, who

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.779
they are but most of them you don't know who
they are. But the shows are really, really

00:51:36.779 --> 00:51:41.650
terrifically funny so I have to say I get
more laughs now, like I'm more reliably amused

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:46.160
now by watching television than I am by reading
most things now. And I think that's kind of

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.890
what happened because people are always saying,
"Where are the humor columnists of tomorrow?"

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:54.150
And I says, "There is no humor column for
them to write. The newspapers are disappearing."

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.390
Thanks to you guys, no.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.990
[audience laughs]

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:03.440
I don't really blame Google for that. I think
it's just, we are the, w-w-w-we're the perfect,

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.739
where the newspaper industry is, is a perfect
example of why you should never allow an industry

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:08.900
to be run by English majors.

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.200
[audience laughs]

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:17.319
We could have handled it all differently,
I think. But, but that's, that's where I think

00:52:17.319 --> 00:52:21.569
they're going. That's where I think smart,
funny writers go now. And it's too bad because

00:52:21.569 --> 00:52:24.170
you don't know who they are; at least I don't
know who they are. But I think they're really

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.559
good, whoever they are.

00:52:27.559 --> 00:52:29.230
Yeah? I surprised you--

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:30.230
&gt;&gt;Gopi: We can take one more from--

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.420
&gt;&gt;Dave: Yeah, I'm just going to answer the
ones that people go like, yes, no? No.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.420
[audience laughs]

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.420
Ok.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.420
[more laughter]

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.290
&gt;&gt;Gopi: We're done then. Thank you so much
for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, Dave

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:40.290
Barry.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.290
[round of applause]

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.290
&gt;&gt;Dave: Thank you so much.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.293
