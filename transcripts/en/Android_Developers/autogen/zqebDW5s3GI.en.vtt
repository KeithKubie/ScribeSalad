tell this from looking at the graphics I
 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.150
tell this from looking at the graphics I
run through the game but they've

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.160

unfiltered for the most part so you'll

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840
unfiltered for the most part so you'll
 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.930
unfiltered for the most part so you'll
see that the graphics look kind of look

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:55.940
see that the graphics look kind of look
 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.370

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.910
instead of looking blurry they look
intentionally blocky and that was really

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:00.920
intentionally blocky and that was really
 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.000
intentionally blocky and that was really
nice a nice patch by them and back of

impressed by that I didn't expect

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:06.470
impressed by that I didn't expect
 

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.200

something like that I'm out of an

something like that I'm out of an
 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.790
something like that I'm out of an
android game but maybe I we just had

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800
android game but maybe I we just had
 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.010

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.700
as clearly but yeah they've done it's
really it's really beautifully done

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:18.710
really it's really beautifully done
 

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.110
really it's really beautifully done
they've also done a very good job of

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120
they've also done a very good job of
 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.270
they've also done a very good job of
integrating most of the Android features

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280
integrating most of the Android features
 

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.500
integrating most of the Android features
the FF probably the only really

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.510
the FF probably the only really
 

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.900
the FF probably the only really
confusing thing is again the old-school

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:25.910
confusing thing is again the old-school
 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.920
confusing thing is again the old-school
elements of the game which you

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:26.930
elements of the game which you
 

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.420
elements of the game which you
definitely have to get used to if you

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.430
definitely have to get used to if you
 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.370
definitely have to get used to if you
haven't played this sort of game in a

haven't played this sort of game in a
 

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.780
haven't played this sort of game in a
while we have for some of our younger

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:31.790
while we have for some of our younger
 

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.279

that we're done they're done well one of
 

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.040

things I really enjoy is that even

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.050
things I really enjoy is that even
 

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.720
things I really enjoy is that even
though the game has old-school

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:46.730

unfiltered graphics if you look at the

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200
unfiltered graphics if you look at the
 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.080
unfiltered graphics if you look at the
font you can see the font is rendered at

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.090
font you can see the font is rendered at
 

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.020

full resolution independently of the

full resolution independently of the
 

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.590
full resolution independently of the
game and that makes the game feel so

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:56.600
game and that makes the game feel so
 

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.850

of interesting about this you know one
 

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.980
of interesting about this you know one
is this is that we hit the back key we

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:26.990
is this is that we hit the back key we
 

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.980
is this is that we hit the back key we
get close application okay first of all

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:29.990
get close application okay first of all
 

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:31.600
get close application okay first of all
it's a little jarring because we

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.610
it's a little jarring because we
 

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.430
it's a little jarring because we
actually end up getting getting a

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440
actually end up getting getting a
 

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.020
actually end up getting getting a
dialogue that is a system dialogue

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.030
dialogue that is a system dialogue
 

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.450
dialogue that is a system dialogue
rather than our own it's also a dialogue

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:37.460
rather than our own it's also a dialogue
 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.730
rather than our own it's also a dialogue
that's not a honeycomb dial not a hollow

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:39.740
that's not a honeycomb dial not a hollow
 

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.530
that's not a honeycomb dial not a hollow
style dialog so so we're

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540
style dialog so so we're
 

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.330

we're kind of thrown out of there you

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:44.340
we're kind of thrown out of there you
 

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.400
we're kind of thrown out of there you
can see we actually have at the bottom

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:46.410
can see we actually have at the bottom
 

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.990
can see we actually have at the bottom

it doesn't do anything and we also have

this on an old school device so all of
 

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.550

this could easily be corrected of course

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560
this could easily be corrected of course
 

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.710
this could easily be corrected of course
by simply targeting a more recent

by simply targeting a more recent
 

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.350

version in terms of the menu and the

version in terms of the menu and the

zoom and as far as the back key is
 

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.520
zoom and as far as the back key is
concerned in this case it really just

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:13.530
concerned in this case it really just
 

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.690
concerned in this case it really just
makes sense to go back to the main menu

makes sense to go back to the main menu
 

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.490
makes sense to go back to the main menu
since you can continue this would be a

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500
since you can continue this would be a
 

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.680
since you can continue this would be a
perfect opportunity to quick save go

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:18.690
perfect opportunity to quick save go
 

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.120
perfect opportunity to quick save go
back to the main menu would be much much

less jarring for the user now there you

less jarring for the user now there you
know there is if you quick safe within

you look at the on-screen controls here
 

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.310
you look at the on-screen controls here
you see that you have you know a

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320
you see that you have you know a
 

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.220
you see that you have you know a
constant on-screen HUD of arrow keys and

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.230
constant on-screen HUD of arrow keys and
 

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.260
constant on-screen HUD of arrow keys and
the arrow keys are actually fairly far

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:42.270
the arrow keys are actually fairly far
 

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.910
the arrow keys are actually fairly far
apart here on this tablet if you look

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920
apart here on this tablet if you look
 

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.269
apart here on this tablet if you look
here on on what is uh I believe you're

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279
here on on what is uh I believe you're
 

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.250
here on on what is uh I believe you're
are you left hand side of the screen I

guess we're seeing a mirror here so and

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:51.980
guess we're seeing a mirror here so and
 

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.680
guess we're seeing a mirror here so and
and so you'll see they're actually

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:54.690
and so you'll see they're actually
 

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.060
and so you'll see they're actually
fairly far apart and you'd actually want

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.070
fairly far apart and you'd actually want
 

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.310
fairly far apart and you'd actually want
those to be closer together on a town on

know it is a little bit jarring to have
 

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.760
know it is a little bit jarring to have
that in there in terms of it would be

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:48.770
that in there in terms of it would be
 

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.050
that in there in terms of it would be
great if they could figure out a way of

actually modifying the engine to to

just not filtering the text in this

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.330
just not filtering the text in this
 

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.150
just not filtering the text in this
particular case i think i think the

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160
particular case i think i think the
 

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.730
particular case i think i think the
filtering is actually diminishing from

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:00.740
filtering is actually diminishing from
 

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.460
filtering is actually diminishing from
the impact of of the text within the

the impact of of the text within the

about you know what about the HUD and
 

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.939
about you know what about the HUD and
just baking the game a little bit

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:12.949
just baking the game a little bit
 

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:16.480
just baking the game a little bit
cleaner in terms of being able to have

people understand the controls you know
it it once you realize that you're

random buttons and you have to kind of

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839
random buttons and you have to kind of
 

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.000
random buttons and you have to kind of
figure out what they do in different

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.010
figure out what they do in different
 

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.620
figure out what they do in different
situations and the game is consistent

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:26.630

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.130
still are a bit a bit blurry and one of
the nice thing about this game is that

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140
the nice thing about this game is that
 

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.870
the nice thing about this game is that
you'll notice actually and I should have

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880
you'll notice actually and I should have
 

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.630
you'll notice actually and I should have
mentioned that before when talking about

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640
mentioned that before when talking about
 

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.900
mentioned that before when talking about
in ocean three that you actually do see

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:07.910
in ocean three that you actually do see
 

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:14.560
in ocean three that you actually do see
artifacts due to basically filtering

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:14.570
artifacts due to basically filtering
 

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.490
artifacts due to basically filtering
where it's actually where it's actually

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500
where it's actually where it's actually

blurring stuff that's outside of the
 

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.210
blurring stuff that's outside of the
current yeah that's right the games you

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220
current yeah that's right the games you
 

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.220
current yeah that's right the games you
see like little pixels three pixels here

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.230
see like little pixels three pixels here
 

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.020
see like little pixels three pixels here
you don't see any of that in this game

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.030
you don't see any of that in this game
 

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.750
you don't see any of that in this game
and it's just it's it looks beautiful at

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760
and it's just it's it looks beautiful at
 

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.470
and it's just it's it looks beautiful at
this resolution so I don't know another

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480
this resolution so I don't know another
 

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.900
this resolution so I don't know another
thing i want to note is that this game

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:32.910
thing i want to note is that this game
 

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.580
thing i want to note is that this game
and the last game you can skip through a

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:34.590
and the last game you can skip through a
 

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.620
and the last game you can skip through a
lot of the the cutscenes so you're not a

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:36.630
lot of the the cutscenes so you're not a
 

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.110
lot of the the cutscenes so you're not a
fan of story driven games and you want

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120
fan of story driven games and you want
 

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.669
fan of story driven games and you want
to skip right to the action and

00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679
to skip right to the action and
 

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:42.020
to skip right to the action and
definitely do that in other words if you

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.030
definitely do that in other words if you
 

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.700
definitely do that in other words if you
have a short attention span missing

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:43.710
have a short attention span missing
 

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.320
have a short attention span missing
games and that's why i love these games

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:45.330

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.450
games and that's why i love these games
that's why i love them right to the

it from a gameplay perspective there was
 

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.220
it from a gameplay perspective there was
a little bit too much of i walk off the

a little bit too much of i walk off the
 

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.930
a little bit too much of i walk off the
screen and i walk back on and all like

element of this of the sort of game and
 

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.560
element of this of the sort of game and
it certainly gives you the unlimited

it certainly gives you the unlimited
 

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.590
it certainly gives you the unlimited

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600
ability to keep leveling up but i did
 

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.419

find ok I I was like really that's how I
 

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.360

have to do this but you know maybe maybe

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:17.370
have to do this but you know maybe maybe
 

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.220
have to do this but you know maybe maybe
maybe if you have someone there is this

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.230
maybe if you have someone there is this
 

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.990
maybe if you have someone there is this
plus button here but it doesn't seem to

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000
plus button here but it doesn't seem to
 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.510
plus button here but it doesn't seem to
help so there you know as I was I was

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520
help so there you know as I was I was
 

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.740
help so there you know as I was I was
really hoping for something better

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:24.750
really hoping for something better
 

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.360
really hoping for something better
within the HUD to say hey I really want

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:26.370
within the HUD to say hey I really want
 

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.710
within the HUD to say hey I really want
to use a potion because I'm almost dead

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720
to use a potion because I'm almost dead
 

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.900
to use a potion because I'm almost dead
yeah and there was no way that was those

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:29.910
yeah and there was no way that was those
 

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.600
yeah and there was no way that was those
was one of my complaints as well that if

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:32.610
was one of my complaints as well that if
 

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.700
was one of my complaints as well that if
you're in the middle of a 5 monster

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:34.710
you're in the middle of a 5 monster
 

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.289
you're in the middle of a 5 monster
fight and you want to use a potion is

00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299
fight and you want to use a potion is
 

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:38.060
fight and you want to use a potion is
kind of annoying that to go into the

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.070
kind of annoying that to go into the
 

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.840
kind of annoying that to go into the
menu screen yeah it is jarring and again

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:41.850
menu screen yeah it is jarring and again
 

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.520
menu screen yeah it is jarring and again
though you know big action button I

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:43.530
though you know big action button I
 

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.919
though you know big action button I
think it's interesting to to to look at

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:45.929
think it's interesting to to to look at
 

00:29:45.929 --> 00:29:48.049
think it's interesting to to to look at
this and compare this against me know

00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059
this and compare this against me know
 

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:50.090
this and compare this against me know
what we saw in in final fantasy 3 which

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100
what we saw in in final fantasy 3 which
 

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.180
what we saw in in final fantasy 3 which
had really really minimal displaying

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:53.190
had really really minimal displaying
 

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.720
had really really minimal displaying
controls on screen and you know this we

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:56.730
controls on screen and you know this we
 

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.700
controls on screen and you know this we
have lots and lots of stuff all over the

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:58.710
have lots and lots of stuff all over the
 

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.640
have lots and lots of stuff all over the
screen you know and it you know it

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.650
screen you know and it you know it
 

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.470
screen you know and it you know it
they're both very effective I think this

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480
they're both very effective I think this
 

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.870
they're both very effective I think this
in some ways is more intuitive but I

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880
in some ways is more intuitive but I
 

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.700
in some ways is more intuitive but I
really like the minimalist approach and

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:07.710
really like the minimalist approach and
 

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.049
really like the minimalist approach and
once you've actually played the game for

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059
once you've actually played the game for
 

00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:10.669
once you've actually played the game for
just a few minutes you do figure out

00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679
just a few minutes you do figure out
 

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:13.250
just a few minutes you do figure out
fairly quickly well its many buttons on

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260
fairly quickly well its many buttons on
 

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.260
fairly quickly well its many buttons on
the screen I know you know you know it

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:15.270
the screen I know you know you know it
 

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.270
the screen I know you know you know it
is somewhat intuitive buns on the screen

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:17.280
is somewhat intuitive buns on the screen
 

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.169
is somewhat intuitive buns on the screen
it's like when you have this many

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179
it's like when you have this many
 

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:19.580
it's like when you have this many
buttons i just started starts to get

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:19.590
buttons i just started starts to get
 

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.590
buttons i just started starts to get
tricky what you're actually doing so

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600
tricky what you're actually doing so
 

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.980
tricky what you're actually doing so
i've had a question for you Dan first

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:23.990
i've had a question for you Dan first
 

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.750
i've had a question for you Dan first
based on some things that we're seeing

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760
based on some things that we're seeing
 

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.539
based on some things that we're seeing
on the YouTube live stream yes I how are

00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:29.549
on the YouTube live stream yes I how are
 

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:31.060
on the YouTube live stream yes I how are
the controls on this can

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:31.070
the controls on this can
 

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.350
the controls on this can
heard too inotia I I think they're

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360
heard too inotia I I think they're
 

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.090
heard too inotia I I think they're
they're a little easier the controls are

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.100
they're a little easier the controls are
 

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.159
they're a little easier the controls are
a little closer together so I find it's

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:39.169
a little closer together so I find it's
 

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:40.389
a little closer together so I find it's
a little easier on a tablet they still

00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399
a little easier on a tablet they still
 

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.100
a little easier on a tablet they still
have the same basic problem though that

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.110
have the same basic problem though that
 

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.659
have the same basic problem though that
they aren't scaling the signs of the

00:30:43.659 --> 00:30:43.669
they aren't scaling the signs of the
 

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:47.350
they aren't scaling the signs of the
d-pad for the tablet which I like they

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360
d-pad for the tablet which I like they
 

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.110
d-pad for the tablet which I like they
really should be scaling that and would

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120
really should be scaling that and would
 

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.490
really should be scaling that and would
you like to explain to our developers

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:51.500
you like to explain to our developers
 

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.310
you like to explain to our developers
the best way to do that sure so what

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320
the best way to do that sure so what
 

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.860
the best way to do that sure so what
we're talking about here is this device

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:56.870
we're talking about here is this device
 

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.980
we're talking about here is this device
is a large screen device which has a

00:30:59.980 --> 00:30:59.990
is a large screen device which has a
 

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.659
is a large screen device which has a
screen resolution of any DPI sorry I

00:31:04.659 --> 00:31:04.669
screen resolution of any DPI sorry I
 

00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:08.649
screen resolution of any DPI sorry I
between yeah density of what we call

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:08.659
between yeah density of what we call
 

00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:12.340
between yeah density of what we call
mdpi which is about 150 pixels per inch

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.350
mdpi which is about 150 pixels per inch
 

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.529
mdpi which is about 150 pixels per inch
and so we were trying to do when

00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:14.539
and so we were trying to do when
 

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.570
and so we were trying to do when
wherever we decide one of these controls

we're actually looking to size them
 

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:21.490
we're actually looking to size them
based approximately on the size of your

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:21.500

it really is a good compromise between
 

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.909
it really is a good compromise between
form and function it works very it works

00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919

small and they wanted to differentiate

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.250
small and they wanted to differentiate
 

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.580
small and they wanted to differentiate
them very very easily and if they

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:41.590
them very very easily and if they
 

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.200
them very very easily and if they
actually tried to make them look more

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:43.210

facial features and so it became easier
 

00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:50.970
facial features and so it became easier
in these games to differentiate them by

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:50.980
in these games to differentiate them by
 

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.860
in these games to differentiate them by
