Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich webs. Oh my, let's talk. Yeah, do it. Oh, I'm Molly Webster. Yeah. Just graduated and party, join the party. And uh, today we have a, I don't know, we have a birth story. We're calling this birth story because that's what it is. We're going to tell you about babies who were very recently born and who one day will turn to their parents and say to them, tell me how I got here. Like what's, what's, what's my story? What's my story? And the parents in this case will say, well that's complicated. That's, yeah. This is one where the kids will hear what we're, you're about to hear. And they'll go, really, it's a collaboration with a team of reporters in Israel called Israel story. They, a group of folks who do sort of long form reporting and storytelling. They'd been doing it in Hebrew for three years and they are in the middle of their first English language season right now, which we're going to be in. Exactly. And uh, this is a two producers that we worked with in particular, Maya Kosovar. And you'll high Mattel and a, this story begins with Maya. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06          It was party. We were all dancing Israeli music in the middle of Jaffa. Mr Birthday. They were at her apartment and it's guy tall. How was dancing with his partner? These are friends of yours. Yeah. Tallies. Kind of mega star in the deaf community in Israel because he translates the news in the TV to deaf people to sign language. Oh well so he's like the little guy in the corner of the TV. Yeah. And his partner, a man Amir or a meal with an r is a psychologist that works specially with children that are autistic. Huh. Anyway, they're at the party. So we were dancing all together and then a pal was, oh my God, maybe it's going to be the list party that I'm in because I'm going to be a parent and not only a parent, I'm going to be a father for three.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And then we were like, oh my God, three babies, how's that going to happen?

Speaker 2:          02:05          And it turns out how that was going to happen is a crazy story involving a four countries, women, two guys. And three babies as we mentioned. And planes, jet planes, two of them, hundreds of thousands of the, at least four.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Yes. So yes, all that. But we should, we should go back a bit to the beginning. The first

Speaker 3:          02:27          speaking of that I started in [inaudible] is, Eh, is his ability to be a father. This is a mirror.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Really? Yeah. How so?

Speaker 3:          02:35          Because a, it was a good man, you know, he was very, uh, gentle, a little bit and really an adults, eh, to be in the family. I don't know how to describe it though.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Thanks. Did you see that like on first meeting or was this like four months in

Speaker 3:          02:57          my career is established work with the district people and to take notice for every sign though of communication and a, and to understand that the people and to analyze them. So it was really immediate. They said, let's say after two or three times you say, okay, Eh, I want children. So yeah. Are you interesting? I wrote a manifesto about my future. What I want to do, what I want to do in my career. It's kind of my vision and I gave it to him and I said this and this is what I want. A sign at the bottom, please. Yeah, that was a contract. It's like this is what I want. If you want to join me, Eh, so let's do it. So let's do it and tell. What was your reaction to the, to the manifesto? I like it. It's look like someone who want a future. It's your own parents. Have any either of your parents have any views about that saying don't do or that's weird. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Suffice to say their families did not approve, especially when it came to the idea of them having kids. Now how to have those kids. That is a question. Basically there, there are two options. If you're a gay couple and you want to have, there used to be three options. That's you Chi. My towel from Israel story here is how he and Maya laid it out for us. Option number one, which is now not as much of an option. You could adopt a kid from a third world country, but he says over the last few years what happened is that those third world countries figured out who was adopting their babies and one by one they banned it for gay couples. The second option, which is becoming very, very popular in Israel is sort of the new family. That's what it's called in Hebrew at least sort of getting together with another woman who wants to be a mother but doesn't have a father and then they do a joint parenthood. They all live in the same house? No, the mother lives separately and it's kind of like divorced parents that get along really well. They sign a contract before the process and everything is like in the contract telling them your said that early on they tried this route,

Speaker 3:          05:09          eh? [inaudible] from one of his friend to do the coparenting, but then I spoke with Talend, ask him, listen, it's very important for me to have a baby of my own and with my sperm. And I said to [inaudible] I want to try, but I don't care if in the end we have only one baby in your sperm, so it will be my baby the same. I think I was more stubborn about it. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:37          Amir couldn't really explain why it was so important to him, just that it was important to him. But reflecting on it later, my, uh, from Israel's story, put it this way,

Speaker 4:          05:45          it's very Jewish and Israeli. I mean, if you're not in the Israeli mainstream, if you are gay or if you are different and you'll have your own baby, it's like a, of being

Speaker 3:          05:58          part of the game, you know,

Speaker 2:          06:00          whatever the reasons. A Amir and tall, talked it over and then they went back to this woman tells Fran who had offered to do the coparenting

Speaker 3:          06:06          and we asked her if she can obligate to us to bring two children, one of of thous berms and one of my own.

Speaker 2:          06:14          In the end she said no. And at this point a year had gone by.

Speaker 3:          06:18          Well. So then we've decided that maybe the best option will be option three is, is surrogacy

Speaker 5:          06:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:29          meeting. Of course, if you're a gay man that you take your sperm, take some eggs from a woman, put your sperm and those eggs into the womb of a second woman

Speaker 6:          06:37          who carries the baby to term. But surrogacy is illegal in Israel only for gay couples. Yeah. In Israel, if you're a Hetero couple, you can use an Israeli woman as a surrogate. But if you're gay you can't. So there's a big problem. But that problem also creates a big demand, as you can imagine, are quite a lot of gay couples in Israel. And so a company's spraying up basically offering international brokering of sperm eggs and uh, ovaries,

Speaker 2:          07:06          babies outsourcing

Speaker 7:          07:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:10          Harlem. And they don't meet the Moose. You can see this play out every year at these conferences in Israel conferences where they'd get prospective parents together. We are here for our first time in Tel Aviv, so it's this big room of people, several hundred people, Pretty Michelle Gay men. Pardon me, for not being able to speak Hebrew very well or at all Shalom. Basically what happened to these conferences is that surrogacy agencies will get up and basically sell their products. We now offer surrogacy in Mexico, Thailand, Anima, the United States, India. Anybody been to fort worth? Very nice place. You can go see a basketball game and go see a baseball game.

Speaker 2:          07:44          These agencies will find women in all of these places who will serve as the surrogate for your child and depending on which country you choose and whether or not you provide the donor eggs or they do, or a million other factors, the costs will vary.

Speaker 3:          07:58          We offer very, uh, competitive prices. For example, $36,000 complete start to finish in Mexico. 38,000 in Thailand,

Speaker 7:          08:07          anywhere from 65,000 to 85,000, 150,000. It could be that much.

Speaker 3:          08:13          That's excluding the donor of course. But we have a good selection of donors including uh, Jewish donors as well. Yeah. The have session with the lawyers. You have session with families, you have sessions with doctors telling them your went to two of these conferences, success of years and coming back from the second one we take a calculator and you start how we can make it raising money. Money, money. Yeah. They figure if they go with a company that does surrogacy in the u s it's probably going to cost $150,000 or is that lawyers and lawyers, the hospital, the spare delivery, uh, the egg donor, uh, there is a lot of people that we need to pay

Speaker 2:          08:53          and he says, keep in mind when you pay that money, you are not guaranteed a baby. You'll buy a process. Yeah. We don't buy a baby. One of our friends did this kind of process and they spend five times and they still didn't succeed five times. Yeah. They figured with that kind of risk do we get in the u s was just too expensive and so they started looking at surrogacy agencies which operate in India, in Nepal because over there you can do the same thing and it will cost you about $60,000 so it's almost half price, almost a half price. Yeah. Now one of the tricky things according to get high is that in 2013 India basically outlawed surrogacy for gay couples. I mean you, if you're a straight couple you can do surrogacy in India, but not if you're gay. Also in a part by the way in Nepal also outlawed surrogacy effectively that Kevin had said, if you are a Nepali woman, you cannot be a surrogate period, but there's sort of a loophole. Indian women are allowed to be surrogates in the pilot. Just Nepali women aren't allowed to be surrogates in Nepal. So what ends up happening is it's really strange situation. It looks like it puzzle. These agents in northern India will find Indian woman move them across the border into Nepal. I'll take them all the way to Kathmandu where the surrogacy agencies have set up shelter houses and work with local hospitals and clinics.

Speaker 2:          10:13          My assessed for talent, Amir, the decision to do it this way was not easy. They had like different opinions that had the bigger issue with the more rural concept of this process. Amelia was like, this is the thing that we need to do. I want to be a father. But Pal was, it was very hard for him.

Speaker 8:          10:35          I thought the, if it's, it's a moral to do things like that

Speaker 9:          10:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          10:41          to use and other woman to give me a presence like that and, and I know she will never will see this baby anymore.

Speaker 2:          10:52          Is it a moral, because you're essentially like just using a woman's body or

Speaker 8:          10:58          eh, yeah. Yeah. You can say

Speaker 2:          11:01          he felt like he's using other people bad luck for his own good. Yeah. She has no choice. She's not doing it out of freedom. She's just doing it for the money and maybe it's not morally okay that will use this weakness telling me or went back and forth on this for months. And eventually the argument that won the day was this did, if they're going to do it, they're going to do it with this agency called Lotus, which to their understanding paid the surrogate's $12,000. I mean, the surrogates were actually paid in Indian rupees, but that would be the dollar equivalent. $12,000. Now for a rural woman in India, that is a massive sum of money. They figured this won't just help her survive, it will change her life. She'll be changing their life and they'll be changing hers. Maybe this,

Speaker 8:          11:54          um, kind of like comfort. Yeah. They get money. They can change their life. They can buy a house, they can send the her children to school, Eh, to learn in the university. When I felt and understand it's, would it be a life changer? And the, it's not exploiting it. It's bloating are so I agree.

Speaker 10:         12:21          Mm.

Speaker 2:          12:21          At the start of the whole process, one of the main issue was to peak the egg donor and like who are these women? Like where do they come from? Ukraine. They're from the Ukraine. They're all Ukrainian. What is that? That is not a country I expected to be thrown into the mix of countries. The reason the eggs are from eastern Europe are generally because was a no white because they're white, so it's like cheap white eggs. She pointed eggs. That's quite a phrase. So you have like a website and you see a lot of pictures of women and then you need to choose the most Eh, like JD? Yeah. Jewish online dating service. Yeah. I think it was the most straighty ish act that I did in a very long time. Oh, straightest nice. You're picking out a lady's? Yeah. Yeah. How did you decide which criteria you wanted an a donor mom. Oh, the first one was high. You wanted someone tall? Yeah. Why? Why was height your first one? Because it's smart. Easy to lose it. Yeah. When your height. Yeah. Okay. Then eyes. She has the speak eyes. They showed my a picture light brown here and she has this nice nose. If was, you know, very strange. It was very uncomfortable to choose for me. It was very uh, eh. [inaudible], Eh, genetical uh, improving. Oh. Jenica Janay eugenics. Huh?

Speaker 2:          13:54          Now since telling them your head, each one at a baby with their own sperm, they told Lotus we would like to rent two wombs, one of each sperm, and to try to use like two surrogate mothers. Lotus said, fine. That's going to run you about 50 $60,000 each pregnancy. Again, no guarantees, so telling the mirror they'd give lotus their sperm and little cups. Lotus raises the sperm, sends it to a hospital. In Nepal, the Ukrainian woman, the egg donor is flown to Nepal. Her eggs are harvested somewhere along the way to north Indian. Women are moved across the border into Nepal. Finally, the doctors at that Nepali hospital take the Israeli sperm, injected into the Ukrainian eggs, create some embryos and the implant. Those embryos in the wounds of the Indian surrogates for countries. One baby, a few months go by. They get the news that both surrogates are pregnant. The process worked. One is pregnant with three babies and

Speaker 8:          14:51          all their scent, sonograms, pictures of the surrogate's, pregnant bellies. I all the time, look on the picture of her all the ultrasound pictures all the time looking on my cell phone. In the picture it tells, says there wasn't really much he could do cause for three or four or five months, not much happened until

Speaker 11:         15:14          [inaudible] six months, six o'clock in the six o'clock in the morning. Donna from Lotto call us and the Amir was answered the phone and they hear him say, okay, they're okay. I wake up and say what? Because

Speaker 8:          15:32          it was too early, too early. How early? About eight to eight weeks. A head. Wow. The surrogate who was carrying twins had given birth. I was crying a lot. This is the surrogate caring tiles baby, which turned out to be two babies. Yeah, and were you on the plane? The same day is getting the color and day after we fly from Tel Aviv to instant bull and from Instanbul tool couple months. It was very crazy today. Then gala, this is one of tiles friends who was also in Nepal for surrogacy. Took me to the hospital and

Speaker 12:         16:15          well

Speaker 8:          16:19          I was shocked because Gilly was so tiny. Gilly was 3.8 pounds. His brother, you have all 4.8 pounds and yeah, I was very scared to touch him. He says he expected the twins sustain the hospital for a month. But the nurses were like, nope, going home tomorrow. I thought they don't ever enough time to think because I understand tomorrow I need to take them home and to be alone

Speaker 12:         16:55          and I never take care of in the babies.

Speaker 8:          17:01          So I said, I said to the nurses, teach me out to feed them. After three days I took them home. So where was the surrogate during these days? Was she at the hospital? I think she was in the hospital. Yeah, because she had the [inaudible] surgery. I was ask if she's okay and if she needs something. They said you cannot see her until she signed all the papers and then you can see her. The papers hadn't been signed. Yeah, because we need that. She's giving up all her maternal lay rights and if she doesn't want to sign this paper

Speaker 3:          17:50          we can lose the baby.

Speaker 2:          17:52          The last on this game, crazily complicated. But basically they needed Israel, India and Nepal to all recognize that they were the uncontested parents and as all legal rights and hanging in the air. We've been terrified was the recent case in Thailand, which is all over the news where the surrogate, which right after the baby was born changed her mind lake and his husband and believed this surrogate decided to try and keep the baby because she found out they were gay.

Speaker 3:          18:17          We had a little bit of an anxiety, let's say they will going to know that their baby's going to grow in the house with through that

Speaker 2:          18:27          any case tall is in Nepal with the twins. Amir is back in Tel Aviv. A couple of weeks go by and then

Speaker 3:          18:34          eh called me and said the [inaudible]. The second surrogate had given birth one baby and they after

Speaker 13:         18:44          you [inaudible] one from symbol tool Linda

Speaker 3:          18:53          and then it was very, very, very nice that we went, eh, only asked with the babies. We'll let no parents, no friends, no phone phones, no wall to build the first Eh, Eh, blocks of our relationship with the babies.

Speaker 7:          19:12          Some [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          19:17          and for the next month they lived in an apartment in Nepal, just them and their three babies.

Speaker 7:          19:27          [inaudible] learning to be dads [inaudible] being a goose and waiting for the paperwork to be done. What's the bands? So

Speaker 2:          19:41          now the paperwork incidentally is a beast because after the surrogate sign away, their rights, the babies have no nationality and then they're suddenly illegally in the country. So then the guys have to take a DNA test, send it to Israel, get it verified, then they've got to get a passport for the babies. Then several sets of visas need to be gotten and all of that means multiple trips to these Railey embassy. And it was on one of those trips that they learned something.

Speaker 3:          20:09          It was really weird because we went over there with our eight kids to get the passport and over there there was another surrogate from a different agency

Speaker 2:          20:18          in Indian woman and standing next to her was in Israeli woman who happened to speak Hindi.

Speaker 3:          20:22          And we just go, you know, out of curiosity, we eh, asked her to ask the surrogate in Hindu, eh, how much she's, Eh, she's getting for the whole process. Yeah. But the surrogate was very shy. Yes. Not Very delighted to speak about the money, which made them even more curious. So they persisted and then Eh, we discovered she gets only

Speaker 8:          20:48          3000 to use stole or something like that.

Speaker 7:          20:50          Yes.

Speaker 2:          20:55          $3,000 for the whole pregnancy. Amir was like, wait a second

Speaker 8:          20:58          in the agreement, $12,500 supposed to go to the surrogate.

Speaker 2:          21:04          That was at least his understanding. Now this was a different woman from a different agency and this was just one woman's account. But still in your narrative, you've described that you thought that the reason that this was okay to do the surrogacy is because you are using the phrase users. This will make a change in the life of the woman that was a life changing sum of money. So Maya says they walked away from that meeting wondering if they should do something in Israel, you know, call the agency at the very least. Say, hey, we heard some rumors, I'm sure they're not true, but what do you think? We started to ask question, but then literally the next day,

Speaker 7:          21:46          [inaudible] ran the scenes of death and destruction from Nepal today after a powerful earthquake that started outside Putman [inaudible] death toll is now over 5,800, nearly 14,000 [inaudible] officials

Speaker 2:          22:08          say it is the most destructive earthquake to hit Nepal in more than 80 years. The death toll would ultimately rise to somewhere between seven and 10 years. A thousand Maya says she was in New York, uh, in a meeting and she gets this voicemail from Tal

Speaker 7:          22:26          [inaudible] [inaudible] and he was shouting

Speaker 2:          22:29          in earthquake. Just happened here. We saved the babies and we got down to the street where half naked, we don't know what to do. And he's crying over there and then

Speaker 7:          22:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:43          it suddenly stopped the, he lost the connection. Mm. It was, uh, like 12 hours with no connection to them. We didn't know if they're alive or not. You know, everything was unknown. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          23:01          I don't know how baton took his cell phone and we just ran barefoot.

Speaker 2:          23:07          Mayor says they ran out of the apartment down the street, half naked, holding the babies and the phone on the way. They ran into their friend Gil, who had four babies and another couple who had two babies.

Speaker 8:          23:16          We are in this treat and we are nine babies. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          23:24          they actually shot a video on [inaudible] phone. You see tall only in shorts. I don't have to go with this with a look at a bunch of other couples holding babies and they're all literally standing on a pile of rubber as they're standing there. A guy with a badge, walks, walks

Speaker 8:          23:40          by y'all policeman. I love you all from the a American. Yes,

Speaker 3:          23:46          we are Israeli citizen. We have nine, nine babies. We need El please. We don't have food for the babies. Okay, thank you. Go from this chase very quickly to go from here. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          24:04          So they took us in to the embassy, the u s embassy or the Israeli embassy. They went to the Israeli embassy and the Israeli embassy sort of went into emergency mode, gave us a some blankets and hay put up, put out tents. And shortly after the news cameras arrived from Tal Tyler is a palace. He's like in the media and stuff because he's the, he's the sign language translator. And so he realized that he doesn't have any way of communicating back home that he's alive. So you, hi, says a towels shoved his way in front of one of the television cameras. [inaudible] my name started signing 12 hours after the earthquake. Maya says she got a call from her partner back in Tel Aviv and she said they're on the news now. Good mothering. I can see tiles speaking, sign language to his parents saying everything is okay, they are alive. Three babies are with them and they are waiting to their rescue team to come and take them. But what the camera's also captured was the scene that hadn't really been grasped yet. Cause this whole thing has been going on kind of quietly. Now you have an international earthquake. Everybody's watching the television and in the middle of the story they're like 10 Israeli babies and gay people and all this. It was more than that. Babies. Yeah. How many were there? 24 on babies. 2024

Speaker 14:         25:29          um

Speaker 2:          25:30          wow. Yes. Whoa. Because there is another agency that also, it's like all of a sudden you realize there's this pipeline of babies. Yes, I'm moving from Nepal to Israel. Yeah. [inaudible] Maya says when the images of those 24 babies splashed across Israeli TV screens was like the first time that this other Augustine was eh, discussed in the Israeli media such way. She says, a huge debate broke out. One side of the argument was, okay, we are using women and it's Eh, it's unmoral. And from the other hand there was like, okay, in Israel for gay couples, they don't have a lot of choices. I mean, and everyone was asking, what do we do with all these babies and the surrogates? There was like a huge argument in the Israeli media about the questions of there are women that are waiting to give birth and we need to bring them to Israel to, to give birth here cause the fathers are here. So they would fly the women to Israel, have the baby and then fly them back. Yes, they was talking about it. Yeah. They talked about it. But I don't know. I think the [inaudible] they could not do that because that just, it feels like kidnapping a lady. Yeah. And so what happened was that very quickly

Speaker 6:          26:44          Israel sent over a search and rescue and medical aid delegation in all the babies and their parents. They were basically just all put on a plane and sort of the process was expedited and they just brought everybody over to Israel.

Speaker 7:          27:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         27:01          back in Israel, a parade of newborns. It will celebrate together knowing the medical stress they've been through. I'm very much aware of that. Many in Nepal are still going through it. So what happened to the surrogates? Any idea

Speaker 2:          27:14          they checked with the agency, what is the situation with the surrogate mothers? And the answer was that two of them are becking in the already and the warn there in the earthquake. And what about all the surrogates who are in the Pol but hadn't given birth yet? Yeah, I mean about them. There's a big question. I mean no one knows there were like a worried fathers in Israel.

Speaker 15:         27:36          It's terrifying. All my thoughts, all my prayers are for the surrogate mother and for the unborn child

Speaker 1:          27:43          telling him your made it back to Israel with their babies. They were fine. But there was still a lot of questions and if I were one of you guys, I would still be wondering after all these, both of these women gave you as you point out, a remarkable gift. Both of you believe that you hope rather both of you hope that that gift was well rewarded and it was life changing. But both of you don't know at this point you're just a little suspicious that maybe it wasn't. And don't you have this funny feeling that you need to find out whether they got paid what you thought you'd paid them?

Speaker 6:          28:18          Yes. Like, this is why we're so glad that we made the connection with you guys and we heard that you can,

Speaker 1:          28:25          hey, hi. And then maybe, yeah, so

Speaker 16:         28:28          yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:31          we started a kind of a whole new leg of the story.

Speaker 17:         28:34          Hello? Hello. Hi Molly. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Woo. I hear some other things too. Oh, what'd you, yeah. Actually it might just be static on the line, but it kind of sounded like the ocean. I'd just switch up the fan. Just give me a second.

Speaker 2:          28:48          A producer, Molly Webster was able to track down a reporter in India, Nilanjan a BOMAC and she asked her if she could find those surrogates.

Speaker 17:         28:55          Okay, so you had given me a name, right? Lotus, Lotus. Lotus has got a prison that in Nepal. I actually call that person in Nepal and they did tell me in the location of the clinic part, I spoke to the doctor and she said that yes, I will put you in touch with one of the surrogates. And the next morning they were supposed to touch base again, but then you know, she just totally went in, communicated. That's been the same day I opened my mail and there was a mail from Israel. You know them asking me like, just like to stop the search for some time. [inaudible] so

Speaker 2:          29:28          near them as far as we understand what happened was that the doctor contacted Lotus, Lotus contacted Talan Amir saying call off the reporters, you're putting these women's lives in danger. If someone in their village sees a reporter hanging, they'll know those women were surrogates. That's not something these circuits want people to know. Stop. Here's a, here's my understanding and you guys correct me if I'm wrong, is say we had asked someone to look for them and that person got kind of close and then word got back to the agency and that's created some pressure for us to change and you know that's really what we're sort of staring at right now is how to respond. We heard that there is a real threat on their alive because of the culture of the society that they live in. One of them was Muslim. I don't know if a, if, if the Muslim society is going to accept the fact that she carried the pregnancy to a gay couple and two squarely and to Israelis. Yeah. So that's a very, very weird, very delicate situation. Yeah. Firstly, we don't want anything that may hurt, Eh, the surrogate. Well, I mean, we want to tell this story. We definitely don't want anyone to get hurt, but I do feel like we have an ethical obligation to hear from the women who do this, if not the specific women in this case, than people who represent their experience to whatever degree it can be represented, it would be, it would feel wrong for that to be a voice that we don't hear. I don't know.

Speaker 18:         30:57          It's like, Eh,

Speaker 2:          31:00          it's for us, it's

Speaker 18:         31:01          a, yeah.

Speaker 2:          31:02          We don't want that. Anybody will contact our surrogate and if it says that it's not going to be a without the story, so let's be it because it's not worth it for us. Okay. Understood. Understood. We won't make any further attempts to contact those two, those two, uh, women. Yeah. Yeah. Just so we're all clear. I think what I'd like to do is to continue to pursue people who have been in similar situations but are not in any way connected to those two women or do you guys,

Speaker 18:         31:30          yeah. Okay. I mean

Speaker 2:          31:34          again, we need to wear only make sure that

Speaker 18:         31:37          eh,

Speaker 2:          31:40          nobody's going to be hurt. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker 7:          31:44          Okay.

Speaker 2:          31:45          That's where we left things with telling Amir and then, uh, and then the story changed a lot.

Speaker 7:          31:52          It's coming up.

Speaker 19:         32:03          Hi Radiolab. This is Sally calling from Melbourne Australia. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 2:          32:19          from WM YC studios comes the untold story of one of the most aspirational

Speaker 20:         32:25          and delusional teams in sports history. We knew that we can beat anybody in the world. I'm doing everything I should be doing and it's still not working. So what do you guys, you guys can

Speaker 2:          32:37          play about it. You guys are the ones that fricking caused this whole

Speaker 21:         32:40          American fiasco. One team's insane journey to the 1998 World Cup hosted by me. Roger Bennett had men in Blazers available wherever you get your podcasts,

Speaker 1:          32:52          a bad world cuff is better than their workup. You Bet your ass. Okay. I'm Jen Abu Rod. I'm Robert Krulwich and Molly Webster. This is radio lab and we will return now to our collaboration with Israel. Story producer is Maya Kosovar and you. Hi, my tau a, the story of telomere and their three babies. Now, that's how it started for us. It was a story of two guys trying to have some kids, but around the point of the earthquake, uh, the story really shifted for us. I mean, as it did for the entire world really, because we've been concentrating the tale so far on the father's, but with 24 some odd babies. That's an awful lot of women who had to carry those babies. So what could they be thinking? What is the story about them? How are they feeling about this transaction? Uh, how much are they getting it? Will it actually change their life? These are some of the questions we had. We gave those questions to Molly and she sort of ran with it. Yeah. Yeah. So in the months after the earthquake, I guess you could say the, like the political situation in Nepal

Speaker 17:         33:50          changed how everyone started looking at surrogacy changed once everyone saw these pictures of all these babies outside the Israeli embassy being put on airplanes and sent back to Israel, it just cracked open this huge debate, not just back in Israel, but in Nepal and India. Even internationally basically you had groups coming out and saying like, you know, the feminists were saying this is exploitation and we're just using these women for their wombs. And there are op ed articles about should we be shifting women across borders? Is this the way you want to do surrogacy? And then sort of the next thing that happens, uh, like three weeks after we talked to talent Amir, is that Nepal actually decided to ban surrogacy completely, completely for both straits, for both same sex couples, foreign couples, local couples, and for, for Nepali, women couldn't do it. An Indian woman couldn't come into their borders and do it.

Speaker 17:         34:40          No more surrogacy, no more loopholes. No more surrogacy, normal loopholes. But then the confusion was that they banned surrogacy, but there was still a pregnant surrogates on the ground. And so they sort of existed in this gray zone. Um, and in the midst of that was when we went out to try and find surrogates in Nepal. All the surrogates are kept in what are called shelter houses, which are just like houses that, um, agencies rent out that have a lot of pregnant women. We still have these, yes, they still have the houses, like the rumors are that they move the houses further away from the city center, like attract less attention. And so we found a Nepali reporter DJ and I am a freelance journalist based in Kathmandu to go try and get into one of these shelter houses. So

Speaker 1:          35:33          the shelter house is actually quite far from the main city centers. Almost

Speaker 22:         35:38          half an hour, 40 minutes drive from Kathmandu. It's on a, on a hilltop because these are the outskirts of Katmandu where new settlements have just started. Uh, so it was actually a school building, which they turned into a shelter because I think the school had left after the earthquake. The moment I reached the first floor, I was so surprised. It was very noisy. A lot of children playing around and turns out a lot of women bringing their young children if they're too young to be left alone. Really? Yeah. And how many women were there? They were around I think 20 or 22 women there. 20 or 22 women on the first floor of this building. Yeah.

Speaker 17:         36:22          This shelter house was run by another Israeli agency, so not Lotus, but a different one. And uh, we're guessing that most of the women were carrying babies for Israeli couples

Speaker 22:         36:32          and at least the women I saw who outside the room or who had the doors open. They seem to be around 30 to early forties. Really? Yeah. I mean, the first time I saw, I saw the first woman I talked to kidney's Algeo in May. She was wearing like a mustard color. Sadie. She had some bangles. All the women had some bangles in their hands and

Speaker 17:         36:54          man [inaudible] she said she was 36 years old. [inaudible] from Kolkata. [inaudible] she has two girls. [inaudible] asked, how old are your girls? And she said eight and 12 though is how'd they do that? The N***A [inaudible] number cutie asked like, why are you doing this? And the woman said, [inaudible] Oh, I'm doing it for them. It's because you know,

Speaker 22:         37:23          we have a lot of financial problem. My husband is a rickshaw driver and we don't make enough and got him [inaudible] she worked as a maid in Delhi

Speaker 17:         37:36          and ultimately she said she had no other way to raise money for her daughters to get married because [inaudible] in Hindu weddings, the bride's family pays off the groom in the form of a dowry. And the plan was to use the money from surrogacy for the down room diets out of mind. She'd been in Katmandu for three months. So she was in her first trimester of a named and when per asked her

Speaker 22:         38:00          scaly [inaudible] Scowl Guy [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         38:03          does she know who the baby is for [inaudible] she said no, the settleable but she knows it's not hers. Yeah, but that's what's top. And actually all the women that per QT talked to were very, very clear about this. She's at a middle one, not amendment. This is a job we will eliminate who I with the may have a Tiko. The second woman I talked to, 30 years old, also a made in Delhi, also two daughters. She looked all dressed up. She was already too as if she was about

Speaker 22:         38:36          to leave somewhere. And then I realized, okay, her husband is here.

Speaker 17:         38:38          She had just given birth and she put the job sentiment pretty plainly. [inaudible] so she said, and I'm translating here, may it by selling [inaudible] I will give gladly, I will give the baby from my wound. Yeah, but [inaudible] if I will think this is my baby, then how will it work? I have two children. I cannot take this child home. [inaudible] I will have to give. I have no sadness, no problem. Anytime for QT asked these women, are you conflicted? Will you have trouble giving the baby up? She always got the same answer. Name Nay, nay, nay. Oh, they always say that we would happily give away the child and [inaudible] if the baby comes out right now I'll just give a trailer. Did you get a sense that these women didn't want it known that they were doing this? Um, I mean some of them did and some of them didn't because some women were like [inaudible]. They said like, now that I'm here, my neighbors, my family, everyone knows. Oh. And then when recruitee asked her [inaudible] do they have an opinion? Is it right or wrong? She answered no, no. [inaudible] I'm here for the money. So I would not listen to any opinions. If it was wrong, I would not come here.

Speaker 22:         40:03          But some of them were like [inaudible] why would I tell anyone? You know, there was one particular woman [inaudible] 32 years old, [inaudible] nail Polish on and she had laid his pink lipstick on [inaudible] she said, keep on my village, simply do not believe these things. We go nanny [inaudible] and anyone's Oneida. That one can have children by getting injected or taking medicine. [inaudible] they won't believe this. She kind of do battles with how some of the people in our village had done something similar when they bred cows or fishes. [inaudible] you said like maybe they'll understand but my family would not understand name. She says who'd want to go? I have told lies to them.

Speaker 23:         40:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         40:49          so how much in the end do they make? I asked him [inaudible] how much money do you get here? I talked to four women and the figure was the same.

Speaker 23:         40:58          Try to think [inaudible]

Speaker 22:         41:04          Saturday the 3.5 lacks.

Speaker 17:         41:07          What does that mean in dollars? So if you do the conversion, um, today it's a 5,000, 300 US dollars. And the way it works is that they get paid a small amount of money every month that they're pregnant. And then at the end they get a lump sum for Cudi says that for these women at the end of the pregnancy, that lump sum,

Speaker 22:         41:25          it is like let's say around two or $3,000, which is the amount that talent Amir heard outside the embassy. The total sum that they have when they go back home is quite,

Speaker 17:         41:34          you know, it's not a lot. So five ish thousand dollars is what you're hearing. Yeah. Wow. That's a difference to sort of see if this was a number that was just coming out of that shelter house or if it was something that was like the going rate, I guess. Uh, we talked to six surrogates who are in India, that same rate, around $5,000 kept coming up and we did hear a range from one surrogate. Um, and this was about a friend of hers. Uh, we heard as low as a thousand. It's a surrogate getting only a thousand dollars for a pregnancy. Yeah.

Speaker 16:         42:10          Yeah.

Speaker 17:         42:15          Hello? Hello. This is Jerusalem calling New York. Answering. Ultimately we took this information back to Tom and mere because this was originally their question. So let's talk about the money part now. All right, so the last time we talked to you, you thought you were paying your surrogates $12,000 yes, around ish. We've been off reporting and it seems like the number that's coming up most consistently for what surrogates are reporting as their rate is 5,300 US dollars.

Speaker 7:          42:49          What?

Speaker 17:         42:52          Yeah, I don't if it's fast. Too much.

Speaker 7:          42:57          Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 17:         43:02          It's too low. It's too low. Really? Yeah. I want to cry. We explained to them that if you actually look at the contract, the line that looks like it's to payment straight to the surrogate doesn't actually say this is painted for the surrogate. It says this is payment to surrogacy services and it's sort of like once you add in that second word, it opens the door to all kinds of things. She's getting less

Speaker 7:          43:32          then the half.

Speaker 17:         43:35          It's very, it's like we feel like suckers. It's a cool get the money. So who got the money? The question. It hung in the air for a few weeks until

Speaker 24:         43:48          I have a around seven minutes before I go into something that I did see my car now

Speaker 17:         43:54          I was finally able to talk to Don and Muck Dossey who is the head of Lotus, which is the agency that talent Amir used in Nepal. She had just in the morning I talked to her, she had just flown in from Nepal to Israel and I caught her in a car on her way back to the airport and she was going to fly off to Australia and I asked her how much do the surrogates actually get paid.

Speaker 24:         44:12          I can tell you truly that I worked in Indiana college since 2010 and I cannot tell you exactly how much the Jerry eight holding your hand at the end of the procedure because we don't transfer the funds to the surrogate herself.

Speaker 17:         44:29          She's saying she has no idea and the she has no idea is because she said this and other agencies I spoke to said this is that when you're working on the ground in foreign countries under the umbrella of surrogacy, you are dealing with a lot of middlemen and the middlemen have middlemen and there are sub middle men. The people who find the women in India who get all the paperwork done, who get them to the border, who get them over the border, who then bring them to some Paul, someone meets them in Katmandu gets them to the shelter house and all those people may need to get paid.

Speaker 24:         45:01          I truly can't tell you that. I truly don't know. After the agents, you know how much the surrogates, they have three to hands. We don't come and ask the agent exactly how much goes for her compensation. Exactly how much goes for her and nowadays we don't go into that. I can tell you that.

Speaker 17:         45:18          Well, I guess I was thinking about, I would feel conflicted as the head of an agency to be like, I think the money's going to some people, but I just don't know. Like I think that would niggle at me.

Speaker 24:         45:32          Yeah, well that's a good thing that you're doing what you do. You and I'm dealing with that.

Speaker 17:         45:36          Yes.

Speaker 24:         45:39          And you know, you can look the whole world and say, okay, I'm going to make it a brighter, I cannot deal with all the problems in the world. We are trying to give him as much as possible.

Speaker 3:          45:53          We paid the money for this woman gets life and, and now we understand it's not exactly like that. It's not right.

Speaker 1:          46:07          I mean that's the real, I think the deep question here underneath, after everything is over is when, when we do a generous thing, like we give people families who couldn't have families before, but that becomes a business. Is there something about the business of making a family that is always going to be a little troubling and there are no perfect ways to do this or is there a way to pull this off in some, I just don't know. I mean like

Speaker 3:          46:44          I still have three more embryos that they're in the freezer in Japan. I don't know if the next time I would not do the process may be in the state.

Speaker 17:         46:59          The U S is like an entirely different surrogacy scene, which we're just not going to get into here. But the interesting thing that, uh, that uh, Donna said and and, and ahead of another agency was that they think that in the next like five to 10 years, the US will be one of the only countries where surrogacy is still happening. Right?

Speaker 24:         47:16          These things are closing down. Most of the things are closing down.

Speaker 17:         47:20          So obviously Nepal has a band, Thailand, it looks like a in a few days after this piece comes out that India may ban it for foreigners, Cambodia, there's rumors that they're about to ban it. And even in Canada, there are talks of new restrictions on surrogacy and this, these are bands like not just for same sex couples, but uh, federal couples, single people, everybody. Oh. And the main reason

Speaker 1:          47:43          all of these bands and restrictions as, as worries about, uh, exploiting women. Yeah. I feel weird about that a little bit though because, cause if your ex, if you're trying to, if you, as we heard these women are making a business decision whether or not we agree with it as an entirely separate thing, it seems they seem like they're making a decision, then we're going to take it away in order to protect them. Feels, I don't know. It's funny because it times, it also feels it, you just think like, okay, these women can decide how they're going to use their own bodies. Right? It's a little bit like a little black, the abortion debate in a way. Totally. Yes. But by the same token, it is, it's not wrong for a society to say, Hey, there are certain things we just won't allow. We won't give you that choice because we, we find that the choice itself is, um, is wrong.

Speaker 17:         48:34          [inaudible] I mean, it's fair, but like one of the arguments against banning it is that, is that there's still a demand for surrogacy and that that's not going to go away. And so it just pushes this system underground. And so, uh, and, and then that way it's a lot, you know, shady or, yeah. Um, but the other thing was, is that then Prakruti actually went and talked to the women about like, [inaudible] what this job does for them up gazebos. I go to much, I think you owe me like, okay, so it's not the crazy amount of money. We thought it might've been. It's $5,000. Like what does that do for you? [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         49:12          that Asuka one woman said, you know, when I get this money, I'm willing to go back home and start something when my [inaudible] start a small shop. Do you know my own little enterprise? [inaudible] the other women, all of them wanted to use this money to build a house. [inaudible] can you buy a plot of land in New Delhi for five grand? You definitely could not get a plot of land in New Delhi for five grand. But what these women do is they take the money and they go back to their original village and they use it there to buy a small plot of land. And that's totally doable and it's actually no small feat. Having that ownership of land is so important in our societies in South Asia, once you owned land in South Asia, it raises your, um, like socioeconomic status. It's something that's passed down through generations. So you're like creating something for your family.

Speaker 17:         50:01          And if you're one of the women that may be already have land, the thing you can do with that $5,000 is build a house on it. It's a very small like mud house or you know, keep in mind like these women, their day jobs are all made right? And so they make less than a hundred dollars a month. They said had it not been for this, I mean, they would have never probably never owned this much money at at a single chance, but more than that, like boom, guess what? You're gonna cost when you go into this, or at least when I went into this, the thing that I expected to see was like, okay, these are poor, desperate women that are being forced into this. Like right. They'd been dragged across the border. I think the thing that I was surprised to see when I looked at the transcript was that I'm cutting, even though these women don't have a lot of options and yes, they are poor, they had chosen to do this out of the limited options that they had. They looked at them all and they thought like, this is the thing that I'm going to do to get what I want. It felt like these women were making a choice.

Speaker 22:         50:59          I asked him [inaudible] what if you were given a challenge to go abroad, let's say Dubai or Qatar, because a lot of women from India and [inaudible], one of them said that, you know, [inaudible] like why would I do that? That would be very far away. She says that here the kids can come, their husbands can visit. Oh, they're fed. Well [inaudible] the surrogates get good medical care that taken care of during the whole nine months and, and for this whole nine months they're sending money back home and back home. There's one less mouth to feed. I think it'll be, I mean, the way we passed judgment, you know, you just pity on these women, but I think they've, they are very aware of what they're doing. They might be exploited to some level like you said, but it seemed like the women in some ways, they are in charge of deciding how they want their life to be and we don't have to look at them with, um, with PT.

Speaker 17:         51:57          No. [inaudible] the last woman that Perkuto he spoke to, she was a 32 year old woman from Darjeeling. She spoken to Polly and she told [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] I came here in March. My embryo transfer was done once, but I don't know if it was due to the earthquake or something else, but it didn't get heartbeat and it got washed.

Speaker 22:         52:22          She said that she lost the fetus in two months and he tried it twice on her [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         52:32          per QT. How did you feel when the child got washed? Surrogate one nugget. I felt bad.

Speaker 17:         52:47          Oh Kayla, not I did what to say op? No. Afnan I have noticed that Lachsa it felt like it was my own. Okay. Buckle Tyna I'm a in queue and they won't give money if it's unsuccessful. They know they're not gum banana [inaudible] well we, she, I, I'm like, I didn't know if you miscarry you don't get paid. Yes, yes, yes. She says it's treated like a business. You get paid for every month you successfully carry and if you do lose the baby, depending on where it is in the pregnancy, part of the money is refunded to the intended parents. [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         53:30          surrogates. Most of my friends had successful stories to share back in Delhi. Some of my friends made a house with the money. Some bought land. I felt good. [inaudible] [inaudible] she basically says she wishes she had done this earlier because now with the band she was being sent back to her village. She was still weeping on little of what could have been if she was, you know, if the eggs were healthy enough, if it held those old right one [inaudible] [inaudible] the money for Kuti will you come again if this opens back up and try again? Repeat the own ones up a 10 oh to surrogate. Yes. I will come.

Speaker 2:          54:27          producer Molly Webster.

Speaker 7:          54:52          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          54:53          there's something on your face that says we're not quite done here. What do you you want to wait? We're done. We're done. No, no. It was say which say what's on your mind. Wow. I'm thinking. I'm thinking about all the different ways we've thought about the story along the way of making it. I mean you can read it as like, this is a story about the business of family making, the outsourcing of babies. You can hear it as a story about exploitation. All these different things are happening in the story, but yeah, but it occurs to me that this is also a story about the inventiveness of people in some way, way you mean? What do you mean by that? I guess what I mean is like the way that culture is, we'll cross fertilize in these really unexpected, like, okay, like this is, these are two, these are two sets of needs that are sort of reaching out and finding each other half a world away. And there's a kind of symbiotic benefit even while it's troubling and maybe unfair, it's still kinda there and like, so I feel like we could talk about the story in any number of ways, but I also feel like one of the things that happened here is this is a story about dreams and about aspiring to have a better life. And how, in this case, those aspirations meet in this really uncomfortable transaction.

Speaker 7:          56:11          [inaudible] [inaudible]

At prx.org in Israel story.org what was the one you were just telling us about? Oh I love this one. There's a story that they did last season in which they went to every town in Israel that has a Hertzel street. Hurtles was like the George Washington of Israel. So they all have hurtful streets. They'd knocked on 48 cause Israel was found in 48. They go knock knock who's there and they opened the door in the interview, whoever's on the other side of the door. It's just a wonderful, cool idea. And they get to meet a crazy quilt of Israelis.
