00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.710
 good morning have been 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.910
 the nights we talk about custom items 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 custom elements are a specification 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.220
 html5 and abolished the yes that allows us to 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.500
 create building elements from the tag 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.970
 these custom behaviors 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.230
 items can be used in 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.840
 three our website and one 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.510
 internet explanation and wanting can 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.900
 also be distributed through gods 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 javascript file in this example 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:51.160
 we will use an element that does not exist 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.100
 within the normal html5 tag e 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.140
 built in this way so there 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.550
 imagine an element called g 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.899
 tantino profile with a user id and an ep 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.149
 and who is it 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.890
 we expect we want to implement one 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.380
 functionality for which once 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.399
 specified username and a key 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.729
 for this element we would like this 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.479
 element displayed washed 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.440
 correspondent legislators of 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.250
 selected on the account of the account 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.970
 google plus 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.220
 so we must say do two kinds of 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.259
 interventions the first is to make sure that 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 our page accepts this element 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.539
 as an element like 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.130
 html5 elements and the second part of 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.080
 this project is to add 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.649
 a particular behavior to this 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.229
 element that is precisely to go 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:50.810
 to use the folds of google plus e 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.479
 recover the user's lava 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.229
 selected a small note 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.800
 still specifies very much in the process of 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.020
 development for which to say find this 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.539
 example you need to use the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.160
 version of chrome channels then the com 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.590
 from 31 onwards and enable the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.840
 if you read it specifically what it is called 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.860
 nebo the office plasma experiment 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.310
 inside the flags they say canary one 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.640
 once this is done we go to recover 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.110
 a google plus 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.490
 in this case we can use the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.520
 my so more blood paganotti and it 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.860
 we populate within our del 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.990
 our custom item and let's go to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.210
 create a personalized pichi for 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.900
 this project using the epia 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.160
 google console then we bind ourselves 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.690
 on the p to the console 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.690
 let's create a new project e 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.650
 let's go to the 94 new project a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 select from the beige board that comes to us 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:09.410
 presented the e and google plus that 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.230
 are present in the alcohol page is here that 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.540
 I call swan and we activate precisely 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 the use of google plus of hype 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.930
 this application 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.930
 then we move to ip access and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.690
 let's go and copy the lape who is that 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.780
 which we will need to log in 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.150
 at the foot 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.110
 at this point our element is 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.820
 complete and as information but 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.430
 obviously it does absolutely nothing 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.959
 it's up to us to get it accepted first 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.390
 item on the page e 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.390
 then provide it with the interaction 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.709
 required to display avatars 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.300
 and at the time of loading the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.100
 flat two points the same enough 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.350
 in fact the specifications quickly 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.800
 provide a new document more 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.239
 called document point register e 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.590
 once invoked point documents 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.320
 register with the first argument i 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.459
 name of the html element we want 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.260
 generate in this case ti profile 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.030
 we are confident that the element in 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.010
 question will be assimilated and managed by 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.180
 ours from our common normal browser 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.539
 htm element 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.799
 in addition as a second parameter like 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.639
 second attribute we can specify 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:31.880
 a prototype then we can associate 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:33.530
 to the element a javascript object e 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.539
 we can go and associate this 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.580
 object some properties that cate gift 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.190
 the element in this case our top 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.860
 prototype is called proto and we have to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.710
 first initialize this 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.150
 object in this way so let's go 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.180
 build a product variable in that 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.669
 actually it is simply a new one 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:59.060
 constructed object starting from the element 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:05:01.250
 basic html and let's go to the ad 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.770
 one of the callbacks that these pays and puts 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.720
 available and called the created of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.789
 callback and therefore that with the beautiful climate is 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.110
 called whenever one of the 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.860
 custom elements of our interest 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.360
 enter the inside of this page 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.889
 in case we can quickly check the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.289
 correct behavior of this first 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.419
 instruction set uses non-LED 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.680
 this means that in the moment in 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.060
 which we are going to launch this 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.460
 application the element ends 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.500
 within the page and then comes 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.360
 launched the critic the back for 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.159
 the newly inserted element which 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.780
 should print the led 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:44.599
 ok how we can see the answer is 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.060
 absolutely the expected one and the letter e 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.759
 browser notifies us that the call back 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.880
 was correctly called this 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.150
 point the first thing we need to do if 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.620
 we just want to recover the avatar 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.800
 user whose specified profile 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.889
 in the user id tribute and we must be able to 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.280
 we will have to build an http xml call 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.780
 15 will need a set of parameters a 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.120
 certain number of parameters we can 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.419
 go and recover and these are 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.039
 so let's go to which first of all 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.080
 inside the variable from a 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.820
 malaka ttp object that quest that one 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.830
 which he uses to actually do the 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.300
 call let's retrieve the two 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.159
 attributes used render 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.770
 of the custom element then user id e 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.410
 who are the ones who serve for 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.400
 self 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.670
 detailing the call we will go to 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.380
 do and save the purpose of the function 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.430
 inside the self this variable 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.260
 it will then help us to maintain 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.970
 the ability to manipulate the element 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.830
 even when we are in functions 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.780
 different 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:53.260
 ok once this is done we will not stay 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:58.100
 that make the call then 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.110
 make the call to the pe of 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.400
 google in this case the service of us 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.590
 interested is at the https address 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.950
 www.google.com the former plus v1 people lo 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.390
 user id we have chosen is the key 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.720
 the petite peaks that we have created little 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.870
 does and send this call and put us 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.330
 listening to the fault of the call back is 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.000
 tied to the yacht themes to associate one 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:27.680
 function to the property a load this 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.840
 function what it does receives the jason is 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.530
 generated by google plus with all 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.540
 user information and extracts 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:38.540
 we can see at the dam 14 and stay in 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.150
 an html element including a link e 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.240
 an image two properties of this jesus 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.680
 also they are 2 ml and the image once 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.350
 did this 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.120
 we notice how this string actually is 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.150
 keane alta also contains elements 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.200
 html is not entered directly 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.820
 the element but is inserted in one 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.010
 shadow dom 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.290
 this because we have seen in the 

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.390
 previous bets with me using 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.110
 leave due and left dom if 

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:07.490
 possible to build html structures 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.500
 avoiding that these are visible 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.900
 we say inside visible and 

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.120
 manipulated within the name and 

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.740
 home of the page then what 

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.810
 we build in a dom show if not 

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.490
 we want society to be so 

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.590
 remains hidden, for example, from poles 

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.870
 did s external rather than alle 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.190
 manipulations by the jump street 

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.350
 in this case obviously wanting 

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.240
 keep the comedy of ours 

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.490
 custom item is very important 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.930
 use the shadow don to avoid ad 

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.760
 example that the link we go to 

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.219
 insert is then manipulated by pity 

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.090
 css that we do not control then 

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.960
 let's create a fall 

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.990
 let's build inside the shell 

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:49.820
 due to this very small html with the 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:52.780
 link is the image once this is done 

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:56.110
 then how do you complete the variables 

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:59.090
 made the http xml call is 

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:03.230
 built left the scepter tom el 

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:07.880
 internal html of it and we're done 

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:10.280
 if we try to run the page that 

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.880
 what happens is that in the window of the 

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:16.880
 results we would have exactly the face 

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.630
 corresponding to the person's avatar 

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.610
 of which was used as an attribute 

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:25.670
 within the delta that this 

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.900
 means that java positions do 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.140
 tirino as soon as written can be 

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.270
 quietly distributed and let's say 

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.940
 the user the developer who decides to 

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.530
 include on your page will have 

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.420
 for free a new tag called 

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.680
 g profile with this detail 

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.590
 behavior 

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.020
 another implicit advantage of this 

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:48.410
 particular strategy is that of 

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:51.710
 obviously and support any 

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.870
 quantity of giteau file elements in 

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.500
 pages return to which you activate it 

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.670
 same identical behavior and therefore 

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.640
 we can easily for example 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.510
 use it to make a collection of 

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.600

 featured on google plus rather than 

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.710
 for other uses 

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:13.040
 with this finished I thank you for 

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.970
 attention and greet you to the next 

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.390
 bet 

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.390
 thank you so much
