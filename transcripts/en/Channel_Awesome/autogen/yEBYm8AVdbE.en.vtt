there and that's two filters that makes
 

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.689 align:start position:0%
there and that's two filters that makes
it<00:16:17.630><c> tougher</c><00:16:18.079><c> to</c><00:16:18.290><c> make</c><00:16:18.320><c> the</c><00:16:18.589><c> connection</c><00:16:19.160><c> now</c>

00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:19.699 align:start position:0%
it tougher to make the connection now

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:24.069 align:start position:0%
saying it doesn't work there's lots of

00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:26.570 align:start position:0%

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.030 align:start position:0%
is so overused and we're relying on too

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.110 align:start position:0%
that should be you here's like what are
 

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.900 align:start position:0%
that should be you here's like what are
you<00:16:30.199><c> doing</c><00:16:30.500><c> in</c><00:16:30.620><c> for</c><00:16:30.769><c> is</c><00:16:30.860><c> the</c><00:16:31.010><c> puppet</c><00:16:31.459><c> you</c><00:16:31.610><c> know</c>

you doing in for is the puppet you know
 

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.090 align:start position:0%
you doing in for is the puppet you know
something<00:16:32.449><c> is</c><00:16:32.600><c> really</c><00:16:32.930><c> there</c><00:16:33.290><c> the</c><00:16:33.680><c> trick</c><00:16:33.949><c> is</c>

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:34.100 align:start position:0%
something is really there the trick is
 

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.130 align:start position:0%
something is really there the trick is
to<00:16:34.130><c> make</c><00:16:34.399><c> you</c><00:16:34.519><c> forget</c><00:16:34.850><c> it's</c><00:16:35.060><c> a</c><00:16:35.120><c> puppet</c><00:16:35.360><c> with</c>

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:36.140 align:start position:0%
to make you forget it's a puppet with
 

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
to make you forget it's a puppet with

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:40.490 align:start position:0%
CGI you know it's not really there so
 

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
CGI you know it's not really there so
it's<00:16:40.970><c> trying</c><00:16:41.269><c> to</c><00:16:41.480><c> convince</c><00:16:41.990><c> you</c><00:16:42.290><c> it's</c><00:16:42.500><c> really</c>

00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:42.769 align:start position:0%
it's trying to convince you it's really
 

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:45.069 align:start position:0%
it's trying to convince you it's really
there<00:16:42.980><c> and</c><00:16:43.190><c> I</c><00:16:43.279><c> find</c><00:16:43.579><c> that</c><00:16:43.670><c> much</c><00:16:43.940><c> harder</c><00:16:44.660><c> to</c><00:16:44.899><c> do</c>

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
there and I find that much harder to do
 

00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
there and I find that much harder to do
um<00:16:45.740><c> there's</c><00:16:46.519><c> a</c><00:16:46.610><c> few</c><00:16:46.699><c> times</c><00:16:47.240><c> they've</c><00:16:47.570><c> done</c><00:16:47.779><c> it</c>

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:47.930 align:start position:0%
um there's a few times they've done it
 

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.430 align:start position:0%
um there's a few times they've done it
like<00:16:48.140><c> golems</c><00:16:48.649><c> pretty</c><00:16:48.949><c> close</c><00:16:49.310><c> um</c><00:16:50.320><c> you</c><00:16:51.320><c> know</c>

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.650 align:start position:0%
like golems pretty close um you know
there<00:16:51.740><c> are</c><00:16:51.949><c> some</c><00:16:52.339><c> characters</c><00:16:52.970><c> and</c><00:16:53.000><c> uses</c><00:16:53.510><c> of</c>

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:53.660 align:start position:0%
there are some characters and uses of
 

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.889 align:start position:0%
there are some characters and uses of

pretty<00:16:57.589><c> amazing</c><00:16:58.399><c> not</c><00:16:58.640><c> so</c><00:16:58.850><c> good</c><00:16:59.180><c> um</c><00:17:00.140><c> but</c><00:17:01.040><c> it</c><00:17:01.339><c> but</c>

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:01.790 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing not so good um but it but
 

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing not so good um but it but
generally<00:17:02.029><c> it's</c><00:17:02.449><c> like</c><00:17:02.630><c> it's</c><00:17:02.870><c> way</c><00:17:03.140><c> harder</c>

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.010 align:start position:0%
generally it's like it's way harder
 

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.890 align:start position:0%
generally it's like it's way harder

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.900 align:start position:0%
because there is nothing there it's
 

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.780 align:start position:0%
because there is nothing there it's

yeah<00:23:10.119><c> because</c><00:23:10.450><c> you</c><00:23:10.690><c> would</c><00:23:10.809><c> also</c><00:23:10.960><c> be</c><00:23:11.200><c> in</c><00:23:11.289><c> 3d</c><00:23:11.669><c> yes</c>

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:12.669 align:start position:0%

yeah because you would also be in 3d yes
um<00:23:13.450><c> yeah</c><00:23:13.989><c> there's</c><00:23:14.379><c> something</c><00:23:14.559><c> about</c><00:23:14.799><c> that</c>

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:14.859 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's something about that
 

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:16.710 align:start position:0%
um yeah there's something about that
simplicity<00:23:15.489><c> like</c><00:23:15.669><c> I</c><00:23:15.730><c> said</c><00:23:15.970><c> it's</c><00:23:16.090><c> just</c><00:23:16.179><c> taking</c>

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
simplicity like I said it's just taking
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.109 align:start position:0%
simplicity like I said it's just taking
away<00:23:16.840><c> that</c><00:23:17.230><c> other</c><00:23:17.470><c> filter</c><00:23:18.340><c> of</c><00:23:18.580><c> it</c><00:23:18.820><c> not</c><00:23:19.059><c> being</c>

00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
away that other filter of it not being
 

00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:21.269 align:start position:0%
away that other filter of it not being
there<00:23:19.659><c> we</c><00:23:19.779><c> know</c><00:23:20.049><c> it's</c><00:23:20.230><c> an</c><00:23:20.320><c> illusion</c><00:23:20.830><c> we</c><00:23:21.070><c> know</c>

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
there we know it's an illusion we know
 

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
there we know it's an illusion we know
it's<00:23:21.489><c> not</c><00:23:21.639><c> real</c><00:23:21.999><c> but</c><00:23:22.299><c> you</c><00:23:22.899><c> have</c><00:23:23.289><c> to</c><00:23:23.409><c> jump</c>

00:23:23.639 --> 00:23:23.649 align:start position:0%
it's not real but you have to jump
 

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
it's not real but you have to jump
through<00:23:23.799><c> two</c><00:23:24.129><c> filters</c><00:23:25.029><c> to</c><00:23:25.480><c> make</c><00:23:25.720><c> the</c>

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:26.049 align:start position:0%
through two filters to make the
 

00:23:26.049 --> 00:23:27.810 align:start position:0%
through two filters to make the
connection<00:23:26.619><c> and</c><00:23:26.830><c> it's</c><00:23:26.980><c> just</c><00:23:27.159><c> so</c><00:23:27.340><c> much</c><00:23:27.369><c> easier</c>

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.820 align:start position:0%
connection and it's just so much easier
 

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.849 align:start position:0%
connection and it's just so much easier
getting<00:23:28.600><c> second</c><00:23:28.899><c> anyway</c><00:23:29.230><c> so</c><00:23:29.440><c> you</c><00:23:29.559><c> know</c><00:23:29.590><c> it's</c>

00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:29.859 align:start position:0%
getting second anyway so you know it's
 

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
getting second anyway so you know it's
actually<00:23:30.009><c> there</c><00:23:30.519><c> it's</c><00:23:30.970><c> the</c><00:23:31.239><c> simplicity</c><00:23:31.450><c> and</c>

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:31.809 align:start position:0%
actually there it's the simplicity and
 

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
actually there it's the simplicity and
it's<00:23:32.019><c> funny</c><00:23:32.169><c> because</c><00:23:32.320><c> it's</c><00:23:32.590><c> so</c><00:23:32.679><c> much</c><00:23:32.769><c> more</c>

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:32.830 align:start position:0%
it's funny because it's so much more
 

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's funny because it's so much more

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:35.710 align:start position:0%

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
doing now is that there's a sense that
