well first of all this is a treatment

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
well first of all this is a treatment
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.279
well first of all this is a treatment
against cancer and it's a new principle

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
against cancer and it's a new principle
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769
against cancer and it's a new principle
for treatment because unlike previous

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
for treatment because unlike previous
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359
for treatment because unlike previous
treatments where you target the cancer

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
treatments where you target the cancer
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.210
treatments where you target the cancer
send these treatment targets the host

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

about this one and it makes a big

but these basic scientists made their
 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.749
but these basic scientists made their
discoveries and persistently followed

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759
discoveries and persistently followed
 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.400
discoveries and persistently followed
them through and developed this

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410
them through and developed this
 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.430
them through and developed this

and it's very interested in office when

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039
and it's very interested in office when
 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.620
and it's very interested in office when
they were doing this discovery whether

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630
they were doing this discovery whether
 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.420
they were doing this discovery whether
looking for this or was it a surprise

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
looking for this or was it a surprise
 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.800

for them when they for professor Allison

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
for them when they for professor Allison
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.350
for them when they for professor Allison
I think he was working with the basic

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360
I think he was working with the basic
 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.659
I think he was working with the basic
regulation of the immune system like

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669
regulation of the immune system like
 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.140
regulation of the immune system like
many others and he did not discover the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150
many others and he did not discover the
 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.450
many others and he did not discover the
molecule that he was working but he

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460
molecule that he was working but he
 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.700
molecule that he was working but he
realized its potential so he rapidly

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710
realized its potential so he rapidly
 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.860

tested an IV that nobody else tested I

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870

don't know how expected it was for him

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789
don't know how expected it was for him
 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.510
don't know how expected it was for him
to get into cancer but he did because he

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520
to get into cancer but he did because he
 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.050
to get into cancer but he did because he
only I'm sure he did not think of cancer

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060
only I'm sure he did not think of cancer
 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.820
only I'm sure he did not think of cancer
at all in the beginning when he looked

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830
at all in the beginning when he looked
 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.740
at all in the beginning when he looked
and found his molecules he was doing

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750
and found his molecules he was doing
 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.870
and found his molecules he was doing
completely different things and actually

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880
completely different things and actually
 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.640
completely different things and actually
probably had ideas that he was doing

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650
probably had ideas that he was doing
 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.370
probably had ideas that he was doing
something completely different but as he

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380
something completely different but as he
 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.409
something completely different but as he
went on and he gradually revealed how

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419
went on and he gradually revealed how
 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.430
went on and he gradually revealed how
this biblical world

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440
this biblical world
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.320
this biblical world
he understood with inspiration for

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330
he understood with inspiration for
 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.439
he understood with inspiration for
medicine how this one could add and even

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449
medicine how this one could add and even
 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.070
medicine how this one could add and even
become even more efficient and finally

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080
become even more efficient and finally
 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.089
become even more efficient and finally
and if you were to do an elevator pitch

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099
and if you were to do an elevator pitch
 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.950

on this price with the goal to simply
convey the overall concept in an

convey the overall concept in an
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.980

exciting way what would you say them

exciting way what would you say them

these scientists have discovered how you

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
these scientists have discovered how you
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.200
these scientists have discovered how you
can lock the brakes of the immune system

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210
can lock the brakes of the immune system
 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.629
can lock the brakes of the immune system
so that it goes much faster and act in a

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639
so that it goes much faster and act in a
 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.820
so that it goes much faster and act in a
much more intensive way and thus can

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830
much more intensive way and thus can
 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.860
much more intensive way and thus can
attack cancer cells so we can kill

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870
attack cancer cells so we can kill
 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.790
attack cancer cells so we can kill
cancer with

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800
