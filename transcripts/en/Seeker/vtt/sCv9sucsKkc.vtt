00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.600
Water, water, everywhere,
On all the moons a-freeze;

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:11.059
Water, water, everywhere,
Please alien life say cheese.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.790
Sup planetoids, thanks for watching DNews,
y’all know me.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.790
I’m Trace.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.510
We often hear, “We know more about space
than about the depths of our own oceans.”

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.380
Whether that’s true or not (and it’s arguable)
what about oceans on other planets?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.920
What do we know about them?!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.320
Firstly, Earth is the only planet anywhere
in the universe that we know has stable, liquid

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.900
water on its surface.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.149
There are other celestial bodies we suspect
of having oceans though, like Europa and Ganymede,

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.850
moons of Jupiter, and Enceladus, a moon of
Saturn.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.739
It’s just the oceans are trapped under sheets
of ice.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.800
In fact, a new study in Geophysical Research
Letters from mid-2016 says tiny Enceladus

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.390
might have a rocky core, internal ocean, and
ice shell!

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.340
Using data from the Cassini probe, and seven
years of observations, scientists believe

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.340
under a (max) 22 kilometer-thick icy shell
sits a salty water ocean!

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.119
(Another paper says max 70 kilometers!).

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.389
They discovered this by looking at the wobble
of the moon as it orbits Saturn.

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:14.540
As the moon zoom the planet, the scientists
realized the planet’s wobble (called a libration)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.329
appeared to move in such a way that could
only be explained if the icy surface wasn’t

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.830
connected to its core!

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.920
It’s almost as if the moon is sloshing like
a milk jug or bowl full of water!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.639
That’s so COOL.

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.790
Not so cool that the ocean inside is frozen
through though, which is weird.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.039
Out of the southern hemisphere of the moon,
scientists spotted over 100 “warm” geysers,

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.329
so they flew Cassini through them to sample
the mist -- it’s super salty WATER!

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.779
Here on Earth (the only model we have to go
by) life in the open ocean is rare -- so we

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:49.439
don’t yet know if there’s life under these
icy sheets…

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.520
We’ll have to design another probe to scoop
up the geyser mists without smashing any possible

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.329
life that exists inside!

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.340
But even with Enceladus’ ocean, Europa is
far more intriguing.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.659
Europa is slightly smaller than our moon,
but larger than Pluto, and NASA believes Europa

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.900
has, like Earth, an iron core, a rocky mantle,
and a rocky “surface”… and on top of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.069
that rocky “surface”?

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.319
An ocean of salty water!

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.680
Unlike Earth, but like Enceladus, Europa also
has a frozen icy crust and may have salty

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.860
water jets.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.360
The reason Europa is more intriguing than
Enceladus?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.770
Life needs three things: energy, water, and
heat.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.420
In another study in Geophysical Research Letters,
scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.560
think judging by Europa’s neighbor Io, volcanic
activity may exist inside the icy crust of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
the moon.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.870
If so, it may mean both heat and nutrients
exist where the rocky crust meets the water

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.579
and there might be what’s called a redox
reaction -- or reduction and oxidation; a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.400
chemical process that is similar to what we
have on Earth.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.000
If this holds true, then the volcanic activity
brings heat and minerals and, of course, there’s

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
water…

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
SO.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.150
LIFE, MOFO DO YOU SPEAK IT!

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.290
Europa, just might.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.180
Look, it’s actually easier to launch a probe
to a moon in the outer solar system, or point

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.590
telescopes like the Hubble at a tiny moon
than it is to brave the depths of our own

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.629
oceans.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.800
It seems to me, the more we learn about these
other moons (and exoplanets!) the more likely

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.950
we’ll understand oceans in general, and
hopefully we can infer more about our own

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.010
in the process.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.480
What’s the difference between a moon and
a planet right?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.480
Is there one?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.330
Amy has the breakdown for you in this video
here.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.410
Would you visit a moon?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.410
Which one?

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.410
Ours?

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.410
Europa?

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.410
Phobos?

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.410
What’s your fav?

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.259
