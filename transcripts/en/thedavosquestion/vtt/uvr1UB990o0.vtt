Well I think China already is pulling us out
the economic crisis. The large scale purchasing

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.580
of global commodities that China has gone
into affect over the last several months I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.070
think is one of the main drivers of keeping
the global economy alive and sustainable.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.779
I think also that China has actually shown
us some great leadership around the green

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.302
movement, energy efficiency, and areas like
that. And I think that that's going to be

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.649
one of the big drivers of the global economy
going forward and one of the big job creators.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.170
And I think China's getting it much quicker
than any of us in the United States are getting

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.170
it. Thanks.
