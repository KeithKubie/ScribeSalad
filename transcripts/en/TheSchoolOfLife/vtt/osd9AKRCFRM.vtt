00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.260
(APPLAUSE)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.080
Thank you very much.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.560
What I want to talk to you about tonight is how to have a better sex life.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.260
Now there's good and bad news. The bad news is it's not simply going to be a physical exercise.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.320
I'm not going to be able to recommend any creams,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.520
lotions or special positions. (LAUGHTER)

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.580
I don't believe that bad sex starts with a lack of ointments.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.720
I think unfortunately it starts in your head.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.620
And even though we think that we think a lot about sex, we perhaps don't think about it enough,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.860
or not in the right ways.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.060
I want to start by asking,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.900
what makes something sexy?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.560
As it were. Before we're looking at the problems that sex gives us,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.500
let's consider what makes something sexy.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.840
Why are certain moments, situations, positions, especially sexy?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.980
I think it has to do with loneliness.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.920
For most of our lives we are isolated, alienated, lonely creatures

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.860
who do not find an echo to some of our deepest needs in the people around us.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.320
We inhabit large, anonymous cities

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.840
and then suddenly, sometimes something miraculous happens.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.160
Someone allows you deep into their mouth

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.960
You can put your tongue right at the top of their upper molars

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.480
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.440
You can sniff around

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.060
and it's wonderful!

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.720
Now, it's revolting as well

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.240
when we talk about it.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.420
Nothing that is sexy is not also, with the wrong person, revolting.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.740
That's the point. (LAUGHTER)

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.000
It's sexy precisely because it's private,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because it's a miniature utopia

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that you're creating with someone.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.340
Think of oral sex.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840
In oral sex, the dirty,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.080
poisoned,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.340
soiled side of you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.320
is, as it were, welcomed by another person.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.040
You are no longer just dirty.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.320
The dirty becomes clean.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.020
Sex symbolically cleanses us

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.640
Another person accepts us, the whole of us and that is a miraculously exciting thing.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.920
It's exciting. We call it, "It's a turn-on."

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.660
It's sexy, but it's deeper than that.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.980
It's psychologically enriching, it makes us feel fully human.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980
Think of violence within relationships.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.980
Within loving relationships people will hit each other,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980
scratch each other's backs,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.360
call each other names,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.760
pull each other's hair.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.140
What's going on there?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.080
Trust. Weirdly it's trust. It takes a lot of trust

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.820
within a loving relationship

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.820
to allow one person to hit another

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.420
Violence, sexual games, all of these things

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.300
they're not signs of depravity. They're precisely signs

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.300
of our more aggressive impulses. Being accepted

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.860
within a social arena. And there's a tremendous sense of well being

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.680
that comes from that.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.040
I want to ask

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.540
why some people turn us on. What is a sexy person?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.280
Now, evolutionary biologists have got an answer to this question.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.660
They tell us that a sexy person is a healthy person.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.320
What we colloquially call 'sexy'

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.960
is somebody who is symmetrical,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.460
their face is symmetrical.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.120
Evolutionary biologists have studied diseases in the womb

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120
and in the early years of life

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
and have concluded that

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.480
people who have facial deformities in later life

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.480
are almost all the subject of some kind of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.060
attack, biological attack in early life.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.060
So the person we call beautiful

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.140
is someone who shows a healthy lineage

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.140
and we're deeply attracted to that,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.800
the biologists tell us.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.140
Here's the work of a guy in St. Andrew's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.200
Who looked at pictures of lots and lots of pretty women

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.600
and then distorted some of them and asked his students

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.860
to rate on a scale which ones he thought, er, they thought were attractive,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.540
or not. So here are a couple from St. Andrew's.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.160
Now, I think that most of you should find this lady more attractive.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.120
She's a version of this one but this one's got a nostril. Something's gone slightly wrong with her nostril

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.800
and slightly wrong with that eye

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.360
and that's why we don't want to ask her out on a date.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.140
(LAUGHTER)

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.840
We want to ask this one out on a date

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.840
'cos she's dead symmetrical

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.180
and we are really turned on by symmetry

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.180
'cos we want to have a child with her

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.900
and that child will stand a better chance of having a long and happy life.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.460
Now, the problem with an evolutionary biological analysis of life

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.340
is not that it's wrong. It's right. Sure it's right.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.640
The problem is, it's very boring.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.480
It's very boring. Ok, so what if this is the case.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.400
That doesn't really explain the richness

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.580
of why certain people turn us on.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.060
Check out this lady.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.680
I think she's a bit of a turn on. She was painted by Ingres in the 19th century. She's called Madame Duvaucey

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.000
She is absolutely symmetrical.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.100
Beautiful face.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.480
Researcher from St. Andrew's would find her totally healthy

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.120
from a biological point of view.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.800
But she's much more interesting than that.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.120
When she turns us on,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.120
it's not just that that's turning us on.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
It's the fact that we can read

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.880
psychological traits in her face.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.600
She shows a certain humour, a tolerance, a dignity

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.940
She's open minded and yet strong.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.240
And when we say this woman is a turn on,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.520
we're turned on not just by signs of her health,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.720
but by a whole person.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.880
We live in a culture where we're often very suspicious of the body,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.000
of the surface. We hear that phrase,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.500
"She only liked me for my body."

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.940
"He only liked me for the outside of me."

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.320
and that's taken as an insult.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.600
I want to argue that a lot of us is present in the physical envelope.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.940
It isn't an insult to say to someone, "You turn me on."

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.600
That can be a deep analysis of who a person is, rather than just a shallow one.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.520
Now let's think, why are we not all turned on by the same person.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.260
It's because we all had different backgrounds.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.360
It's because, if you're a heterosexual male, we had very different mothers

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.880
and according to who our mothers were,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.640
we might get a stronger or weaker impulse to take one of these ladies out on a date.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.260
Now, let's imagine that your mother

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.500
was a kindly soul, very reliable,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.880
very nice, but a little bit dull. Indeed on a bad day, a bit oppressive, a bit rigid.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.040
Now who would we want to take out, of course, we'd want to take out Scarlet.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.900
'Cos she's a lot wilder.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.860
There wouldn't be such a problem of rigidity with Scarlet.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.160
She's more on the chaotic end, as Phillipa would say.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.500
So we need a little bit of that if we're inclining toward the rigid.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.580
However, if you've had a very chaotic mother,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.420
she was dynamic, she was attractive, but she was all over the place.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.360
Your own real needs were not taken care of. Well,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.460
then, Natalie might come to seem a lot more attractive.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.640
So, in other words, when trying to analyse what turns us on,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
ask, "What's missing in us?"

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.240
The person who turns us on, is going to contain within them,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360
all sorts of psychological traits

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.320
which we're attracted to, but slightly short of.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.100
So, what I'm trying to say is,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.880
don't dismiss the notion of sexiness as merely a superficial category.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.340
It's a very deep one.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.300
There's an awful lot of human psychology in the surface analysis.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.280
Now, let's think of the problems of sex. What are the problems of sex.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.260
Well there are really two big problems with sex. Either,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.240
we're having too little sex. Who here is having too little sex?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.240
(LAUGHTER)

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.680
Yep. Er, any? Well. Well, amazingly well sexed audience here!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.680
(LAUGHTER) Erm...

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.500
Er, and some of us are having too much sex. Who's having too much sex here?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.260
(LAUGHTER)

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.600
Who's in the grip of a sexual obsession?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800
Come to this later. We'll t... I'll talk in the bar.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.800
Erm... now.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.180
Why do some of us have too little sex? Part of the problem is,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.140
that the person that we have sex with, generally, is someone we're trying to do an awful lot of other things with.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.440
You know in some cultures and certain periods of history,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.460
people split out roles. You know,

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.380
"this person I'm just gonna do the accounts with,"

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.760
"this person I'm gonna raise the children with and this person I'm gonna have great sex with."

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.860
Now we've rolled it all into one.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.340
"This person's going to be this person called my wife or husband,"

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.180
"and I'm gonna do everything with them."

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.240
"I'm going to put out the bin bags with them,"

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.080
"I'm gonna raise the children with them,"

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.560
"I'm gonna have sex with them,"

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.860
"I'm gonna do the accounts with them and I'm gonna plan the interior decoration of our home."

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.420
Problem is that sex gets very squashed among all these different priorities.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.960
It means that if there's problem with any of those targets,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.960
sex takes a hit.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.240
So in order to get back

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.660
to having a bit more sex,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.940
what you need to try and do, is remember

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.240
what it was like

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.420
to see that person when all you were trying to do was have sex with them.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.940
(LAUGHTER) Erm.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.540
Now.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.980
There's a website. There's a website

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.020
that tries to encourage you to do that.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.460
Don't go on it immediately - later tonight.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.700
It's called, it's called "postyourpartner.com"

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.080
and on postyourpartner.com you take a picture of your partner naked and you stick them on

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.800
and you get aroused and masturbate to the sound, to the notion, that other people are watching your spouse

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.460
or your, er, your special friend,

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.640
and that's erotic. Now, what's going on there?

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.360
(LAUGHTER) What's going on there - gotta keep a straight face!

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:55.040
What's going on there is that you're using the libido of others to remind you of what it was like to fancy your partner before you started putting the bin bags out with them.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.120
You're using them as a guide to remembering what's a turn on.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.380
Erm, now, for those of you not into that, into postyourpartner.com

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.120
there is an alternative.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.640
This is the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, it's gonna cost you about $400 a night,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.540
but it's perhaps more noble than the postyourpartner, but the same thing's going on.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.160
A hotel separates out the functions

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160
and reminds you yet again

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.760
of who that person was before

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.300
they became so confused

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.660
with other things.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.400
Incidentally,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.600
what we're being asked to do is re-appreciate something which was always around

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.640
and which we're not looking at properly.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.740
In other words the problem with not having enough sex,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.600
is not knowing how to look properly.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.380
We should take a leaf from the eyes of painters. Painters do this all the time.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.900
Take Edouard Manet,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.500
who painted some asparagus in the 19th century

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.680
and the thing was, we've all eaten asparagus thousands of times and don't think about it twice,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.840
but Manet made one of the great works of the 19th century by looking at them properly,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.340
looking at them carefully. My suggestion to you is look at your partner

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.580
as Manet looked at asparagus.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.280
(LAUGHTER) Bring them to life!

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.300
With the same degree of repect

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.900
and complexity. Now, let's think about the other problem,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.440
which is having too much sex, or rather being in the grip of a sexual obsession.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.060
The problem with sex is that we often use it not to think about stuff that's quite painful.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.200
Sex comes along and fills a vacuum.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.040
You know? When you don't want to think

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.740
and you've got something pressing. All sorts of difficult things to do

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.320
and you're in front of a computer. What might you do? Guys? Guys, what might you do?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160
You know what you're gonna do. Right?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.800
You know what you're gonna do. You're gonna... you're gonna put something in the internet, right?

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.380
And you might become grip, er, fall prey to a sexual

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.960
obsession, because you're using sex to divert you from anxiety. That anxiety's important

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.620
and you're running away from it, to sex.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.280
Don't.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.560
Now, some people in history have tried to tell us,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.260
not to have too much sex,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.340
not to think about too much sex. They've been aware of the power of sex

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.760
and they've got us to try and do various things

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.980
not to think too much about sex.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.120
and when we think about these people, we think, "Oh my goodness! How repressed they were."

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.340
"Dressing head to toe in gear."

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.040
You know, "Getting too turned on by the sight of an ankle." This seems ridiculous.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.180
We think in the modern world that we are liberated, right?

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.420
And that we don't need to worry too much

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.220
about the physical and about the erotic and about sex because it doesn't really matter what you're looking at.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.900
You can be thinking about, you know, micro-biology or the fate of human beings.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.800
You're not gonna be distracted by certain visual images.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.800
These things are not gonna put you off.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.080
They're not gonna, you're not gonna  change your priorities just 'cos there's somebody sunbathing, semi-naked next to you.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.820
Grow up!

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.960
Now my think... my analysis is, "Yes we will."

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.920
Very many of us, very sensible people, get very, very, very affected by these sort of things.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.060
Now I'm not necessarily recommending this,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.380
but I'm thinking, let's think about the power of sex sometimes, to draw us away

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.180
from things that are very important.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.600
Let's not let sex

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.520
be used as a distraction from very necessary, internal processes.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.060
Let's sometimes admit

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.060
that a certain amount of censorship

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.520
and repression

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.080
is not just for the Victorians,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.860
it's not just for the religious,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.560
it's for all of us. If we're trying to have a good life.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.840
Part of that good life

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.720
will involve some censorship,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.640
some repression.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.240
To conclude,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.280
we'd be awfully sensible

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.400
if we didn't have

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.420
a sex drive.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.160
We'd be very mature, very respectable people by now.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.180
We could take ourselves seriously, very seriously. We could almost be growing smug

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.600
about the sort of people we are. How clever and wise

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.640
and noble.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.740
Fortunately, we have a sex drive

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.120
and that sex drive

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.680
doesn't allow us very long to think of ourselves as sensible beings, 'cos we know what's going on in our minds.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.980
We know every day as we ride the tube, as we walk the streets

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.660
there's stuff in our minds

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.480
that if a video camera was put in there

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.860
we would just look absolutely absurd.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.280
And that absurdity

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.120
is rather nice, in a way. Let's respect how ridiculous

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.460
sex makes us.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.760
It gives us enormous amounts of pain.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.080
But it also

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.520
gives us that vital,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.760
psychological, philosophical lesson

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.020
to remind us not to take ourselves

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.580
too seriously.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.840
Thank you very much.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.840
(APPLAUSE)
