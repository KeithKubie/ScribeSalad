hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.589
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.930
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animations and today I want

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
graphics and animations and today I want
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.030
graphics and animations and today I want
to talk about the new animation system

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
to talk about the new animation system
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.880
to talk about the new animation system
that came on in the 3.0 release

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890
that came on in the 3.0 release
 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.230
that came on in the 3.0 release
specifically I want to talk about object

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
specifically I want to talk about object
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.710
specifically I want to talk about object
animator and its ability to animate view

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
animator and its ability to animate view
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.529
animator and its ability to animate view
properties so let's take a look at a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
properties so let's take a look at a
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.439
properties so let's take a look at a
demo which looks remarkably similar to a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
demo which looks remarkably similar to a
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.419
demo which looks remarkably similar to a
demo we saw in a previous episode where

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
demo we saw in a previous episode where
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429
demo we saw in a previous episode where
we were talking about view animations so

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
we were talking about view animations so
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.780
we were talking about view animations so
the point of today's demo is to show

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
the point of today's demo is to show
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090
the point of today's demo is to show
basically how to do similar kinds of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
basically how to do similar kinds of
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610
basically how to do similar kinds of
things with the new animation system as

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
things with the new animation system as
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930
things with the new animation system as
you could do with the old animation

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
you could do with the old animation
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910
you could do with the old animation
system so we have some very boring

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
system so we have some very boring
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
system so we have some very boring
buttons on the screen with names of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
buttons on the screen with names of
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420
buttons on the screen with names of
animations that are going to run on the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
animations that are going to run on the
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.680
animations that are going to run on the
buttons as we click on them so we have

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
buttons as we click on them so we have
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150
buttons as we click on them so we have
an alpha animation that fades the button

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
an alpha animation that fades the button
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.069
an alpha animation that fades the button
in and out translate moves the button

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
in and out translate moves the button
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.100
in and out translate moves the button
around rotate spins it around scale and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
around rotate spins it around scale and
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.979
around rotate spins it around scale and
then set runs the animations in sequence

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
then set runs the animations in sequence
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600
then set runs the animations in sequence
now one thing to note about this demo

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
now one thing to note about this demo
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369
now one thing to note about this demo
versus the view animation demo is that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
versus the view animation demo is that
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.540
versus the view animation demo is that
you can use the choreography class

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550
you can use the choreography class
 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.399
you can use the choreography class
called animator set to actually run

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
called animator set to actually run
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050
called animator set to actually run
different animations on different

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
different animations on different
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000
different animations on different
objects it's easier to choreograph for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
objects it's easier to choreograph for
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039
objects it's easier to choreograph for
more complex animations where this

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
more complex animations where this
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.570
more complex animations where this
animator set is actually running

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
animator set is actually running
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219
animator set is actually running
animations on several different objects

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
animations on several different objects
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840
animations on several different objects
not just on the same button down there

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
not just on the same button down there
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.160
not just on the same button down there
regardless they're kind of ugly

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
regardless they're kind of ugly
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.660
regardless they're kind of ugly
animations is not what you'd want in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
animations is not what you'd want in
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.890
animations is not what you'd want in
your application this is a little bit

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
your application this is a little bit
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.830
your application this is a little bit
more of about the technique of creating

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
more of about the technique of creating
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230
more of about the technique of creating
and running these animations and also

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
and running these animations and also
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120
and running these animations and also
just as in the previous demo where we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
just as in the previous demo where we
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760
just as in the previous demo where we
saw view animations created from

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
saw view animations created from
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920
saw view animations created from
resources you can also create object

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
resources you can also create object
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.069
resources you can also create object
animator animations from resources as

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
animator animations from resources as
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319
animator animations from resources as
well so we check the little box and we

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
well so we check the little box and we
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969
well so we check the little box and we
can load and run the animations that are

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
can load and run the animations that are
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.270
can load and run the animations that are
then created from resources instead on

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
then created from resources instead on
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.010
then created from resources instead on
this one the actual the animation

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
this one the actual the animation
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.480
this one the actual the animation
resource is actually running on the same

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
resource is actually running on the same
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920
resource is actually running on the same
button so we get that really egregious

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
button so we get that really egregious
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.109
button so we get that really egregious
effect of running these animations in

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
effect of running these animations in
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.440
effect of running these animations in
sequence on that single button ok demo

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
sequence on that single button ok demo
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270
sequence on that single button ok demo
now terribly interesting code little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
now terribly interesting code little
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.929
now terribly interesting code little
more interesting

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
more interesting
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.370
more interesting
so let's take a look at the code so we

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
so let's take a look at the code so we
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.569
so let's take a look at the code so we
have this class called property

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
have this class called property
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.639
have this class called property
animations we have the checkbox that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
animations we have the checkbox that
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.959
animations we have the checkbox that
controls whether we're going to be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
controls whether we're going to be
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670
controls whether we're going to be
loading from resources or loading from

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
loading from resources or loading from
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649
loading from resources or loading from
code we have the buttons that we create

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
code we have the buttons that we create
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.999
code we have the buttons that we create
here we're load-in from the resource the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
here we're load-in from the resource the
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.320
here we're load-in from the resource the
layout resource and then we have the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
layout resource and then we have the
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089
layout resource and then we have the
animations that we create on the fly so

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
animations that we create on the fly so
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.860
animations that we create on the fly so
this is sort of the general way of how

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
this is sort of the general way of how
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.120
this is sort of the general way of how
you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130
you
 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.220
you
create object animators to animate

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
create object animators to animate
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.100
create object animators to animate
specific properties on views let me

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
specific properties on views let me
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.360
specific properties on views let me
bring this code a little bit more in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
bring this code a little bit more in
 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.590
bring this code a little bit more in
line so you can actually see it on the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600
line so you can actually see it on the
 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
line so you can actually see it on the
screen so we have an alpha animation

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
screen so we have an alpha animation
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.270
screen so we have an alpha animation
this is created by saying okay I want a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280
this is created by saying okay I want a
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
this is created by saying okay I want a
floating point animation there are all

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
floating point animation there are all
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.110
floating point animation there are all
these factory methods on object animator

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
these factory methods on object animator
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.540
these factory methods on object animator
as well as value animator to create and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550
as well as value animator to create and
 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.860
as well as value animator to create and
then return one of these animator

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
then return one of these animator
 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.240
then return one of these animator
objects so we're going to say object

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250
objects so we're going to say object
 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.180
objects so we're going to say object
animator dot of float and the target of

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
animator dot of float and the target of
 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.340
animator dot of float and the target of
the animation is going to be the alpha

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350
the animation is going to be the alpha
 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.370
the animation is going to be the alpha
button that we found by ID above and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
button that we found by ID above and
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.100
button that we found by ID above and
we're going to animate the property view

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
we're going to animate the property view
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.020
we're going to animate the property view
dot alpha now there's different ways to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
dot alpha now there's different ways to
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.190
dot alpha now there's different ways to
do this the original way in 3.0 was to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200
do this the original way in 3.0 was to
 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320
do this the original way in 3.0 was to
actually use a string where you use a

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
actually use a string where you use a
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.000
actually use a string where you use a
word that is then associated with

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010
word that is then associated with
 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.740
word that is then associated with
setters and getters on the target object

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750
setters and getters on the target object
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.200
setters and getters on the target object
so in this case we could use the string

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210
so in this case we could use the string
 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.970
so in this case we could use the string
alpha and then it's going to use

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980
alpha and then it's going to use
 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.010
alpha and then it's going to use
reflection or J&amp;I to go in and look at

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020
reflection or J&amp;I to go in and look at
 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.450
reflection or J&amp;I to go in and look at
that target object you provided and say

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460
that target object you provided and say
 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.760
that target object you provided and say
is there a set alpha that I can call

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770
is there a set alpha that I can call
 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.240
is there a set alpha that I can call
during the animation and optionally it

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
during the animation and optionally it
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.420
during the animation and optionally it
may also look for a get alpha to derive

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430
may also look for a get alpha to derive
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.700
may also look for a get alpha to derive
the original value that it starts from

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710
the original value that it starts from
 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.150
the original value that it starts from
but in I think it was 3.1 or 3.2 we

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160
but in I think it was 3.1 or 3.2 we
 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.700
but in I think it was 3.1 or 3.2 we
released a new property mechanism which

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710
released a new property mechanism which
 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.620
released a new property mechanism which
are these static objects on the view

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630
are these static objects on the view
 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.930
are these static objects on the view
class itself and there's slightly more

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940
class itself and there's slightly more
 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.430
class itself and there's slightly more
efficient so instead of using reflection

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440
efficient so instead of using reflection
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.230
efficient so instead of using reflection
or J&amp;I to get to those setters and

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240
or J&amp;I to get to those setters and
 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.420
or J&amp;I to get to those setters and
getters we can simply call directly into

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430
getters we can simply call directly into
 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.920
getters we can simply call directly into
a setter and getter directly in the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930
a setter and getter directly in the
 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.960
a setter and getter directly in the
property object so slightly more

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970
property object so slightly more
 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.400
property object so slightly more
efficient I tend to prefer that when I'm

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410
efficient I tend to prefer that when I'm
 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.650
efficient I tend to prefer that when I'm
animating few properties so we've said

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
animating few properties so we've said
 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.030
animating few properties so we've said
okay I want to animate the Alpha button

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
okay I want to animate the Alpha button
 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.670
okay I want to animate the Alpha button
and when I animate I want to animate the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680
and when I animate I want to animate the
 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.890
and when I animate I want to animate the
Alpha property on that button and I want

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900
Alpha property on that button and I want
 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750
Alpha property on that button and I want
to animate it to a value of 0 note I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760
to animate it to a value of 0 note I
 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.340
to animate it to a value of 0 note I
didn't tell it what value to start from

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350
didn't tell it what value to start from
 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.440
didn't tell it what value to start from
it's going to assume that it starts from

it's going to assume that it starts from
 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.510
it's going to assume that it starts from
whatever value it has right now so it's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520
whatever value it has right now so it's
 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.949
whatever value it has right now so it's
going to go ahead and call the property

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959
going to go ahead and call the property
 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.360

have now now animate it to 0 it has a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070
have now now animate it to 0 it has a
 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.830
have now now animate it to 0 it has a
default duration unlike the old

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840
default duration unlike the old
 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.390
default duration unlike the old
animations which didn't have a default

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400
animations which didn't have a default
 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.250
animations which didn't have a default
duration the new object animator

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260
duration the new object animator
 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.770
duration the new object animator
animations have a default duration of

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
animations have a default duration of
 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.750
animations have a default duration of
300 milliseconds so we don't need to set

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760
300 milliseconds so we don't need to set
 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.250
300 milliseconds so we don't need to set
that duration we're going to set a

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
that duration we're going to set a
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.350
that duration we're going to set a
repeat count of 1 2 which means we're

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360
repeat count of 1 2 which means we're
 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.240
repeat count of 1 2 which means we're
going to run once and then repeat once

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
going to run once and then repeat once
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430
going to run once and then repeat once
after that and a repeat mode or reverse

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440
after that and a repeat mode or reverse
 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.050
after that and a repeat mode or reverse
so it's going to fade out and then back

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
so it's going to fade out and then back
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.479
so it's going to fade out and then back
in translate animation similarly we're

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489
in translate animation similarly we're
 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.860
in translate animation similarly we're
going to create an object animator of

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870
going to create an object animator of
 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.540
going to create an object animator of
float we're going to target the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550
float we're going to target the
 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.280
float we're going to target the
translate button and we're going to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290
translate button and we're going to
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.850
translate button and we're going to
target the view Trane's

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860
target the view Trane's
 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.159
target the view Trane's
Asian X property and give it a value of

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169
Asian X property and give it a value of
 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.659
Asian X property and give it a value of
800 so this means it's going to start

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669
800 so this means it's going to start
 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.219
800 so this means it's going to start
from wherever it happens to be right now

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229
from wherever it happens to be right now
 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.050

wrote the app and it's going to animate

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699
wrote the app and it's going to animate
 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.679
wrote the app and it's going to animate
to a value of 800 repeat count of one

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689
to a value of 800 repeat count of one
 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.850
to a value of 800 repeat count of one
repeat mode of reverse which means it's

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
repeat mode of reverse which means it's
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.230
repeat mode of reverse which means it's
going to animate over the right and then

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240
going to animate over the right and then
 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.600
going to animate over the right and then
slide back over the left rotate

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610
slide back over the left rotate
 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.770
slide back over the left rotate
animation you're probably getting the

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780
animation you're probably getting the
 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.629
animation you're probably getting the
pattern by now we say object animator

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639
pattern by now we say object animator
 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.850
pattern by now we say object animator
dub float of the target that we want to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
dub float of the target that we want to
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.589
dub float of the target that we want to
animate and the property on that target

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599
animate and the property on that target

we want to animate we're going to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770
we want to animate we're going to
 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.619
we want to animate we're going to
animate from its current value which

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629
animate from its current value which
 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.959
animate from its current value which
happens to be 0 to a value of 360 so

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969
happens to be 0 to a value of 360 so
 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.610
happens to be 0 to a value of 360 so
it's simply going to spin a full loop

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620
it's simply going to spin a full loop
 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.070
it's simply going to spin a full loop
and by default is going to rotate around

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
and by default is going to rotate around
 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.360
and by default is going to rotate around
its center and you can set the pivot

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370
its center and you can set the pivot
 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.279
its center and you can set the pivot

if you want repeat count of one repeat

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629
if you want repeat count of one repeat
 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:08.119
if you want repeat count of one repeat
mode reverse so it's going to spin and

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129
mode reverse so it's going to spin and
 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.980
mode reverse so it's going to spin and
then it's going to spin back and then we

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990
then it's going to spin back and then we
 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.600
then it's going to spin back and then we
have a slightly more complex one for

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610
have a slightly more complex one for
 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.709
have a slightly more complex one for
scaling because we're going to animate

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719
scaling because we're going to animate
 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.450
scaling because we're going to animate
two properties at the same time the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460
two properties at the same time the
 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.850
two properties at the same time the
scale X as well as the scale Y so we use

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
scale X as well as the scale Y so we use
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.350
scale X as well as the scale Y so we use
this other class called property values

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360
this other class called property values
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.999
this other class called property values
holder and say I'm gonna want to

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009
holder and say I'm gonna want to
 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.459
holder and say I'm gonna want to
property values holder of float and

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469
property values holder of float and
 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.339
property values holder of float and
we're going to target these properties

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349
we're going to target these properties
 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.140
we're going to target these properties
on the object and we're going to scale

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
on the object and we're going to scale
 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.939
on the object and we're going to scale
up from whatever it happens to be starts

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949
up from whatever it happens to be starts
 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.439
up from whatever it happens to be starts
with the default value of 1 up to a

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449
with the default value of 1 up to a
 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.570
with the default value of 1 up to a
value of 2 then we create a scale

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
value of 2 then we create a scale
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.369
value of 2 then we create a scale
animation and instead of being of float

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379
animation and instead of being of float
 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:35.899
animation and instead of being of float
we're going to say of property values

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909
we're going to say of property values
 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.450
we're going to say of property values
holder that's the target object these

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460
holder that's the target object these
 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.189
holder that's the target object these
are the property value holder objects

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199
are the property value holder objects
 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.050
are the property value holder objects
that we're going to use and again we're

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060
that we're going to use and again we're
 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.990
that we're going to use and again we're
going to repeat and reverse finally the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
going to repeat and reverse finally the
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.869
going to repeat and reverse finally the
set animation this uses the animator set

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879
set animation this uses the animator set
 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.320

use this one of the things you'll notice
 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.779
use this one of the things you'll notice
that there's this fluent API where you

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789
that there's this fluent API where you
 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.119
that there's this fluent API where you
can say I want to play the translation

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129
can say I want to play the translation
 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.189
can say I want to play the translation
animation and want to play that after

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199
animation and want to play that after
 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.899

these complex chains and then you start

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050
these complex chains and then you start
 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.839
these complex chains and then you start
the animation it figures out the tree

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849

the graph of how these things

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139
the graph of how these things
 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.350
the graph of how these things
interrelate and then it executes all of

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360
interrelate and then it executes all of
 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.240
interrelate and then it executes all of
them in the order that you specified

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250
them in the order that you specified
 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.339
them in the order that you specified
then we call the setup animation which

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349
then we call the setup animation which
 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.959
then we call the setup animation which
says okay here's the objects that we

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969
says okay here's the objects that we
 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.390
says okay here's the objects that we
created above and alternately here's the

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400
created above and alternately here's the
 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.249
created above and alternately here's the
resource IDs that you'll want to run it

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259
resource IDs that you'll want to run it
 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.800
resource IDs that you'll want to run it
from the resource instead so we go into

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810
from the resource instead so we go into
 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.269
from the resource instead so we go into
that method where we set up and run the

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:32.279
that method where we set up and run the
 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.399
that method where we set up and run the
animation and if the checkbox is checked

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409
animation and if the checkbox is checked
 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.170
animation and if the checkbox is checked
then we need to load the resource first

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
then we need to load the resource first
 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.780
then we need to load the resource first
and this is something to be aware of you

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790
and this is something to be aware of you
 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.370
and this is something to be aware of you
we are going to use animator resources

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380
we are going to use animator resources
 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.380
we are going to use animator resources
they don't have a concept of instances

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390
they don't have a concept of instances
 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.780
they don't have a concept of instances
and the resources so after you load the

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790
and the resources so after you load the
 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.340
and the resources so after you load the
resource and you have your animator

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350
resource and you have your animator
 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.930
resource and you have your animator
object then you need to set a target on

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940
object then you need to set a target on
 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.430
object then you need to set a target on
it so there knows what target you're

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440
it so there knows what target you're
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.440
it so there knows what target you're
actually trying to animate so we're

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450
actually trying to animate so we're
 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.670
actually trying to animate so we're
going to set the target then we start

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680
going to set the target then we start
 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.780
going to set the target then we start
the animation alternatively if we're not

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790
the animation alternatively if we're not
 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.250
the animation alternatively if we're not
if we're not launching from the resource

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260
if we're not launching from the resource
 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.540
if we're not launching from the resource
we're not creating from the resource

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550
we're not creating from the resource
 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.370
we're not creating from the resource
were instead creating from the codes

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380
were instead creating from the codes
 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.100
were instead creating from the codes
that we had above for creating the

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110
that we had above for creating the
 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.810
that we had above for creating the
animations then we simply call start on

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820
animations then we simply call start on
 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.580
animations then we simply call start on
them let's take a look at some of the

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590
them let's take a look at some of the
 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.650
them let's take a look at some of the
resources for how we create these things

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660
resources for how we create these things
 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.830
resources for how we create these things
we have an object animator tag and we

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840
we have an object animator tag and we
 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.230
we have an object animator tag and we
pass in property names which should make

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240
pass in property names which should make
 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.420
pass in property names which should make
sense they were sort of created that way

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430
sense they were sort of created that way
 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.950
sense they were sort of created that way
so we have a property name we're going

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960
so we have a property name we're going
 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.360
so we have a property name we're going
to animate alpha we're going to repeat

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370
to animate alpha we're going to repeat
 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.640
to animate alpha we're going to repeat
it once and reverse it duration at 300

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650
it once and reverse it duration at 300
 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.060
it once and reverse it duration at 300
milliseconds and a value to zero so it's

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070
milliseconds and a value to zero so it's
 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.130
milliseconds and a value to zero so it's
simply going to fade out and then since

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.140
simply going to fade out and then since
 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.480
simply going to fade out and then since
it's reversing it's going to fade back

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490
it's reversing it's going to fade back
 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.830
it's reversing it's going to fade back
in we have a move animation again

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840
in we have a move animation again
 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.990
in we have a move animation again
similar to what we saw in code scale

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
similar to what we saw in code scale
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.780
similar to what we saw in code scale
animation this one is the ones actually

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790
animation this one is the ones actually
 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.010
animation this one is the ones actually
has two properties that are being

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020
has two properties that are being
 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.530
has two properties that are being
animated in parallel instead of using

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:42.540
animated in parallel instead of using
 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.000
animated in parallel instead of using
property values holder I happen to be

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.010
property values holder I happen to be
 

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.640
property values holder I happen to be
using an animator set here where we

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650
using an animator set here where we
 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.350
using an animator set here where we
create two object animators on the

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360
create two object animators on the
 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.650
create two object animators on the
different scale X and scale Y properties

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:50.660
different scale X and scale Y properties
 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.030
different scale X and scale Y properties
spin is going to do a rotation animation

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.040
spin is going to do a rotation animation
 

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.420
spin is going to do a rotation animation
and then finally this combo file is an

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.430
and then finally this combo file is an
 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.660
and then finally this combo file is an
animator set which is going to run all

00:07:59.660 --> 00:07:59.670
animator set which is going to run all
 

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.210
animator set which is going to run all
of these sequentially and it's going to

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:02.220
of these sequentially and it's going to
 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.980
of these sequentially and it's going to
run it all on the same target object

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:03.990
run it all on the same target object
 

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.900
run it all on the same target object
there so this is the new property

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:05.910
there so this is the new property
 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.160
there so this is the new property
animation system so if you're running

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.170
animation system so if you're running
 

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.630
animation system so if you're running
code from 3.0 onwards it's a more robust

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:11.640
code from 3.0 onwards it's a more robust
 

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.310
code from 3.0 onwards it's a more robust
animation system where you can target

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320
animation system where you can target
 

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.170
animation system where you can target
these view properties as well as any

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180
these view properties as well as any
 

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.540
these view properties as well as any
arbitrary target and arbitrary property

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:17.550
arbitrary target and arbitrary property
 

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.370
arbitrary target and arbitrary property
and we'll see some of that in future

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:19.380
and we'll see some of that in future
 

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.550
and we'll see some of that in future
episodes thanks
