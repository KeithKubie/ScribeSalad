00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:15.933
Our society routinely makes decisions

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.812
without consulting
a quarter of the population.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.663
We're making choices about land use,
energy production and natural resources

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:28.116
without the ideas and experiences
of the full community.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.363
The car, an inanimate object,
has more say over public policy

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.253
than this group of citizens.

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:38.847
Can you guess which group
I'm talking about?

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.182
It's children.

00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.231
I work in urban design,
and not surprisingly,

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.364
most cities are designed by adults.

00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:51.529
Urban planners, architects,
developers, politicians,

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:53.953
and occasionally, a few loud citizens.

00:00:54.736 --> 00:00:58.768
Rarely do you consider the voices
of a group of four-year-olds,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.539
barely tall enough to reach the podium
at city council chambers.

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:06.682
But today, I want to ask you this:

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:10.607
What would happen if we asked children
to design our cities?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.594
(Laughter)

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:17.863
Back in 2009, I was introduced
to a small group of people

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:21.958
who wanted to start a child-friendly
city initiative in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.466
I come from a family
of civil rights advocates,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.291
and I had spent my career until that point

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:31.291
working with low-income
children and families.

00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:35.104
But I had never heard of a child-friendly
city initiative before.

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.633
So I figured its purpose would be
to address some of the frustrations

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:42.527
I had encountered as the parent
of a young child.

00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:47.117
Perhaps we would advocate
for more changing tables in restaurants.

00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:51.141
Or create indoor play spaces
for those cold and rainy days.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:56.153
In other words, make the city
more hospitable to children and families.

00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:00.149
It wasn't until after
I committed to this project

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:02.506
that I realized I had it all wrong.

00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.944
We wouldn't be designing
better cities for children.

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:11.236
Children would be designing
better cities for themselves,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.196
and for the rest of us, too.

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:17.664
Now, I bet you're skeptical
about this idea.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:20.800
And honestly, I was, too.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.958
I mean, there must be a reason
the voting age is 18.

00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:27.577
(Laughter)

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:31.479
How could children possibly
understand complex ideas

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:33.887
such as the affordable housing crisis

00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:37.045
or how to develop
a transportation master plan?

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:41.080
And even if they had ideas,
wouldn't they be childish?

00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:43.061
Or unreasonable?

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.553
Do our cities really need a park
made out of candy?

00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:50.712
(Laughter)

00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:53.069
Or a bridge with water cannons

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:56.830
that fire water onto
unsuspecting kayakers below?

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:59.788
(Laughter)

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.014
While these concerns sound legitimate,

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:07.307
I realized that not including
children in city planning

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.198
was a bigger design problem.

00:03:09.728 --> 00:03:13.982
After all, shouldn't we include
end users in the design process?

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.459
If we're building a park
to be largely used by kids,

00:03:17.483 --> 00:03:20.514
then kids should have a say
in the park's design.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.077
So with all of this in mind,

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:25.839
we formed a program
called "Growing Up Boulder,"

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:30.355
and my job is to work with children
ages zero through 18

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.903
to come up with innovative
city-design solutions.

00:03:33.927 --> 00:03:35.943
How do we do this, you might ask?

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:38.034
Let me give you a real example.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:44.831
In 2012, the city of Boulder decided
to redesign a large downtown park,

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:46.455
known as the Civic Area.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:50.813
This space is bounded
by a farmers' market on one end,

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:53.242
Boulder Public Library on the other end,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.329
and by Boulder Creek,
which runs through the middle.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.482
The space needed a new design

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:01.847
to better handle the creek's
inevitable flash floods,

00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.560
restore a sense of safety to the area

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:07.250
and support an expanded farmers' market.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.123
So from 2012 through 2014,

00:04:11.147 --> 00:04:14.625
we engaged more than 200
young people in the process,

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.069
ranging from preschool
through high school students.

00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:20.323
Now, how did we do this?

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.497
Let me explain.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.839
First, we visited children
in their classrooms

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.855
and presented the project:

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.831
what it was, why their ideas mattered

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:32.370
and what would happen
with their recommendations.

00:04:32.807 --> 00:04:37.498
Before we could influence them,
we asked children to record their ideas,

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:39.988
based on their own lived experiences.

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:44.704
Then we asked children to go
on a field trip with us,

00:04:44.728 --> 00:04:47.831
to document what they liked
and didn't like about the space,

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.307
using photography.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.863
Through green picture frames,

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:54.783
students highlighted
what they liked about the space,

00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:57.562
such as college students,
tubing down the creek.

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.696
(Laughter)

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.260
Then they flipped those frames over
and used the red side

00:05:03.284 --> 00:05:06.546
to highlight things
they didn't like, such as trash.

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.910
Our sixth-grade students
studied the Civic Area

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:13.355
by researching sites
with similar challenges

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.846
from around the world.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.493
Then, we invited the kids
to combine their original ideas

00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:23.278
with their new inspiration,

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:26.255
to synthesize solutions
to improve the space.

00:05:26.691 --> 00:05:31.537
Each class invited adult planners,
city council and community members

00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.609
into the classroom, to share and discuss
their recommendations.

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:41.471
Boulder's senior urban planners
stepped over blocks and stuffed animals

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:47.403
to explore preschool students' full-size
classroom recreation of the Civic Area.

00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:52.022
Adult planners marveled
at the students' ideas

00:05:52.046 --> 00:05:56.642
as they shared a park
constructed out of a jelly bracelet.

00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:59.229
It was supposed to be an ice-skating rink.

00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.332
And then, public art constructed
from animal-shaped plastic beads.

00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:07.252
And while this may seem ridiculous,

00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:10.615
it isn't so different from the models
that architects create.

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:15.045
Now, fast-forward four years,
and I am pleased to report

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.473
that many of the children's ideas
are being implemented in the Civic Area.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:21.283
For example,

00:06:21.307 --> 00:06:23.879
there will be improved
access to Boulder Creek,

00:06:23.903 --> 00:06:26.369
so kids can play safely in the water.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.847
Lighting in previously dark underpasses,

00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.827
so high school students can walk home
safely after school at night.

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.977
And separated biking and walking paths,

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:40.949
so speeding bikers won't hit young people
as they stroll by the creek.

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:47.759
My daughter and I even skated on a new,
child-requested ice-skating rink,

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:48.933
last winter.

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:54.969
So, were all of the kids' ideas
implemented at the Civic Area?

00:06:55.912 --> 00:06:57.062
Of course not.

00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:00.118
Democracy is a messy process.

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:03.887
But just as a reasonable
and well-informed adult

00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:07.014
does not expect
all of her ideas to be utilized,

00:07:07.038 --> 00:07:08.971
neither does a nine-year-old.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:12.918
We've now been using
this process for eight years,

00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:15.958
and along the way, we've found
some incredible benefits

00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:18.116
to designing cities with children.

00:07:18.514 --> 00:07:21.921
First of all, kids think
differently from adults.

00:07:22.514 --> 00:07:24.283
And that's a good thing.

00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:26.426
Adults think about constraints,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.544
how much time will a project take,

00:07:28.568 --> 00:07:32.306
how much money will it cost
and how dangerous will it be.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.933
In other words,
"Are we going to get sued?"

00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:37.107
(Laughter)

00:07:37.553 --> 00:07:39.934
It's not that these
constraints aren't real,

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.355
but if we kill off ideas
from the beginning,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:46.178
it limits our creativity
and dampens the design process.

00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:49.924
Kids, on the other hand,
think about possibilities.

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.519
For kids, the sky is the limit.

00:07:53.543 --> 00:07:54.693
Literally.

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:59.807
When we worked with middle-school students
to design teen-friendly parks,

00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:03.387
they drew pictures
of skydiving, hang gliding,

00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:05.220
(Laughter)

00:08:05.244 --> 00:08:08.680
and jumping from trampolines
into giant foam pits.

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:10.136
(Laughter)

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.875
Some of this sounds far-fetched,

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:17.287
but the commonalities among the activities
revealed an important story.

00:08:17.772 --> 00:08:21.165
Our adolescents wanted
thrill-seeking opportunities.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:25.265
Which makes perfect sense,
given their developmental stage in life.

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:31.347
So our task, as connectors
between inspiration and reality,

00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.731
was to point them towards
activities and equipment

00:08:34.755 --> 00:08:37.462
that actually could be
installed in a park.

00:08:38.014 --> 00:08:41.037
This is exactly what parks
in Australia have done,

00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.719
with their extensive zip lines
and their 30-foot-tall climbing towers.

00:08:47.562 --> 00:08:49.974
When kids dream up a space,

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:54.744
they almost always include fun, play
and movement in their designs.

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:59.300
Now, this is not what adults prioritize.

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:03.039
But research shows that fun,
play and movement

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:06.069
are exactly what adults need
to stay healthy, too.

00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:07.902
(Laughter)

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:13.037
Who wouldn't enjoy a tree house
containing a little lending library

00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:15.863
and comfortable
beanbag chairs for reading?

00:09:16.442 --> 00:09:19.268
Or what about a public art display

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:23.126
that sprays paint onto a canvas
each time you walk up the steps?

00:09:24.109 --> 00:09:28.918
In addition to fun and play,
children value beauty in their designs.

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:32.966
When tasked with designing
dense affordable housing,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.625
kids rejected the blocks of identical,
beige condominiums

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:39.336
so many developers favor,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.717
and instead, put bright colors
on everything,

00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:45.185
from housing to play equipment.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.339
They placed flowers
between biking and walking paths,

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:51.910
and placed benches along the creek,

00:09:51.934 --> 00:09:54.299
so kids could hang out with their friends

00:09:54.323 --> 00:09:56.923
and enjoy the tranquility of the water.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.149
Which leads me to nature.

00:09:59.173 --> 00:10:02.395
Children have a biological need
to connect with nature,

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:04.685
and this shows up in their designs.

00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:07.720
They want nature
right in their backyards,

00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:09.220
not four blocks away.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.893
So they design communities
that incorporate water,

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:19.204
fruit trees, flowers and animals
into their common spaces on site.

00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:23.283
For better or worse, this is logical,

00:10:23.307 --> 00:10:26.859
because five-year-olds today
are rarely allowed to walk four blocks

00:10:26.883 --> 00:10:28.847
to access a park by themselves.

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:32.974
And nature in one's immediate
environment benefits everyone,

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:37.126
since it has been shown
to have restorative effects for all ages.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:40.110
It may come as a surprise,

00:10:40.134 --> 00:10:44.656
but we even take into consideration
the desires or our littlest citizens,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.315
babies and toddlers.

00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:49.575
From toddlers, we learned
that the joy of walking

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:52.533
comes from what you discover
along the way.

00:10:53.014 --> 00:10:57.490
When they evaluated the walkability
of Boulder's 19th Street corridor,

00:10:57.514 --> 00:11:01.474
toddlers spent long stretches
exploring leaves in a ditch

00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:03.339
and sparkles in the sidewalk.

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:06.696
They reminded us to slow down

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.606
and design a path where the journey
is as important as the destination.

00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:15.550
In addition to trees and plants,

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:19.093
kids almost always include animals
in their designs.

00:11:19.117 --> 00:11:21.418
Insects, birds and small mammals

00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:24.204
figure prominently
into children's pictures.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.379
Whether it's because
they're closer to the ground

00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:30.529
and can see the grasshoppers
better than we can,

00:11:30.553 --> 00:11:34.790
or simply because they have a greater
sense of empathy for other beings,

00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:39.429
children almost always include
non-human species in their ideal worlds.

00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:44.529
Across the board, children are inclusive
in their city planning.

00:11:44.553 --> 00:11:49.014
They design for everyone,
from their grandmother in a wheelchair

00:11:49.038 --> 00:11:51.583
to the homeless woman
they see sleeping in the park.

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:54.576
Children design for living creatures,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.520
not for cars, egos or corporations.

00:11:59.766 --> 00:12:03.194
The last and perhaps most
compelling discovery we made

00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:07.250
is that a city friendly to children
is a city friendly to all.

00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:11.218
Bogota, Colombia mayor Enrique Peñalosa

00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:15.227
observed that children
are a kind of indicator species.

00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:18.676
If we can build a successful
city for children,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.767
we will have a successful
city for all people.

00:12:22.359 --> 00:12:23.521
Think about it.

00:12:23.545 --> 00:12:26.926
Kids can't just hop in a car
and drive to the store.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.786
And most kids can't afford
an expensive lunch at the nearby cafe.

00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:34.490
So if we build cities
that take into the consideration

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:36.910
their needs for alternative
forms of transportation

00:12:36.934 --> 00:12:38.831
and for cheaper food venues,

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:42.188
we meet the needs
of many other populations, too.

00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:45.744
The more frequent
and more affordable bus service,

00:12:45.768 --> 00:12:47.728
so desired by our youth,

00:12:47.752 --> 00:12:51.164
also supports the elderly
who wish to live independently,

00:12:51.188 --> 00:12:53.588
after they can no longer drive cars.

00:12:54.189 --> 00:13:00.069
Teens' recommendations for smooth,
protected walking and skateboarding paths

00:13:00.093 --> 00:13:04.904
also support the person in a wheelchair
who wishes to go smoothly down the path,

00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:07.474
or the parent pushing a new stroller.

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:12.172
So to me, all of this
has revealed something important.

00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:13.796
An important blind spot.

00:13:14.355 --> 00:13:17.863
If we aren't including children
in our planning,

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:19.820
who else aren't we including?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.115
Are we listening
to people of color, immigrants,

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:29.019
the elderly and people with disabilities,
or with reduced incomes?

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.244
What innovative design solutions
are we overlooking,

00:13:33.268 --> 00:13:36.300
because we aren't hearing the voices
of the full community?

00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:39.879
We can't possibly know
the needs and wants of other people

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.053
without asking.

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:44.261
That goes for kids and for everyone else.

00:13:44.752 --> 00:13:49.569
So, adults, let's stop thinking
of our children as future citizens

00:13:49.593 --> 00:13:54.296
and instead, start valuing them
for the citizens they are today.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.010
Because our children

00:13:58.034 --> 00:14:02.200
are designing the cities
that will make us happier and healthier.

00:14:02.637 --> 00:14:09.036
Cities filled with nature, play, movement,
social connection and beauty.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:13.955
Children are designing the cities
we all want to live in.

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:15.717
Thank you.

00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:22.741
(Applause)
