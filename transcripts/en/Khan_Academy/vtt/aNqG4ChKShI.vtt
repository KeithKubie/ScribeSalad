00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.700
Welcome to the video
on basic subtraction.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.340
Let's do a little bit a review
of basic addition first.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.570
If I said 4 plus 3,
what did this mean?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.700
What did that equal?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.940
Well, there were a couple of
ways we could have viewed this.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.640
We could have said I
had 4 of something.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.100
Let's say I had 4 circles
or I don't know, I had

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.160
4 lemons for breakfast.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.180
So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons
for breakfast.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760
And let's say, I had another
3 lemons for lunch.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.000
1, 2, 3, and so you could
view 4 plus 3 as how many

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.750
total lemons did I have?

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.640
I'm adding 3 to 4.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.900
So how many total did I have?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.360
Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.190
So I had a total of 7 lemons.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.440
Another way we could have
viewed that is we could have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.060
drawn our number line.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.240
And I'll draw it in yellow
because-- now that's

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.720
not wide enough.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.710
I'll draw it in yellow because
we're talking about lemons.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.355
So let's say that's
our number line.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.350
And if I start at the number--
let me draw all of the numbers.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:32.020
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.470
So you could think about
this as saying, well,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.380
we're on the number line.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.950
We start at the number 4.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.130
That's this number 4.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.700
And we're adding 3 to it.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.170
So we'll increase, along
the number line by 3.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.650
So we'll go 1, 2, 3
and you end up at 7.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.920
So you could say if I have 4
and I get 3 more, I get 7.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.130
Or if I increase 4
by 3 I also get 7.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.350
So what's subtraction now?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.450
Because that's what
this video is about.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.030
I shouldn't waste all of our
time talking about addition.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.920
So let's take the
example of 4 minus 3.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.500
What is that equal to?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.540
Let me switch colors just to
keep things interesting.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.860
So what is 4 minus 3 equal to?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.050
Subtraction or minus is
the opposite of addition.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.990
So in addition you're doing
something more, you're adding.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.850
I don't want to use the word
adding to define addition, but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.040
that's what you're doing.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.890
I had 4 lemons and
then I had 3 more.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.280
In subtraction
you're taking away.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.916
So this example, if I started
with 4 lemons, let's say I

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:45.210
had 4 lemons on a plate.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.070
If I'm subtracting 3, if I'm
saying minus 3, instead of

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.720
adding these 3 and getting 7,
I'm going to take 3 away.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.910
So maybe I'm eating them
or maybe I'm giving them

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.760
to you in exchange for
watching these videos.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.260
So to take away 3 from this 4,
let's say this one goes away,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.910
this one goes away, and
this one goes away.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.900
How many lemons
would we have left?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.820
Well, this is the only one
that I haven't crossed out.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.985
So we would have 1 lemon left.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.120
And this would be the
lemon that's left.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.440
Didn't have to be that
one, I could have crossed

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.210
out any of the 3.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.520
Another way to view that,
let's draw the same lemon

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.045
colored number line.

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:30.810
Let's say that this is the
number line right here.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.180
And I'll draw all
the same numbers.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:47.240
So that's 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.530
Of course, the number
line keeps going.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.145
There's no largest number.

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:55.190
And you can imagine, any number
that you can think of, I can

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.580
think of one higher than that.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.670
So there is no largest number.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.040
So that's why we draw
that arrow there.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.730
I could never draw the
entire number line.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.020
But anyway, back
to subtraction.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.710
So we're starting at
4 lemons, right?

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.130
When we added 3-- plus 3-- we
went to the right 4 spaces

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.840
on the number line.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.090
And that's because the
right is increasing value.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.270
So we went from 4 to 5.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.450
That was one more.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.990
5 to 6 was two more,
and 7 was 3 more.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.510
Now we're taking away from 4.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.860
So what do we do?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.690
What would you think we do?

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.580
Well, since we're taking away
we're going to decrease the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.790
total number of lemons we have.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.680
So we take away
one, we get to 3.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.550
Take away two, get to 2.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.910
Take away three, we took
away three, right?

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.980
So we'll go back 1, 2, 3
along the number line

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.210
and we'll end up at 1.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.340
And that's this 1 right here.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.340
So just to review, addition is
you're doing more or something.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.120
Subtraction is you
are taking away.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.180
If you think about it on the
number line, addition is

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.740
increasing along the number
line by that amount.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.200
So in this case we increased
along the number line by 3.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.340
And so we went from 4 to 7.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.170
In the subtraction case
we decrease back on

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.350
the number line.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.550
So we decrease by the amount
that you're subtracting.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.480
So in this case we
decreased by 3.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.180
We went back 1, 2,
3 and we had 1.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.740
And the other way to view it,
if I have 4 of something.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.580
If I give 3 away or if I ate
3 of them or I don't know

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.680
what I did to 3 of them.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.050
If I lost 3 of them I
would have 1 left.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.260
Now let me show you some
interesting things

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.840
about subtraction.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.510
So we know that 4 minus
3 is equal to 1.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.900
Let me show you something
else that's interesting.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.050
What is 4 minus 1?

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.510
Well, we could use
either example.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.440
Let's do the lemon example.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.130
Let's do apples now; I'm
bored of the lemons.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:01.160
Let's say I 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.620
I have a new pen, sometimes
it doesn't draw right.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.390
Let's say I had 4 apples.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.140
This is the example
we're dealing with.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.450
And I were to eat one of them.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.830
So one of them were to go away.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.640
How many apples
would I have left?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.560
Well, 3-- 1, 2, 3.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.600
So 4 minus 1 is equal to 3.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.640
And if we did it on the number
line, if we started at 4 and we

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.780
subtracted 1-- we took 1 away.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.020
So we're going to
become one smaller.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.380
We go back one, we get 3.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.570
Either way works.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.820
But isn't this interesting?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.520
4 minus 3 is equal to 1 and
4 minus 1 is equal to 3.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.070
You might say, well, did I pick
the numbers just so it worked?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.790
Well, it turns out that
it's always true.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.440
Well, I don't want to get too
technical, but we're already

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.860
touching on something that
you'll learn later, maybe

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.210
in algebra one day.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.840
But actually I don't want to
go into all that right now.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.460
So where does this come from?

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.170
Well, this is also based on
the fact that 3 plus 1-- I

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.660
didn't want to confuse you.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.700
So I apologize if I did.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.440
But I'll show you another
interesting thing.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.610
What is 3 plus 1?

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.710
3 plus 1 is equal to what?

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.370
Well, that's easy.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.400
You know that from
basic addition.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.720
You can start on the number
line at 3 and add 1 do it.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.000
And where do you end up?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.310
You end up at 4.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.060
3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.420
Or you could have started at 1
on the number line and added 3.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.160
1, 2, 3 and you would
have also ended up at 4.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.690
So we also know that you could
have switch this either way.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.880
Both of those are equal 4.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.140
What do you see here?

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.630
Well, there's a bunch of things
I've written here and they all

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.930
kind of relate to each other.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.660
1 plus 3 is equal to 4.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.780
3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.740
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.920
Essentially, 4 minus 1 and
getting 3 is the exact same--

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.200
you're saying the same thing
as 3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.170
This statement says if
I add 1 to 3 I get 4.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.120
This is saying if I take
away 1 from 4 I get 3.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.600
So if I start at 4,
move back, I get 3.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.280
This is saying if I start at
3, and I move up 1, I get 4.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.600
Hopefully that gives you a
little bit of intuition

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.670
about what subtraction is.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.870
In the next video I'll just do
as many basic subtraction

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.800
problems I can do
in 10 minutes.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.030
And then you'll be ready
to do the exercises.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.532
See you soon.
