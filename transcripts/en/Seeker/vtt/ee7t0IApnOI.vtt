00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.350
Can music really give you an orgasm?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
Hi Everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.050
We all listen to music because we like it.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.730
The right music can change our mood, help
us prolong a workout, and even increase teamwork

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.890
and comradery when we’re working with other
people.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.260
But some of us experience music a little differently.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.320
Ever feel a chill down your spine or get goosebumps
after hearing a particular tune?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.589
Some people call this creepy physiological
response a “music orgasm” and they aren’t

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.759
entirely wrong.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.030
“Music orgasms” are often reported as
a prickly, pleasurable sensation that suffuses

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.450
the body in response to music or other auditory
stimuli.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.370
And studies like those performed by scientists
at McGill University have revealed that this

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.250
response and autonomic arousal is due to release
of endorphins, the neurotransmitter dopamine,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.650
and activation of the midbrain region usually
referred to as our “pleasure center”.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.019
These three things also happen during sexual
orgasm.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.420
So is it fair to say that music can actually
induce orgasms in humans?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.590
Well, the population is large and variability
is great, so I wouldn’t say it’s impossible

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.390
… but it is improbable.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.240
The physiological reaction commonly reported
does not share enough of the classical characteristics

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.250
of orgasm to be considered the same thing,
and claims that “music orgasms” are equivalent

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
to cocaine use and mastubation are likely
overblown.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
but some of you may be wondering “how is
a “music orgasm” different from Autonomous

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.850
Sensory Meridian Response?”

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.380
(ASMR) and that is a great question that science
has not yet been able to answer.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.270
Frankly, not enough is known about the anecdotally
reported pleasurable effects of ASMR to be

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.380
able to make a scientifically meaningful comparison.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.590
On the surface though, they do seem to be
similar phenomena leading to the question

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.020
of why we have these responses at all.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.180
but at this point science can only speculate.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.960
As one author of an excellent review on “The
Neurochemistry of Music” clearly states:

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.860
‘Music does not have the clear survival
benefit associated with food or sex, nor does

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.609
it display the addictive properties associated
with drugs of abuse.“

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.110
So why would humans evolve a pleasurable response
to it?

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.069
We don’t know, but it may be as simple as
a response of pattern recognition or to unexpected

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.130
changes in a perceived pattern.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.180
Either way, while researching this story I
came across an article that asserted “who

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.091
needs sex and drugs when you’ve got Rachmaninoff?”
and to that I say quite clearly: “I can

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:27.430
live without Piano Concerto No. 2, but sex
and coffee are non-negotiable.”

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.921
As pleasurable as music can be, there are
those rare few individuals who do NOT like

00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.290
music at all.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.480
