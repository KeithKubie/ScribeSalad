1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,450
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich. Radiolab.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,430
Today is our animal minds
animal mind, right? Do, do, can,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,740
can one animal really know what's going
on in another animal's head? Yeah.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,960
Like really? No, really. No

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,730
thanks her kidneys.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,770
So we were thinking about that whale
story that we heard before the break.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,541
Yup. You know,

8
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,240
where the DIYers make the whale and they
were sure that we always saying thanks,

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,380
literally saying thanks. Thanks
for helping me out. Okay.

10
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,460
That is their opinion.

11
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:32,461
But we wanted to know like what can you
actually scientifically say about that

12
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,260
kind of exchange and that question.
Let us introduce yourself. Like,

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,760
so this guy, uh, my name is Patrick Hoff.

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,360
I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York,

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,150
although actually the truth is he's
really from someplace like Geneva.

16
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:48,850
He's from, he's a Swiss from the
French part of Switzerland. Right.

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,540
We came to him because he may have
found a way of separating the animals,

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,060
of knowing which animals can genuinely
have human emotions and which can't.

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,390
It's, it starts,

20
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:06,391
it starts in 1995 we were studying the
anatomy of the human cingulate cortex.

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,600
It's part of the brains right
here, Kenny, between your eyes,

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,070
but down and a student in my
lab, Estonian still named scheme.

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,270
She was looking at some brains
and she saw something, ah,

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,030
these very slender of bipolar on the run.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,310
I've never seen a neuron like that.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,640
Maybe it's abnormal to probably
pathological, just to be sure.

27
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,520
She got some slides of other human
brains looked in the same place.

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,070
[inaudible]

29
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,450
and we, there was again,

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,430
started to see them again and we
were very pleased. They, okay.

31
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:43,910
We have discovered a new cell type, whew.

32
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,010
Something that is unique to human,

33
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,310
but then they went to the library and
discovered that some guy whose name is a

34
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,103
Constanta Fun Economo

35
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,980
[inaudible] Romanian Guy [inaudible] it's
seen these cells 70 years ago and you

36
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:04,310
named them spindle cells
because of their shape. Oh,

37
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,190
that must've been a very sad
day for us to know. No, no,

38
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,480
it's now they believe that these little
brain cells may be a key to how humans

39
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,520
relate to one another.

40
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,600
And whether or not other creatures
can relate to us in the same way.

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,120
Right. Is it possible to, for us
to see a spin they'll sell at?

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,811
Yeah. I wait,

43
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,680
can we can show you a spinels of
Patrick half took us down the hall. Yep.

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,300
Chad went first and parked
him in front of a big

45
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,200
microscope. Yeah, fine sense. Again,
look at it. Will it be obvious to me?

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,810
I'm looking at crossing the middle of
the field. You can see a series of tall,

47
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:43,490
slender and making me dizzy. One, two,
three, four, five. Is that the spindles?

48
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,910
Yep. Oh, they're everywhere. Yeah. Aw,
you want to see them? [inaudible] I mean,

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,760
yeah, you hold them mind.
Oh yeah. There's like a,

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,830
there's a whole troop of them when
they're long and skinny and purple.

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,380
It's funny cause the normal brain cells,

52
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,830
which you can also see in
there are like dot, dot, dot.

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,490
But these ones are do like
little purple bananas,

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,880
like a team of Purple Banana and
the thing that makes these cells so

55
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,490
interesting, she mean to hit
off in this direction. Yeah.

56
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,740
According to Patrick
Hoffman is that, you know,

57
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,200
in the normal brain cells they
just talk to their neighbors.

58
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,230
But these ones because they're so

59
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,180
a long, they seem to be yelling
across a beat. A distance.

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,160
Exactly. We know that the cells
send an action at some distance.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,390
Okay. Hello?

62
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:31,970
Uh,

63
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,960
it's across the valley. Yeah, it's across
the valley. Exactly. It's projecting

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,750
the projecting what and
from where to where. Well,

65
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,120
Patrick Hoff doesn't entirely know,

66
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:47,390
but he says he can make a pretty
good guess based on, well,

67
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,100
if you look at the microscope

68
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,870
noticing things. Yeah.
Yeah. So, so here, here,

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,380
the top of the spindle points toward the
surface of the brain or the job he says

70
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,150
seems to shoot up boards.

71
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,950
Those more modern parts of the brain
that involve high Yoda cognition. Yeah.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,730
Language, abstract thinking.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Whereas the bottom of the spindle seems
to shoot down deep down lower centers in

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,760
the brain towards those older parts
of our brain that involve feelings,

75
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:14,050
emotions, instinct.

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,310
Wow. Perhaps this is
what Patrick off things,

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,640
the desales are a kind of
network, a really important one.

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,820
It allows the different parts
of our inner selves to connect.

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Like you've got the parts of us down
here that feel things can now communicate

80
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,150
with the parts of us up
here that think things.

81
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,520
This is an oversimplification
of course, but the point,

82
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:41,300
the larger point is that this is exactly
what happens when you look into the

83
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,950
eyes of another human being

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,350
[inaudible]

85
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,700
because it begins with a kind
of thought, your eyes seem sad,

86
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,760
but then that thought within you travels
a great distance and connects with the

87
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,740
feeling of sadness that you feel sad too.

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,870
I mean it's the basis of a kind of a m.

89
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,850
Exactly, exactly. You know, I,
I see you happy, you know, so,

90
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,880
so that I feel good about it and
you know, and consider those times.

91
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,080
I mean not just empty where like your
thoughts and feelings are in conflict and

92
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,380
if you've got to really talk to
one another, like for example,

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,710
when you kicked in front of me at the
microphone yet again, and I hate you,

94
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:23,070
but I know that I have to work with
you. So I, I, I sit on that feeling,

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,940
I just sit on my, it's going down to
the bottom of my brain. But I say,

96
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,113
take taking that,

97
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,040
see that's the best part of your spindle
situation is that it's not just the

98
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,060
thoughts, connected feelings with its
thoughts can sometimes suppress feelings.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,490
Yeah.

100
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,490
I think that's the idea is that humans
in social interactions can rely on these

101
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,150
hardwired emotions in the same way
other animals might be able to.

102
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,010
That's [inaudible] science writer,

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,150
a regular radio lab contributor and a guy
we often call to help us make sense of

104
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,350
things. Um, you know,

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,680
we can like a dog just hump every
other dog and see what happens.

106
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,040
We've been Scott to flirt
and be funny and you know,

107
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,560
buy a couple of drinks and that, that,
that was, you guys have to cut back.

108
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,560
Cause I just, I am so astonished. Wow.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,200
We gotta use that. Um, I just, I
just turned into a frat boy. So,

110
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,870
but the point being that
our social interactions are
very complicated and that,

111
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,120
and we can't rely,

112
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,750
it's much tougher for humans to rely
on simply these hardwired primitive

113
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,080
instincts you get into the job of
spindle cells is to simply broadcast

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,390
content to the rest of the brain because
without our whole brain involved,

115
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,920
we never be able to navigate the social
world and make any kind of connection.

116
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:39,520
Right.

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,200
So if spindle cells then allow us to talk
gently and emotionally to one another.

118
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,750
The question is, this is
the question for our hour.

119
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,710
What about introduced species is an
intra or Inter Intra in Charlotte?

120
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,590
[inaudible] yeah, that's inside I
think across species is what you mean.

121
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,070
Does any other animal have spindle cells?

122
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,470
We're taking the end as it happens. So we,

123
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,430
I'm taking you to my cold room
just down the hall from his office.

124
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,190
It's professor Hoff has a
freezer a way. High Stone.

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,010
The specimens are very big
door to full of brains,

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
so it's going to get
through the cooler here.

127
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,580
[inaudible]

128
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,230
all different kinds with brains of volume
species. The CETACEANS are over there.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,460
We have the great apes around whale
wall. That's the way the wall, yeah,

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,090
he's got dozens and dozens of rains and
buckets in new jars and it keeps them

131
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:35,080
all organized. Well, each category
of species has its own shelf.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,350
You have more apes down there
with the gorillas and orangutans.

133
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,740
Ah, it was really cold there.

134
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,210
So what they did was they took a bunch
of those brains off the shelf and walked

135
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,620
him down the hall to the lab and put
little pieces of them under a microscope.

136
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
They didn't expect to find
any of those bizarro neurons,

137
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,320
any of these other creatures.

138
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,590
Cause he was pretty sure this is
something that is unique to human.

139
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,130
But one day we will looking at
the brain of the Humpback Whale

140
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,690
and we stumble on spindle cells,
plenty of spindle cells. Well,

141
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:24,140
so what was that? Did you, were you
surprised? And I was there say, okay,

142
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,100
this is fascinating. You weren't
expecting that. I wasn't that.

143
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,680
I told expecting that.
But on the other hand,

144
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,440
here we have the humpback whale,

145
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,570
which is a very social
animals. They, they,

146
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,520
they fall clans, they, they

147
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,070
communicates the males, they have a song,

148
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,550
they hunt together, they
develop punting strategies,

149
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,630
which requires perfect
coordination of many whales.

150
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,000
So they have to act together to do that.

151
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,180
Now if acting together is the key you
and having complex social structures,

152
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,060
well then these things shouldn't just
be limited to whales. And in fact,

153
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,810
over the years half and other
scientists have found spindle sales in

154
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:16,920
chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins,

155
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,440
gorillas. Which begs the question

156
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,220
[inaudible]

157
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,250
like if we want to have an experience
with another creature and now not just at

158
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:27,070
the zoo, but a real shared experience,

159
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,850
do those creatures need
to have these things?

160
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,290
Do you think the existence of spenders
so creates more of a possibility of

161
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,010
having that cross species
sharing moment? I think so.

162
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,150
[inaudible]

163
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,680
if we assume that these cells
have zilch on influence on, uh,

164
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,990
the sociability of the species,

165
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,080
it is very likely that you would
experience something of that kind with a

166
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,820
species that has,

167
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,170
then I doubt you would get a very good
experience if you were trying to do this

168
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
with the Hyena.

169
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,200
So maybe what we see when
we look into, you know,

170
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,400
the sad eyes of a blue whale or when
we look into the eyes of an elephant

171
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,270
cradling a baby elephant, which are
just the cutest things on earth.

172
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,250
Maybe what we recognize is is
is that same flavor promotion,

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,820
that same inner life, a
feeling maybe and it's the big,

174
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:29,120
maybe maybe that in our
life requires spindle cells,

175
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,320
but how big is that? Maybe it means
a sounds like a really maybe, maybe.

176
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,600
I mean, yeah, it's important
that this is all just a,

177
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,910
I think this is still very theoretical
and in fact if you asked people like

178
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,120
Clive Lynn, the fellow who who,
who poopooed our our whale,

179
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:54,370
thank you from before as Clive,

180
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:58,570
like could you look at an animal and find
something in the animal that says yes,

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,940
if he has that he's got feeling

182
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,340
well wrong.

183
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
I don't for a moment imagine that there's
going to be a type of nerve cell or a

184
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,380
type of structure in the brain,

185
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,450
which is going to be such an acid test
of whether an animal has a particular

186
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:19,470
psychological capacity that we could
then find that kind of neuron and say,

187
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,200
well now we know without having to
look at the behavior of the animal.

188
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,400
Now we know that this species has
this or that psychological ability.

189
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,960
Well, let me ask the question
a different way. I mean,

190
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,570
do you think spindle cells
are no spindle cells?

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,770
Let's just toss them out for a second.

192
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:36,771
Do you think there are a category of
creatures that are more likely to have

193
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,550
empathic experiences with us? Would
you draw lines between beings?

194
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,660
Well, the thing that I would,

195
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,740
the thing I would emphasize if we are
looking for empathy between different

196
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,750
species is their um,

197
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,900
developmental experiences
to make his point.

198
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,070
Clive told us about this
experiment. This is,

199
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,580
let's take a chimp with all the spindle
cells inside the chimp brain there,

200
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,910
but the champion who room
and in front of the champ,

201
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:04,640
let's put two cups face down.
Now, one of the cups has a grape,

202
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,250
something delicious under it,

203
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,850
and the chimp doesn't
know where the grape is.

204
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,440
Could be under cup a or Cup B.

205
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:16,441
So what you the experiment do you simply
point to the cup that has the grape?

206
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
Like that's the one. That one right there.

207
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,590
I know the animal has to
do is to go to the cup.

208
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:27,070
That's pointed to it seems simple
enough. But chimps, Clive says,

209
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,390
chimps find this stunningly difficult
to understand. Get this wrong.

210
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,330
What do you mean? I mean, they just
look at you pointing and they look into,

211
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,120
you're pointing and they look and
you're pointing and they just go, wow.

212
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,120
Whereas dogs who don't have spindle cells,

213
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,820
most pet dogs get this from the get go.

214
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,030
The dogs can do this
and chimps can't. Yeah,

215
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,670
they quite spontaneously recognized
that you should go where they,

216
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,290
where they point. And Clive says,

217
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,700
the explanation here is not the dogs
have some special cell in their brain.

218
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,810
It's simply because,

219
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:59,630
because they grow up in our households
if they grow up with us. Right.

220
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,190
To test this idea. He did the
same study, the pointing one. Yep.

221
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,540
Except this time with some wolves because
wolves are the animals from which dogs

222
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:12,541
are descended but they haven't lived in
human households obviously and normally

223
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,570
like the chimps,

224
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,400
wolves totally screw up the porting
tests that we've done some tests on some

225
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:22,690
wolves that were hand reared by human
beings and are very friendly to human

226
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:27,670
beings and we find that those
wolves behave just like the dogs,

227
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,720
that they are just as good at following
the human pointing to find the food.

228
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,810
Really. Did you have to train them or no?

229
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:37,960
We did not train them while
they just picked it up,

230
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,260
but these are exceptional bulbs in so
far as they were reared by human beings.

231
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:47,500
They were bottle fed when they were wee
babies because there are things that go

232
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:51,940
on earlier in our development that are
crucial and that include learning who are

233
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,690
your, who are your kind,
what do, who am I, what am I?

234
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,100
And you learn that in a critical period
in your early life by looking around you

235
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:01,600
and seeing who you're interacting with.

236
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,530
Pretty much every dog you might meet
has learned to accept humans as social

237
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:09,160
companions. And that's because
it was reared in a human home.

238
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,330
And because evolution has prepared it
with a relatively slow development so that

239
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,170
it's pretty easy to tame a dog.
The Wolf on the other hand,

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,870
it goes through its childhood and
adolescence in the blink of an eye and the

241
00:14:20,871 --> 00:14:22,660
course of just a handful of weeks.

242
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,050
And so it's actually extremely difficult
to successfully hand rear a wolf

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,310
because you have so little time available
to you and you have to invest 24 hours

244
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:33,611
a day,

245
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:38,611
seven days a week during that brief
period that a wolf is open to the

246
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,310
possibility of learning who its companions
might be. That's really interesting.

247
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,450
You know, one of the pieces of the
interpretation that I find intriguing,

248
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,020
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna run by you,
is that, oh, that's so interesting.

249
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,620
I'm now sitting here thinking, boy, if I
could raise a whale with a baby bottle,

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,850
then I would know whether the will was
saying thank you to me because I would

251
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:02,120
have learned, it's not like I have to
learn, but whale would have learned human.

252
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,970
Wow, that's right. I mean, of course,
this is completely hypothetical.

253
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,100
The whales are really
bad example to choose,

254
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,100
but my guess would be if
you bottle fed or whale,

255
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,330
you would get a whale that might plausibly
do something like a behavior that

256
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:19,190
expresses things. That is such a
hard mental image to conjure. Well,

257
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,460
that's right. That's right. Bottle
feeding. Oh, well, yeah. Well,

258
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,940
because we have to keep rising to the
surface for 21 years to breathe before I

259
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,720
actually get to the experiment.

260
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,500
There are a number of
drawbacks to that experience.

261
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,720
Radiolab will continue in a moment.
As soon as I come up to breath.
