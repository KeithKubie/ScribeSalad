MICHEL DEGRAFF: You know, so
why this hashtag for the course?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.990
The hashtags, Stay Woke?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.430
Well I love it,
because in a way,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.180
it's one of these phrases that
take a very complex concept,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.550
and that makes that accessible
to the larger public.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.370
Because Stay Woke
is a way to talk

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.740
about critical consciousness.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.950
And what we've seen
in the past elections

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.189
is this increase of
quote-unquote "fake news."

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.689
And one thing which
I've been trying

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.800
to share with the students is
that this concept of fake news

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.990
isn't at all a new phenomenon.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.430
So in fact, if you
look at the way

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
history is taught in the US--

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.060
if you look at, say, Howard
Zinn's book about history--

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.220
it tells us how
our history books

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.620
are filled with fake news.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.120
So the point is that, it's not
just fake news that's fake.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.940
And what the students get
to see through, for example,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.570
the Haitian revolution is
that, in the textbooks,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.239
most of them-- actually,
almost all of them, maybe,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.630
except for one or two--

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.330
they got to learn
lots of details

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.100
about the French Revolution.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.316
And then the
American Revolution.

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.940
So they know all the
things about that.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.630
But almost none of
them knew about Haiti.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.260
But if you think of
what revolution means,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.930
this revolution has
had much more impact

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.620
when it comes to human
rights, civil liberties,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.440
than both the US revolution
and the French one.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.500
And the question that I
ask them is, why is it

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.160
that they went through
the elementary school,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.370
the high school, some of them
most of the college years,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.261
without ever hearing about
the Haitian revolution?

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:43.760
Right?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.880
Which, in fact, it has
been much more potent

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.320
than both the French
one and the US one.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280
And to me, that was a great way
to introduce to them the idea

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.940
that, you have to stay woke.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.240
You have to
understand why history

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.555
is being taught in such a biased
way, that excludes the one

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:04.730
revolution that actually
allowed this concept of equality

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.820
among all human
beings to become true.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.639
Because both in
France, and in the US,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.000
when they were claiming liberty,
equality, fraternity, there

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.160
were still people
who were in chains.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.750
You know, in fact, blacks
were still in slavery.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.160
Women couldn't vote.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.740
It's only in Haiti that
revolution took its

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.530
really meaning in really
changing the world order.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.530
And in creating this
possibility for all human beings

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.300
to be equal.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.570
But yet, it's not taught
in the classroom in the US.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.500
And to me, that's one of the
most blatant cases of fake news

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.830
that's become so much a
part of the way children

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590
are educated in the US.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.010
So Stay Woke means to be alert
to this kind of propaganda that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.170
passes for history.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.010
That's Stay Woke.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.676
And of course, we
look at other examples

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:55.310
where they,
themselves, participate

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.500
in these hierarchies of
knowledge that actually

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.630
subserve hierarchies of power.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.405
That's Stay Woke.
