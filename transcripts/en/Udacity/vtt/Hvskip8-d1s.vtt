00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.930
The Visitor pattern is an example of a behavioral pattern.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.330
And in order to describe the behavior, we use a sequence diagram in this case.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.170
Recall that in the sequence diagram,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.730
each of the columns corresponds to a different object.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.120
The horizontal lines correspond to messages being sent among the objects.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.390
And that time marches down the page.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.702
The first column in the diagram corresponds to the data structure itself.

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:29.063
And it is responsible for sending messages to each of the concrete classes, and

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:32.710
those messages are accept messages passing in whatever visitor we

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.930
currently want to implement.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.190
The concrete classes are in the second column.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.892
Their responsibility is for doing the callback.

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:43.090
That is, they are given a visitor as an argument and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.560
they need to pass themselves to the particular visitor operation responsible for

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.830
whatever visitor they're currently implementing.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.600
Those are the messages at the top which go from the second column over to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.090
the fourth column and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.550
in the middle of the screen from the third column over to the fourth column.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.220
Finally, in the visitor operation itself in the fourth column,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.020
can make calls back into the elements,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.790
taking advantage of whatever operations those elements provide.
