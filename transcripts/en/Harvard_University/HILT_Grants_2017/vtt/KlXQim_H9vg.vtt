00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.070
Sound Lab 2.0 builds
on an earlier project

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.630
that we'd been working on.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.750
It was essentially four computer
stations in the Music Library

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.150
that allowed students to
work on their sound editing

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.450
and sound technology projects.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.940
And Sound Lab 2.0 is the bigger
and better version of it.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.180
So after the first
round, we realized

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.440
that we were quite interested in
expanding on what worked well,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.830
and we wanted to see sound
technology more integrated

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.720
into curricular events.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.950
And so we came up with
a few projects that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.080
would allow this expansion.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.250
The most important part
is to create a website

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.890
to let people know
that we exist.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.990
The second most
important part is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.550
to update the equipment,
the computer stations,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.150
buy high-end
recording equipment.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.540
And perhaps the most
significant innovation

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.519
is the third part
that allowed us

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.530
to organize a regular
series of workshops

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.980
that Chris organizes and
runs where he invites

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.820
guest speakers who talk
about all sorts of aspects

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.050
of working with sound.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.190
And that could be
radio production.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.040
It could be turn-tabling,
so all kinds

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.573
all kinds of technological
and creative approaches

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.490
that work with sound and
that the students are

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.840
very interested in.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.990
One that has been
the most memorable

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.460
was we did a workshop about
circuit bending, which

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.190
is when you take a cheap
electronic device that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.070
creates sound and it's
typically battery powered.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.130
You take it apart,
reveal the circuit board,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.780
and then you dive right into
the circuitry and rewire it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.390
so it then makes a
new palette of sounds

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.060
that you can then manipulate.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.060
Then we brought in Erik Brunvand
from the University of Utah

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.120
to teach this, and it
was an interesting way

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.780
to create a new sound
device, a new instrument.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.280
But it also was a way to teach
students to empower themselves,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.490
to not be afraid of technology,
to just go right in,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.390
and you can control it.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.650
You can decide what happens.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.930
And he did a really
fascinating lecture

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.300
that combined very
technical engineering speak.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.780
He simplified it but was able
to engage with the students.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.220
And then we spent the rest
of the afternoon taking apart

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.648
electronic toy dogs,
other Casio keyboards,

00:02:41.648 --> 00:02:43.190
the weird random
things that we found

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920
at thrift stores, and a bunch
of toys that he brought in,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.740
kids toys, that we took
apart and made some amazing

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.420
sounding instruments.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.220
It was quite a lot of fun.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.380
At the moment, we have
a couple of courses

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.535
that use the equipment
from the Sound Lab.

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:58.910
There is a freshman seminar
that my colleague Chris Hasty

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.970
teaches on sound tracking,
producing sound, music

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.840
and sounds for
pre-existing film clips.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.200
I've been teaching a
course for the last five

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.210
years, "The Art of
Listening," that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.700
uses the equipment quite a lot.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.962
The whole course is
arranged around a number

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:20.670
of creative projects,
starting with a mix

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.325
tape where we hand out a
cassette tape to the students.

00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:24.950
And most of them
have, obviously, never

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.783
seen a cassette tape
before and don't really

00:03:26.783 --> 00:03:27.810
know what to do with it.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.620
And so we start with
this Jurassic technology.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.700
And then we move through various
aspects of digital editing

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.570
toward the final
project, which is

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.220
a sound map of sonically
interesting places

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.800
around Cambridge.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.420
So they record and
edit their soundscapes,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.630
and then we put them
up on a digital map.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.840
And so over time, we
get historical layers.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.690
Some students and
some TFs have taken

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.840
advantage of our "Intro to
Audio Production Workshop."

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.017
The focus is on podcasting.

00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:06.600
"California in the '60s," which
is a class that's also offered

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.820
in the music department,
but other classes

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.440
throughout the FAS have
brought in students or faculty

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.709
have come in to attend those
workshops, to enable themselves

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.102
to then go and teach
how to do podcasting

00:04:19.102 --> 00:04:21.310
or then the students can
directly learn how to do it.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.490
So a variety of
people have come in

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.842
to use the resource that's
been created with this funding.

00:04:27.842 --> 00:04:29.300
And one of the
things that's really

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.420
surprised us is the
overwhelming response

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.090
that we've received from
all parts of the university.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.400
We've worked with people
from public health.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.690
We've worked with people
from the Divinity School,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.682
with the Hutchins Center for
African-American Studies--

00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:46.640
History and literature.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.030
--history and literature,
English, lots of anthropology.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.130
But we expected FAS to
be a central focal point,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.740
but it's all the
other schools as well.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.330
So it's really
something that supports

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.980
the work in all of Harvard
throughout the schools.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.050
Sure.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.650
So I think, for us, we had
two measures of success.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.310
One was how well we
connected with other parts

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.360
of the institution.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.120
And the other was how many
projects the Sound Lab

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.530
generated, how the general
interest in the workshop

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.330
panned out.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.730
And we're pretty satisfied
on all those fronts.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.840
For us, the big
challenge is to bring

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.090
the integration of
sound technology

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.170
and sound production forward
with curricular interests.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.860
And you kind of need to--

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.620
I think the hardest part is
to convince faculty members

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.000
that they can do this
and that you don't need

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.600
to start from
scratch and that it's

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.790
possible to build those projects
into syllabi and curricular

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.330
ideas in interesting ways.
