Hi everyone!

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.280
This is president Barack Obama.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.100
NASA's Aura Satellite has been tracking global pollution trends for the past decade

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.800
and it's initial findings have shown us a lot about the state of our atmosphere

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.060
The satellite detects gases like nitrogen dioxide,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.380
the common pollutant from cars and power plants,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.940
the data shows us that the United States and Europe have some of the highest emissional levels in the world

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.000
But it also shows us that over the last 25 years,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.620
Nitrogen Dioxide levels have dropped by up to 50% in both regions.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.240
Thanks in large part, to new rules that protect our air.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.920
At the same time, in China, India, and the Middle East.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.220
This pollution has grown dramatically

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.900
So imagery like this can help us see what actions are working,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.100
and where we need to focus additional international efforts.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.120
and it proves, that we all need to work together

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.700
to protect the one planet we've got.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.440
