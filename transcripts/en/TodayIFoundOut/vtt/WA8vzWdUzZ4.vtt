00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:15.720
Personally nominated for the 
Nobel Prize a record 84 times, Arnold Johannes

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.800
Wilhelm Sommerfeld was one of the most influential
physicists of all time, both because of his

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.920
own accomplishments in the field and the many
dozens of his students who turned into superstars

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.420
in the world of science (including having
four doctoral students go on to win the Nobel

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.989
Prize, along with three of his other postgraduate
students also taking home the award- the most

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.070
eventual Nobel laureates all taught by one
person).

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.820
Born on December 5, 1868 in Königsberg, East
Prussia, Sommerfeld began his career as a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.420
student of mathematics and the physical sciences
at Albertina (aka University of Königsberg)

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.230
in his hometown, where he received a Ph.D.
on October 24, 1891.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.749
After a year of compulsive military service
ended in 1893, unlike so many academics of

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.690
his era, Sommerfeld continued to serve as
a volunteer for the next eight years on the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.690
side.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.250
Physically impressive, with a Prussian bearing
and wearing a fencing scar on his magnificently

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.030
mustachioed face, while in the service, Sommerfeld
was famously described as managing “to give

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.380
the impression of a colonel of the hussars,”
rather than a book-worm academic.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.820
As for that scar, in his first year of study,
the near “compulsory drinking bouts and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.800
fencing duels” not only resulted in said
scar, but also hindered his studies significantly,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.720
which he later came to regret as wasted time.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.940
Apparently making up for lost efforts in his
youth, Sommerfeld left Königsberg for the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.270
University of Göttingen and after two years
as an assistant to more experienced mathematics

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.530
professors, he earned his Privatdozent (authorization
to teach at the university level) in 1895.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.320
Rapidly moving up the ranks, he was appointed
to chair the mathematics department at the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.090
Bergakademie in Clausthal-Zellerfeld in 1897.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.130
The following year, he became editor of the
famous Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.290
a post he held through 1926.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.490
Sommerfeld moved on to become Chair of Applied
Mechanics at the Königliche Technische Hochschule

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.709
Aachen, and it was in Aachen that he produced
his theory of hydrodynamics.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.920
Also at Aachen, Sommerfeld mentored Peter
Debye, who later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.150
in 1936 for “his contributions to the study
of molecular structure.”

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.090
In 1906, Sommerfeld accepted the position
as director of the new Theoretical Physics

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.510
Institute at the University of Munich, where
he mentored Werner Heisenberg in hydrodynamics

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.910
theory; Heisenberg later won the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1932 “for the creation of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.239
quantum mechanics.”

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.439
While in Munich, Sommerfeld also mentored
Wolfgang Pauli on his thesis on quantum theory,

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.799
and Pauli also went on to win a Nobel Prize
in Physics, in 1945, for his discovery of

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.680
the eponymous Pauli exclusion principle (which
stated that two or more identical fermions

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.950
can not be in the same quantum state within
a quantum system at the same time).

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.790
If all that wasn’t enough, he also mentored
Hans Bethe while at the University of Munich;

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.629
Bethe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1967 for his theory of stellar nucleosynthesis

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.659
(i.e., when chemical elements in stars change
due to nuclear fusion).

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.920
While his own direct contributions to advancing
the world of physics were prodigious, including

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.499
his pioneering work in quantum theory, it
was arguably for his teaching ability that

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:23.269
Sommerfeld was most revered in his lifetime,
with Albert Einstein once remarking, “What

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.430
I especially admire about you is that you
have, as it were, pounded out of the soil

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.829
such a large number of young talents.”

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.719
Mathematician Morris Kline further stated
of Sommerfeld that he “was at the forefront

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.969
of the work in electromagnetic theory, relativity
and quantum theory and he was the great systematizer

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.139
and teacher who inspired many of the most
creative physicists in the first thirty years

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.680
of this century.”

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.480
Famed Jewish mathematician, physicist, and
Nobel Prize winner Max Born (who was forced

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.439
to flee Germany in 1933) went on about Sommerfeld’s
talent for cultivating young minds who so

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.219
often went on to great scientific achievements
of their own:

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.779
Theoretical physics is a subject which attracts
youngsters with a philosophical mind who speculate

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.480
about the highest principles without sufficient
foundations.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.139
It was just this type of beginner that he
knew how to handle, leading them step by step

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.859
to a realisation of their lack of actual knowledge
and providing them with the skill necessary

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.280
for fertile research.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.639
… He had the rare ability to have time to
spare for his pupils, in spite of his duties

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.889
and scientific work.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.050
… In this friendly and informal way of teaching
a great part was played by invitations to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.860
join a skiing party on the ‘Sudelfeld’
two hours by rail from Munich.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.949
There he and his mechanic … were joint owners
of a ski hut.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.449
In the evenings, when the simple meal was
cooked, the dishes were washed, the weather

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.639
and snow properly discussed, the talk invariably
turned to mathematical physics, and this was

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.870
the occasion for the receptive students to
learn the master’s inner thoughts.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.860
Going on about the man himself, Born stated,

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.340
Arnold Sommerfeld was one of the most distinguished
representatives of the transition period between

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.030
classical and modern theoretical physics.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.060
The work of his youth was still firmly anchored
in the conceptions of the nineteenth century;

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.389
but when in the first decennium of the century
the flood of new discoveries, experimental

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.060
and theoretical, broke the dams of tradition,
he became a leader of the new movement, and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.280
in combining the two ways of thinking he exerted
a powerful influence on the younger generation.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.050
This combination of a classical mind, to whom
clarity of conception and mathematical rigour

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.259
are essential, with the adventurous spirit
of a pioneer, are the roots of his scientific

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.050
success, while his exceptional gift of communicating
his ideas by spoken and written word made

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.639
him a great teacher.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.550
Adding to his list of achievements, Sommerfeld
eventually became chair of the Deutsche Physikalische

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.319
Gesellschaft in 1918, a position previously
held by Albert Einstein.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.430
With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany,
however, Sommerfeld was forced to watch many

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.440
of his esteemed colleagues have to flee the
country.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.550
As the aforementioned Morris Kline notes,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.580
Sommerfeld’s life was saddened toward the
end of his career by events in Germany.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.000
Anti-Semitism, always present in that country,
became virulent in the Hitler period and Sommerfeld

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.610
was obliged to witness the emigration of famous
colleagues, including Einstein.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.599
All he could do was use the friendships he
had built up during a one-year stay in the

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.270
United States and a one-year round-the-world
trip to help place the refugees.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.199
The loss of so many of its best men in this
way together with World War II, destroyed

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.789
the scientific strength of Germany, and Sommerfeld
felt obliged to continue teaching until 1947,

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.729
long after the usual retirement age of 65.

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.410
On that note, Sommerfeld had intended to retire
much earlier, in 1936, putting forth one of

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.140
his prized pupils, the aforementioned Nobel
Prize winner Werner Heisenberg, as his hoped

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.140
successor.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.069
However, as Heisenberg, like Sommerfeld, was
considered by the Nazi party to be a Jewish

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.520
sympathizer, ultimately the decidedly unaccomplished
anti-Semite Wilhem Muller, with a lot of help

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.819
from the Reich Education Ministry, was very
controversial appointed to replace Sommerfeld

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.039
as Professor of Theoretical Physics, despite
Muller not even being a theoretical physicist.

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.770
(Unsurprisingly, Muller was dismissed from
the position in 1945 as a part of the denazification

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.990
process that followed WWII.)

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.070
As for Sommerfeld’s once patriotic views,
he wrote to Einstein shortly after Hitler

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.070
took power,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.210
I can assure you that the misuse of the word
‘national’ by our rulers has thoroughly

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.879
broken me of the habit of national feelings
that was so pronounced in my case.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:18.599
I would now be willing to see Germany disappear
as a power and merge into a pacified Europe.

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:23.050
In any event, as for his own Nobel Prize aspirations,
as alluded to, Sommerfeld’s contributions

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.289
to theoretical physics were many and included
groundbreaking work in quantum theory (including

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:34.449
co-discovering the Sommerfeld-Wilson quantization
rules in 1915), electromagnetism and hydrodynamics,

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.490
and significantly advanced knowledge of X-ray
wave theory, among other things.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.210
Among his many awards were the Max-Planck
Medal, the Lorentz Medal and the Oersted Medal,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.030
and he was also a member of the Royal Society,
the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.990
Indian Academy of Sciences and the Academy
of Sciences of the USSR.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.860
However, although he was nominated an astounding
and record setting 84 times (the only other

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.620
person close is Otto Stern, who was nominated
82 times before finally winning in 1943),

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.820
Sommerfeld never won a Nobel Prize.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.820
His nominations for Physics were made in 1917,
1918, 1919 (twice), 1920, 1922 (four times),

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.820
1923 (twice), 1924, 1925 (six times), 1926
(three times), 1927 (three times), 1928 (three

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.820
times), 1929 (nine times), 1930 (four times),
1931 (twice), 1932 (five times), 1933 (eight

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.820
times), 1934 (six times), 1935, 1936 (twice),
1937 (eight times), 1940, 1948, 1949 (three

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.820
times), 1950 (three times) and 1951 (four
times).

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.849
Sommerfeld died on April 26, 1951 at the age
of 82 as a result of a traffic accident that

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:11.379
occurred while taking his grandchildren for
a walk.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.969
At the time, he was quite hard of hearing
and did not hear shouted warnings before he

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:16.720
stepped in front of a moving truck.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:34.880
The distinguished scientist died two months
later as a result of the injuries sustained

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:47.209
in that incident.
