00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.000
Probably the last piece of advice for millennials
I’ll give is: resist any attempts to make

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.490
this about your choices rather than your options.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.279
We get blamed for every single thing that
happens to us, that when we live far away

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.739
from work it’s “because we want to be
suburbanites,” and when we job hop to get

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.869
higher wages it’s “because we’re flighty,”
and when we live with our parents because

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.500
we have to, because the rent is too high,
it’s “because we’re lazy and we just

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.879
want to play video games all day.”

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.190
Next time anyone brings up anything about
your choices, tell them about how your options

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.190
have changed.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.780
Our options are objectively much more difficult
now than they were for our parents.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.579
Look up any statistic about wages, about the
prices of housing, healthcare and education,

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.579
about what kinds of jobs are available, and
it is objectively worse now.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.289
It is not your fault.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.329
It is the fault of the people who are not
interested enough to find out how things have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.860
actually changed in this country.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.690
I think it’s important to have a reality
check that most humans want a level of security

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.280
and most humans want prosperity for themselves
and their families.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.830
And so when we say things like, “Millennials
don’t want to work,” or “millennials

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.780
want to move jobs every couple years,” what
we’re oftentimes expressing is that millennials

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.290
are working in an economy where they HAVE
to, where there’s all kinds of economic

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.780
data showing that if you want a raise the
best way to do that is to switch jobs.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.880
So for a lot of us that are paying off our
student debts and paying way too much in rent—we

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.920
need to move jobs.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.970
You don’t have to justify your life to get
a raise.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.440
If your company is employing you they are
making money off of you, you are entitled

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.540
to some percentage of that money.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.530
If bosses say they can’t afford you, then
threaten to leave—or leave!

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.150
I don’t see any reason – I think it’s
very important to keep in mind that your company

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.750
is fundamentally not loyal to you even if
the people are nice and even if your boss

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.360
is great; your company, the minute they need
to let you go, they will let you go.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.379
And it’s time for you to have the same relationship
to them.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.030
So frankly you do not have to tell your boss
about your student loans, you do not have

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.829
to tell your boss about your high rent, you
should go into your boss’s office every

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.909
year and tell him you should get paid more,
because you deserve it, and he is making money

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.310
off of you and you deserve a huge chunk of
that.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.349
So I don’t think we should fall into the
trap of trying to use our poverty to get more

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.310
money out of our companies; I think we need
to hold them accountable to the fact that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.319
they are making money off of our labor and
we are entitled to a percentage of it.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.450
So I think we often times talk about economic
circumstances as if they are the preferences

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.749
of millennials when actually they are the
necessity of millennials.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:02.680
So I think if you want to retain millennial
workers, treat them as people.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.659
Consider that they are the same as people
in their 40s and 50s: they want a decent life,

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.510
they want a pension, they want pay, they want
to feel like they have meaning in their lives.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.670
And give them that.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.099
I mean we don’t - I don’t think there’s
any magic to having millennial employees.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.719
I think: don’t hire them as contractors
and recognize their unions and pay them decently,

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:30.719
and then they won’t leave your company.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.890
It’s not that hard.
