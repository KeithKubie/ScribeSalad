TIM ANDERSON: Welcome to
Tech Tips From Teachers.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.510
On this episode, we'll be
looking at student tool apps.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.450
Our guest today
is Kyle Brumbaugh,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.480
from San Jose, California.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.730
Kyle's been in
education for 25 years,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.640
and is currently the Director
of Educational Innovation

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.870
and Information Services at
a large Bay Area high school.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.480
He also recently co-authored a
book on classroom technology.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.647
Kyle, thanks for joining us.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.146
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: Thank you for
having me here at Google, Tim.

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:26.970
TIM ANDERSON: How are
you seeing technology

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.550
affecting learning for students
and teachers in the classroom

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.050
today?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.550
KYLE BRUMBAUGH:
Well, it just really

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.060
has expanded over
the last few years.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.157
Technology and the
number of technologies

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:38.990
that are available for
students and teachers

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.270
has just exploded, really, in
the last three to four years,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.260
even.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.720
Teachers now have access,
and students have access,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.350
to a variety of
resources that they never

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.920
had access to before.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.885
Really, the libraries of the
world and all the information

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.300
in the world is accessible
to them at their fingertips,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.470
right at their desks.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.910
TIM ANDERSON: Very cool.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.326
And if we're
thinking specifically

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:02.090
about those student actions
like studying and note taking,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.131
how is technology
playing a part in those?

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.880
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: Well,
there's so many apps

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.410
right now that
really allow students

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.150
to leverage their
study, or to make

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.940
their study more effective.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.860
Some of the apps with
flash cards or ways

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.060
to quiz themselves,
or teachers to provide

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.022
quizzes as formative assessments
so that the teachers can gauge

00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:22.105
where the students are at.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:23.490
And the students
can gauge themselves

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.115
where they're at, so
they know, really,

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:27.670
how to focus their study on
what the things they need

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.427
to learn for that next task
that they may take in class.

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:33.260
TIM ANDERSON: For student
tool applications,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.730
it's important that developers
prioritize a few key things.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.260
It's crucial that these apps can
be used anytime and anywhere,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.440
and it's important that
they're highly customizable,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.670
and allow students to
collaborate with one another,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.480
as well.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.979
TIM ANDERSON: Why
is it so important

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.855
that these apps can be used in
a variety of places, variety

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:52.362
of circumstances,
variety of times?

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.570
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: Well, you
want to extend the learning

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.050
outside the classroom.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.320
One of the benefits of having
students with technologies

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.570
is that they can now use those
technologies anytime, anyplace.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.990
So I start to think of now that
student who was maybe learning

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.120
something in a
biology class, now

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.460
has the opportunity to, on
their way home on the bus,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.790
open their phone and go
through a series of flash cards

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.810
that now will deepen
their learning from what

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.160
they learned in class.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.626
Also, at a high
school level, one

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.750
of the big things that
happens to a lot of students

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.120
is they miss some class
because of athletic events,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.740
or some other
extracurricular activities.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.487
Now, while they're
on the way traveling

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:29.320
to some of these
extracurricular activities,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.740
they can actually study what
they've been learning in class

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.281
or what they missed in class,
because the teacher can provide

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:37.510
that content to them in a
digital format that really

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.029
wasn't accessible just
a few years before.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.070
TIM ANDERSON: Definitely.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.830
And then what about that
customization piece?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.204
Why is that something that's
so important for these sorts

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:45.840
of tools?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.250
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: Well,
the customization piece

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.791
is really important because it
actually targets the learning.

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.150
It takes the student,
and really allows

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.670
the student to
assess themselves,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.170
or the teacher to assess
what the student knows.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.850
And so the teacher
and/or the student

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.740
can target what they really
don't understand, and spend

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.400
the time learning those
skills, and then bringing them

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.720
into the whole so they really
have an entire picture of what

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.600
the learning goals are, and what
the learning outcome should be.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600
TIM ANDERSON: Very cool.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.306
And then on that
collaboration piece,

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:15.680
I feel like that's
something that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.202
is sort of a buzzword
these days in education.

00:03:18.202 --> 00:03:19.910
Why is that something
that's so important

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.490
to integrate into apps?

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.980
KYLE BRUMBAUGH:
Well, collaboration

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.870
is huge, because
you want to allow

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.054
students to work together.

00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:28.470
Because that's what they're
going to do in the work world.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.690
When they leave
school, they need

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.481
to be able to collaborate
with their peers.

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.790
They need to be able to
work as part of a team.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.580
These apps allow students
to work as part of a team,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.850
and because of that, they learn
some socialization skills,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.420
they learn how to
divvy up the work,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.920
or how to separate out the work.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.300
But then bring it
back to a whole

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.190
so that everybody has the
same level of understanding.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.440
Teachers can manage that process
by assigning different roles

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.630
to different students.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.300
But, at the same
time, or at the end

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.110
when they have a
culminating project,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.570
the teacher can now assess
the group as a whole,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.990
and really be able
to parse out--

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.740
which was one of
the negative things

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.680
with collaborative
learning in the past--

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.640
was that teachers
really couldn't suss out

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.100
which student had done what.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.840
Now, because of the way
the tools are structured,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.080
teachers can really kind of
look at what students have

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.740
done as part of the collective.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.620
And then what students
know individually,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.029
and not just what the
group project presents out

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.537
to the entire class.

00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:24.870
TIM ANDERSON: Let's take a
look at some exemplar student

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.440
tool applications.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.800
Kyle, first up.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.160
Quizlet-- why is that such
a strong student tool?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.660
KYLE BRUMBAUGH:
Well, Quizlet really

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.880
gives students and
teachers the opportunity

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.290
to create that anytime,
anyplace learning.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.540
So a student could start
off in the classroom using

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.890
Quizlet on a tablet,
and then transition

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.800
from using that tablet to
their phone out on the quad,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.830
on the way home.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.400
Virtually any place they want to
use that application they can.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.410
Teachers can actually set
up some listening skills,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.870
and some vocabulary just
using the auditory components

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.730
of Quizlet.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.930
Also, Quizlet allows teachers
to create quizzes using images,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.330
so that it can be more of a
sight-recognition type of tool.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.240
So there's plenty
of different things

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.820
that they can do in Quizlet.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.800
TIM ANDERSON: And
what about Papyrus?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.690
What makes that such a
great app for the classroom?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.731
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: So one of
the things with Papyrus

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.370
is that it's really
customizable, in that you

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.710
can go through, and you
can change the colors,

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.480
you can change the pressure,
you can change the thickness.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.560
It really is responsive to
the touch of the student

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.170
using the application.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.570
Which is unique.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.570
The other things that
you can do with Papyrus

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.800
is that you can bring in
content from other places.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.130
For example, you could
actually take a picture

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.500
with your phone or your
tablet, bring it into Papyrus,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.750
and mark it up or annotate it.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.125
TIM ANDERSON: And
then what about

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.310
with StudyBlue, what makes
it such a valuable tool

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.090
for students?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.050
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: So
first of all, StudyBlue

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.790
has a wealth of information.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.000
They have over 250,000 decks
that users or teachers can

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.260
pull from, to really
say, I want my students

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.680
to learn about this.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.400
But the other piece
with StudyBlue

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.190
that really makes it effective
is that ability for students

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.061
to collaborate-- to create
decks collaboratively,

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.310
and that they can now share
those decks back and forth

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.000
with each other, and then
share those, actually,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.916
back with the teacher.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:13.270
So the teacher can really
say, if these students really

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.140
think these are the
most important things,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.762
I really need to make sure that
I hit those things in class.

00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:19.220
TIM ANDERSON: So
there you have it.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.090
For student tool
applications it's

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.170
important that they can be
used anywhere and anytime,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.130
that they're highly
customizable,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.780
and that they allow for
collaboration among students.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.570

Kyle, thanks for joining us.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.810
KYLE BRUMBAUGH: Thank
you for having me, Tim.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.685
TIM ANDERSON: Thanks.

00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.460
