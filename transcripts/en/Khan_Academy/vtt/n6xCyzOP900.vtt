00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.080
SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with
our exercise guru Ben Eater.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.830
BEN EATER: Hi Sal.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.705
SALMAN KHAN: And we are
looking at this model

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.132
you made called Exploring
mean and median.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:09.090
Let's see what it says.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.450
Arrange the five orange points.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.730
So these are the orange
points right over here.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.239
On the number line so
the arithmetic mean

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.880
is negative 0.1.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.610
Arithmetic mean is really
kind of what we traditionally

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.700
view as the average.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.270
BEN EATER: It's the average.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.490
Yeah.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.948
SALMAN KHAN: You
add up the numbers

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:25.930
and divide by the
numbers that you have.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.640
And that the median is 2.5.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.339
And 2.5 is essentially
the middle number,

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.630
if you have an odd number of
numbers, which we do here.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.120
BEN EATER: Which we do.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.369
SALMAN KHAN: Or if you have
an even number of numbers,

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.410
it's the arithmetic mean
of the middle two numbers.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.670
It's really going to be--

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.360
BEN EATER: --halfway between--

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.526
SALMAN KHAN: Halfway between
the middle two numbers.

00:00:42.526 --> 00:00:45.230
And they're both ways of
measuring central tendency.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.400
BEN EATER: Right.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.050
SALMAN KHAN: And the distance
between adjacent tick marks

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.540
is 1.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.480
So this is like, so this
one right over here is 0.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.020
This is 1.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.750
This is 2.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.730
This is negative 1.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.351
This is negative 2.

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.850
And so the whole
point here-- what's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.540
the point of this exercise?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.125
BEN EATER: The point
of it, well, you

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.710
said they're both ways of
measuring central tendency.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.770
But we can see here is
that they don't always

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.660
give you the same answer.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.590
So we're being asked to see an
arithmetic mean of negative 0.1

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.780
and a median of 2.5.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.220
Those are very
different numbers.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.290
So how can you take
5 points and say

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.069
the central tendency
is negative 0.1.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.860
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.570
BEN EATER: And the
central tendency is 2.5.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.940
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.890
And they're just different
ways of measuring it.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.960
BEN EATER: There's different
ways of measuring it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.920
and sometimes one way is
better than the other.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.390
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.450
BEN EATER: And you
kind of have to know.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.310
SALMAN KHAN: I was just
starting to play with it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.130
and you see, if I take this
the highest number here

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.927
and I change it, I
can change the mean.

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:32.260
But I didn't change the median
because the middle number

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.700
is still this middle
number, no matter what's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.320
going on out here.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.690
And that's why
actually the median

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.720
tends to be viewed as a better
measure when you have outliers.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.776
When you have really, really,
really large values or really,

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:48.400
really, really small
values, the median

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.566
is a little bit more robust.

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.634
So if like this thing is
some crazy large number,

00:01:51.634 --> 00:01:52.925
the median doesn't change much.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:53.230
BEN EATER: Right.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.396
SALMAN KHAN: Even though
this one number being large

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.987
took the whole
arithmetic mean up.

00:01:57.987 --> 00:01:58.820
Same thing out here.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.570
If I have an outlier over here
it doesn't change the median.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.320
BEN EATER: So in this
case, it's asking us

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.410
a mean of negative 0.1
and a median of 2.5.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.470
Those are very far apart.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.830
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.410
BEN EATER: So you might
expect a lot of outliers.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.800
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.591
BEN EATER: So when
we're done, you probably

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.290
would think a lot of the points
are going to be closer to 2.5.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.070
SALMAN KHAN: Let's
think about this.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.230
Let me get the median first.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.610
So the median is
just a middle number.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.240
BEN EATER: Right.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.198
SALMAN KHAN: And so, and
here there's 5 numbers

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:21.073
so the middle number
literally has to be 2.5.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.114
BEN EATER: So one of those
dots has to be on 2.5.

00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:25.140
SALMAN KHAN: Let me make
the middle number 2.5.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.870
So that gets me to 2.5.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.620
That's got to be--

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.920
BEN EATER: You are
looking at the mean there.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.480
SALMAN KHAN: Oh sorry.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.200
Sorry.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.199
I'm looking at the mean.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.000
2.5 is the median.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.570
Median is 2.5.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.090
And now I want to get the
mean at negative 0 point

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.960
negative 1, or a negative 0.1.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.245
So let me start
making this, let me

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:49.940
see what I can do
to make negative.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.420
The mean still is
not, so let's see.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.230
Median, look.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.830
There you go.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.430
BEN EATER: There we go.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.471
SALMAN KHAN: There we go.

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:57.620
So let me check my answer.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.120
Yes.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.454
So this you see that there are--

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:01.078
BEN EATER: Yeah,
which of those numbers

00:03:01.078 --> 00:03:03.346
do you think better represents
the central tendency?

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:04.970
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah well.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.670
You--

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.440
BEN EATER: I don't know.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.106
SALMAN KHAN: You don't
know in this case

00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.411
I guess it's a, either one is.

00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:09.910
Let's see.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.980
If they were all grouped and
there was a couple outliers,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.600
then the median probably
would've been better.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.075
BEN EATER: Yeah.

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.350
And there might be different
ways to arrange those dots too.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.310
And you can play with them.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.330
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, that
would be interesting.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.390
Let me check.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.200
I got it right.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.710
Let's do another one.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.380
Next question.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.880
All right.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.815
Arrange the 10 dots.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:25.440
OK, same thing.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.770
We want the mean 3.6.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.370
Median at 6.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.420
So let me think about
the median first.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.580
So I want to get the middle
number to median at 6.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.307
The median is six.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.390
BEN EATER: You need to
drag one more dot over here

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.590
because you're going to be
between the two middle numbers

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.170
because you have an
even number of points.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.020
SALMAN KHAN: Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.561
You're right.

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:54.680
So the median is taking
them, right, right, right.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.560
So here we go.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.595
Median is now 6.

00:03:57.595 --> 00:03:58.220
BEN EATER: Yep.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.750
SALMAN KHAN: Very good.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.624
Right I had to worry
about middle two numbers

00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:01.840
because I had an even number.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.760
And now, let me see.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.780
The mean, I need to get to 3.6.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.840
The mean, I need to get to.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.840
And I can't make this one
of the middle numbers,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.460
then it'll distort my median.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.930
3 point, I guess it can
be one of, it can't get.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.897
BEN EATER: Yeah, you
can't go past that number.

00:04:17.897 --> 00:04:18.980
SALMAN KHAN: So let's see.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.610
I want to go 3.6.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.860
3.6 gets me right over there.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.860
BEN EATER: There you go.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.670
SALMAN KHAN: There you go.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.390
BEN EATER: So here,
which of those numbers

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.072
do you think have a
better central tendency?

00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:33.030
SALMAN KHAN: I would say
the median in this one

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.202
because this feels a little
bit more outlier like.

00:04:35.202 --> 00:04:35.910
BEN EATER: Right.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.510
SALMAN KHAN: At least in
this situation, the way

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.468
I have, we have we've
set up this distribution.

00:04:39.468 --> 00:04:40.480
Let's check the answer.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.240
That's satisfying.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
Get the smiley face.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.040
And you also have hints here
if someone has trouble with it.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.440
BEN EATER: That's right.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.023
And they can actually show you
maybe a different way to do it.

00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:49.760
SALMAN KHAN: So you define the
median is the middle number.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.499
Then you show dragging points.

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:53.040
So let's see.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.070
Show us an example.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.570
This is an example where the
median and the mean are both 6.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.810
BEN EATER: Right.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.190
So that just puts
half the points

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.610
to the left of the median and
half the points to the right.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.693
SALMAN KHAN: Right, right.

00:05:02.693 --> 00:05:03.420
That makes sense.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.702
And then you could keep going.

00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:06.160
But that doesn't
solve the problem.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.320
BEN EATER: No, it's--

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.403
SALMAN KHAN: So let's see.

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:09.999
And then you explain.

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.040
So you just give a little
more explanation there.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.248
And then finally, you talk
about how you changed this

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.610
so that you can get
the mean of 3.6.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.230
So let's see if you
show that example.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.000
So there you go.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.450
BEN EATER: So we just moved
a couple of outliers out.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.780
SALMAN KHAN: Outliers
affect the mean,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.360
but then the median
doesn't change.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.190
Very interesting.
