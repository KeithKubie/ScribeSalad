00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.080
XIAOLU GUO: The focus
point, but today

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.522
also so we're going to show
some film clips from my film.

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:05.980
As you know, also,
I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.630
I was writing lots of novel
for the last, say, 15 years.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.760
But this novel is
the one I think

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.374
I spent a really long time on.

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:21.790
Normally, I'm a
very quick writer.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.020
On one novel, I
would spend, say,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.760
8 months, or maximum, a year
and a half to finish a novel.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.900
Because I'm impatient,
and I'm Chinese,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.090
which means that
you can't really

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.920
write a novel that takes
two or three years.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.340
I'd prefer to die or
something like that.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.710
My patience is so low.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.950
But this novel took
me about five years,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.094
because first of
all, I write now

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:49.760
in English, which is
my second language.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.040
I'm used to writing
in Chinese, so that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.220
takes a much longer time,
twice as long as I needed.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.130
And second, it's a
novel I tried to set

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.920
both in China and in
the West, and it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.150
kind of a double love story.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.140
There's two of
lovers in the West,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950
in London, and then
two lovers in China,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.320
from China but
exiled in the West.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.780
So the novel has this nature
like a detective novel, which

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.860
I could never have done
before, and I never

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.100
know how to write a proper--
so-called proper plot--

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.880
detective style novel, because
I come from a poet background.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080
As you know if you
write poetry, it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.110
really the beauty of words, and
the flow of emotion rather than

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.400
a very complicated narrative
style, which I always thought

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.040
belonged to some male
55 years old at least.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.830
They were good with that.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.070
I'm not very good with that.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.800
So it took me a very long time.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.290
But the one thing I
wanted to write for years

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.780
is the issue between
the relationship

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.600
between the individual artist
and as a political society.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.010
This subject, you can
imagine as a Chinese,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.990
I lived all my life 30
years in China, and then

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.460
for the last 12 years, I came
to the West, mainly Europe,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.350
to live.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.199
And I think this question,
perhaps very similarly

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.730
for Russian artists, if a
Russian writer left Russia,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.910
came to the
so-called free world,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.860
you would have a similar
kind of anxiety and a nearly

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.710
personal obsession to
discuss the relationship

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.860
between individuals and
the political world.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.750
Because that's
where we come from.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.900
It's impossible to
be apolitical if you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.430
come from China or Russia.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.390
So I wanted to discuss those
issues in a novel format,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.110
especially have a love
story kind of jacket,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.080
but inside it's
something quite personal,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.520
and historical to explore.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.460
So these things are in the book,
but I hope you found out later

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.560
after I leave this place.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.750
FEMALE SPEAKER: I wanted
to ask you in the novel,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.250
the male character seems to see
the world in black and white,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.260
and the female character seems
to be more of a pragmatist.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050
And I was wondering
whether in your mind

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.150
there's something about
being female which

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.880
is linked to survival,
perhaps because of looking

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.560
after the next
generation, or just

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.170
being more pragmatic
and more linked to life.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.250
XIAOLU GUO: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.040
I mean, I would
hate to say there's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.970
a definite difference
between the female view

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.420
and the male point
of view, but then

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.520
our biology difference
between male and female

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.620
does create a
secondary reality which

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.510
is beyond anything
else, that reality,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.350
because of the physical
difference between men

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.670
and women.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.300
And I wanted to shape
a quite a big story

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.020
between man and woman.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.330
Somehow they are always
at war, whether they're

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.400
lovers or enemies.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.660
And I think when I was young,
a teenager, I was very in love

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.020
with French literature, for
example, Marguerite Duras,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.900
and that generation, the 1950s,
French, Italian literature.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.475
There was always the
idea of two lovers always

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:10.500
as enemies, whether
from the same culture

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.710
or different cultures.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.510
And I think these issues
are in most of my novels.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.769
I think my last 10
books are nearly all

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.180
about that, between two
lovers, or husband and wife.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.980
There's a great war going
on between two individuals,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.160
on it's caused by all
kinds of differences,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.730
cultural differences, just
individual differences.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.340
But with this book, I
wanted to shape the man.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.485
The man in the book is
a musician, actually

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:39.840
a punk musician.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.840
And I wanted to shape the new
generation of Chinese, which

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.770
is not very historical, heavy
handed in Confucian tradition,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.910
but someone totally in
love with the Sex Pistols,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.605
for example, listening
to the Clash,

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:56.170
all this Western pop music,
especially form Britain,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.120
actually.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.180
And that's how I was.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.930
I was totally hooked
on to that cultural

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.260
when I was 20 something.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.600
So the man is really like Johnny
Rotten in the Chinese version.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150
And therefore, he
had to be exiled,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
like Johnny Rotten has
to be exiled from Britain

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.890
and go to America.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.800
So he's really a
political animal,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.020
and he thinks the
political struggle

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.520
is all we need to do in the
art world, in music, in books.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.450
And his lover, a Chinese
girl, who in the book

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.790
is a slam poet, a
traveling poet, and she

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.890
believes in nature
and a grand history,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.160
which is beyond humanity.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.760
Nature and the
continuation of life

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.070
is much bigger than
political struggle

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.880
and ideological discussion.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.990
And in the end, I don't want
to give away the whole plot,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.850
but the woman
survives in the book.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.723
The man doesn't survive.

00:05:54.723 --> 00:05:58.550
So this is kind of a generic
perspective in my books,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.110
that somehow women are in
the end much wiser than men.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.150
But by saying that, I am, I
think, both male and female

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.020
inside.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.140
And these two sides, very
social, political side

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.530
is fighting against my
feminine, non-political side.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.110
And I think nearly every day,
I argue with myself in my book

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.110
and in my film.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.620
And I want to present those
battles in one person.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.280
Now, in the book,
it's two characters,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.071
but actually it's two
bunches of character.

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:33.000
One is a political bunch, one
is totally sensual, love-driven,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.590
lover conquers all,
that kind of character.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: In the book,
we have the Chinese characters

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.510
and also the Western characters.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.780
And I felt that there was
this idea of aliveness

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.980
that you talk about, and part
of feeling alive is fighting,

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.129
is the rebellion.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:52.670
And I was wondering
whether you think

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.730
that we're lazy in the
West, because we don't

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.130
have to fight in the same way.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.890
There are not so
many restrictions,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.300
obvious restrictions,
to our freedoms.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.092
Does that lead us to
lead a more trivial life?

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.300
XIAOLU GUO: Well, I'm sure
in Google you're not lazy.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.080
I see you work very hard,
lots of coffee in the morning.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.790
So I mean, Britain,
Germany, these countries.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.230
I think are working quite
hard, as much as Chinese do.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.420
But I think the society,
the shape of society's

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.410
rather different.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.660
Because in China, the
difference, especially

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.510
in Britain is so typical.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.850
Britain had 300 years of
Industrial Revolution.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.500
The Dickens novel,
Dickensian time,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.830
wrote about the whole
Industrial Revolution

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.160
from Victorian Period.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.470
So you had 100 years to digest
this kind of lifestyle, which

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.700
is industrialized,
office-based, and fast,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.640
away from the rural
agricultural life.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.560
But in China, we didn't have
300 years of this evolution

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.570
from agricultural to
the industrial period,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.830
because we had for
the last 20 years--

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.220
only in the last years
we suddenly progressed

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.610
from traditional
agriculture, 1,000

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.980
years of agricultural
peasant society.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.020
We had to shift,
immediately transit

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.580
to a modern,
industrialized society.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.160
And that last 25 years, from
Deng Xiaoping's time, our XXX

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.690
leader, he was the one, the
first leader after the Cultural

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.050
Revolution who
decided that we should

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.870
adopt some Western
style American systems,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.549
and introduce the market economy
to China at the end of the '70s

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.190
and especially in the '80s.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.429
And then from the
1980s until now,

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:44.920
China suddenly went
through this radical change

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.040
to modernize itself.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.980
And so I think it looks like
China is the most crazy version

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.430
of industrialization,
but actually it's

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.830
because a 300 years period is
being compressed into 30 years.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.320
And I think if you
understand that, then you

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.020
understand the Chinese
phenomena well, a bit,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.620
because I don't
understand it either.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.720
It's really complex,
and it's a vast country.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.790
And also the culture,
the way we view China now

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.870
is like a communist China.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.320
But bear in mind,
the communist China

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.740
only exists from 1949
when Mao took over China.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.270
Before 1949, it's
thousands and thousands

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.710
of years of feudal
society, which

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.870
is one with an emperor
in the imperial court,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.130
and the rest is a
feudal peasant system.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.300
And that is, I think, the
really deep, really fundamental

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:44.770
Chinese structure, which is also
collective, autocratic society

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.400
which was never, never, never
an individualistic society

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.230
like most of the Western
countries, Western cultures.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.370
So in a way, I
guess in my novel,

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.750
the peasants talk about work
and the commitment to the land,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.540
to the roots, and they
think life on the road

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.010
is a sorrowful, sad style.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.230
So that's totally different from
American modern culture, people

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.260
on the road, the
houses on the wheels.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.050
So I think these are the
fundamental differences.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.350
But yet, in a modern society,
now we are every similar.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.930
The working ethic is similar.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
it's amazing that you're

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.160
writing in English in itself.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.135
XIAOLU GUO: Struggle.

00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:32.510
FEMALE SPEAKER:
But I'm wondering

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.630
if you found a new freedom
in a language which

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.280
isn't your mother
tongue, because in a way,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.935
it's cliche free, because you
don't have the cliches to use

00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:43.380
a cliche at your fingertips.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.440
XIAOLU GUO: Well, you're right.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.980
I think in the
beginning, because I

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.210
went through a really
personal identity

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.690
crisis in a way for
some years after I left

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.760
China, which is 2002, 2003.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.690
Because when I was in Beijing,
I was a fast, furious writer.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.000
So I wrote, published
about eight, nine books.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.210
And I was writing for
the different magazines,

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.150
cultural magazines,
as a cultural critic.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.260
So I was a very
fast, speedy writer.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.340
And then I left China
about 12 years ago.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.370
I came to the UK.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.580
Because I had a film
scholarship, I came to the UK

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.710
to study film, directing.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.240
And I was supposed to
make films in the West.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.520
But then when I
can see to the UK,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.830
I suddenly had this identity
crisis or loss of my identity,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:37.310
not only as a Chinese, but
also just as an intellectual.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.280
Because I think it's not good
enough to live as a citizen.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.300
It's more dignified if you can
live with a cultural identity

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.010
too.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.500
And I think most immigrants
went through very

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.430
sad non-cultured identity.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.530
Most immigrants, say, Chinese
immigrants, Turkish immigrants,

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.700
they came here as
economic immigrants,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.780
so their daily life is just
trying to make a living.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.150
I mean, culture wise,
they can't really

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.700
write articles to express
their political view.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.020
Or they go to cinema and
enjoy theater and a film,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.570
because their life is so limited
here because of the survival

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:15.700
problem.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.800
And in my case, when I came
to Britain 12 years ago,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.059
I found it extremely lonely,
not only physically lonely.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:24.100
I couldn't speak English.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.740
I never went to any
English grammar school.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.080
So I came as an artist.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.480
And I said, well, I
could maybe survive here,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.750
but that's not very dignified.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.760
And I wanted to
survive, to continue

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.380
as a novelist and filmmaker.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:43.040
And the only way is to adopt
my second language, which

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.680
is English.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.500
And I couldn't really speak at
that time, let alone write it.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.900
But I decided I'm going to
use my broken English to write

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.130
my first novel in English.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.380
And that was a novel called
"A Concise Chinese-English

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.290
Dictionary for Lovers."

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.300
And it's a very simple book.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.980
I thought it would
be a disaster.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.030
I thought, no one's
going to publish it.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.880
And I would just
be totally broken,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.530
and I will go back to China
to return to my old life.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.230
But it was a big surprise.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.180
The novel is written in
a very broken English,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.555
and the novel is about
a peasant Chinese girl

00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:19.220
who couldn't communicate
with her lover in London.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.790
So she wrote a book,
like an English notebook

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.020
with all of the vocabulary.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.380
So it's like 100 vocabulary,
from very simple words

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.210
like full English
breakfast, or green finger.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.690
And then each vocabulary becomes
more and more sophisticated,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.780
say, pessimism, optimism,
or privacy, something

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.620
more philosophical,
more culturally complex.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.810
So the whole book this is a
little bit vocabulary notebook,

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.250
guiding you through
her desolation in love,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:57.590
and her longing to the
world, basically to love.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.600
Somehow, the book
was quite successful.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.920
And I think that was
really the moment

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.700
I said, well, that's good.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.800
I took that risk to write
in my second language,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.020
but I could continue
now as a writer.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.660
And that was the
moment I think--

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.350
I was still having a very
strong identity crisis,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.230
because as you
ask, when you write

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.550
in a second language, what
kind of writer are you now?

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.720
Especially if you're
from China, it's

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.330
very far away from the West.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.810
So I asked myself, I
am a British writer,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.950
or a Chinese writer?

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.330
So I was still living under
the nationalistic hat,

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.410
as if national identity
is your only identity.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.490
And I suffered from
that crisis for years,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.930
because I was
writing in English,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.470
and I published a
few more novels.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.090
And then life opened up because
of writing and filmmaking.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.710
I went to live in Germany for
two years, Berlin and Hamburg.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.050
And then I went to Paris
to live for two years.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.620
And I think just living around
in the European different

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.430
cultures, different
languages and landscapes

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.620
enabled me to think about
this identify problem.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.550
And now I think that
national identity can never

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.130
define an individual.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.570
I think most of you
sitting here probably

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.520
have different passports, Irish
passports, British passports,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.290
Canadian passports,
because it's really

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.860
such a new phenomenon
in the last 20 years,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:29.920
how individuals become
so-- I think no longer

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.866
you live under a one-dimensional
identity, let alone

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:35.690
if you have a different
sexual identity,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.610
being gay, being lesbian,
being transgender.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.180
Lots of people have three,
say, national identities.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.290
And I think with
this new kind of way

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.220
of living, you start
to think, well, I could

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.990
write in Chinese, or English.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.220
Or one day I may be
writing in French.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.405
But those things, the languages
no longer define who I am.

00:15:56.405 --> 00:15:58.690
I am bigger than that.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.130
I am the individual who
has all this [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.450
And I think that's amazing.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.790
We can live in different
dimensions nowadays,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.620
without living under one
hat, one rigid identity.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.924
And that's really freedom.

00:16:12.924 --> 00:16:14.715
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
actually quite curious.

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:17.380
When you think of an
idea for a work of art,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.380
how does it come to you?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.040
Because you seem to move
not only between languages,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.401
but also between media.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.109
So the novel could be
a film, or the film

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:28.750
could be a novel or a poem.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.840
XIAOLU GUO: Yeah, well,
I think because you

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.590
work in this building, you
need to collect data, facts,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:43.285
but I think with artists, of we
try to live the opposite way,

00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:46.970
because somehow those
things don't enable me

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.470
to write stories with emotion.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.580
So the way I live, I
guess like most artists,

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.820
I live quite naked.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.160
We don't belong to any
institution by choice,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.570
or there's no choice.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.220
And I think I really get the
stories from my own roots.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.650
I grew up in a very peasant
remote village in China,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.510
in South China, between
Zhejiang Province and Fujian,

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.030
south of Shanghai, which is
opposite to the Taiwanese

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.420
Channel.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.280
And I could show
you some film clips,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.329
because my teenage years in
that monotonous little village

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.869
with a great longing go outside.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.875
And I think those years
ago, when I was young,

00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:32.420
it was very depressing
in a little village,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.090
in a very feudal society.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.080
I grew up with my grandparents.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.410
My grandmother had bound feet.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.900
She was a concubine
for my grandfather.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.690
And both of them
were illiterate.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.010
They could not even recognize
their name on an ID card.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:53.650
And it was very really nearly
barbarian, a feudal village.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.150
And then when I
was eight or nine,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.490
I brought back to
my parents, who

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.100
live in another town which
is much more cultured,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.000
and my parents
presented communism

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.830
to China, which is
against the feudal system,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.560
against the superstition,
against the whole thing,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.250
concubines and
the old tradition.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.030
They are really the
generation from Mao's time.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.650
So they were very
dogmatic about what's

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.370
a good way of living, learning
and studying, non-religious.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.980
So all that, it
was opposite to how

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.580
I grew up with my grandparents.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.330
And I think that was
the transition for me

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.970
to think about what's is
really the truth of human life,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:33.470
in a way?

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.240
And I think those
contradictions are in my books

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.379
and in my films, and
especially in "I am China."

00:18:39.379 --> 00:18:41.170
And then later on, when
I came to the West,

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.130
it's another kind of-- I
wouldn't say culture shock,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.040
because it's a
cliche, culture shock.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.380
But it was quite a
painful transition for me

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.140
to understand,
adapt this culture,

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.020
and especially Britain,
it's so different

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.910
from European culture.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.690
I think Britain
has somehow carried

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.140
more Victorian tradition.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.140
The continuity is
much stronger, which

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.280
means it's tougher for
the foreigner to adapt,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.120
unlike other cultures.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.600
There was a revolution in the
last 200 years, so in a way,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.370
it might be closer to
China in that aspect.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.620
So for me, it was quite
difficult to adapt, again.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:24.900
I was thinking maybe to show
the first several minutes

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:38.660
of one of my fiction films
called "She, a Chinese."

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.540
OK, so it's a pity we can
only just see the beginning,

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.990
because it's really a film
about a peasant girl gradually

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.840
discovering her youth
and her freedom.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.870
So in the beginning, you see her
quite tough peasant background.

00:19:56.839 --> 00:19:58.630
She's dating different
boys in the village,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.530
and then one day, she
discovers there's a huge city.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.970
So she runs away
from the village,

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.900
dating all these modern
gangsters in the big city,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.210
and then she becomes a
kind of young prostitute.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.150
And then she's discover
there's the West.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:10.914
There's London.

00:20:10.914 --> 00:20:11.580
There's Britain.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.590
So it's a tough, tough
version of village youth.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:22.460
And then you see her walking
along the western seashore,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.530
a nameless seashore.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.020
You don't even know
what country it is.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.060
It's quite a bleak
film, but it's

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.590
this is woman's physical
journey, a young woman's

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.880
physical journey.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.240
It's a very bodily
experience, for also of course

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.520
a spiritual experience too.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.857
I hope you'll see one day.

00:20:41.857 --> 00:20:43.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
mean, one thing that

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.560
struck me about the film is just
how beautiful the landscape is.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.242
And on the one
hand, it looks very

00:20:50.242 --> 00:20:53.390
hard to be constantly
nagged and bored.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.056
XIAOLU GUO: Yes.

00:20:54.056 --> 00:20:55.472
FEMALE SPEAKER:
On the other hand,

00:20:55.472 --> 00:20:57.730
why would you even
travel five miles in such

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.080
a beautiful surrounding?

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.730
Is there regret after
the escape and the exile?

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.290
Like, what has been lost?

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:11.770
XIAOLU GUO: I mean,
nostalgia is always--

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.810
you might come from a horrible
little barbarian place,

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.370
but the nostalgia
makes everything

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.040
so poetic and
romantic in memory,

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.040
even though the reality
was much harsher

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.590
than in your imagination
or in memory.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.420
But nostalgia is
something different.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.820
It's a confirmation
of your roots,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.750
and a kind of reconciliation
with your roots, which you

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.970
maybe hated.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.860
Maybe you hated it
for a long time.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.060
But it's a value
system in your head.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.920
You revalue the
past you have lost.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.080
And it's like revaluing
your youth, in a way.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.830
Even if your youth was spent
in a horrible place, but still

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.390
you were young, and
fresh, and innocent.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.110
And I think that's
a contradiction

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.950
for this character.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.120
She struggled all the
way, came to the West.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.470
To the most exciting place,
to be the most beautiful woman

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.360
in the Western world.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.840
But her roots came back
calling her all the time,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.740
and made her life
totally melancholic.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.889
And that's kind of the
spirit of this film.

00:22:08.889 --> 00:22:10.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: But
even though there

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.950
is so much sadness in your
work, there is always humor.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.080
XIAOLU GUO: Oh, I hope so.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: I never know if
my reaction is inappropriate,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.000
or I don't know how different
audiences react differently

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.610
to your work, but
I know you're going

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.580
to do a short reading from "I
am China," which is actually

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.140
funny.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.080
It's also terrible.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.010
But there's often that
dichotomy in your work.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.810
XIAOLU GUO: Yeah, well, I
hope you will enjoy the book.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.100
It's quite sad a bit,
but the character

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.480
may be sometimes quite funny.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.650
I hope so for you.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.270
So I'm just going to
read a little section

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.520
from the beginning
of "I am China."

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.610
And hopefully we can have
a discussion more freely

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.410
after that.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.140
But the one thing
is, it was really

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.740
difficult to write this
book, because the most of it

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.380
is from a male, very angry
male punk's point of view.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.150
And the novel is based on
the letters and diaries

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.440
between these two lovers.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.535
So very angry, angry
young punk man, on there's

00:23:12.535 --> 00:23:15.630
a young woman, a young woman's
side I'm familiar with,

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.650
but with this angry
young man's side,

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.530
I couldn't really
get his tone right.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:24.310
And I remember, I was
reading all the biographies

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.000
of Johnny Rotten, Bob Dylan, or
Tom Waits, all these musicians'

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.500
books.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:33.062
And I thought, wow, I really
have to get this voice right.

00:23:33.062 --> 00:23:34.270
But then, they're Westerners.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.160
So the swear words,
all this is different.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.820
And Chinese punk
is something else.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.020
Actually, it's quite serious,
and they maybe never swear,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.690
maybe.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.955
So it took me a long
time to get his tone.

00:23:46.955 --> 00:23:48.455
And there's a section
that I'm going

00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:51.640
to read to you of
this young, angry punk

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.300
man who's exiled from China.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.440
He was so angry he
had to write a letter

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.960
to the queen of Britain,
because of his illegal situation

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.160
in Britain.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.620
And actually, that's based
on my real experience.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.860
I had some kind of problem
with my visa in Britain

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.080
in the beginning few years.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.040
But I didn't write a
letter to the queen.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.090
Luckily, I wrote a letter
to some important person,

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.880
Salman Rushdie, actually.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.692
So that time, I think
about 18 years ago,

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:21.150
I wrote a letter
to Salman Rushdie,

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.260
and then he helped actually
get to my visa sorted

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.105
in this country as a writer.

00:24:27.105 --> 00:24:30.300
And it's kind of a
funny coincidence.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.530
But this letter now is
very different of course.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.024
The situation is very
absurd and nearly comical.

00:24:37.024 --> 00:24:37.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.920
I'm going to open the
discussion up to everyone now.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.330
So who would like to
take the first question?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.650
Any questions?

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.450
XIAOLU GUO: Please, yeah.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:52.950
Yeah.

00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:57.160
AUDIENCE: I'm just interested in
the difference between writing

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.220
in Chinese and
English, and how you

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.370
would approach writing a scene.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.240
If you're describing
a room or a character,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.160
would you choose different
adjectives or different ways

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.730
to describe the same situation
according to language?

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.080
Because obviously, the
language is so different.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.038
XIAOLU GUO: Absolutely.

00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:15.550
It's a good question.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:20.500
It's technical, but also
so totally emotional.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.720
I always say English
is maybe between German

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.870
and English and
Swedish maybe, there's

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.586
not such a-- I
mean, you can still

00:25:27.586 --> 00:25:28.960
argue there's a
great difference,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.710
but between Chinese and
the European languages,

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.600
really, there's
no real reference,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.040
because the Chinese
language is a pictorial.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.635
The character is
written as a picture.

00:25:41.635 --> 00:25:44.400
So the Western words
are letter-based.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.710
So it's ABCD, and we
don't have that system.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.620
So another thing is
quite philosophical.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.850
In Chinese language, we
don't have tense difference,

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.090
so verb difference.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.520
And that's really painful
for a Chinese writer

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.040
to always try to find out what
the real tense you are writing.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.840
But if you have a Chinese
mind, if you grew up

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.310
in China, for you,
everything is present tense.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.530
In Chinese we say,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.760
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.550
Which means, I eat noodle,
and I go to cinema yesterday

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.730
afternoon something.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.220
But there's no difference.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.990
There's no difference
with the verb.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.920
There's no gender
difference either.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.580
If you want to indicate it,
you just put the where and the

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.060
when, exact time in
front of the sentence.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.800
And that's quite
important, actually.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.830
And the action
actually is after,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.440
after the time and space.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.830
So the most difficult thing for
Chinese is past perfect tense,

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.230
something like "I had
been" "I have been."

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.250
And you're thinking what?

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.606
But I am here right
now, here and now.

00:26:52.606 --> 00:26:53.730
What are you talking about?

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.185
The first two books
I wrote in English

00:27:03.185 --> 00:27:05.680
were absolutely present
tense without pretending

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.470
to be a postmodernist, you know
the postmodern novelist who's

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.250
always writing
everything present,

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.620
even if they're talking
about 3,000 years ago.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.180
And I wrote
naturally, and I think

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.930
it created great confusion
for my editor and publisher.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.570
They said, but this is
the past, and the past

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.000
happened in the past.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.590
Would you like to change
it to "I had been"

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.120
in this sentence and
this whole paragraph?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.760
I actually couldn't
understand it.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.815
I said, but I'm here now.

00:27:31.815 --> 00:27:34.280
And also, what about
the beat generation,

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.695
or Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg?

00:27:37.695 --> 00:27:42.450
Didn't they write in what's
called subconscious stream?

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.410
Don't they write
in present tense?

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.170
"On the Road," Kerouac.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.300
And they said, no.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.970
They don't write
in present tense.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.810
So some editor bought
a copy of "On the Road"

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.580
by Kerouac to show to me
that every sentence is

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.020
in past tense.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.190
I was in such a shock,
because I thought

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.500
that the Western subconscious
stream was always

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.150
present tense.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.030
No.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.450
Even the beat generation
writers wrote in past tense.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.170
So from that day on, I was
like, that's a real culture

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.090
shock for me to understand,
OK, everybody in the West

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.226
are living in the past, even
if you are writing present.

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:19.720
So it was totally
philosophical, and it's painful,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.530
especially for me,
because I never went

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.940
to any English grammar school.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.560
So I'm self-taught.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.690
To form a sentence
in your book, say,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:36.450
he had been painting the wall
while I entered his house,

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:39.100
took me 10 years to make
a sentence like that.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.230
Because in Chinese,
you would say,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.450
he paint-- he doesn't paints.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.290
He doesn't paints.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.580
He paint.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.450
So in Chinese, there's
no S, no verb change.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.850
He paint the house when I
enter the room three days ago,

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.740
2013, or something
like that, whatever.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.340
So very simple grammar, but
the difficulty with Chinese

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.140
is complicated characters.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.590
And that is the tough bit.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.839
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's quite
interesting in "I am China"

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:08.702
that you actually have images
of the writing in the original.

00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:09.785
XIAOLU GUO: Exactly, yeah.

00:29:09.785 --> 00:29:11.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Obviously,
I don't understand

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.540
what these scrawls mean, but
you can gauge the personality

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.070
by the calligraphy, even if
you don't understand anything.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.020
XIAOLU GUO: Exactly.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.371
And I think that's something,
in China in the old days,

00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:27.870
if your mother tried to arrange
a marriage for her daughter,

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.911
the mother would always
says, this is a good man,

00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:31.700
because his calligraphy
is beautiful.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.830
And that means he's very
culture and civilized.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.960
And calligraphy, the
handwriting with a brush,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.850
how you write characters,
is the biggest virtue,

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.890
the biggest value of a man.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.800
And nowadays, any Chinese
can type ABCD, and then

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.594
on the computer, well,
10 different choices

00:29:50.594 --> 00:29:51.760
for the characters jump out.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.990
You can click number five, and
then find the words in Chinese.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.870
And I think the computer
technology's absolutely

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.350
changed the culture.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.900
So you no longer write.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.970
You no longer need to
write beautiful calligraphy

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.870
as a great virtue of a man.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.260
You just need to type ABCD.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.725
And also, I think it's
incredible that's as a culture,

00:30:11.725 --> 00:30:14.360
we made the Chinese
to able to understand

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.520
the Western culture, English
culture, but not the other way

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.020
around.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.290
Because for us to
use computers means

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.150
we have to understand
English in order

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.470
to cooperate our Chinese
writing on the computer.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.660
But not you, in the West, so
you just need to know ABCD,

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.080
but you don't need to learn all
the 20,000 Chinese characters.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.650
And I think that also
imbued, in a way,

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.620
a cultural inequality to
understand each other.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.760
So if you talk about from
a Western point of view,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760
it might be dangerous for
you, because you don't

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.060
learn the other way around.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.630
So in a way, you might need
to learn a bit of Chinese

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.530
too, in order to match
the Chinese mind.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.060
And of course an adjective is
actually the secondary problem.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.500
I think the verb is a huge,
huge struggle for Chinese

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.624
to write and to speak.

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:01.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: More questions?

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.074
XIAOLU GUO: Yeah, please.

00:31:03.074 --> 00:31:03.990
Is there a microphone?

00:31:07.746 --> 00:31:10.730
AUDIENCE: Who are the filmmakers
that particularly inspire you?

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.118
XIAOLU GUO: The filmmakers?

00:31:12.118 --> 00:31:14.521
AUDIENCE: Yeah, who are the
particular filmmakers that

00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:15.270
have inspired you?

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.410
XIAOLU GUO: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.720
I love lots of filmmakers.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.450
It's is funny, because I started
to write when I was very young,

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.460
13, 14 years old.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.370
I published my poems and
stories when I was 14.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.390
But I didn't want to go to
university to study literature,

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:34.535
because I was this very
calculating person,

00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:35.410
a calculating person.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.400
I thought, I already
know how to write,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.395
but I don't know
how to make films.

00:31:39.395 --> 00:31:42.940
And filmmaking is the most
fashionable thing in the 1990s,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.990
and still in a way.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.440
And I thought I was desperate to
try to learn how to make film.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.470
And that's why I was in
a film school in China

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:53.260
and in the UK for
12 years altogether.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.990
And you can imagine, I really
lived with those old films,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.680
especially '50s, '60s.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.580
And I love a lot of them,
especially European filmmakers

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.850
in from the 1950s, say Jean-Luc
Godard, Jean Rouch, Chris

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.850
Marker, lots of
documentary filmmakers,

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.700
because I'm very into the
film as they're making it.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:18.990
But of course, the Italian
filmmakers, Pasolini, and also

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.940
Fassbinder, the
German filmmakers.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.840
But the old
Hollywood time, which

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.850
I think more or
less everyone loved,

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.680
because they carried
the good tradition

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.560
in the old days in Hollywood,
Billy Wilder, for example.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.060
And the modern ones, of course.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.990
It's common.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.760
Nearly everybody loves
Kubrick, for example,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.890
and Coppola, all
these filmmakers.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:44.340
But my filmmaking, really,
you saw those clips.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.270
They have more of
a European identity

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.780
than a Chinese identity.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.590
Because the culture
and heritage I

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.200
got is really the
Western literature

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.150
and the Western film.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.300
And I loved those things
when I was a teenager.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.340
So I was really from that
kind of modern generation

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.780
that grew up after the
Cultural Revolution.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.560
And we were very attracted to
especially European culture.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.200
And I think that was the reason
I came to Europe 12 years ago.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.070
I thought, why would
I stay in China

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.680
and make second-hand films
look like Western films?

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.130
Why don't I come to the West and
have the first-hand education?

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.580
And I wanted to be
in that environment,

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.050
and to have more genuine stuff.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.950
And in a way, there's a negative
side with Chinese literature

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.080
and cinema.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.000
We are imitating the
Weston literature style,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.500
and the Western filmmaking,
because the modern form

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.890
has really come from the West
in the last, say, 100 years.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.100
And before that, it was another
type, another narrative.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.520
So for me, it makes sense.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.230
I'm now in the West,
because the stuff I like,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.120
the literature style, the film
style is really from this land

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.250
rather than from the East.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.708
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Any more questions?

00:33:59.226 --> 00:34:00.110
Is that it?

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.690
XIAOLU GUO: How many
minutes do we have?

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think we can wrap up.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.350
So thank you very, very much.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:12.750
If you would like to
have your books signed,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.830
then Xiaolu will
be here for you.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.220
So please give a round
of applause for Xiaolu.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.970
[APPLAUSE]
