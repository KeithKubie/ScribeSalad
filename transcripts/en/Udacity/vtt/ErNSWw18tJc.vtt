00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
As a final question, I will now tell you that in a different election

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where the same pie chart is correct we had a total of 240,000 voters,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is the sum of all votes cast.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Assuming that this pie chart here is correct, can you tell me how many votes

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
are cast for each of the parties?
