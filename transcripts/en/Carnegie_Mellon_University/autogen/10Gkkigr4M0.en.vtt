the question with any technology that
has both tremendous benefits and

largely populated by people who are
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.279
largely populated by people who are
willing to try a new thing and basically

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289

that we feel phenomenologically as

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280
that we feel phenomenologically as
 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.050
that we feel phenomenologically as
boredom curiosity and flow one of the

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060
boredom curiosity and flow one of the
 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.220
boredom curiosity and flow one of the
really amazing things that we've

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.230
really amazing things that we've
 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.930
really amazing things that we've
uncovered is some of the neuroscience

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940
uncovered is some of the neuroscience
 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.850
uncovered is some of the neuroscience
that supports this perspective and

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:45.860
that supports this perspective and
 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.040
that supports this perspective and
there's some really provocative evidence

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050
there's some really provocative evidence
 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.960
there's some really provocative evidence
that suggests that the same neural

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:49.970
that suggests that the same neural
 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.760
that suggests that the same neural
mechanisms and strategies that allow

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.770
mechanisms and strategies that allow
 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.860
mechanisms and strategies that allow
bees and bears to forage in the

bees and bears to forage in the
 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.140
bees and bears to forage in the
wilderness allow us to for

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150
wilderness allow us to for
 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.439
wilderness allow us to for

for information on the web so where does
 

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:02.740
for information on the web so where does
this leave us one thing that's really

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750
this leave us one thing that's really
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.629
this leave us one thing that's really
important when we're discussing agency

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639
important when we're discussing agency
 

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.659
important when we're discussing agency
is understanding what agency is and I

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:07.669
is understanding what agency is and I
 

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:09.909
is understanding what agency is and I
think very powerfully the picture that

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919
think very powerfully the picture that
 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.560
think very powerfully the picture that
emerges from the behavioral science can

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.570
emerges from the behavioral science can
 

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.230
emerges from the behavioral science can
form that question another thing that

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240
form that question another thing that
 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.570
form that question another thing that
was brought up in the keynote yesterday

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:15.580
was brought up in the keynote yesterday
 

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.370
was brought up in the keynote yesterday
was this question of what kind of

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.380
was this question of what kind of
 

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.870
was this question of what kind of
environments were constructing for

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:19.880
environments were constructing for
 

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.460
environments were constructing for
ourselves with artificial intelligence

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:21.470
ourselves with artificial intelligence
 

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.280
ourselves with artificial intelligence
and digital technology as we move

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.290
and digital technology as we move
 

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.780
and digital technology as we move
further from the environments that we

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:25.790
further from the environments that we
 

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.960
further from the environments that we
developed and evolved to cope with we

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:28.970
developed and evolved to cope with we

introduce potential strains on the way
 

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.010
introduce potential strains on the way
that we make decisions on the way that

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.020
that we make decisions on the way that
 

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.050
that we make decisions on the way that
the mind functions and these have really

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.060
the mind functions and these have really
 

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.610
the mind functions and these have really
profound impacts on the way that we

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:36.620
profound impacts on the way that we
 

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.649
profound impacts on the way that we
experience our lives and the decisions

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:38.659
experience our lives and the decisions
 

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.260
experience our lives and the decisions
that we ultimately make I think that

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.270
that we ultimately make I think that
 

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.579
that we ultimately make I think that
this finally leaves us with a

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:42.589
this finally leaves us with a
 

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:45.579
this finally leaves us with a
perspective that as technologists as

00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:45.589
perspective that as technologists as
 

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:48.519
perspective that as technologists as
policymakers as leaders we decide

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:48.529
policymakers as leaders we decide
 

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.340
policymakers as leaders we decide
everyday to me to build a world that

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.350
everyday to me to build a world that
 

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.920
everyday to me to build a world that

the fissures that exist naturally in the
 

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.310
the fissures that exist naturally in the
way that our mind approaches

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320
way that our mind approaches
 

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.769
way that our mind approaches
problem-solving and with that I thank

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:05.779

every one of our sessions has had a

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.190
every one of our sessions has had a
 

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.160
every one of our sessions has had a
panel and we've designed the whole thing

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.170
panel and we've designed the whole thing
 

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.990
panel and we've designed the whole thing
so every panel is different in format

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000
so every panel is different in format
 

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000

this final panel is really
 

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.630
this final panel is really
unconventional for us because it's a

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640
unconventional for us because it's a
 

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.420
unconventional for us because it's a
conventional panel so get ready and

empowerment to be able to take that on

empowerment to be able to take that on
the thing that concerns me is what are

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160
the thing that concerns me is what are
 

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.400
the thing that concerns me is what are
economic incentives in order to to do

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.410
economic incentives in order to to do
 

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.199
economic incentives in order to to do
that who is going to benefit from this

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:15.209
that who is going to benefit from this
 

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:18.350
that who is going to benefit from this
as an african-american I always worry

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360
as an african-american I always worry
 

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.870
as an african-american I always worry
are we increasing the economic

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880
are we increasing the economic
 

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.819
are we increasing the economic
segregation that's happening

00:15:22.819 --> 00:15:22.829
segregation that's happening
 

00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:25.009
segregation that's happening
and so that really comes down to the

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019
and so that really comes down to the
 

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:27.229
and so that really comes down to the
needs that we're going to address what

00:15:27.229 --> 00:15:27.239
needs that we're going to address what
 

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.049
needs that we're going to address what
kind of agency that we're going to give

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:30.059
kind of agency that we're going to give
 

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:31.669
kind of agency that we're going to give
people across the socio-economic

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:31.679
people across the socio-economic
 

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:34.579
people across the socio-economic
spectrum and that really is you know

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:34.589
spectrum and that really is you know
 

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:36.530
spectrum and that really is you know
other than my grad students and all the

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540
other than my grad students and all the
 

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.629
other than my grad students and all the
great here is they caused me really the

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639
great here is they caused me really the
 

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:40.579
great here is they caused me really the
the needs that that we're going to

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:40.589
the needs that that we're going to
 

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:43.939
the needs that that we're going to
enable is what keeps me up at night okay

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:43.949
enable is what keeps me up at night okay
 

00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:46.299

thank you

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:46.309
thank you
 

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:48.349
thank you
Wendell maybe this is maybe this is the

00:15:48.349 --> 00:15:48.359
Wendell maybe this is maybe this is the
 

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.419
Wendell maybe this is maybe this is the
most basic question of all what do we

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:50.429
most basic question of all what do we
 

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:52.699
most basic question of all what do we
mean by agency and empower me I guess we

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:52.709
mean by agency and empower me I guess we
 

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:54.710
mean by agency and empower me I guess we
should just define our terms here what

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720
should just define our terms here what
 

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.269
should just define our terms here what
do we mean by those terms and are they

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279
do we mean by those terms and are they
 

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.179
do we mean by those terms and are they
related to each other in any way well I

00:15:59.179 --> 00:15:59.189
related to each other in any way well I
 

00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.369
related to each other in any way well I
mean we can get into the socratic thing

00:16:01.369 --> 00:16:01.379
mean we can get into the socratic thing
 

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:03.710
mean we can get into the socratic thing
of taking these terms apart because the

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720
of taking these terms apart because the
 

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.809
of taking these terms apart because the
problem is they actually means so many

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:05.819
problem is they actually means so many
 

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:08.569
problem is they actually means so many
different things and they mean very

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579
different things and they mean very
 

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:09.769
different things and they mean very
different things when you're talking

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779
different things when you're talking
 

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:11.989
different things when you're talking
about the agency and empowerment of

00:16:11.989 --> 00:16:11.999
about the agency and empowerment of
 

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:14.749
about the agency and empowerment of
humans versus the agency and empowerment

00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759
humans versus the agency and empowerment
 

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:17.150
humans versus the agency and empowerment
of the technologies that we are are

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160
of the technologies that we are are
 

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.909
of the technologies that we are are
working with but when I look at both

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:19.919
working with but when I look at both
 

00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:21.799
working with but when I look at both
terms I actually think they have become

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:21.809
terms I actually think they have become
 

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:24.319
terms I actually think they have become
dimensions of freedom or what we have

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:24.329
dimensions of freedom or what we have
 

00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:26.629
dimensions of freedom or what we have
traditionally called freedom there they

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639
traditionally called freedom there they
 

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.569
traditionally called freedom there they
are dimensions of your degree of control

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579
are dimensions of your degree of control
 

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:32.629
are dimensions of your degree of control
and room for initiative in your life and

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639
and room for initiative in your life and
 

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:35.269

perhaps what might be most helpful here
 

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.489
perhaps what might be most helpful here
is to change the question a little bit

00:16:37.489 --> 00:16:37.499

sort of defining our terms a little bit
 

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:18.880
sort of defining our terms a little bit
but we also need to talk about who makes

but we also need to talk about who makes
the decisions and and you've asked this

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.110
the decisions and and you've asked this
 

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.380
the decisions and and you've asked this

perhaps is that I think we need to have

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:47.860
perhaps is that I think we need to have
 

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.010
perhaps is that I think we need to have
other people at the table and it's

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.020
other people at the table and it's
 

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.529
other people at the table and it's
difficult when designers are not the

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:52.539
difficult when designers are not the
 

00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:55.200
difficult when designers are not the
ones crafting the algorithms but

think that's something that he's always
 

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:03.750
think that's something that he's always
understood is that the framing of the

architects and other individuals play
very important role in questions of

very important role in questions of
 

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.570
very important role in questions of
artificial intelligence and certainly

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:24.580
artificial intelligence and certainly
 

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.899
artificial intelligence and certainly
certainly around agency and empowerment

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:26.909

thank you thank you and this brings us

00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159
thank you thank you and this brings us

thank you thank you and this brings us
back again I guess to some of the issues

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480
back again I guess to some of the issues
 

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.500
back again I guess to some of the issues
we were talking about with Chad how do

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:34.510
we were talking about with Chad how do
 

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.350
we were talking about with Chad how do
we get people from different levels and

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360
we get people from different levels and
 

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.909
we get people from different levels and
parts of society involved in these

00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919
parts of society involved in these
 

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:40.560
parts of society involved in these
decisions they're typically being made

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:40.570
decisions they're typically being made
 

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.680
decisions they're typically being made
by folks of a particular demographic how

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:43.690
by folks of a particular demographic how
 

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.260
by folks of a particular demographic how
do we get other people involved I was I

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.270
do we get other people involved I was I
 

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.730
do we get other people involved I was I
was told that I could I could be

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:47.740
was told that I could I could be
 

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.120
was told that I could I could be
inflammatory and offensive and so so I

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.130
inflammatory and offensive and so so I
 

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.570
inflammatory and offensive and so so I
think the many many of our efforts are

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:54.580
think the many many of our efforts are
 

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.360
think the many many of our efforts are
focused on corporations and

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.370
focused on corporations and
 

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.040
focused on corporations and
you know and they're hiring rates but I

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.050
you know and they're hiring rates but I
 

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.890
you know and they're hiring rates but I
I really think it's the I think we have

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900
I really think it's the I think we have
 

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.980
I really think it's the I think we have
failed as universities in order to train

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:03.990
failed as universities in order to train
 

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.470
failed as universities in order to train
the next generation I think what happens

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480
the next generation I think what happens
 

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.210
the next generation I think what happens
is as we bring in students those

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220
is as we bring in students those
 

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.830
is as we bring in students those
students perform they look very much

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840
students perform they look very much
 

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.410
students perform they look very much
like us they produce in ways that we

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:12.420
like us they produce in ways that we
 

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.810
like us they produce in ways that we
expect and things that they produce they

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820
expect and things that they produce they
 

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.549
expect and things that they produce they
produce products that are valuable to us

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559
produce products that are valuable to us
 

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.560
produce products that are valuable to us
and so we want more of that and so it

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:18.570
and so we want more of that and so it
 

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.150
and so we want more of that and so it
creates this cycle where you were you

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.160
creates this cycle where you were you
 

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.470
creates this cycle where you were you
bring in a lot of the same types of

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480
bring in a lot of the same types of
 

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.930
bring in a lot of the same types of
people over and over again and this

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940
people over and over again and this
 

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.360
people over and over again and this
isn't just race this is socio-economic I

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.370
isn't just race this is socio-economic I
 

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.710
isn't just race this is socio-economic I
think a lot of these things break down

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720
think a lot of these things break down
 

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.280
think a lot of these things break down
by zip code more than anything else

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:30.290
by zip code more than anything else

by zip code more than anything else
though I think what you really have to

though I think what you really have to
 

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.880
though I think what you really have to
have as an incentive for us as educators

have as an incentive for us as educators

to to provide the tools across the

there right now if we think about

there right now if we think about

there right now if we think about

it's not that it's a that it's a non

prior work it's it's completely off the

because there's a bigger question at

add some useful ideas about the economic

add some useful ideas about the economic
 

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.870
add some useful ideas about the economic
implications and I think it's already

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880
implications and I think it's already
 

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.239

economic implications and these are
already underway but especially if we
