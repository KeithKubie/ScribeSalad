00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:07.021
Have you ever seen

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.301
a big, red "No Running" sign at a public pool?

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:11.159
For the most part,

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.438
the pace on the deck reflects this statement.

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:15.532
But while the sign accurately describes

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:16.925
the patrons' movements,

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:18.491
isn't it true that people are walking

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.290
because the sign tells them no running?

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.171
So, is this sign portraying the pool's environment,

00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:25.763
or is it doing something else,

00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:27.932
something more powerful?

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:30.600
The difference between a statement that describes

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.797
and one that commands

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:35.553
is an idea developed by British linguist J. L. Austin.

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:37.096
He defines this distinction

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:39.316
as two separate parts of speech:

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.267
constatives

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:41.633
and performatives.

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:42.995
Constatives are sentences

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.274
that describe something as true or false,

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:46.857
and performatives are sentences

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:48.562
that denote an action.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.637
In other words, a constative is,

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.546
and a performative does.

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:55.329
To help us distinguish these two parts of speech,

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.289
let's start by examining constatives

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.457
around the park outside the pool.

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:01.507
The first sign we encounter says,

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:03.922
"The park closes at 6 p.m."

00:01:03.922 --> 00:01:06.345
After checking with a friendly park official

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:08.682
that the park does, indeed, close at 6,

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.067
we can confirm that this statement

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.809
is a true constative.

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.608
Nearby, there's a man on a bench

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:15.731
with a newspaper, and the headline reads,

00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:17.016
"Heatwave!"

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:20.024
However, the sky is cloudy and it feels quite chilly.

00:01:20.024 --> 00:01:22.522
Today's headline is a false constative

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:24.859
as it has proven to be incorrect.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.781
Before the rain starts to fall,

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.477
let's throw away our can of soda

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:30.782
at the blue trash bin that says, "Recycle."

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:32.067
It's a performative.

00:01:32.067 --> 00:01:33.565
Performatives are sentences

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.823
that are meant to inspire actions.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:37.702
Rather than conveying a message,

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:39.229
it acts upon the world,

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.661
it does something.

00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:43.249
In this case, the performative of "Recycle"

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.113
is requesting people to put their trash

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:46.895
into the proper receptacle.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.258
Words not only bring about actions,

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:51.732
sometimes words themselves are actions.

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:54.484
This is what is known as speech acts.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.869
These actions include, but are not limited to,

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.649
ordering,

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:58.477
promising,

00:01:58.477 --> 00:01:59.436
apologizing,

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.397
warning,

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:01.279
sentencing,

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.142
christening,

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.781
and even marrying.

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:06.147
Take a look at the wedding near the gazebo.

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:08.532
The couple says the words, "I do."

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.202
The speech act here are the words, "I do."

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:13.623
These words cause them to marry one another.

00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:15.568
"I do" has acted upon them

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:17.729
and profoundly changed their world.

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.541
However, performatives depend

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.327
on context and reception.

00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:23.820
These are known as felicity conditions.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.980
Imagine if the mayor showed up to the wedding

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.145
and said, "By the power vested in me

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:29.336
as mayor of the city,

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.499
I name this gazebo 'The Mayor's Pizza Palace.'"

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.097
His words would be a speech act

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:35.927
by which he named the gazebo.

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:37.520
And because he's the mayor,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.622
the gazebo would be known by its new name.

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:41.366
But if someone who isn't the mayor,

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.176
just a normal passerby,

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:45.759
decides to name the gazebo after her favorite cat,

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.381
the chances are the name would not change.

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:50.630
Felicity conditions are the rules

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.734
under which the performative can be enacted.

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.540
These are fairly logical.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.904
The performative should have proper authority,

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:58.037
it should be understood,

00:02:58.037 --> 00:02:59.229
it should be clear,

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.483
and it should be able to be executed.

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:04.152
If the performative doesn't meet these conditions,

00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.204
then it doesn't have the power

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.114
to denote action.

00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:09.870
But just because a performative meets its conditions

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.039
and is clearly stated,

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.581
doesn't mean that it's implicitly followed.

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:14.510
Back at the pool,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.455
a rowdy group of teenagers races to the high dive.

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:19.087
"No running" does not seem

00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:20.422
to have power over them,

00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:22.056
and they'll have to face the consequences

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:24.400
of breaking this performative.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.114
They may even have to force out

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:27.560
some performatives of their own,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.705
such as apologizing to the life guard

00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:31.102
and promising to never run again.

00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:32.353
Maybe the life guard will respond

00:03:32.353 --> 00:03:33.639
with another performative,

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.652
sentencing them to be banished from the pool

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:37.261
for the rest of the day.

00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:39.283
After all, these teenagers must learn

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:41.568
to respect the power of words.
