00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:08.840
MARCIA NUNES: Hi.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.000
Happy Women's Day.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.790
So I'm Marcia Nunes.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.710
And as Karen said, I am
the merchandising manager

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.140
for Google Play
in Latin America.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.780
So what that means is I pick
what apps and games and books

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.310
and movies and music we
feature in the region.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.270
And I'm also a movie producer.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.570
So I-- oh, yeah, is this better?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.330
OK.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.540
I'll just lean into the mic.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770
I'm also a movie producer.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.960
I just finished my
first feature film.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.370
And we'll be premiering
at the Tribeca Film

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.630
Festival in just over a month.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.950
So, really exciting.
[APPLAUSE] Thank you.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.640
And I'm here to talk to you
guys about how technology

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.310
is changing the playing field
for female content creators.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.540
And it's a pretty big topic.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.706
So I'm just going to focus--

00:01:01.706 --> 00:01:04.741
FEMALE SPEAKER: You can use the
mic that's on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:05.616
MARCIA NUNES: Better?

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:06.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.190
MARCIA NUNES: Oh, great.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.690
Sorry.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.080
I can't really get a sense of
how it's projecting from here.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.650
And this is good because
then I can move around.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.040
I'm here to talk about
how technology is changing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.120
the playing field for
female content creators.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.660
And I'll just focus on film.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.710
Because that's what I know best.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.310
But most of this can apply to
video games, music, publishing,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.030
et cetera.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.570
There's lots of
cool ways that tech

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.520
is acting as an
equalizer in this really

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.850
male-dominated field.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.120
But there's still lots
of problems and lots

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.090
of opportunities for disruption.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.920
So I'm here hoping
that I will inspire

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.669
some of you young engineers
and maybe some of you engineers

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.460
who are a little bored
in what you're doing

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.010
and want to change
something else.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.030
I'm here to inspire you to
create some new solutions.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.320
So for those of you who don't
know, women's representation

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240
in film, both behind the scenes
and in the stories themselves,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.057
is really, laughably, low.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.390
I don't know if anybody watched
the Oscars last weekend.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.120
But Cate Blanchett talked about
this in her acceptance speech.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.400
She said, "to those of us in
the industry who are still

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.640
foolishly clinging to the idea
that female films with women

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.940
at the center are niche
experiences-- they are not.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.450
"Audiences want to see them.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.180
And in fact, they earn money.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.710
The world is round, people."

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.840
So let me just tell you
guys a bit about the numbers

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.990
to give you a sense of the
issue that we're facing.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.670
Of the 250 top-grossing films in
the US in 2011, only 5% of them

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.340
were directed by women.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.900
Only 14% of them were
written by women.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.550
And only 25% of the
producers were women.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.410
So these numbers have
fluctuated very little

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.080
since 1998, which means that the
traditional Hollywood model is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.515
a huge impediment to access
for women filmmakers.

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:57.970
And why is that?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.590
So trying to figure that out.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.760
Last year, the Sundance
Institute and Women In Film

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.650
did a study called, "Exploring
the Barriers for Opportunities

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.084
for Women Filmmakers."

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:07.750
And they went through
all these numbers.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.749
And they also interviewed
hundreds of filmmakers

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.200
to try and get a
sense of the problems.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.270
And from this study,
from these interviews,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.370
five main barriers
to entry emerged.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.180
The first two go together.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.900
And they're, gendered
financial barriers

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.002
and male-dominated networks.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:23.960
So what does this mean?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.600
That in movies, as in most other
things, men control the money.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.740
So if the men are in charge
of the funding sources

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.830
and these male
financiers are not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.425
as interested in
women's stories,

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:37.050
women's stories are
not getting funded.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.040
And they're not getting seen.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.300
The other issue is that
female-centric projects

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.000
are perceived to lack
commercial viability.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.920
So traditionally,
the assumption is

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.965
that women will go watch
"Thor" and "The Avengers"

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:51.820
and other male-centered films.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.890
But men are not going
to do the same thing

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.160
for female-centered films.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.310
Now, last year, two
of the biggest hits

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.970
were "Frozen," which is awesome,
by the way, and "Hunger Games,"

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.350
obviously proving this wrong.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.310
Before that, you
had "Bridesmaids."

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.180
You had "Twilight."

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.970
You have tons of
examples that show

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.030
that female-centric
films do make money.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.910
But still, Hollywood sticks
to the old assumptions.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.480
And the slate skews highly male.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.920
So some of the other problems
that female filmmakers are

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.370
faced with is
stereotyping onset,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.190
meaning that people don't think
women can direct action scenes,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.980
even though Catherine Bigelow
has been doing it for years.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.480
And people don't
think females can

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.870
direct huge crews full of men.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.110
Lack of work and family
balance-- which we know

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.170
is an issue everywhere.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.380
And exclusionary
hiring decisions--

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.900
So Katherine Hardwick,
who's the director

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.640
of the "Twilight" franchise,
has spoken pretty openly

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.799
about being denied studio jobs.

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:52.090
Because they just wouldn't
trust a woman with a project

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.099
that's very large.

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.640
And you guys might
be thinking, well,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.860
I kind of like "Thor," I
kind of like "Avengers."

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.910
I think things in
film are pretty good.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.420
Why should I work
to change this?

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.780
Why should I be
creating platforms

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.320
that will help
female filmmakers?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.440
And I think that it's because
if we consider our culture

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.175
to be a reflection
of who we are,

00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:13.900
to have a film culture
without women's voices

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.860
contributing a
significant amount

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.580
is a really limited reflection
of who we are as a whole.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.040
And it's also a reflection--
you can see this

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.980
because in the top 250 movies,
again, of 2011, only 11%

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.330
of the main
characters were women.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.660
78% were men.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.430
And in another study
of over 900 movies,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.150
they found that violence,
blood, gore, weapons,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.790
they were much less
likely to be seen

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.350
in a female-driven project.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.400
And thought-provoking
topics were much more

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.270
likely to be seen.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.900
And having women in lead
positions in film also

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.440
increases the overall
number of women

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.080
that are working on a project.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.910
So the Sundance
Institute found that when

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.480
a man directs a film, on average
23% of the key positions,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.750
meaning producers, writers,
editors, cinematographer--

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.100
only 23% of those positions
are held by women.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.990
When a woman directs a
film, 44% of those roles

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.950
are held by women.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.260
This is a much better ratio.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.100
And we're creating
jobs for more women.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.650
So what are some solutions
to even the playing field?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.530
The same women that offered
up the five barriers to entry

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.570
also suggested the
following-- improving access

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.420
to finance, mentoring
and encouragement

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.870
for early career women,
and raising awareness

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.200
of the problem, like
I'm here doing today.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.100
So how is tech helping
to address some of these?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.200
Firstly, access
to funding-- we're

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.030
all probably familiar
with crowd funding, where

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.380
you fund or partially fund
your project with support

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.090
from your future audience,
people who are already

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.720
interested in the product.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.770
So Kickstarter's the big
one that we've all heard of.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.120
There's also tons
of other models.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.230
Kickstarter and Indiegogo
mostly are rewards-based.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.970
People contribute in
exchange for prizes.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.160
They don't expect to
get their money back.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.430
There is Slated
and IndieVest that

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.632
are now, with the JOBS
Act, raising money

00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:11.715
through crowd funding, but
for equity investments.

00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:13.940
So people do get
their money back.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.450
And there's one
called CineCoup that's

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.070
kind of an audience
participation, American Idol

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.150
film competition, where people
post trailers, the audience

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.260
votes on them.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.150
And the best one gets
funded by the company.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.650
And there's one
called Seed&amp;Spark,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.910
which is focused on
female-driven films.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.967
And it's also a nonexclusive
distribution platform.

00:07:34.967 --> 00:07:36.550
And they curate it,
so that you really

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.900
have to prove to them that
you can attract an audience.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.150
You have to prove your vision
to them before they even

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.525
let you start your
crowd funding.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.590
So it's pretty cool.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.390
There hasn't yet been a study of
how many crowd-funded films are

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.200
female-driven.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.783
And I would love to
see those numbers.

00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:53.190
Because I think they
will be much more equal

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.780
than Hollywood films.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.140
But there has been some
high-profile successes

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.260
for women on these sites.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.240
And a big one is about to come
out in theaters on March 14.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.400
And that's "Veronica
Mars," which

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.210
is a show starring Kristen
Bell as a plucky student

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.880
detective that was
beloved by many

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.020
but watched by only 2 and 1/2
million people a week, which

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.470
for Hollywood is not enough.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.090
So Warner Brothers
cancelled that show.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.730
And Kristen Bell and
the show's creator

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.730
went to Warner Brothers.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.640
And they said, if we can raise
$2 million on Kickstarter,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.490
will you make a movie of it?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.540
Warner Brothers said OK.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.440
And it was the
largest film goal ever

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.490
on Kickstarter at the time.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.289
They ended up
raising $5.7 million

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.640
from over 91,000 people.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.890
And the studio funded
the rest of the movie,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.450
which only cost
about $6 million.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.090
So Warner Brothers really
got a good deal out of that.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.140
And now it's coming
out in theaters.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.180
On a smaller scale,
Jodie Foster just

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.090
recently narrated
a documentary about

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.260
the first female director.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.340
It's called "Be Natural."

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.470
And that raised
$219,000 on Kickstarter.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.829
And my movie raised $60,000 on
Kickstarter, which was great.

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.370
Because without it,
we would not have

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.830
been able to get the
production going on time.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.060
So we really needed that gap.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.910
Another huge
development in a way

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.530
that tech is influencing
the industry right

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.840
now is the direct
access to audience.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.510
So we all know there's a
myriad of different platforms

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.120
where you can watch content.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.500
And we're not relying on
linear TV programming.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.290
So that basically
means that we can

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.490
watch what we want to watch
when we want to watch it.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.025
In 2006, Chris Anderson wrote
a book called, "The Long Tail."

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:35.590
And the book is about how with
the rise on my distribution

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.510
there is going to be the demise
of the hit-driven mindset,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.720
which for movies means those
tent pole action movies.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.600
And what he was saying is that
on stores like Google Play

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.980
and iTunes and
Amazon and Netflix,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.430
people can browse
the infinite isle.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.800
And that is a digital store
with limitless inventory

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.470
It means that you don't have
to watch the blockbusters that

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.470
are always in your face.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.990
You can watch, via
personalization

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.020
and via merchandising,
you can watch

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.740
what actually
interests you, not what

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.870
the studios are
telling you to watch.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.370
And you can see the
proof of how this works

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.250
and how our interests
are actually

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.610
very diverse in the
way that money is now

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.930
made in online distribution.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.175
So after the book came
out, Reed Hastings,

00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:19.190
who is the CEO Netflix,
told Chris Anderson

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.680
that Blockbuster made 90% of
their revenue from new releases

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.700
when they had physical stores.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.700
Netflix only relies
on new releases

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.650
for 30% of their revenue.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.550
So that means that
people are actually

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.227
looking for their
true interests.

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:35.810
They don't want to
watch those movies.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.410
They want to watch
different movies.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.960
And these are giving
women more opportunities

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.100
to get their content noticed.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.500
There's also lots of
fun, other platforms,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.530
like TUG, which is a website
that allows you to crowd fund

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.550
to get your movie actually
in a movie theater.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.130
So it usually costs
about $5,000 to $20,000

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.919
to get into a movie
theater if you're

00:10:58.919 --> 00:10:59.960
an independent filmmaker.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.940
And most people can't afford it.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.830
So there's certain
online platforms

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.600
that allow you to pre-sell those
tickets so you can actually

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.410
fund your theater run
before you even get there.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.690
So there's much less of a risk.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.950
Going back to the
need for mentoring

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.330
and raising
awareness-- obviously,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.840
we use social media to get
the word out about films

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.530
all the time now, from
the crowd funding stage

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.790
to the distribution stage.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.360
Lots of people think that the
big benefit of crowd funding

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360
is not only that you get
money for your project,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.500
but also that you have
a built-in audience.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.190
Social media also
puts a public face

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.920
to the mentor-mentee
relationships,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.170
which is really important now.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.170
Because one of the downsides
of relying on crowd

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.770
funding is that
you basically need

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.590
an audience to buy into you
before you create your content.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.930
So having ways for some public
figure whose work is already

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.820
widely respected to show
public support for an upcoming

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.200
filmmaker means
that that filmmaker

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.340
is going to have a much
easier time getting

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.480
funding on these
crowd sourcing sites,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.510
and getting audience, et cetera.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.500
So there's no study
yet, like I said,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.140
of how all of this technology
is impacting women in film.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.040
But we can look at recent
independent filmmaking

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.777
statistics to see
what's changing.

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:20.610
Because these are the
films that are getting

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.600
made through this technology.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.290
So this year, 3,293 films
were submitted to Sundance.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.740
Of them, 773 were
directed by women.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.290
That's 23.4%.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.000
Out of the 119 films that
were accepted in Sundance,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.730
women directed 29%
of those films.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.580
So not great numbers, still.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.740
But about six times better
than the Hollywood figures.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.270
So we're going in
the right direction.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.880
But there's lots of things that
still need to be disrupted.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.500
And like I said, TED
can't provide an answer

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.400
to all of them.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.560
But I am hoping that you
guys will get inspired, build

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.690
more platforms that can
help other female content

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.050
creators to address
some of these issues.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.800
So a couple of ideas-- one thing
that really needs disrupting

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.460
is the distribution model.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.550
Because right now, even
though you can finance,

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.550
you can produce, you can reach
your audience without really

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.550
relying on the traditional
male-centric financing world,

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.910
you can't distribute
your movie, you

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.040
can't get money for your
movie without going back

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.200
into that world.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.150
So to give you an
idea, even the smallest

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.980
of independent movies
that you'll probably

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.459
watch on Netflix or on
TV or on Google Play--

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:38.000
even the smallest
one of these movies

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.220
probably cost at least $100,000.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.830
But without going into a
traditional distribution

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.860
company, it's really hard for
a filmmaker to get even half

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.780
of that.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.410
So that means that their
investors aren't getting paid.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.980
And it perpetuates the myth
that people aren't paying money

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.340
for female-driven content,
which is not true.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.400
People are paying money.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.810
But people are paying money
for things they can find.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.240
They're not paying money for
movies they don't know exist.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.870
So I know tech can't
fix this on its own.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.200
But the more platforms
that are created for women

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.130
to distribute their films
and to collect payment

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.290
for that distribution-- that's
the really important part--

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.040
the more the traditional system
is going to have to shift.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.750
And in that vein, we also
don't want the film world

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.040
to get too niche.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.720
We don't want a world where
your future choices are all

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.320
decided by an
algorithm that is only

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.070
looking at your past choices.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.980
We want a world
where one day you

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.400
can watch "Wadjda," which was
a great foreign film last year

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.341
about a little girl who's
entering a bike competition.

00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:40.090
But then the next day,
you can turn around

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.300
and watch an explosion
bonanza like "White House

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.490
Down," if you want to.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.360
Those are also fun.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.200
So we want to open our horizons.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.370
We want to get the
most films out there.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:54.310
We don't want to trap everybody
in individualized little boxes.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.320
Crowd funding is also
still incredibly difficult

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.680
if you're not a celebrity
like Kristen Bell

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.360
and if you don't have
an established audience.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.910
So most people end up
raising their money

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.970
from their own
personal networks.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.910
So how can we build
something that

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.810
will allow upcoming female
filmmakers to reach a wider

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.140
group of people?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.120
What can we build
that won't rely

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.900
so much on your current
network, but will

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.640
look at your network's network
and that extended network

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.900
and bring people from all
of those places together?

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.930
Finally, women are
not the only ones

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.610
that are underrepresented in
the entertainment industry.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.200
Every other minority has equally
low numbers or even lower.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.320
And it doesn't do
much to just fight

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.690
for equal representation
for women filmmakers

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.420
and forget about everybody else.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.120
So we need to really be
thinking of solutions

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.190
that will allow filmmakers
of all genders, all races,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.980
all creeds, all
sexual orientations

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.260
to tell their stories.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.200
And only then will
we have a culture

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.171
that's truly reflective
of who we are.

00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:56.670
Thank you.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:07.770
And if anyone has any
questions-- All right.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.020
AUDIENCE: I'll ask a question.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.811
MARCIA NUNES: Sure.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.700
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoyed your talk.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.790
It was interesting.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.880
So you're a filmmaker
and you work for Google.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.090
All of these alternative
models, are they really

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.132
viable to make a living
as an independent artist?

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.465
Or are you going to rely on
some sort of patronage model

00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:26.345
like crowd funding?

00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.530
That sort of thing.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.960
MARCIA NUNES: Well, that's
a really pertinent question.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.140
Right now, most
artists can't just

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.620
make a living being artists.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.130
So everybody needs an
alternate source of income.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.380
I do think that a
patronage model is probably

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.220
going to happen very soon, crowd
funding, but also organizations

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.080
like film societies
that give grants

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.240
to artists and everything.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.400
I think we are going
back to that world

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.340
with any kind of
independent art phenomenon.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.670
But it's hard.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.569
I mean, I don't sleep.

00:16:59.569 --> 00:17:00.360
That's how I do it.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.650
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.670
Super great talk.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.770
I really enjoyed
listening to you.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.380
So my question-- you talked
a little about distribution.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.780
But would you recommend
any portals online

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.410
that we can go to
to currently find

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.050
women-directed and
women-told stories that

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.879
are in film or in TV right now?

00:17:21.879 --> 00:17:23.170
MARCIA NUNES: Yeah, definitely.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.710
So one that I mentioned
was Seed&amp;Spark.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.700
So that is a crowd funding site.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.850
But they're also a
distribution platform.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.120
And they are definitely
focused only on women.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.300
But I would say, also, that any
of the big on demand platforms

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.920
will have a section, probably,
that's like women filmmakers

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.160
or something that, even if
it's-- like Netflix is known

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.730
for having famously funny, very
specific categories that are

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.480
targeted exactly to you.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.180
So I think it's easier to
find female-driven content

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.230
on these sites than
it would be to go

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.990
to a actual physical store
and get it on the shelf.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.980
There's also really
great resources

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.570
by a company called
Women In Film.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.700
And that's a nonprofit that
highlights women in film.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.060
So they actually
have a great catalog

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.000
of films directed and
produced by women or just

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.250
about women's stories.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.340
And if you click
on movies there,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.326
they'll tell you where
you can buy them online,

00:18:23.326 --> 00:18:24.200
which is pretty cool.

00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.760
Well, thank you so much.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760
Enjoy your lunch.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.720
Oh, one more?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.220
OK.

00:18:36.674 --> 00:18:38.340
AUDIENCE: It's a
pretty simple question.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.670
But can you tell
us about your film?

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.780
MARCIA NUNES: Oh, sure.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.480
So my film is called,
"Manos Sucias."

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.220
And we shot it in
Colombia last year.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.990
And it's a narrative film.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.790
It's about the drug
trade in Colombia.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.467
It's about two
brothers that haven't

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.050
spoken to each other
in several years.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.520
And they, unbeknownst
to each other,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.280
end up on the same drug run.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.290
And it just takes a look
at life on the lowest

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.010
rung of the
international drug trade

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.184
and how they're not the people
that are driving this at all.

00:19:09.184 --> 00:19:10.600
But they're the
people whose lives

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.650
are most negatively
affected by it.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.430
April 17.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.310
[LAUGHING]

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.160
I'm a developer.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.250
And I've also worked
on a few film projects,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.400
mostly in San Francisco in a
group that encouraged everybody

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.630
to do these projects for
free, which is really great.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.400
Do you know of any
groups like that

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.940
in New York City that
encourages, also,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.620
just women, as well, just to
do directing, producing, create

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.659
groups together?

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:42.450
MARCIA NUNES: Yeah.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.630
Well, I know there is,
again, Women In Film.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.110
They have a branch in
New York and in LA.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.300
There's also a
really great group

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.090
called Chicken and
Egg Productions.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.540
And they're not group per se.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.840
But they're a company
that specializes

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.160
in female-driven projects.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.920
And if you have an
idea for a project,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.284
they're the people that
you would take it to.

00:20:04.284 --> 00:20:05.950
AUDIENCE: Can I also
add one more thing?

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.700
It's a little bit
related to the last one.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.820
I wanted to say something.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.580
I'm curious as to
the next generation--

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.700
because I think I'm a
little older than you--

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.790
because the last speaker spoke
about feeling not supported

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.230
in technology.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.650
And also, obviously, in film
we're not supported enough.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.160
And it disappoints
me a little bit

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.150
to hear women are so focused
on finding men or trying

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.880
to impress men and not
show their inner nerd

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.380
and strength, versus finding
men that are very supportive

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.520
and encouraging those men
to be stronger and more

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.980
confident in themselves to be
able to accept strong women.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.640
And so I'm wondering
how people-- maybe it's

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.820
a group question,
really-- are women

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.430
still feeling like they have
to really conform to this more

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.690
feminine way so that we're
accepted versus being strong

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.540
and finding these men
and maybe raising--

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.710
I want to raise
the next generation

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.910
and have friends that raise the
next generation of boys that

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.280
can be really strong enough
to accept strong women.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.240
So I'm just curious about that.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.767
What is your experience?

00:21:12.767 --> 00:21:14.350
MARCIA NUNES: Well,
I definitely don't

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.620
know if I can speak
for all women.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.937
I think that's something
that a lot, a lot of women

00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:19.520
struggle with.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.410
I see a lot of my friends
struggling with it.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.860
I am incredibly
lucky that I married

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.540
a man who lets me be my
weird, nerdy, crazy self

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.840
and sing on the sidewalks.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.680
And he doesn't care.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.260
And it's awesome.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.080
I think there are men like that.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.900
One thing I didn't
mention is that my movie

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.269
is directed by a man, in fact.

00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:42.060
So I'm here talking
about women filmmakers.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.490
But I'm working
on a movie that's

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.070
written and directed by men.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.030
And they're both awesome,
super sensitive guys.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.680
And I think those
guys are out there.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.410
And I think that the women,
not of your generation,

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.110
I think the women of the
generation above that that are

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.090
raising the guys today
did a really good job.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.830
But there's always
going to be assholes

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.420
that don't support strong women.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.034
And I think we just need to stop
giving them the time of day.

00:22:09.034 --> 00:22:09.950
AUDIENCE: No, I agree.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:11.680
I had a really
strong father that

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.640
really supported me to
do whatever I wanted.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.970
And he was a mathematician.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.210
And he just helped me say,
go do whatever you want.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.400
And my husband is same way.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.150
So I'm hoping
everybody-- well, I

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.650
would love to support
everybody that

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.120
would want to find a man that's
stronger versus you needing

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.870
to feel like you
have to be less.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.200
So anyway, I was just curious.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.400
Thank you.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.150
[APPLAUSE]
