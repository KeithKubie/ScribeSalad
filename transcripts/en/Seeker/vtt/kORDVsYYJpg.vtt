00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.729
If Candy Crush and other games feel like insidious
mind control devices, it's only because they

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.940
are.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.020
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and Candy Crush
is the current champ for most addictive to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.840
the human population- it's got 93 million
daily players and is installed on half a billion

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
people's phones.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.840
You probably either play it and love it, or
played it, hated it, and still played it longer

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.410
than you meant to.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.570
What makes it so addictive?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.730
Let's talk about the Skinner Box.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.320
The Skinner Box is an experiment where some
sort of animal in a small cage presses a lever

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320
and gets a treat.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320
Or an electric shock.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.140
Researchers can change how often a lever press
results in a treat to do all kinds of things

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.910
to the animal- you could make it totally uninterested
in the lever, or you could make it so the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.300
animal obsessively presses it all the time.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.289
And neither has to mean the animal doesn't
get shocked.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.300
Get where I'm going?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.889
Every time you win in a game, your brain gives
you a little bit of dopamine.

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.159
Some good reward feelings.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.629
By keeping you winning early on and then making
it harder and harder, games trigger some addictive

00:00:58.629 --> 00:00:59.629
tendencies.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.670
It also makes losing hurt- you want to go
back to winning.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.059
Winning was awesome.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.990
Free-to-play games like candy crush require
some sort of currency like lives or energy.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.390
Lose all your energy and WHOOPS, you can't
play for a few hours.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.890
Unless you pay to do it.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
This does two really nasty things to your
brain.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
If you don't pay for an extra turn, you're
playing into something called hedonic adaptation.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
Psychology of games wrote about an experiment-
appropriately enough, involving candy.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.080
Subjects were given a piece of chocolate to
eat.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.090
Then, half the group was told not to eat anymore
chocolate for two weeks.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.619
The other half was given two pounds of chocolate
and told "Yo, enjoy this chocolate.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.859
ALL OF THIS CHOCOLATE."

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.369
In two weeks, everyone was welcomed back and
offered a piece of chocolate.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.909
The people who abstained for two weeks loved
the chocolate.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.840
The people who were gorging for two weeks,
unsurprisingly, weren't that into it.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.840
By restricting your access to playing, Candy
Crush makes you want to play it MORE.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.439
But what if you're the sort of person who
gorges themselves and pays for the extra turn?

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.680
You're probably experiencing gambler's fallacy.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.134
That's the idea that the more you try something,
the more the odds are that the outcome is

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:07.134
in your favor.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:08.360
That's mathematically untrue.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.920
If your odds of getting into a car accident
are 1 in 10,000, it doesn't mean after 50

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.100
car rides your odds are 1 in 9,950.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.580
They reset every time.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
Pretty obvious.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.670
But our brain gets confused when it comes
to games because we believe in our talent.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.720
Our brains go particularly crazy with activity
for near-misses.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.820
You got SO CLOSE to winning last time.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.690
One more move and you would've had it- and
you're so in the zone that if you pay the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.970
$0.99 to skip the waiting period you'll win!

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.970
You know you'll win.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.420
You probably won't.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.420
Games use tricks like this to keep you in
your little skinner box, paying $0.99 at a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.600
time for a free game until you've spent way
more that you would've to buy an expensive

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.120
one that wasn't full of this stuff.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.810
Poor dumb brains.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.750
There are games that use your brain's weaknesses
for good.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.420
Jane McGonigal, the author of Reality is Broken,
created a site called SuperBetter that taps

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.260
into these same behavior reinforcements and
habit-forming tendencies to make a game that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.770
actually helps people make good habits and
recover from injuries.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.770
Apps like Habit RPG turn todo lists into roleplaying
games where you get experience and level up.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.510
(https://www.superbetter.com/ https://habitrpg.com)

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.010
I tend to obsessively play manipulative games
like Candy Crush for a day or two and then

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.200
get rid of them forever.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200
What about you?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Do you fall for this stuff?

check out my other show Hard Science if you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.910
dig builds and experiments.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.310
This week we're making $20 cardboard boats
and seeing which ones will keep the most people

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.310
afloat.
