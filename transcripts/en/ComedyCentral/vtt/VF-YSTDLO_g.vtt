00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.110 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT?

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.112 line:85%

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.218 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:03.122 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE SEEN SOME HIPSTER
PASTORS AND I THINK THEY'RE

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:04.457 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MISSING THE BOAT IF THEY'RE
TRYING TO SENSATIONALIZE

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.725 align:start position:0%
THE CHURCH.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.928 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DOES THIS GUY THINK
WILL REVOLUTIONIZE CHRISTIANITY?

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.162 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ROBOTS.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:13.299 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE SAYING THE FUTURE
OF CHRISTIANITY INCLUDES ROBOTS?

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.167 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; POTENTIALLY.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.503 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOW DOES A ROBOT BECOME
CHRISTIAN?

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.472 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
A ROOMBA, OR YOUR iPHONE

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:22.141 align:start position:0% line:85%
OR TALKING TO SIRI.

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:25.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE TALKING SOMETHING THAT'S
YOU KNOW EXPONENTIALLY MORE

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.180 size:75% position:38% line:85%
INTELLIGENT THAN WE ARE.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO ROBOTS WILL CHOOSE TO BE
CHRISTIANS.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.783 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SAYING ROBOTS.

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
 GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE
HIGHER THOUGHT, THEY WILL

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHOOSE CHRISTIANITY?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.288 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.090 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK-- I THINK IT'S REASONED
ARGUMENT.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:40.826 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS SOUNDED AWESOME.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start position:0% line:85%
CARL MUST BE PUMPED.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:43.596 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DOMO ARIGATO MR. CHRIST!

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.532 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
REALLY CARE ABOUT A ROBOT AT

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.466 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.434 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
FUTURE, THOUGH.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.969 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SO BE IT.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL GOING
OLD-SCHOOL PRAYER.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.777 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT IS OLD-SCHOOL PRAYER THE
FUTURE OR WILL ROBOTS REMIX

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.978 align:start position:0% line:85%
THOSE JAMS?

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.713 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO
PROCESS ALL OF THE INFORMATION

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:04.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON EARTH INSTANTANEOUSLY, YOU
COULD WRITE A PRETTY GOOD

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.551 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERMON.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:04.917 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SWEET.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.118 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:10.389 line:91%
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN A
GUY WITH A TATTOOS AND A KICK

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:11.557 align:start position:0% line:85%
DRUM.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.625 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS
FAR AS INTELLIGENCE GOES.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.193 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HIPSTER PASTOR SLAM.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.761 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- LIKE,
A ROBOT IS CREATED -- I DON'T

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:21.000 line:85%
THINK A ROBOT COULD HAVE FAITH.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:24.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SURE, ROBOTS COULD HAVE
FAITH.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:25.337 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABSOLUTELY, WHY NOT?

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.573 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE HOPE WOULD BE YOU
KNOW BEINGS THAT WOULD

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
ESSENTIALLY LEAD TO US A NEW
PATH OF HOLINESS.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:34.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NEW PATH OF HOLINESS SOUNDS
FUTURE CRUNK, RIGHT.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.983 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, CLEARLY JESUS IS IN
NEED OF A REBOOT.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.685 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IS THERE A NEW SON OF GOD WE
SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR?

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:40.452 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS THERE A CODY.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:41.887 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE HE TRANSCENDS
TIME.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.556 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HEAR ME OUT --
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.193 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; FATHER, SON,
HOLY GHOST, AND CODY.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHO'S CODY IN THAT?

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:51.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, MAN, THAT GUY IS A
MYSTERY.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE JESUS
ISN'T IN NEEED OF A REBOOT

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.301 align:start position:0% line:85%
AT ALL.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:56.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK HIP STUFF GOES OUT OF
STYLE.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:57.069 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S THE THING.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.271 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:02.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE STILL WEARING FONZI'S
JACKET.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.044 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY ROBO DORK, SHOW ME THE
FUTURE.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:08.247 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK AS A SPECIES, THEY
CAN USE THEIR GIFTS TO FURTHER

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.248 size:84% position:42% line:85%
JESUS' REDEMPTIVE PURPOSES.

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.684 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CALLING A ROBOT A
DIFFERENT SPECIES?

00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:14.954 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH POTENTIALLY, UNLESS
WE'RE INTEGRATED WITH THEM.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:15.755 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ( BLEEP ) ROBOTS?

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.392 line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO. LIKE A CYBORG.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LIKE IF HUMANS ARE GOING TO
MAKE SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.595 line:91%
THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GIVE IT A GENDER

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:24.764 line:85%
AND ( BLEEP ) IT.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:29.101 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHRISTIAN ROBOTS ARE GOING TO
BLOW YOUR MIND.

00:04:29.134 --> 00:04:32.638 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS SOLD SO I WENT TO BUILD MY

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.006 align:start position:0% line:91%
RELIGIOUS ROBOT, AND FINALLY IT
WAS DONE.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.278 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND SO,
I NAMED IT ADAM.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:39.712 align:start position:0% line:85%
AUTONOMOUS.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.047 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.614 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.283 align:start position:0% line:85%
MONKEY?

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:48.220 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AND ONCE HE DOWNLOADED THE
BIBLE, HE DID HAVE A FEW

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.021 align:start position:0% line:85%
QUESTIONS.

00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:51.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHERE CAN I BUY MY
HEBREW SLAVE?

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:52.425 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.859 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SERIOUSLY.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.628 line:85%
&gt;&gt; SORRY, IT'S NOT AN OPTION.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.397 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS I CAN HAVE ONE
IN EXODUS 21.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.866 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S HALF THE REASON I SIGNED
UP.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.034 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS WAS NOT GOING WELL.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:02.334 line:91%
&gt;&gt; CAN GOD CREATE SOMETHING SO
HEAVY HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:03.602 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIFT IT?

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:05.071 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THAT. I'M SORRY.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.772 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF GOD WANTS TO QUIT SMOKING,
CAN HE HIDE CIGARETTES FROM

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:07.740 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIMSELF?

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO
THAT. I'M SORRY.

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.978 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY DOES GOD GIVE BABIES
CANCER?

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:17.683 align:start position:0% line:91%
