&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.540
I'm Phoebe Connelly, the
deputy director of video

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.840
at the Washington Post.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.990
We are a charter sponsor of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.420
I'd like to start by thanking
the co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.920
David Rubenstein, and the
other generous sponsors

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.320
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.650
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.620
please note the information
is in our program.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.530
We will have time after the
presentation for questions

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.230
and have been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.690
to the microphone you will
be included in videotape

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.840
of the event which may be
broadcast at a later time.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.410
So, without further ado,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.010
our guests today are Matt
De La Pe単a and Loren Long.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.260
They are the author and
illustrator of this book,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.810
"Love", which they will
be talking about today.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.830
Matt de la Pena is the number
one New York Times bestselling

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.880
Newberry Medal-winning author
of 5 picture books including

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.190
"The Last Stop on Market
Street", and his new one

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
which is coming out shortly
called "Carmela Full of Wishes",

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.250
as well as 6 critically
acclaimed young adult novels.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.430
He received his MFA
in creative writing

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.330
for San Diego State University
and he attended school

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.630
on a full athletic
scholarship for basketball,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.500
which I think is a
pretty cool fact.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.110
Lauren Long is the award winning
number one New York Times

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740
bestselling children's book
author and illustrator.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.990
He is the creator of the Otis
series of picture books as well

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.620
as Little Tree and the upcoming
"There's a Hole in the Log

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.550
at the Bottom of the Lake".

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.600
You might also know his drawings
because he's the illustrator

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.340
of "Of Thee I Sing"
by Barack Obama.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.640
Before they get them started,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.400
they will be signing
books at 2:00 pm.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.510
So, please welcome Matt
de la Pe単a and Loren Long.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.560
[ Applause ]

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.860
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Hello, guys.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.580
Thank you so much
for having us here.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.160
The last time I was
here I think, Loren,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.460
too, it was on the lawn.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.760
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Yeah,
it was outside.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.060
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: This is
the first time they've done

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.360
it inside.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.660
This is exciting.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.810
We're going to begin by just
reading the book to you.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.130
Ready? You might notice
Loren over here drawing.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.760
He seems to draw
everywhere we go.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.270
So, Love.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.370
In the beginning, there is light

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.530
and two wide eyed figures
standing near the foot

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.000
of your bed, and the sound
of their voices is love.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.960
A cab driver plays love softly
on his radio while you bounce

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.740
in back with the bumps of the
city and everything smells new.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.480
And, it smells like life.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.650
Love too, is the smell
of crashing waves

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.150
and a train whistling
blindly in the distance.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.600
And, each night the sky

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.860
above your trailer
turns the color of love.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.480
In a crowded concrete park you
toddle toward summer sprinklers

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.790
while older kids skip
rope and run up the slide.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.170
And, soon you are running
among them and the echo

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.850
of your laughter is love.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.860
On the night the fire alarm
blares you're pulled from sleep

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.770
and whisked into the street

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.770
where a quiet old lady
is pointing to the sky.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.550
Stars shine long after they've
flamed out," she tells you,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.000
"and the shine they
shine with is love."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.460
But it's not only stars that
flame out, you discover.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.780
It's summers too, and
friendships and people.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.200
One day, you find your family
nervously huddled around the TV

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.320
but when you asked
what happened,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.390
they answer with
silence and shift

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.330
between you and the screen.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.590
In your dream that
night, you are searching

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.430
for a love that seems lost.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.870
You open and close
drawers, lift cushions,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.940
empty old toy bins,
but there's nothing.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
You wake with a start in the
arms of a loved one who bends

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.280
to your ear and whispers,
"It's okay, it's okay."

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.580
It's love.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.520
And, in time you learn to
recognize a love overlooked.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.100
A love that wakes at dawn
and rides to work on the bus.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.460
A slice of burned toast
that tastes like love.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.820
And, it's love in
each deep crease

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.100
of your grandfather's
face as he lowers himself

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.260
onto an overturned
bucket to fish.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.250
And, it's love in
the rustling leaves

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.680
of gnarled trees lined
behind the flower fields.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.060
And, it's love in the made
up stories your uncles tell

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.660
in the backyard between
wild horseshoe throws.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.960
And, the mad in rags outside the
subway station plays love notes

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.990
that lift into the sky
like tiny beacons of light.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.540
And, the face staring back
in the bathroom mirror?

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.910
This, too, is love.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.770
So, when the time comes for
you to set off on your own,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.030
heavy winds will sweep past
your building and great,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.650
great clouds will
congregate above.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.360
Your loved ones will stand there

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.940
like puddles beneath their
umbrellas holding you tight

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.060
and kissing you and
wishing you luck.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.370
But, it won't be
luck you'll leave

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.310
with because you'll have love.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.290
You'll have love, love, love.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.510
Thank you for letting
me read that to you.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.150
[ Applause ]

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.820
And, now what we're going
to do is we're going

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.820
to just briefly talk
about where we come from

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.230
and how we both arrived
at this same book.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.580
Loren lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.250
I live in Brooklyn, New York.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.150
So, we're coming at it
from different places,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.570
different upbringings.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.340
And, we wanted to find the most
inclusive word we could render

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.010
in a book and for
us it was love.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.410
So, a little bit about me first.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.360
This is my dad.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.220
He was a just a kid
when I was born.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.640
He was the first in his
family to be born in America.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.190
We call him the Mexican Hippie
Surfer because he's Mexican

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.470
but he likes to surf,
which is not normal.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.840
And, that's me, the big boy
right there, that liked tacos.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.840
So, my dad's Mexican,
my mom's white.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.450
Now, this isn't the
greatest picture of me.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:45.000
By the way I thought that there
was an undiagnosed medical

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.950
condition happening here until I
just had a son a few months ago

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.740
and he's even fatter than me.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.000
So, it's just purely genetic.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.870
But, here's my mom and they were
both teenagers when I was born

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.970
and we grew up right
on the Mexican border.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.810
And, I did play basketball
in college.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.440
I became the first
in my family to go

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.230
to college thanks to a sport.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.700
That's why all you young guys

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.260
if you love sports it
could take you places

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.560
that you never imagined.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.720
I'm just going to flash through
a couple of my previous books,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.790
Last Stop on Market Street.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.090
[Applause] That's nice.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.240
Where did I come out
on landing on Love?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.150
I just remember there
was so much divisiveness

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.880
in the country, you know, when
I started to write the book.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.340
And, I had a daughter
at the time.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.410
Only a daughter, and I remember
thinking, "What is the one thing

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.980
that we all share no matter
our political beliefs,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.040
no matter what our social
standing in the country is?"

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.870
And, I felt like it's love.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:55.450
It's the kid growing up in
Brooklyn has love hopefully.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:59.280
The kid growing up in
rural Pennsylvania has love

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.580
in their family.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.800
So, that's where I
landed with this book.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.070
And, I was very fortunate
enough to be able

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.420
to share this experience
with Loren Long.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.060
And, now he's going to tell you
a little about his background.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.090
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Alright,
so Matt de la Pe単a grew

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.520
up near the ocean.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.830
In San Diego, near the
Mexican border in an exotic,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.140
wave place where people surf.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.620
I came from an exotic
land called Missouri.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.760
There's my childhood.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.450
So, it was one of the best
things about doing the book

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.840
and actually collaborating

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.640
with the author is
getting to know him.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:50.050
I really learned a lot about his
culture by sharing my culture.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.790
You can see what I look like.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.190
Here's my dad and my mom.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.890
Nobody in my family
were artists, you know?

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.450
They liked, so this is Missouri,
then we moved to Kentucky.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.490
This is when you're
an 11 year old kid

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.300
on your birthday your mom
might put a horse when you live

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.010
in Lexington, Kentucky.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.770
We didn't wear shirts or shoes.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.180
No Kentucky jokes.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.940
Now I live in Ohio, but it was
really wonderful for me to grow

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.040
up in this environment.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.130
A couple of teachers.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.030
We have educators in the
room by show of hands?

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.190
Yes, yes, a couple
of special teachers.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.970
By this time, mom
and dad salesperson,

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.010
secretary, no artists.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.320
We didn't go to art museums.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.620
We didn't do those things.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.920
The only time we went
to an art museum is

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.930
when we visited my
grandmother in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.710
And, we went to this, I used
to call it the Cowboy Museum.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.890
It was the Gilcrease Hills
Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.370
It was filled with Frederic
Remington paintings.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.400
I wasn't an artist,
but I loved to draw

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.800
and I had a couple
of special teachers.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.510
This is my middle school,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:11.220
my seventh grade influential
human being in my life.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.550
And, I'll go ahead and straight

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.100
up just tell you it was a mostly
white school that I went to.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.620
Seventh grade, this man was
the head football coach.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.930
He was the coolest
guy in the building.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.130
He would never know shrimpy
Loren who was the furthest thing

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:31.120
from a football coach except
he was also the art teacher.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.730
I heard him say my name once
and I looked up and I said,

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.460
"I can't believe Mr.
Pennington uttered my name.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.140
And, he was holding my drawing.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.280
And, I'll never forget the sound

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.970
of hearing Mr. Pennington
use my name

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.860
and it's just an amazing thing.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.370
That was love.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.670
He didn't have to help me out

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.300
but he started giving me
a little extra attention.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.700
By the way, I was never the
best artist in my class.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.080
There was always some annoying
kids that were better than me.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.380
But, I really loved it.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.680
I really loved it.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.310
Then, I had another
teacher, Miss Clifton.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.570
I'll never forget Miss
Clifton to the day I die.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.460
By the way, that's me
with all that hair.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.890
That's me as a, like a
freshman or a 10th grader.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.670
She's teaching me how
to use oil paints.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.520
She was bringing her
art books from home.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.150
"Loren, this is Vincent
Van Gogh,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.570
have you ever heard of him?

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.240
Loren, have you ever
heard of Norman Rockwell?"

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.540
So it was very influential.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.410
I've come all these
years to realize

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:41.080
that was absolutely an
act of love on her part.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.380
Here's some of my books.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.010
One of the biggest joys

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.270
of my careers is illustrating
The Little Engine That Could,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:52.040
one of my favorite
songs when I was little.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.320
We'll go through these quick.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.970
Otis The Tractor was the
first thing I ever wrote.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.300
I never thought I
would write something.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.610
I wasn't a great reader
when I was little.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.910
It was an attention thing.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.530
It was easier for me to draw
pictures and play and goof

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.320
around than it was
to focus on reading.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.440
So, as a result I never thought
I would grow up and be a writer,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.710
and I wrote my own story
about a little tractor.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.700
And, we have six
hardcovers by the way.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.700
They make great gifts.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:31.650
And, yeah, the kid
from Lexington,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.590
Kentucky gets this phone call.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.510
President Obama, yes!

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.170
[ Applause ]

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.020
I'm living in Cincinnati,
Ohio, and somebody

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.150
from New York calls me
because the president

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.740
and his family chose me

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.210
to illustrate his amazing
love letter to his daughters,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.300
Of Thee I Sing, A
Letter to my Daughters.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.760
At that point, check
that one out.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.060
And, Little Tree.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.660
When my sons, who I feel like
are your age, went to college,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.680
I was having a hard
time with it.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.910
My wife wasn't even having
as hard a time as I was.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.290
For some reason, it was
hard for me to let go

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.910
and I wrote a little fable.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.620
And, who knows that I
could write something

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.070
but it actually gave me comfort.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.780
And, I thought if
it comforted me,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.160
maybe it would comfort
somebody else.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.610
So, Little Tree.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.860
And, then I think
we're on Love, right?

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.160
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
Yeah, we are.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.710
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: And, then
Love, and then I get this.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.700
This is called the manuscript.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700
So, Matt de la Pe単a
lives in New York,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.160
I live in Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.970
I had been fortunate
enough to meet Matt.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.370
I knew about his career.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.940
I knew of his Newbery
Medal career and I get

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.200
in my phone call from my agent,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.000
a text called Love,
from Matt de la Pe単a.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.510
I read this and I'm
thinking, "I'm in."

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.060
I want to give Love
to the world.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.670
And, then I read it
and Matt's text went

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.330
into some different places.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.980
I'll never forget the first time
I read this piece right here

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.400
and I said, and I read, "The sky

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.230
above your trailer turns
the color of love."

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.830
And, I actually said, "Did he
say 'trailer?'" And, I'm like,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.930
"This goes into different
areas."

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.800
This book allowed me to take
my art, my Otis The Tractor

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.460
and Little Engine
That Could career,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.870
into a little different area.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.200
And, I'll always be
grateful for that, Matt.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.820
In Matt's text he talks
about how beautiful love is,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.580
how you receive it, how
you start to recognize it.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.310
It's also a little
messy in places right?

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.400
Love isn't always perfect.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.170
And, I said, "You know I've been
painting the same way my entire

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.500
career for 15 books.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.280
It's time for me to do
something a little different."

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.860
So, has anybody ever heard
of monoprints, monotypes?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.280
What I did with Love,
it's unpredictable.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.550
I have a way of painting
my art into oblivion.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.280
People have to tell
me to stop, you know?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.910
Nobody ever has to say,
"Loren, paint more."

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.260
They always have to say, "Stop."

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.910
Right art directors, editors?

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:16.110
Because I'm like a working
artist, I'm going to work

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.130
on this painting until I
prove this thing is good

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.570
to the world every time,

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.430
even after I've illustrated
Barack Obama's book.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.380
I'm still having
to prove myself.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.930
Anyway, I sometimes get a little
too detailed to so I decided

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.150
to do monotype prints.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.530
So, I'm looking at, okay

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.010
so first I'm looking
at the manuscript.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.550
There's no book, right?

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.330
It's just paper, and this
is what I'm looking at.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.360
And, I'm pretending I'm a movie
director and this is the part

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.540
where it says, Matt, can
you read that for me?

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.420
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Sure,
it's, "And in time you learn

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.780
to recognize love overlooked,
a love that wakes at dawn

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.080
and rides to work on the bus."

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.210
And, originally the
line after that read,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.450
"A pair of old house
slippers that fit like love."

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.820
And I was thinking
of my grandmother.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.660
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: So,
you took this text.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.070
So, if you all got that
text what would you draw?

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.920
That's what I'm asking myself.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.800
I feel like I'm five years
old again drawing Snoopy

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.450
on the kitchen floor.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.130
There's no difference.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.600
So, I decide I'm going to make
a moment in this little movie

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.480
and I'm going to show
the child from behind

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.810
and he's watching his parents.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:32.280
That bus represents his parents
and I thought how clever am I?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.860
I'm going to put oversized
slippers and I'm going

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.990
to nail this and the slippers
represent the parents.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:44.130
But, when I saw the picture
it didn't ring true to me.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.690
It almost felt like a desertion,
like someone is being deserted.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.990
It was too heavy.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.380
It wasn't the right note.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.730
It wasn't the right
moment in our movie.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.530
So, I changed it.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.150
You can see here I've
changed the socioeconomic

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.990
of this little boy simply by the
props that I put in his room.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.380
Now, I've got a big
picture window, right?

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.730
I've got kind of a different
type of fancy drapes.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.670
I'm still grappling
with what kind

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.570
of underwear this little
boy is going to wear.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.040
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
The tighty whitey here?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.600
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Yeah, this
is the tighty whitey here,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.900
the blue and gold.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.200
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: And,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.780
apparently your wife
was not a fan.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.750
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: No, my
wife by the way comes

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.190
into my studio, which
is in my home.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.070
And, she says, "I don't
like the tighty whiteys."

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.100
And, I'm saying, "This
is authentic, man.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.650
Tracy, this is art!"

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.110
Yeah, so you can see here
I also put the figure.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.590
I put the parent
walking to that bus.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.930
And, then I felt like
it wasn't quite right.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.870
I remembered my own
brother at a time

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.780
when my two parents left before
we did for the school bus.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.070
My brother, my oldest brother's
responsibility was feeding me.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.140
And, he would always make toast.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.150
And, so I brought
in another figure.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.210
You see I've made
the windows smaller.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.140
I've changed what kind of
subject I'm making just

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.510
by those little details.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.290
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: And, so
this gets kicked over to me

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.930
and I think this is
an interesting detail.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.250
Not everybody knows, normally
when a picture book is created,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.350
the author and the
illustrator stay separate.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.140
They never discuss
any of the process.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.020
They only meet when
the book is done.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.130
But, Loren and I had
a different situation.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.540
We actually talked on
the phone multiple times.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.920
We talked out everything.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.350
And, when I got this
sketch in the mail

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.060
or in my email I
actually thought whoa,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.340
this is a whole other
layer of Love

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.190
that I hadn't originally
considered.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.490
And, for the first time

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:47.230
in my career I changed the
text because of a sketch.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.280
So, I took out the oversized
slippers that I thought

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.370
of my grandmother, I
remember from her closet.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.990
And, I said you know what, I'm
going to put this toast in.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.570
So, it changed the line to,
"A slice of burned toast

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.430
that tastes like love."

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.130
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: And, that's
my favorite line in the book.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.430
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Of course.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.430
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: It
is a good line.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.730
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
It's a great line.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.030
That's a great piece of writing.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.580
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: It was
actually cited in a review

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.780
and I was like, "Can I
take credit for this?"

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.820
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
Well yeah, you can.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.780
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: So,
just real quick,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.750
in part because of what I
told you about me being a bit

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.990
of a perfectionist, I
wanted to do monoprints.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.270
Instead of taking my paint
from my palette directly

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:35.090
to the illustration board or
the canvas, we used a brayer

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.940
and worked on glass, plexiglass.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.430
And, for you monotype
specialists out here,

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.960
forgive me this is the first
time I've ever done this,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.370
because I was trying
to jump in the dark.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:54.310
I was trying to do something to
match the depth of Matt's text.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.300
So, I would ink up the
brayer and I would wipe it

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.610
on to the plexiglass and
smudge it away and pull it away

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:08.060
and use paintbrushes to add,
use Q-tips to pull away and draw

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.040
and manipulate the ink.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.480
Then I would take it down to a
studio and then I would take it

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.150
down to the little makeshift
basement printing shop

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.450
that I set up.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.970
I convinced my wife
I should buy a press.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.250
Put this on, and then took a
piece of paper that was damp,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.240
put it down, run it
through that roller

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.830
and it actually mashes
the ink onto that paper.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.650
You come out and you
pull that paper up

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.370
and it has an impression.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.460
And, that doesn't look like much

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.830
but I thought okay,
those are my figures.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.570
That's my figures, but I
can't do the background.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.480
So, I did that on another
page and you can see the one

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.530
on the right is a real
dark background, the wall.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.960
And, I'm having fun.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.600
It's like I can never paint
these textures with my hand

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.490
and paintbrush like I've
been doing for 20 years.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.590
But, I did something
called a ghost print.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.990
That background is too dark, so
I ran that same piece of glass

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.620
through on a new clean piece of
paper and I got the lighter one.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.680
And, then, how many of
you guys do collage art?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.680
I'd never done collage
art, but I needed

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.840
to to put these images together.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.590
So, I cut the window from the
right, glued it onto the left,

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:37.240
cut he figures out, cut
them out, glued them on,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.540
and I've got my painting.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.260
It doesn't look finished,

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.520
but I've got the
structure of my art.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.970
I've got stuff that I'd never
done with textures and rawness

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.370
that I thought sort
of matched the text

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.290
about love in Matt's work.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.290
And, then here I finished by
painting like I always do,

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.860
with paint brushes and
some color pencils,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:05.480
putting extra attention on the
expression, just a little touch

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.940
in this big brother, his face.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.010
But you want to get
that emotion right.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.660
And, then, Matt, you saw this.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.960
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Yes.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.260
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: This
is when you--

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.560
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
This is probably

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.590
when I actually changed the
text and you might notice

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.400
that this is pretty well
made toast and I was like,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.810
"I don't trust this brother's
toast making skills."

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.900
So, I burned it and now
watch the final detail.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.840
He burns it.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.500
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Yeah, that was an
all-nighter to burn that toast.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.970
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: But,
you know we would just

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.950
like to say it's such an honor
to share this book with you

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.400
at the National Book Festival.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.060
So, thank you so
much for having us.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.890
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: I
have one thing to do.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.190
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Yeah,

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.160
and then Loren actually has
something he's produced here.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.900
So, if you're an
educator raise your hands.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.700
I see we have a lot
of educators.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.720
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Who's in
an elementary school?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.600
What are you?

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.950
You're a reading teacher?

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.080
Okay, what's your name?

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.850
Christina, do you
have a classroom?

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.780
Do you have walls?

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.550
Alright, your name is, how
do you spell your name?

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.140
Okay, I might misspell
it but here we go.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.980
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
So, it's kind of cool

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.650
because he's given these out
everywhere we've presented.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.670
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: I-N-A, right?

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.310
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a:
It's kind of fun.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.610
&gt;&gt; Loren Long: Thank you guys.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.180
I'm just going to sign
this and give it to you.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.480
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pe単a: Thank you.
