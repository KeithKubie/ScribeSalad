savvy I am already.

Somehow I have made a
career on the internet.

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.410
Don't ask me how that happened.

SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.382
It's always so much fun going
back and watching old videos

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:37.840
because it's just like this
history of the past eight years

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.510
of my life, and I'm like, I
remember what I had for lunch

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.710
that day on that shoot.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.980
I remember that director was
being rude to me that day.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.561
I don't know.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.060
It's fun.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.930
It's fun to take a
trip down memory lane.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.520
But thank you guys
for having me.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.470
My name is Sam Tsui.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.080
It's such an honor to be
here talking to you guys.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.370
Googlers are awesome.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.500
You make what I do possible.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.310
You're working on the products
and the platforms that

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.640
allow such awesome content
creation and sharing

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.010
and communication,
and I truly believe

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.090
that platforms like
YouTube and Google

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.125
are making the world a smaller
and ultimately better place.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.010
So thank you.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.079
It is an honor to be
talking to you guys today.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.120
I was watching some of
the other talks at Google,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.896
and there are some really
inspiring, cool, you know--

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:22.270
I have nothing necessarily
life-changing to impart to you

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.310
guys today, but
hopefully I'll just

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.790
tell you a little bit
about my story and sort

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.530
of how I got into
this whole world.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.200
And hopefully you
find it interesting

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.730
or edifying or useful.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.560
And do be thinking of
questions while I'm

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.630
talking because, at the
end, we'll do a little Q&amp;A.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.560
So if there's anything also
you guys at other Google

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.889
offices, who are
watching, yeah, I'm

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.930
more than happy to talk
to you guys afterward too

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.950
and answer whatever questions.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.420
I also know that
this goes online,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.503
so I want to say hi to the
fans that are watching.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.320
Fans nowadays are so amazing
at finding stuff online.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.480
They are just the best
sleuths in the world.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.949
I'll go to an event
and be like, there

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.490
was this one really
cool picture that

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.630
was taken of me
with these people,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.711
but I'll never find that.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.960
And then I will just, like
a minute after that, go on,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.100
and some fan has found
it on some obscure blog

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.480
and made three edits of it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.460
And I'm like, how
do you do that?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.680
It's an insane skill.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.730
So I know that
there are certainly

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.157
a couple of fans
probably watching

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:22.240
this after the fact posted
on the YouTube channel.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.250
So hello, thank
you, Samily member.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.225
I love you.

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:29.530
Yeah, so I figured I would
just take you on a little trip

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.630
back in time to how I got
involved in all of this

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.120
because I think one
of the awesome things

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.730
about having discovered
this crazy world of YouTube

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.970
and digital content creation
and the digital space for music

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.010
is that everyone who I
have met in that space

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.560
has such completely
different stories.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.970
It's such a new platform
and such a new way

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.940
of conceiving what a
music career can be

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.750
and what an entertainment career
can be that everyone's story

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.760
is so interesting and
so unique and different.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.380
So I've loved just getting to
know other creators and sort

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.880
of where they've come from, and
that has been really helpful

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.550
and sort of just
informing my journey

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.045
through this crazy world.

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:13.420
I'm also going to
sing some songs

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.160
for you over the course of today
so to keep you entertained.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.740
I know it's lunch hour, so
a little song and dance.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.740
So it all started, I
guess-- my journey--

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.310
when my parents met in 1968.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.040
My mom was a high school
music teacher in Iowa,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.680
and my dad was from Hong Kong.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.000
And he came to the States
for college in the '60s,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.400
and especially as
becoming an adult,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.170
I have just gained
such appreciation

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.000
for how interesting an
experience that must have been.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.140
He tells stories about how he
was like the only Chinese guy

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.970
in the entire state
of Iowa, and he

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.180
had to drive two hours to go to
one Asian grocery mart, where

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.265
he could get his weird oils and
chili paste to cook his food.

00:05:57.265 --> 00:05:59.140
But yeah, especially as
I've become an adult,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.810
I have such insane
respect for that kind

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.510
of uprooting your life and
going halfway around the world,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.080
especially back then.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.060
My parents, luckily for me,
got married, got together.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.780
And I really think that
being half Chinese,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.780
being mixed race, especially
as a young person,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.610
very much informed the
person that I became.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.280
And I think all
artists and creators--

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.070
it often sort of
has its root in,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.030
when you're a young
person, seeking out

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.080
what your identity is.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.264
And I think the more kind
of crises of identity

00:06:31.264 --> 00:06:32.680
you have as a kid,
the more likely

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.480
you are to become an artist.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.580
So every time you're forced
to confront something

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.800
of, you know, I'm mixed race.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.570
So how do how do
I identify myself?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.320
Where do I belong?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.070
Or being LGBT, you know,
these are things that,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.960
as a young person,
force you to really take

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.630
a step back and assess yourself
on kind of a macro scale,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.310
which I think,
although that can be

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.770
like really crappy and
painful sometimes as a kid,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.360
is a large part of where
my desire to be an artist

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.826
and sort of explore the
human experience came from.

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:03.700
So that's my parents.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.574
Flash forward-- many
years later, I was born.

00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:08.197
I was always a
really creative kid.

00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:10.030
My favorite thing is
there are so many words

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.240
used to describe people in this
digital space who do things

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.320
like I do--

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.777
influencers, YouTubers,
digital stars-- whatever.

00:07:17.777 --> 00:07:19.360
And I think, still,
one of my favorite

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.470
is creators because,
at the end of the day,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.470
everyone has such different
things that they do.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.090
I have friends who are
beauty vloggers and lifestyle

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.550
people and athletes and
gamers, and the common thread

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.890
is really our love for
creation and making something.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.750
So as a kid, I made--

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.650
oh my gosh--

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.070
I was just-- whether it was
writing an original musical

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.070
just to put on for my parents
in the living room, or I mean,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.420
I went back home recently and
found I had like published--

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.870
by published, I mean printed
on the computer like 20 issues

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.404
of "The Tsui Times"--

00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:56.320
a newspaper about what
was going on in my life

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.745
that no one was going to read.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.370
It's now sitting in
my parent's closet,

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.240
but I always had that
instinct to just make

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.420
stuff, which I really
had to sort of reach

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.780
back and reacquaint myself
with now, as a YouTuber,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.010
as a creator.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.337
But I always knew I
wanted to perform.

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:16.420
As I said, my mom was a
high school music teacher,

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.640
so I taught myself to
play piano with her help.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.570
I learned to sing and eventually
to start producing and writing

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.810
my own music.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.210
And you know, when I
got into high school,

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.630
I started doing choir and the
musicals and all that stuff.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.090
So I always knew that I
wanted to be an entertainer.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.730
I wanted to be a performer.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.530
But my vision of what a music
entertainment career looked

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.809
like, at that time, was
totally different from what

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.766
it ultimately has turned
out to be because there

00:08:47.766 --> 00:08:49.390
was no such thing,
at the time, as sort

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.540
of this self-made digital
personality creating

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.290
your own content.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.420
Really, as a kid who
wanted to do music,

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.620
my idea of what that meant
was I have to get discovered.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.120
You know, I have
to go on auditions,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.610
and I have to make sure I'm
seen by the right people, who

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:09.600
will decide that I am worthy
of being given a platform

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.060
and that I'm worthy of the
money being put in to market me

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.230
to this and that.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.810
And that's, I think, what
everyone, at the time,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.600
envisioned the path
to becoming a musician

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.790
or becoming an entertainer was.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.400
And one of the things that
I think that I'm certainly

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.330
so grateful for with
the advent of YouTube

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.800
and just the ability to
share content directly

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.030
from where it was created
without a middleman to anyone

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.600
in the world, truly,
who wants to consume it.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.759
I really ascribe all of
what I have been able to do

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:46.300
and what I've been
lucky enough to be

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.602
able to do to that ability.

00:09:49.602 --> 00:09:51.310
And I mean, I'll talk
about this further,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.160
but I think, especially
for minorities,

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.340
whether ethnic
minorities, LGBT--

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.310
anyone who has a unique
different voice that maybe

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.290
10 years ago, certainly
if you were, say,

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.042
trying to get into
the music industry,

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.250
the big wigs might have
said, oh, well, I don't know.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.500
You know, we don't want
to risk putting money

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.750
in developing this artist
because he's Asian,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.850
because he's gay,
because he's short--

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.750
whatever it might be.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.830
So I think one of the things
that people truly responded to

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.017
in, you know, the YouTube
and the digital space

00:10:20.017 --> 00:10:21.850
is just the fact that
you don't need someone

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.690
to tell you that you are worthy
of your creations being seen,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.820
and you can really
find the people who

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.130
want to watch that stuff
and prove yourself,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.200
which is very empowering
for young people

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.460
and young artistic people.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.960
You can prove
yourself that there

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.750
is an audience for
what you want to do,

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.270
and I'm so grateful for that.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.360
So after high school,
I went to college.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.580
I went to Yale, where I
majored, not in music,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.700
but in classical
Greek, which I have not

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.690
found to be incredibly useful.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.970
I enjoyed it.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.800
Nowadays, it's basically--

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.570
I get to go to the
Getty Villa and seem

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.110
like a smart ass
to all my friends

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.360
and an annoying know-it-all.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.943
That's basically the only time
that my classics degree factors

00:11:00.943 --> 00:11:03.850
into my life, but I
very much enjoyed it.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:09.250
And it was then in college that
I started this YouTube thing,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.830
which was a completely sort
of novel idea of using this

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:20.470
as a platform to develop a brand
and to launch an entertainment

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.130
career.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.336
YouTube was, at the
time, so different,

00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:24.460
such a different landscape.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.460
It was more cat videos and home
videos and things like that,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.380
which, hey, I love a cat video.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.900
There's still many cat videos
that I watch on the daily--

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.537
no shade to cat videos.

00:11:33.537 --> 00:11:35.120
But there just weren't
as many people,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.703
and there were no
precedents of people

00:11:36.703 --> 00:11:40.360
who had taken to YouTube
to create quality

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.820
content specifically
for that platform

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.130
and use that kind of
as a launching pad

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.660
to achieve what you want.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.570
So I teamed up with my
friend Kurt Schneider,

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.192
who was also at Yale, and who
actually, weirdly, happened

00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:53.900
to have grown up down
the street from me.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.180
We went to the same elementary
and middle school as well.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.320
So we knew each other from
back in Philly, got together

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.820
at college.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.153
He was interested in production.

00:12:04.153 --> 00:12:06.190
I was obviously
interested in just

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.980
getting my music seen by as many
people who wanted to see it.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.820
So we figured, hey, this could
be a cool, interesting way

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.130
to extend our
reach a little bit.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.657
Obviously, we had no idea
exactly how much it would be.

00:12:18.657 --> 00:12:20.740
But yeah, often in interviews,
I'll get asked, oh,

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.350
did you know what you-- did
you have this whole master plan

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.540
when you first started
posting videos?

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.670
And the answer is no.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.716
No one could have
imagined exactly what

00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.590
the digital space for
music and entertainment

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.950
would have become.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.660
But we definitely did it with
the goal of, you know, hey,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.090
I want to be a musician.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.840
I want to do this.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.330
I want to have my voice
heard, so it seemed

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.780
like just an interesting
exciting new platform to maybe,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.969
you know, get my work seen by
maybe a couple degrees removed

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:48.760
from people I knew.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.000
So we posted our first videos
and then got maybe 100,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.235
150 views or something.

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:54.610
And at the time,
you're like, OK,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.810
I think I know like 150
people, so these are probably

00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.950
just the people I know.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.399
This is my immediate circle.

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.940
And then those first couple of
videos, watching them grow to,

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.140
OK, there's 1,000 people.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.860
All right, that must be
the people I know and like

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.620
two or three of each of their
friends and then, as it climbs,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.055
just realizing that it
was getting to a point

00:13:14.055 --> 00:13:15.430
where there were
truly people who

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.440
had no connection to me
who, for whatever reason,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.590
logged onto this video and
watched it and enjoyed it

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.830
and maybe then shared it.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.139
And that was, I remember,
just such an incredible mental

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:29.680
exercise to just imagine people
from all over the world doing

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.260
that, and it was so humbling.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.810
And it still is to this day.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.560
So our first viral video was
this Michael Jackson medley,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.810
which was our first
video to hit a million.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.380
And oh my god, that was totally
mind blowing at the time.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.890
I remember we got written up
in the "Yale Daily News"--

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.650
a little blurb on the
side being like, sophomore

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.871
Sam Tsui and junior Kurt
Schneider have a video.

00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:54.370
I think it was even
in the newspaper

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.911
when it had 100,000 views, and
we were like, we have made it.

00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:59.020
We are in the college newspaper.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.740
This is it.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.200
And the beautiful thing about
the lack of expectations

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.570
we initially had was that
everything that happened

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.270
was just like such
the crazy windfall.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.030
We eventually got to go
on "Oprah" and "Ellen"

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.880
and "World News Tonight" and
started showing up in blogs

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.140
and being written up.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.550
And it was such a joy,
and it was so mind-blowing

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.980
that simply making something
in your own little dorm

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.067
and posting it online could
even have that kind of life

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.150
and that kind of traction.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.185
So that was really special.

00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:31.810
And then at that
point, we sort of made

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.930
the decision to take that and
turn it into something else.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.850
And that's the thing, I think,
that separates sort of one hit

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.607
wonder viral video
from the people

00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:44.690
who have actually sort of
become content creators.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.877
We were like, look, OK,
there's a power here,

00:14:46.877 --> 00:14:47.710
and it's incredible.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.830
And it's thanks to this amazing
platform and amazing fans

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.290
around the world, who want
to consume good content.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.340
So yeah, I was like, if we
can do this consistently,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.550
if we can really be smart
about building a brand

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.560
and making people
expect and come

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.839
to expect exciting, interesting,
creative, different music,

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.380
I think we could
have something here.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.369
And the rest was
sort of history.

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:12.910
I'm going to sing
a song for you now.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.515
I've been talking too long.

00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:17.140
I'm going to bring up my amazing
guitarist and very good friend

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.460
Jason Pitts.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.490
You saw him probably in
several of those little clips

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.090
that I played.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.592
We met a few years ago.

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:29.300
We've been all around
the world together.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.710
It is awesome to get to travel
with a very good friend.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.210
So this first song
I'm going to play

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.780
is the first original
song I ever put out.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.924
So the first couple of
years, it was all covers.

00:15:39.924 --> 00:15:41.840
Oh, it's actually not
the first original song.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.500
It's the lead single of
my first original album.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.050
I started online with covers
and mash-ups and medleys,

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.180
and you know, it was
an interesting leap

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.860
because obviously,
in mind, I had always

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.980
just wanted to be a musician,
a singer-songwriter, a touring

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.550
artist.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.642
And so making the leap from
covers to originals was like,

00:15:58.642 --> 00:16:00.100
are people going
to be as invested?

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.433
Are they going to be as excited?

00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:02.930
And putting out
the first album was

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.181
such an incredible experience.

00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:05.763
We did a really
successful Kickstarter

00:16:05.763 --> 00:16:07.520
and got to make some
awesome music videos

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.240
and have been touring with
that album for a while since.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.820
And yeah, it was just
so special to see

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.460
that the fans who had loved
the cover and mash-up stuff

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.489
were just as excited
about my original stuff.

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:20.030
So this is called
"Make It Up," and I

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.071
thought it would be an
appropriate first song too

00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:24.745
because it's sort of about not
having really any idea what

00:16:24.745 --> 00:16:26.120
you're doing, but
faking your way

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.329
through it, which I think anyone
who is in the digital space

00:16:29.329 --> 00:16:30.620
knows a little something about.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.820
So this is "Make It Up."

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.800
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:53.365
[MUSIC - SAM TSUI, "MAKE IT UP"]

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:06.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.379
Yeah, so that was off
my first original album.

00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:09.920
Am I good using this
mic, by the way?

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.960
I realized we were
sound checking with it.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.110
Awesome.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.404
Make it up as I go.

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:19.070
So that was off my
first original album.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.590
So after college, I
moved out here to LA

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.970
and got an awesome
team and started

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:31.910
looking at how do we turn this
YouTube cover career into what

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.310
I wanted, which was to be a
singer-songwriter, a touring

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.460
artist, and someone who got
to really go around the world

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.150
and share my music with anyone
and everyone who would listen

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.310
and found some pleasure in it.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.834
And so that's what the last
several years have been,

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:48.500
have been building
kind of what that is.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.420
And it's really an
interesting spot

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.350
to be in, being in this sort
of digital influencer space,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.745
but also sort of, at the same
time, having this music career

00:20:58.745 --> 00:20:59.870
that I am pursuing as well.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.760
There's a lot of new
tools that are opened up

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.460
by having social platforms.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.400
But there is also-- you have
to sort of be careful about how

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.426
you navigate them because,
with so many options and so

00:21:10.426 --> 00:21:12.800
many things you can do with
your time and with the tools,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.216
you have to figure
out, obviously,

00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:17.540
the right ways to reach the
people that you want to reach.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.150
I want to talk
briefly about the fans

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.500
because obviously, in
the trinity of what

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.920
makes the world go round, it's
the creators, the platform--

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.850
you guys-- and these
fans, who are not only

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.470
consuming this
content, but taking

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.410
such an active amazing
ownership over it.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.650
And I think that's what
truly is the key to what

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.490
makes all of these digital
creators, these influencers,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.240
such a kind of revolution
in entertainment

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.700
is actually the fans
giving them that power

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.070
and giving them
those opportunities.

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.830
One thing that I try to
constantly remind myself

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.270
about my fans is that
being a fan, in many ways,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.180
is first and foremost a
form of self-expression.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.180
I think it's easy to sort of
think of fans as these passive

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.625
people who are consuming the
content you make and that

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.500
everything is kind of
going in one direction,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.240
but I think it's--

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.850
not the boy band One
Direction, a single direction.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.900
But I always continue
to remind myself that,

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.060
at the end of the day,
when you're someone's fan--

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.810
we're all fans of different
artists and different people.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.790
At the end of the
day, by being a fan,

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.100
you're really saying
something about yourself.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.630
You're saying, you
know, especially

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.220
in the digital age
and the social age,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.080
when you're posting to
Twitter and Instagram

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.942
and Facebook about
what you like,

00:22:35.942 --> 00:22:37.650
what you're really
saying, on some level,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.237
is this is my identity
that I am building

00:22:40.237 --> 00:22:41.570
and I'm projecting to the world.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.540
I'm showing you who I am, and
I care enough about this thing,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.379
or this thing aligns with what
I believe and what I care about

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:48.920
and what I think is
important, so I'm

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.420
going to incorporate
that into my own identity

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.920
that I'm sharing
out with the world.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.710
So it's incredibly humbling,
and I think it's a big burden,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.810
as a creator, and
as anyone with fans,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.130
to know it's not just this
totally selfish thing of me

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.252
making stuff, and you
either like it or you don't.

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.960
Once someone has signed
on board and said

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.010
that what you do and
your music represents me,

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.390
they're constituents in a way.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.630
And I feel obligated
to put out stuff

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.520
that continues to
represent them, surprise

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.280
them, and interest them, and
be creative and interesting.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:26.020
But yeah, whenever I'm
feeling kind of in a rut,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.890
or what do I do
creatively, I like

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.840
to remind myself
that, yeah, fandom

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.270
is a form of self-expression,
and it's something

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.910
that I can give
to my fans, who I

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.680
call the Samily, which I love.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.720
That was actually fan-generated.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.300
I did a vlog.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.580
I was like, you
know, what is our--

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.610
because there have been
a couple different--

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.390
some people were saying we're
the Samurais, which I liked.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.570
But I was like, OK, we
need to have a conference

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.322
and solidify this.

00:23:51.322 --> 00:23:53.780
So I did a vlog, and I was
like, let's vote on what the fan

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.321
name should be
called, and we settled

00:23:55.321 --> 00:23:57.440
on Samily, which I really love.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.400
It's so perfect because
it's got a couple layers.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.680
It's "Sam" plus "I-L-Y," which
is internet speak for I love

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.500
you, so you've already got
the love theme in there--

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.200
obviously, a pun
on Sam and family.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.690
And the more I've
been on the platform

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.250
and been in this
space, the more true

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.720
that rings, that these fan
communities that are created

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.840
are really, for a lot of
people, a form of family,

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.080
of finding people, who like
the same things as you,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.206
who identify with you and
give you a sense of belonging.

00:24:27.206 --> 00:24:28.580
And that's one of
the main things

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.310
is I strive to create
in this Samily.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.140
And this sort of
realm of the content

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.550
I make is a sense of we're
all in this together.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.747
In a culture that can
become increasingly isolated

00:24:39.747 --> 00:24:41.330
with the advent of
technology, I think

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.460
it's important to remind
ourselves that it also

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.040
has a lot of power to create
communities and create

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.130
belonging, which is really,
really important to me.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.089
Another awesome
thing about fans,

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.880
which makes them so
important and powerful,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.155
is I think the
constant goes that way,

00:24:56.155 --> 00:24:57.530
they express
themselves, and then

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.290
there is a return of
a sense of ownership

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.950
they have over what I do and
sort of this collective sense

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.950
that, the more I'm trying
to go on tour a lot

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.840
and put out a ton of videos and
get these cool opportunities,

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.850
the fans are very
much a part of that

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.580
because, more so than I think
a traditional music artist,

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.079
they very tangibly have
a role in everything,

00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:22.870
in allowing me to have
those opportunities.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.560
So when I get to
go on tour, open

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.760
for Bon Jovi, which I got to
do in Jakarta about a year

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.620
ago for 40,000 people.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.790
It was totally crazy.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.980
It was one of the best
experiences of my life.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.250
But every time they get to see
me doing something like that,

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.980
it's not just, oh, this person
I really like their music

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.960
got to do this.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.592
As fans in the digital
age, they truly

00:25:44.592 --> 00:25:46.050
have an ownership
over that success

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.040
because it was the
fans sharing the music

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.830
and incorporating it into
their life and their world

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.207
and their friend group
that is opening these doors

00:25:55.207 --> 00:25:56.040
and allowing for it.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.970
So it really is our
collective victory

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.900
is every time I get to
do something really cool,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.540
and I think that's
what makes fans

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.590
of digital musicians and digital
creators all the more strong

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.960
because they're super invested.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.839
And it's a lot harder
to sort of fall out

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:14.130
of that sense of investment
than just sort of passively

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.866
like, oh, I like that
song on the radio.

00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:17.490
Yeah, I guess I'm a
fan of this person.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.850
But when you've actually
seen the journey from start

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.980
to finish, I think
it's impossible

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.921
not to have more of a visceral
connection to those people.

00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:30.420
One thing I was going to say--
seeing the journey from start

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.245
to finish--

00:26:31.245 --> 00:26:35.950
one of the best and worst things
about the way that content

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.777
creation happens on YouTube--
obviously, it's a volume game.

00:26:39.777 --> 00:26:42.360
Going back to make those reels
and stuff, I'm like, oh my god.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.860
I've made so many videos.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.870
There's so much of
me on the internet,

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.790
and it's also so
funny that it just

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.847
sticks around in a way
that is so crazy to me.

00:26:51.847 --> 00:26:54.180
Going to source some of those
clips of the older videos,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.638
I'm like, I haven't
seen this video

00:26:55.638 --> 00:26:57.789
in like three years since,
you know, I made it,

00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:59.580
and I read the comments,
and this and that.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.960
And then I'll go
back, and I will

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.060
see that there's a comment
from an hour ago of being like,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.080
oh, I love this.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.720
So it's interesting
that, while I

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.714
think of my progression
and my content creation

00:27:09.714 --> 00:27:11.130
in this linear
way, it's like, OK,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.760
three years ago, I was doing
this, and now I'm doing this.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.730
In a way, you're building
kind of this living organism

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.517
that it's not totally
linear, and someone

00:27:19.517 --> 00:27:21.600
can come in and discover
your stuff from something

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.190
you did five years
ago and then see

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.750
something you did yesterday
and then see something

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.749
you did seven years ago.

00:27:25.749 --> 00:27:29.690
And that is both really
cool because, again, it

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.560
allows new fans to sort
of take that journey

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.351
from the beginning.

00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:35.235
This chair is slowly
panning around.

00:27:35.235 --> 00:27:37.860
It not only allows fans to take
that journey from the beginning

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.120
even if they're getting
in now, but it also--

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.580
yeah, every time
you make a video,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.650
it's a new point of
entry for someone else

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.997
to then sort of come
on the ride with you.

00:27:48.997 --> 00:27:51.330
But it's also, yeah, as an
artist and a creative person,

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.980
it's a little
terrifying because there

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.938
are some things you made
like a couple of years

00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:57.060
ago that you're like,
I've gotten much better.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.350
My skills have improved.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.230
I'm sorry that this was the
first video of mine you saw.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.330
Check out this one I just did.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.080
Yeah, so that stuff--

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.790
it sticks around in both a
good and sometimes slightly

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.370
mortifying way.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.500
But yeah, the other
the final thing

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.220
I want to say about fans
that I have discovered

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.110
is their ability to
detect authenticity

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.480
in a really crazy way.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.874
Just looking at the
way various different

00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:29.040
YouTubers' and creators'
sort of careers have gone--

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.207
I think almost always the
most successful people

00:28:32.207 --> 00:28:34.290
and the people with the
most and the fiercest fans

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.130
are the ones who are
truly themselves,

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.430
as trite as that might sound to
say, because fans, especially

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.460
nowadays, when you have access
to these vlogs of people who

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.120
are being so real and being
exactly who they are in a way

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.160
that you didn't necessarily
get to see that much

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.390
in entertainment a
handful of years ago--

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.420
you didn't see people
being totally real.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.450
I mean, I guess reality
TV started to bring that

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.090
into the fore, but the advent
of someone literally just,

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.367
without any producers or
writers or anything, just

00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:03.450
showing you who they are--

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.910
I think it has trained
our young people today,

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.580
in a really good way,
to be able to sniff out

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.320
when things are not authentic.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.639
And so I think that has
made content creation--

00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:17.430
it's a challenge, but
it's a good challenge

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.890
to remind ourselves that the
fans will know if you're doing

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.240
something that is disingenuous.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.790
One of the things I struggled
with the decision of how

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.120
to announce was I got married
last year to my husband Casey.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.030
It was very exciting.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.770
It was awesome.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.960
But when I first
started on YouTube,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.300
I hadn't said anything
about my dating life.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.657
I was a musician,
and at the time,

00:29:38.657 --> 00:29:39.990
I wasn't as big on social media.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.150
So I was like, this is
not relevant to what I do.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.025
I just put out music.

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:44.691
And then as the years
went on, I started

00:29:44.691 --> 00:29:46.080
to do more vlog style content.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.082
It had become this thing I
just never really talked about,

00:29:49.082 --> 00:29:50.290
and I was like this is weird.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.630
I've been out since I
was 18, and I weirdly

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.380
felt like I was back
in the closet online,

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.315
and I absolutely
hated that, especially

00:29:57.315 --> 00:29:59.190
as I started doing more
lifestyle vlog stuff.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.150
So and yet I was
weirdly nervous when

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.859
I posted the video, saying,
just, oh, this is my boyfriend.

00:30:06.859 --> 00:30:08.400
We got engaged--
this and that, which

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.566
obviously was very exciting.

00:30:09.566 --> 00:30:12.480
And in my personal life, I
could have cared less about.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.270
I was definitely not in
the closet or anything.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.430
And the moment I
posted that video

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:22.310
and got the responses from that,
I think my content creations

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.560
since then has been
off the charts so much.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.410
It just felt so much
better, more real to me,

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.165
and I've seen that response
in the fans as well.

00:30:31.165 --> 00:30:33.540
I think that the content I've
done since then, especially

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.370
the lifestyle
stuff, the reaction

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.470
has just been incredible.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.042
And that was really,
really meaningful to me.

00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:43.500
Interestingly, you know, there
are some parts of the world,

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.590
because YouTube allows you to
build such a global community

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.960
of fans, there were
some places in the world

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.030
where that is seen as something
a little questionable.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.750
And you know, it's the internet.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.772
I certainly got
comments to that effect.

00:30:57.772 --> 00:30:59.230
And for a second,
that got me down.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.813
I was like, OK, you
know, these people

00:31:00.813 --> 00:31:03.330
in these countries, where
this is definitely not

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.330
as progressive as
it is in America--

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.130
that got to me
personally initially.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.450
But then I realized
that there are

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.149
gay young people,
LGBT young people,

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:15.690
in those countries,
who are literally

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.410
in the midst of that
society, and being

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:24.630
able to be content that they can
consume that that shows exactly

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:29.640
who I am in a really, I hope,
positive and inspiring manner

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.470
I think is actually
all the more important.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.520
So every time I saw something
that had hate in it,

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.650
it affirmed my
decision more than ever

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.519
that it's really important.

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.310
As I said before, I
mean, one of the things

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.851
I think is most
special about YouTube

00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:46.680
is that it gives this platform
to previously disenfranchised

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.760
groups and people.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.650
I mean, we've seen
that, in almost

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.794
every marginalized
community, a lot of times

00:31:51.794 --> 00:31:54.210
you see what you would think
are a disproportionate amount

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.470
of YouTube stars from
those communities

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.595
because that's the only
outlet that a lot of people

00:31:57.595 --> 00:32:00.960
have to see an Asian
person doing pop music.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.050
You look at the top
40 charts today.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.960
There are no Chinese
last names in the top 40

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.510
on iTunes or
Billboard, and that's

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.190
something that is
really important to me

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.934
to change and to hopefully
give young kids a little

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.850
more representation in
the music they consume.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.540
OK, I've been talking a lot.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.456
Let's do another song.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.700
This song is called
"Walking Backwards."

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.080
It's off my first
album as well, and this

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.641
is a song that has meant a
lot to me and a lot of fans

00:32:31.641 --> 00:32:32.140
as well.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.459
It's about something
that, as a YouTuber,

00:32:34.459 --> 00:32:37.000
you struggle with, as someone
especially in the entertainment

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.270
industry, wondering
what you're doing,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.520
feeling like you're sometimes
taking one step forward,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.500
two steps back.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.510
It's called "Walking
Backwards," and it's a song

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.400
that a lot of fans
have related to.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:33:03.620
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:08.490
[MUSIC - SAM TSUI, "WALKING
 BACKWARDS"]

00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:08.404
Thank you.

00:36:08.404 --> 00:36:10.328
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:16.380
Finally, I know I'm
running out of time,

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.921
but I just want to
close up with sort

00:36:17.921 --> 00:36:20.940
of what I'm working on next
and what's on the horizon.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.530
As I said, it's
sort of navigating

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.920
this hybrid new career.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.791
There's no really
guideway for it,

00:36:25.791 --> 00:36:27.540
which is both exciting
and a little scary,

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.990
of having all these digital
tools at our discretion,

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.280
but wanting a music career and
wanting to perform and tour.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.080
So I'm excited to be working
on a new album that is going

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.610
to come out later this year.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.620
And the thing I'm
really thrilled about

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.770
is that I'm either
producing or co-producing

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.350
the whole thing, which was
not true of the first album.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.140
And I think one of the greatest
things about being a content

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.300
creator that I never would
have done if I hadn't is

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.760
just you're forced to
become a jack of all trades.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.779
And even though I would
have said 10 years ago,

00:36:55.779 --> 00:36:56.820
I'm going to be a singer.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.900
I'm going to be an entertainer.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.983
I'm going to be pop star--

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.270
yada, yada.

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.760
And putting out a
video a week, I've

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.250
had to become a great
producer, a great mixer,

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.050
a great masterer, a great
video shooter, great editor,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.610
a great marketer-- all this
stuff that, in retrospect, god,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.080
I am so grateful that I had
to learn all those things

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.120
because now, when
I create something

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.790
like an original album
of my own, it is 100% me,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.850
and I feel that I have the
tools and the vocabulary

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.646
to be able to articulate
exactly what I

00:37:25.646 --> 00:37:26.770
want to share with my fans.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.170
And I think that's
super important,

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.444
and it allows you to then
start to see in artists,

00:37:31.444 --> 00:37:33.360
who don't do that often
in the mainstream, who

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.140
have these huge teams, and you
can't hear their voice in it.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.190
And as I said, I think
fans are beginning

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.929
to be able to sort of start
to read that authenticity.

00:37:40.929 --> 00:37:43.470
And so I think it's all the more
important for young artists,

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.270
moving forward, to
really take ownership

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.530
of your creation and your art.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.520
So I'm really excited
about the album.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.090
It's a little darker, a little
sexier than old Sam Tsui stuff.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.460
So fans, get ready for that.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.690
Brace yourselves.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.190
No, but I'm really
excited about it.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.870
It's like this
super fun, synthy,

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.780
throwback vibe that I
literally cannot wait to share.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.700
We just shot the
first music video

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.550
for the first single, which
is going to be coming out

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.460
ahead of the album.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.270
And I just cannot wait.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.560
This is going up online after.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.250
I would have played a little
bit of it for you guys,

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.530
but it's coming out very soon.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.610
So I'm really thrilled about
that, and yeah, I mean,

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.120
thank you guys for listening.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.200
I hope this was interesting
or, as I said, edifying.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.690
I think just hearing the
stories of people who are

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.324
using this awesome platform--

00:38:29.324 --> 00:38:31.740
I always find them to be really
inspiring and interesting.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.270
So yeah, I don't know if
there's time for questions.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.770
I blab on.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.572
Questions-- great, awesome.

00:38:37.572 --> 00:38:39.780
SPEAKER: All right, so we
have this awesome Catchbox.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.870
We're going to bounce
it around the room.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.450
Here you go.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.160
SAM TSUI: I want
one of those so bad.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.280
That's so cool.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.350
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.220
SAM TSUI: It works!

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.720
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.150
about the negative
reaction that came when

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.270
you revealed your sexuality.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.990
Could you talk about how you
handle negative reactions just

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.947
to the content that you create?

00:38:59.947 --> 00:39:02.280
SAM TSUI: Absolutely, I mean,
it's a really easy answer.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.110
You just don't engage.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.610
And I mean, that's the biggest
advice I can give for anyone,

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.860
whether or not you're trying
to make a career online.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.070
Even if you're just a
person living your damn life

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.890
on social media, just don't
engage with the negative stuff.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.990
And I mean, the amazing
thing about having

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:19.770
fans is that the love
so outweighs the hate,

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.190
and when there is hate, like
the moment a bad comment gets

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:28.140
posted, you have like a handful
of fans jumping on that,

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.120
responding in kind--

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.120
not negatively, but
just pointing out where

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.510
there are unnecessary hate.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.840
So yeah, you just
learn to let it go.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.440
And as I said, you learn
that, if someone has something

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.910
negative to say
about it, it means

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.000
that there are attitudes in the
world that are still messed up.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.820
And so the best way
to combat that is just

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.570
by continuing to do exactly
the same thing, I think.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.917
So haters make me
stronger, you know?

00:39:56.917 --> 00:39:57.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.800
SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.841
People talking into that
box-- it's such a neat--

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.954
nice.

00:40:04.954 --> 00:40:05.620
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.910
SAM TSUI: Hello.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.900
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned the
traditional music artists--

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.460
they usually have a
persona when they perform,

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.490
and your success
depends on being

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:23.300
authentic and figuratively
naked when performing.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.800
It's a--

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.150
SAM TSUI: Not literally.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.860
I know I said the
new music is sexy.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.450
It's not that sexy yet, guys.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.680
Don't get excited, fans.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.100
AUDIENCE: So do you
think that exposure

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.599
is difficult in this
new life that you have?

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:38.140
SAM TSUI: Absolutely,
I mean, I think

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.290
that's one of the big
challenges of navigating it.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.220
As I said, it's kind of
like this hybrid career

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.680
because there are some
people who set out explicitly

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.580
to be personalities and to
be digital personalities.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.690
So for them, it's
always about, yeah,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.610
what can I do to get
the most eyeballs on me

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.740
and let you into my
life to the fullest?

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.390
But I went into it
wanting to share

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.910
my music, which is not
the same thing as sharing

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.830
every moment of my life.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.430
So it's definitely been a
learning process of figuring

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.160
out how to best navigate that.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.280
And you know, as I
said, I have found

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.694
erring on the side of authentic
and letting people in,

00:41:15.694 --> 00:41:17.110
ultimately, I've
found to be good.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.270
But that definitely
wasn't the case at first.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.960
I was hesitant.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.770
I was nervous.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:28.660
But yeah, I think it does give
a depth to music and to art

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.050
when you have a window
into that person's life,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:33.880
and stuff in the
music, I think, takes

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.500
on a new meaning
and understanding

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.650
when you have a window
into who that person is

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:42.230
in a multifaceted way--
so ultimately good thing.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.390
It's always going to be tricky.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.192
But yeah, and I'm
figuring it out.

00:41:46.192 --> 00:41:46.900
I'm making it up.

00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:53.840
AUDIENCE: OK, so kind of
like two questions in one.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.800
SAM TSUI: Bring it on.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.633
AUDIENCE: As you said,
you are making it up.

00:41:56.633 --> 00:41:59.170
So I think, especially
for a content creator,

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:03.710
it's important to stay dynamic
and also to stay up to current.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:08.810
So how is one way, like how do
you incorporate cultural trends

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.150
and technology changing
to remain current?

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.280
But then also, on
the flipside, how

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.100
would you like to see technology
change to kind of suit

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.727
you as a creator better?

00:42:17.727 --> 00:42:19.310
SAM TSUI: That's a
fantastic question.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.268
Yeah, I think another
one of the big challenges

00:42:21.268 --> 00:42:24.650
of being a creator is staying
abreast of everything.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.210
And especially being
a music creator,

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.960
there's a lot of stuff.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.790
You know, I'm doing cover
and mash-up content,

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.240
so I have to stay aware of
what's happening in the charts.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.417
I'm nominally a social
media personality,

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:35.750
so I have to understand how
those platforms are working.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.170
And when a new one comes
up, how do I use it?

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.545
And I'm always
the worst at that.

00:42:38.545 --> 00:42:39.500
I'm late to the game.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.760
You know, the actual
interface and algorithms

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.060
of YouTube and these platforms
are changing constantly.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:49.580
So continually being a student
of every facet of what I do

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.880
is, I think, critical.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.880
And the moment you
get complacent,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.560
you see that reflected
in the work-- part of why

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.364
I, this year, decided to
do a video every Tuesday,

00:42:59.364 --> 00:43:01.280
which before, I kind of
had a looser schedule.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.330
And I decided to
do it every Tuesday

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.100
because I was like,
you know what?

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.850
I have to really force
myself to be regular

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.722
and to create this schedule.

00:43:09.722 --> 00:43:11.180
And yeah, that was
one thing I did.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.500
I was like, this year,
that's a new thing I'm

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.230
going to do because I think
the ways certain algorithms are

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.692
working, people
aren't necessarily

00:43:16.692 --> 00:43:17.900
seeing all the videos you do.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.330
So I was like, OK, how
can I confront that issue,

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.312
where some of my subscribers,
who maybe want to see my stuff,

00:43:23.312 --> 00:43:24.020
aren't seeing it?

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.950
It's getting lost
in their feeds.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.290
OK, well, one way I can
sort of combat that is by,

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.790
if they know it's
coming on Tuesday,

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.539
then you're building
an expectation there,

00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:33.164
and then there are additional
ways other than just

00:43:33.164 --> 00:43:34.205
that little notification.

00:43:34.205 --> 00:43:36.970
Now, in their mind,
it's #TsuiTuesday.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.055
So yeah, that's just--

00:43:38.055 --> 00:43:39.680
I don't know-- a
little example of just

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.010
like a small bit of innovation
to address a problem

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.210
and sort of confront that.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.930
In terms of how I would want
to see it increase, I mean,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:48.750
I think--

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:49.940
well, I love the--

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.440
on YouTube, developed this last
year, and I got to beta test

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.050
it, is the community tab.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.840
As I said, I think
the main thing

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:02.174
is tools that allow us to build
connection because, you know,

00:44:02.174 --> 00:44:03.590
everything in the
digital space is

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.798
kind of a double-edged sword.

00:44:04.798 --> 00:44:07.130
It is at once alienating
and connecting,

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.900
and it's kind of sometimes
confusing of like what it is.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.631
So I think, yeah, tools like
that, that allow you-- you

00:44:12.631 --> 00:44:14.130
know, you can watch
a video of mine.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.550
And then in the same realm
and on the same platform,

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.150
you can have a discussion
with other people

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.395
in a safe space about
that particular video

00:44:21.395 --> 00:44:24.110
or about this channel, and
then I can be a part of that.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:28.820
Tools like that, that
encourage and facilitate

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.970
connectivity in a meaningful
way are always welcome.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:40.310
SPEAKER: Hello, so
we've got some questions

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.719
from the online forum.

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:43.010
SAM TSUI: Hello, online people.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.150
SPEAKER: And I was
going to mention

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.441
that you've got some YouTube
engineers in the front row

00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:47.037
there.

00:44:47.037 --> 00:44:47.870
SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.536
SPEAKER: Speak to the
right peeps there.

00:44:49.536 --> 00:44:51.780
SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.820
SPEAKER: So Shweta
from Sunnyvale--

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.500
this was our number
one voted question--

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.020
any plans to visit
or perform at Google,

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.172
Mountain View, smiley face?

00:45:02.172 --> 00:45:02.880
I think I might--

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.500
SAM TSUI: Bring me.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.200
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.590
SAM TSUI: Yeah.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.130
No, I've performed at
a couple Google events.

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:07.130
It's always so much fun.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:08.770
You guys are great audiences.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.240
Yeah, you're truly awesome.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.506
I would love to.

00:45:11.506 --> 00:45:12.280
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.450
SAM TSUI: Yeah, and as I
said, I love live performing.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.840
I think one of the things
about doing so many videos is

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.510
that-- it's amazing, and I enjoy
it, and I've learned so much,

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.182
but it's not the same
as live performance.

00:45:23.182 --> 00:45:24.890
I've loved going on
tour around the world

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.514
and meeting with fans
around the world.

00:45:26.514 --> 00:45:29.400
So you don't have to ask me
twice to ever perform live.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.120
I'm like, come on, Jason, we're
going to go play somewhere.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.350
So yes, I'm coming.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.020
SPEAKER: All right, I guess
you got your answer there.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.830
Next question here from
Lauren in New York--

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.020
with cover songs,
it ends up being

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.110
so important to do something
different to the original that

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.280
adds value.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.200
How do you approach
this, and how do you

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.200
push yourself to do new
things with those songs?

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.010
SAM TSUI: Absolutely,
that is so important,

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.620
especially as the space
has become sort of--

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.870
I don't want to say cluttered.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:58.495
That's a negative
sounding word, but it

00:45:58.495 --> 00:46:00.410
has become really
populated of people

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.850
doing music online, certainly
more so than when I first

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:03.350
started.

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:09.420
So innovation and being
creative is so key.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.119
A-- by simply being a student,
as I said, of the world

00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:14.660
and of music.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:19.202
I listen to a lot of music
and learn as much as I can

00:46:19.202 --> 00:46:19.910
about production.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.940
I mean, honestly, doing cover
music and mash-ups and kind

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.880
of the puzzles that those often
entail of either reinventing

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.970
a cover or mashing up with
something else or reimagining

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.130
it is like the best--

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.020
it's like a master
class in pop music.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.480
And anyone who wants to be
a producer or a songwriter--

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.310
I think it's like
one of the best ways

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.170
to just force yourself
to learn because,

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.990
by having to, every week, take a
song that, for whatever reason,

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.776
is popular and up on the charts
and deconstruct it, say, OK,

00:46:44.776 --> 00:46:45.650
what makes this tick?

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.150
Can I reharmonize this?

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:48.610
Can I do this acapella?

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.720
Can I do this in a way
that will surprise people?

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.250
It really forces
you to kind of look

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:55.430
at the guts of what makes a good
song and then reconstruct it.

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:56.931
So every time I
do that, you know,

00:46:56.931 --> 00:46:59.180
I don't see that as, oh, I'm
just doing another cover.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.850
It's like I'm
learning something,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:03.320
and through that
learning, I think

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.414
you kind of surprise yourself.

00:47:05.414 --> 00:47:06.830
And yeah, you have
to be committed

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.760
to make some videos that maybe
aren't going to be as popular

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.670
and be OK with that because
you did something weird.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.987
And I think the amazing
thing about being a creator

00:47:15.987 --> 00:47:18.320
and the volume of content we
get to share with our fans,

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.120
more so than a
traditional artist,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.810
is that we have a little more
freedom to have a testing

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.170
ground, you know what I mean?

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:27.000
A traditional artist might
release music once, you know,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.560
every couple months.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.220
And I am, in a way, putting
out a new piece of music

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.150
every week.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.614
And it's a great way to kind of
have a space to learn and see

00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:36.780
what works and what doesn't.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.446
And so a lot of the
innovation, I think,

00:47:38.446 --> 00:47:40.580
comes from seeing what
people didn't like so much

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.170
and it didn't work, but having
the confidence to put that out

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:43.670
there.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:46.810
And the fans
understand that it's

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.560
good to be surprised
even if sometimes you

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.060
like the thing they did the
week before a little bit better.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.250
SPEAKER: A question, yeah?

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.739
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:01.780
Can you talk a bit about
your musical influences,

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:06.020
both from your past and from
current contemporary music?

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.970
SAM TSUI: Absolutely, I grew
up listening to two things--

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.660
musical theater and '80s music.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.970
So I gained from
those two genres

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.620
an appreciation for all
things unabashedly just

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.080
epic and kind of
ridiculous and earnest.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.580
I mean, that's one
that, when people

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.038
ask me to describe like what's
the tone of your songwriting

00:48:27.038 --> 00:48:30.400
or whatever and just
your persona in general,

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.440
one sort of core of
mine is being earnest.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.560
And I think a lot of
contemporary pop artists,

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.570
for a while, it's been
in the other direction.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.320
It's been, who is the coolest
and most aloof and most

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.840
unattainable and mysterious?

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.240
And obviously, an element of
mystery in music is great,

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.500
and it's important.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.320
But I've always been of
kind of the opposite school.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.770
You know, I'm going to
give you all of me on stage

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.040
and be totally real and earnest.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.590
And so that's in all my music,
whether it's an uptempo song,

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:00.589
a fun song, a slow song.

00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:04.540
I want to tell stories that
feel relatable and real

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:10.030
and not sort of cultivate some
kind of I'm cooler than thou.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.970
So and in terms of music that
is inspiring me a lot right now,

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.490
I've been listening to a
lot of Brooklyn synth-pop

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.531
because it has that kind
of '80s throwback thing,

00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:22.300
and there's a lot of that kind
of fun funk electro finding

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.490
its way into the new
music, which again,

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.740
now that I'm producing or
co-producing all the stuff,

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.990
it's definitely a lot more
me and exactly what I want.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:31.410
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:38.010
So you said you like
musical theater?

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.760
SAM TSUI: Love it.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.460
AUDIENCE: I have always wanted
you to do musical theater

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.930
covers on your channel, and I
can't remember you doing any.

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:45.680
SAM TSUI: I just--

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.970
you know, I just did "Beauty
and the Beast" with my husband.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.970
I mean, that's kind of
cheating musical theater.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.320
It's Alan Menken.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.380
Yeah, you know what?

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.920
I haven't.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.310
I've gotten some
potential offers and stuff

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.630
from Broadway stuff,
which I've always want

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.880
to eventually go back
and do that because, when

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.480
I was in college, as I said,
I majored in classical Greek,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.750
but I planned on pursuing
music via musical theater.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.330
So I did all the shows at Yale.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.310
And yeah, I know.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.690
I need to.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:13.740
I really want to go back.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.870
And when the right role
comes around on Broadway,

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.460
I'm so there.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.560
AUDIENCE: I was listening
to a "Dear Evan Hansen"

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.510
cover of "Waving Through
the Window" the other day.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:22.380
SAM TSUI: That's a good song.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.760
AUDIENCE: And when I like heard
you were coming, I'm like,

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.090
you know, that would probably--

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:25.920
SAM TSUI: I love "Dear
Evan Hansen," yeah.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.110
AUDIENCE: --go really
well with your voice.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.610
SAM TSUI: Yeah, and
especially a lot

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.720
of new musical theater
stuff over the last 5,

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.475
10 years is basically pop.

00:50:32.475 --> 00:50:34.350
You know, it's like very
pop musical theater.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.144
So yeah, OK, I will
take that to heart.

00:50:36.144 --> 00:50:38.310
I'll need to do some musical
theater stuff for sure.

00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:43.612
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:43.612 --> 00:50:46.022
AUDIENCE: Oh, someone
else had a question?

00:50:46.022 --> 00:50:46.729
Sorry.

00:50:46.729 --> 00:50:48.770
I guess, I mean, I've been
following your YouTube

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:49.604
for a long time now.

00:50:49.604 --> 00:50:50.436
SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:50:50.436 --> 00:50:52.770
AUDIENCE: I've been
wondering, so are your plans

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.100
to just become a
big YouTube star

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.490
or to become a big pop star,
like someone who's just

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.190
on charts, more like, I
guess, as you were saying,

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.899
like people are more
impersonal nowadays,

00:51:02.899 --> 00:51:04.398
but then at the
same time, you still

00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:07.190
want to show like-- you want to
have an Asian presence and more

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.080
of an LGBT presence
on the charts.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:09.620
SAM TSUI: Absolutely, yes

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.570
AUDIENCE: So what
are your plans?

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.042
SAM TSUI: Absolutely,
well, I think

00:51:12.042 --> 00:51:13.750
the amazing thing that
you've been seeing

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.792
the last just couple of years
is that it's not necessarily

00:51:17.792 --> 00:51:18.500
one or the other.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.541
And I'm definitely not
pursuing one or the other.

00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:22.700
I'm not trying to be the
biggest YouTube star ever,

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:27.080
and I'm not trying to be a pop
star who is aloof and doesn't

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.150
let people in.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:33.307
So ideally, I want to have
sort of a hybrid of the two.

00:51:33.307 --> 00:51:35.390
You know, look, I want to
scale what I'm doing up.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:39.155
I want to go to tour for as many
fans around the world as I can.

00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:40.280
I want to be on the charts.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.280
I want my music and my message
and, as I said, my visibility

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.879
to be as big as it can.

00:51:44.879 --> 00:51:46.670
And that's obviously
easier said than done,

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.530
but I think with the new
music, I'm on the way to that.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:53.030
But I think the pop star of
the future is a YouTube star.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.100
You know what I mean?

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.600
In the next couple
of years, I don't

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.750
think there's going
to be a distinction.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.416
I mean, you see
traditional artists, who

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:02.750
are clamoring to get
sort of a digital life

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.240
and get their YouTube channel
up and going because that's

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.000
become such an integral part
of the ecosystem of how people

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.110
are discovering music, how
people are consuming music.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.270
So yeah, it's to
scale what I'm doing

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:18.320
and hopefully be a part of
the wave of breaking down

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.950
the barrier between those two
things and becoming the hybrid.

00:52:27.165 --> 00:52:29.040
SPEAKER: All right,
looks like we're at time.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.760
SAM TSUI: Amazing.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.950
SPEAKER: But I want to thank
you so much for visiting us--

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:32.220
SAM TSUI: Thank you.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.470
SPEAKER: --at Google
LA, and I'm sure we all

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.080
enjoyed you performing for us.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.280
So let's go ahead and give
him round of applause.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:38.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.460
SAM TSUI: Thank you for
having me so much, guys.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.660
Seriously, it was an honor.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.137
And I hope that was interesting.

00:52:44.137 --> 00:52:45.970
I hope you guys took
something away from it.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.630
Thank you.
