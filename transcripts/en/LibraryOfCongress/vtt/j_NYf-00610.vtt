&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.370
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, everyone,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.160
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.540
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, Chief of
the African Release Division.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.660
And it's a great pleasure
to have you all here

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.180
for what promises
to be a wonderful,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.700
wonderful presentation on Domes,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.380
Arches and Minarets
by Mr. Phil Pasquini.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.690
And I just want to
say a few words,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.220
as I do regarding what we
do here in the division.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.840
We're a division made up of
three sections; the African,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.080
the Mideastern, and the
[inaudible] sections.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.320
And we are responsible for
78 countries in Africa,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.620
the Middle East, Central Asia,
the [inaudible] and responsible

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.310
for many, many of the
languages in the region.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.370
Our specialists are
scholars with knowledge

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.960
of the region, of the languages.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.620
We are responsible
for the collections.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.950
So we command, we
collect, we shelve,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.000
we preserve and we serve.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.210
And we serve to our
patrons materials

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.880
in the languages
of those countries.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.490
So if you're doing research
on any one of those countries,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.190
the materials in those languages
are here in our stacks.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.340
But materials referring
in western languages

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.460
to those countries are part
of the general collection.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.990
We always do programs,
as the one we have today,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.330
to enrich our knowledge of the
countries that we cover to share

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.200
with our patrons
more information

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.270
about those collections,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.670
and to show how our collections
are being used, are being used

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.140
to write articles, to
write books, to inform.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.020
And many of our countries seem
often quite exotic [inaudible],

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.560
having little to do
with the United States.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.920
But today's program actually
shows how those very countries

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.960
have had an impact and continue

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.950
to have an impact on
the United States.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.570
And not just culturally
or linguistically,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.280
or in terms of food or whatever,
but physically in terms

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.870
of the very architecture of
the cities and the programs.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.770
And it's only by having
someone like Phil Pasquini go

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.120
around the country, observe,
take pictures, and show

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.780
and demonstrate the impact
of those cultures which seem

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.190
so foreign to many and yet are
integrated and very much part

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.940
of the United States landscape.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.840
It's only by having someone like
him show it that we understand,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890
we get a better understanding
of really the impact

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.060
of the world on the US.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.500
So in order to introduce
the speaker,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.530
we have Joan Weeks who's the
head of our [inaudible] section

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.090
and also the Turkish specialist.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.600
She wears both hats.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.130
And who met Phil Pasquini at
a gathering and invited him

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.660
when she realized how exciting
the work he was doing is,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.470
and she wanted to share

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.640
with everyone the
work that he has done.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.610
So Joan will introduce
the speaker,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.510
and thank you again all
for being here today.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.250
[ Applause ]

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.590
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank
you, Mary Jane.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.420
I'd also like to
welcome everyone.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.130
And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce our speaker.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.550
Phil Pasquini is internationally
acclaimed photo journalist.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.500
In his professional
career he has worked

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.700
as a college professor in
sculpture and industrial design,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.570
and has lectured
on these subjects

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.030
in Europe and the Middle East.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.150
Since 1999 he has been
a staff photographer

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.240
at the Washington Report
on Middle East affairs.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.240
This very interesting journal
I have here in my hands,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.370
and I invite you
to check for that.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.050
Also we have it in
our collections,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.540
and look for it as well.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.170
In his work as a
photo journalist,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.370
his photographs have appeared
in publications worldwide.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.290
He's also worked as a foreign
radio correspondent reporting

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.860
from Europe and the Middle East,
and across the United States.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.330
In 2010 he received
the prestigious Council

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.030
on American Islamic Relations,
CAIR Award, for fairness

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.410
and integrity in the media.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.580
In 1980 he received
a national endowment

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.830
for the arts individual
fellowship, which allowed him

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.220
to pursue a photographic study

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.550
of ancient Egyptian
art and sites in Egypt.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.600
That, to me, sounds very
exciting, to be able to be able

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.400
to go there and photograph
those fantastic treasures.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.530
He has traveled extensively
in North America, Europe,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.320
North Africa, and the Middle
East pursuing many significant

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.040
and historical news stories.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.730
His interest in Islamic
architecture first evolved

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.690
from a trip to Morocco in 1970

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.750
and has been an ongoing
photographic subject

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.460
in his work since that time.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.570
He illustrated his book
Domes, Arches, and Minarets

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.530
as well his lecture with images
from the library's prints

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.690
and photographs collection.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.850
Perhaps after today's talk
you'll see reflections

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.690
of Islamic architecture
around you.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.190
I, for example, as I was
preparing this, was reminded

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.490
of the paintings inside the
dome of the main reading room,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.620
which attributes the areas

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.930
of the world's knowledge
where they came from.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.260
And physics is attributed
to Islam.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.860
So perhaps you'll see
more of these reflections

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.160
as he goes through his lecture.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.940
Please help me welcome
Phil to the podium.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.740
Thank you.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.230
[ Applause ]

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.530
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: I
have to hydrate first.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.040
Let me start by thanking
Joan Weeks and Doctor

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.260
for inviting me here
today to speak.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.080
It's a great pleasure
to be here.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.280
And I also wanted to
acknowledge how much of a part

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.050
of this book I utilized the
resources of The Library

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.980
of Congress in its production.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.020
It was very instrumental.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.140
I just want to make
a few comments first,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.150
and then I'll get
into the presentation.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.470
But the purpose behind my
doing the book was, in part,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.370
to dispel the notion
that somehow on 911,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.870
which as you'll remember
we celebrated

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.730
or acknowledged the terrible
disaster yesterday, but how much

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.950
that caused people to think
that somehow Islam arrived

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.170
in America at that time.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.310
And what I tried to do in the
book historically was to focus

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.380
on how much Muslims have
been a part of our country

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.260
since before its inception on
the North American continent.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.060
And I will show you some
images that dispel that notion,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.710
at least for the most part.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.070
Domes, Arches, and Minarets.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.840
We're having the
presentation today.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.140
[Inaudible Comments].

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.490
Oh, I'm sorry, okay.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.650
Is this better.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.020
All right.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.610
Okay. Well, the presentation
today, okay, good,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.880
in no small part, is brought
to us by basically two people.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.470
Al Huzen [phonetic], who
was from Baghdad originally

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:44.000
but worked in Cairo in the
10/11 to 10/21 wrote a book

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.340
on optics based on Chinese
observations and discoveries.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.620
And he created the camera
obscure, which if you'll go

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.630
down to the Renaissance
you'll remember Da Vinci,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.570
a very [inaudible]
artist, utilized in order

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.090
to project images to
copy them in their art.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.980
And then, of course, more modern
times, today's presentation,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.670
with Apple computer and
the personal computer

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.430
with Steve Jobs who actually
has a Syrian background.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.550
So we don't think of these
things in those terms,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.990
but I think it's important

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.720
to conceptualize what
we're looking at today.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.490
The earliest building built by
Muslims, and there are only two

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.680
in the book that were
built by Muslims,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.760
and everything else was
built by non-Muslims.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.110
But the first one is
The Alamo from 1744.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.050
It was built by Moorish
craftsmen

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.790
and designed by Moorish
Craftsmen.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.690
And we think of it normally
as an iconic building

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.260
in the development
of Southern Texas

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.130
and Texicanos in
American history.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.460
But little is acknowledged
about its original origins.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.870
Much to their credit, at the
Alamo itself, there is a panel

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.790
that talks about the Moorish
design, which is most prominent

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.490
on the El Pheese
[phonetic] which is the frame

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.010
around the front door.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.080
And you can see in this
illustration the various

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.820
carvings of floral motif.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.280
Another building that was part

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.530
of The Alamo chain is the
Mission San Francisco de la

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.230
espada, which is an
important building.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.530
It was initially going

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.170
to be built much
larger than what it is.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.110
And the entry was a
quatrafoil, that you can see

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.490
on the image on the right.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.040
So it was a circular,
four shapes for a flower

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.000
and then a square running
into it, giving eight points,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.770
which is an important
thing in Islamic design.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.090
But when it was constructed,
you can see in the top image,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.390
the church was smaller.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.040
So they had to change
the pieces around.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.530
But had it been constructed
the way it was intended to,

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.490
you see it's much
larger for the entryway.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.460
And you get a better
sense for that shape.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.310
I first wanted to talk
about some of the influences

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.970
on Islamic design in
American architecture.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.880
And probably the best place
to start is with literature.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.950
Almost everyone in the 1800s
utilized The Bible as a source

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.090
of information and inspiration.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.250
And the illustrated Bibles
always depicted the Holy Land,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.840
as you can see in this image,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.140
with domes, arches,
and minarets.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.080
So it's always as though
everybody in the Holy Land lived

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.260
in either a mosque
or next to a mosque.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.730
You can see the city scape
is very filled with them.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:42.190
In 1883, the Villa Zorayda
was created by Franklin Smith,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.390
who was a self-taught architect.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.720
And he liked Islamic
style literature

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.230
and built this building based on
a couple of books that he read.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:00.090
And he brought to Saint
Augustine the Islamic style

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.070
of architecture that
it's so famous for today.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.400
If you go down there,
you'll see lots of buildings

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.910
with Islamic influence.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.930
The other thing that helped
induce people's interest

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.950
in the Middle East, it was
referred to at that time

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:19.050
as The Orient, was depictions of
illustrations from 1001 Nights,

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.480
the Genie in the Bottle and The
Fisherman and all these things.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.250
They're stereotypic,
iconographic images,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.500
but they're always
depicted on a city scape

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.090
over which is interposed or
superimposed domes, arches,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.390
and minarets once again.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.690
So this theme keeps
coming up visually

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.510
in many of these depictions.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.470
In Hollywood today, at The
Highland Center, which was based

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.910
on a film done by Cecil B.
DeMille, the ground is covered

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.490
around the concrete with
granite oriental carpets

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.280
that are designed.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.460
And it tickles me to see
people walking around

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.000
and they don't really
recollect or seem

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.300
to understand the significance

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.990
of the buildings'
Islamic origins.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.710
The only city built
in the US based

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:16.830
on 1001 Nights theme was
America's Arabian Night City

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.330
of Opalocka, Florida.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.460
In 1924 it was designed.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:29.390
Well, it started out as going to
be an English Tudor styled city.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:35.300
And the developer, Curtis, who
invented or worked on aircraft

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.020
and was instrumental
in development

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.270
of aircraft carriers decided,

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.060
when he took a woman
out, to look at the site.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.090
And she said, well, this
looks like 1001 Nights.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.960
So he hurriedly sent a telegraph
to his architect in New York

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.090
and said we're changing
the theme.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.670
I want it to be 1001 Nights.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.040
So the guy had to go out, get
a copy of the book, read it,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.620
looked at the illustrations
and came up.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.950
And this was the City Hall,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.730
which originally was
the real estate office.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.950
This is one of the homes
in the development.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.070
It actually had a dome
on it, at one point.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.420
So it looks like a
miniature mosque.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.210
But there's still 124 buildings
in the city, original buildings

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.990
from 1920s which depict the
theme in various manners.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.780
This is the Opalocka,
Florida train station

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.080
and it's still being used.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.510
It's been renovated and
it's now a childcare center.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.960
But if you dropped
me down there,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.460
I would swear I was in Morocco.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.380
It has such a heavy Moroccan
influence with the tiles

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.840
and horseshoe arches and so on.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.610
Another part of literature,
of course, is Ali Baba

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.870
and the 40 Thieves,
spelled Alibaba.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.220
In Costa Mesa, California
they managed

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.760
to slam Ali and Baba together.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.480
So it says Alibaba.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.680
This is a very American
building.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.340
The name is misspelled, for
what purpose I don't know.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.980
It's in Costa Mesa,
California and it's run

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.860
by a family from Taiwan.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.370
So it makes it even
more American

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.940
in that very diverse sense
that we all celebrate.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.960
Another influence on
the public's interest in

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.000
and the development of
Islamic styled buildings was

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.750
foreign travel.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.720
In the mid to late 1800s
only very wealthy people went

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.070
overseas, many of
them to the Holy Land,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.970
a lot of them around the Levont.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.420
And many came back and
either added acutriments

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.520
to the existing building
or the end

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.030
or the built what I call
a souvenir of their trips.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.500
This was one building
built by Frederick Church.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.010
You may remember him as the
Hudson School River Painter.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.090
He made a fortune on a
painting, a huge painting

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.070
that he charged 25 cents to see,
that went around the country.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.330
And he decided to build a
mansion after his family,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.160
his children all died
of child illness.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.430
And he and his wife decided
they would start a new family.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.040
They would build a new house.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.340
They would go overseas.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.640
They would come back and
they would have a fortress

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.470
to protect the family
from further problems.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.920
So he started a French
Mansard style mansion.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.450
After he got to North Africa,
he telegraphed his architect.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.110
There seemed to be a lot
of telegraphs going back

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.140
and forth with architecture.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.820
And he said, "I want to do
a Persian style building.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.580
So stop what you're doing,
and I'll send you drawings

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.880
and designs," which he did.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.160
And so today Alana
has this overlay

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.340
on a French Mansard
style structure

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.640
of his Islamic influence.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.220
And when you go in
the front door,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.290
there's a glass clear
story window above it.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.180
In Arabic it says
Morhaba [phonetic]

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.920
or Welcome in gold leaf.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.750
But his sense of
orientalism is very eclectic.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.470
He has Japanese,
Chinese, Himalayan,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.490
Great Masters Paintings
and all these other things

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.790
on the interior.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.720
So the interior and
exterior are somewhat

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.400
of a mishmash of styles.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.170
Another wealthy benefactor
to the arts was George Metz,

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.350
who had a lot of
money from furniture

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.800
and pharmaceuticals
in Quincy, Illinois.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.630
He went to North Africa and
sketched a lot of buildings.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.720
And when he came back,
he hired George or --

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.930
yeah, George Barinsmyer
[phonetic], a famous architect

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.860
in that region, to build
his house based on Tunisian

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.370
and Moroccan buildings
that he saw.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.880
And he carried the theme more
intensively on the interior.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.410
And here you can see
in this building,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.190
a very elaborate
beautiful building,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.090
somewhat Hollywoodesque in
that the black and portion

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.050
that you see on the walls
is actually painted.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.350
And these beautiful columns

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.170
with this turned spiral
is actually pieces of wood

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.600
that are glued together

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.700
and twisted slightly
to create deterrence.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.500
So labor intensive and
it has all the intent

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.590
of being authentic, but on a
very superficial sort of level.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.040
But nonetheless, a very
beautiful building.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.600
Amy Semple McPherson,
who was as many

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.430
of you may remember a
radio Christian Evangelist

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.780
who had a large following,
worked very hard in the 1920s,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.270
amassed tons of money
and decided

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.450
to build herself a retreat based

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.390
on her experiences
in the Holy Land.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.700
And so she had gone
to Jerusalem.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.170
And she came back and then
there's this disconnect,

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.830
Jerusalem being filled with
this wonderful brown stone.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.390
And she built an Andalusian
Spanish Moorish style building

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.060
where she went to
on the weekends.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.360
But it was quite hush hush.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.660
She didn't want her followers

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.280
to know she was spending
money on this.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.400
So in the 1930s after
the stock market crashed,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.290
she was noble enough to sell her
building and take the proceeds

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.120
and help feed people
who were her followers.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.670
And actually the church still
owns the building today,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.120
as far as I know.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.270
But it, too, is a
beautiful building.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:19:01.230
It formerly had crescents on
the tops of the two minarets.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.190
The church put the
cross up there,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.900
and the prayer room was the
room on the right with the dome.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.550
Famous buildings were
another source of inspiration,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.440
and this is the Taj
Mahal houseboat

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.740
in Sausalito, California.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.180
It's the only depiction of
Taj Mahal, that I know of,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.900
that has a wine cellar in
the basement below water.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.300
So it functions on a
very different level,

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.990
but it's a very beautiful
building as well.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.880
Of course you're familiar
with Aya Sophia in Istanbul,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.120
which is set the notion of what
standard architecture should

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.790
look like for Moorish
or for mosque design.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.920
It's been the inspiration
for a number of buildings,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.600
one of which was
the Shriners Temple

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.140
in Wilkesbury, Pennsylvania.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.580
You can see it looks very much
like it, with the exception

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.900
of the four minarets
which are Indo-Islamic.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.550
But it's a beautiful
building in very poor shape.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.750
They're trying to restore
it, and they've been arguing

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.660
about whether or not
it should be torn down.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.230
One of the most interesting ones
is the blue dome gas station

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:14.770
in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
based on the Aya Sophia.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.070
This was common.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.090
This was the first gas station
that was built on a corner.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.530
Gas stations, when
they were first built,

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.660
were built mid-block and
people had a hard time getting

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.960
in and out of them.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.300
Somebody got the bright idea
if we put it on a corner,

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.630
people can come from
all directions.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.130
And so this was the
solution to that.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.870
It has a mechanic's bay in an
L shape, and that's important

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.320
for what I'll show
you in a moment.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.400
Today this is a very famous
building that was going

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.040
to be torn down, but people
raised a lot of noise about it.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.340
So they kept it.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.540
And the district around it's now
called The Blue Dome District.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.080
So it's inspired
again from Aya Sophia

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.060
as Calmos [phonetic] number
1 was inspired in Hollywood,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.910
California on a corner
with a mechanic's bay

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.430
and L shape and two minarets.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.450
And some time ago
they tore everything

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.900
down except the minarets.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.550
So if you drive down
Sunset Boulevard today,

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.480
there are what people
refer to as rocket ships

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.050
or pencil towers, not knowing
the history behind the building.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.070
This just tickles me, because
it's so obvious and apparent

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.680
if you're really attuned
to Islamic design.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.380
But it has this wonderful
character about it.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.400
This is the Thanksgiving
Chapel from Dallas,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.560
Texas designed by
Philip Johnson.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.080
And when Dallas was doing
a renovation downtown,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.640
they decided they wanted
to celebrate a theme.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.430
And they came up with the
theme of Thanksgiving,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.050
and they offered that
to any group that wanted

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.510
to celebrate Thanksgiving
to come up with a design.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.020
So a group came together and
they hired Philip Johnson,

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.560
and he first came
with the mockett

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.030
of stacked blocks,
like a ziggurat.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.910
And he said this will work.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.240
And the woman who I met
there said this is crazy.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.960
Thanksgiving should
spiral the heaven.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.980
And he said I'll be back.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.300
And he went back and he knew of
the very tall minaret in Iraq.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.020
And he looked at that

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.060
and decided this would be a
good answer for the solution.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.440
And he came back and they built
a nondenominational spiral based

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.200
on the minaret, which, by the
way, the original minaret was

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.210
so tall that when the Moesn
[phonetic] called to prayer,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.890
no one could hear
him because he was

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.640
like 160 feet off the ground.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.730
World's Fairs were another
thing that induced people

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.080
to orientalist architecture
and styles.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.980
And the World's Fair in
Chicago in 1893 was one of many.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.470
They had the risque
belly dancer,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.280
Little Egypt, at that time.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.210
And one of the most popular
exhibits was the Moorish Palace.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.290
And there was always an
ethnographic division,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.720
and one of the most
popular ones starting

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.420
in France earlier was
called Streets of Cairo

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.770
where they had real Egyptians
and hookahs and oriental carpets

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.820
and souvenirs and
a sook and so on.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.830
And so this really built
this notion of familiarity

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:11.520
and interest in orientalist
design and architecture,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.960
much of which was
embodied later.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.290
This is the East
Indian Pavilion in 1898

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.210
at the Chicago World's Fair.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.020
And one of the people who
went there was a very wealthy

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.710
developer from California
who built El Miradero,

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.350
and that was Leslie Brand,
which today is a public library.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.140
But you can see how similar
these two buildings are.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.550
And he took lots of photographs.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.230
And when he came back,
he hired an architect

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.720
and this is what
he came up with.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.570
This is a famous building
that has a story behind it.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:48.350
Munenori Yamasaki is the
Japanese-American architect

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.170
who was interned during
World War II in the camps,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.980
went to college,
graduated as an architect.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.910
Went to an office,
started drawing lines,

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.070
got very bored, decided
to travel.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.640
Traveled around the world.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.940
Got to India.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.240
He saw the Taj Mahal.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.540
He went to the Middle East.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.840
He saw all these buildings

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.160
and he became enamored
with Islamic arches.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.850
And in 1962, he designed
the US Sinus Pavilion

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.450
for the Seattle World's Fair.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.220
But his most famous
building were the Twin Towers

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.330
in New York, which is kind of
a hidden piece of information

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.500
that they were influenced
by Islamic arches

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.250
and even referred to,
ironically enough, as The Plaza

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.130
between the two buildings
using a small M

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.530
as the mecca in the
United States.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.470
So there's this wonderful
connection that's so bizarre.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.060
And if you wrote it,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.600
people would consider it fiction
most probably originally.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.620
Advertising, another thing

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.290
where we have Ottoman Turk
tobacco being presented

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.590
in chocolates.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.630
The Egyptian theme.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.210
The Hills Brother
Sudanese drinking coffee,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.580
which was referred to as
the wine of the Arabia.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.160
I love that as coffee.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.490
It has wonderful ring to it.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.210
Hollywood, of course, has done
nothing to promote good view

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.430
of Arabs or Muslims, but
it has been instrumental

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.140
in reinforcing once again
this architectural designs

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.440
and so forth.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.720
And you can see in every
depiction there's the same thing

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.270
there, the same theme;
domes, arches, and minarets.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.890
Even movie theaters
were thematic.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.640
I can't think of how
many Islamaphobes may go

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.900
to Alhambra Theater and
never put the two together

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.090
in their mind as
separate and distinct.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.120
But one very interesting theater
is The Missouri Theater built

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.320
by the Boller Brothers
in St. Joseph, Missouri.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.940
They were regional architects
and they worked a lot

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.560
on thematic movie theaters.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.530
And here we have a Moorish
Endo-Islamic design.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.010
When you go inside it's
Assyrian and Babylon,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.680
for some unknown reason.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.580
They keep slamming
these things together.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.190
It has this beautiful painted
canopy and a light show of stars

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.720
and the moon going in and out.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.800
So it was really overwhelming.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.710
Nobody's done more for
Islamic design probably

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.650
than the Shriners, and
you remember those guys.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.470
They used to have what
they called Shrine Mosques.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.390
Then they called
them Shrine Temples.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.190
Now they refer to them
as Shriners Buildings.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.280
But they're the guys in the
little cars that drive around

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.580
and they have clowns,

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.780
raise money for benevolent
organizations.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.220
And they refer to themselves
as Masons who have fun,

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.360
which I think is
kind of a nice hook.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.840
Their earlier building,
the Lu Lu Temple

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.230
from 1904 in Philadelphia.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.180
Lu Lu in Arabic means pearl.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.870
So it was the pearl
temple, and it set the stage

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.450
for all following buildings.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.540
They wanted to identify
themselves on the landscape

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.980
in a unique Islamic style.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.820
And I don't think you can
go anywhere in the country

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.050
where there isn't an
old Shriners Temple

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.350
that depicts that.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.320
And these things have become
so familiar on the landscape

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.040
that no one thinks about their
origins or their influences,

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.400
which is rather interesting.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.330
The oldest building
built in Islamic style

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:16.200
in the US probably was
this building from 1829,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.830
built by Mrs. Trollop
[phonetic],

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.070
who was an English
writer who they referred

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.580
to as Old Madam Vinegar.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.000
I guess that talks a
lot about her demeanor.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.480
But she came to the
US as an abolitionist.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.720
She joined a group of
abolitionists in Memphis

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.250
in an area called German Town.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.490
It was nothing more
than a swamp.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:44.050
Their concept was to pay
slave owners what it cost

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.470
for a specific person and
take them under their wing

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.540
and let them work the
monies that they paid out.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.680
So it was really kind of a
mishmash of understanding

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.730
about giving people freedom.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.440
She lived there for about six
months, became very confused

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.520
by what was going on, left,
moved back to Cincinnati,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.220
said America has no culture at
all and Cincinnati has nothing.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.710
So she decided to create a
cultured temple, if you will.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.780
Seneca Palmer was her architect.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.220
They looked at buildings
from Egypt.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.000
She found a mosque she liked.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.620
She built this building.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.140
She used it for art
shows, poetry readings,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.100
musical performances, drama,
and various other venues.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.170
The whole thing went
bust in about six months.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.470
She was disgusted.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.040
She moved back to Europe.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.730
Later died and was
buried in Florence.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.260
But it was the first
purpose known building

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.550
in an Islamic style
that we know of.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.060
Another early building.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.780
This is Exodent [assumed
spelling], still with us,

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:48.110
in Columbia, Tennessee, The
Atheneum which was built

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:52.050
by President Polk's
nephew in an Islamic style.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.460
We believe that when it
was built the two wings

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.350
on either side were not there.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.670
So it was just a central
portion that was painted white.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.970
He never lived in it.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.770
He rented it to the
founder of The Atheneum,

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.430
who actually was the inventor.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.050
And in the book I talk a lot

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.860
about the history
of the buildings.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.490
And really it's a cross section
of known and unknown things

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.040
in portions of America
and art history.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.150
But ultimately to shrink
the story, the gentleman

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.570
who lived here invented one

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.830
of the first torpedoes during
the Civil War that was used

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.280
by the Confederacy
against the US Navy.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.440
So there's lots of
information that's ancillary.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.490
Well, the one person who
did a tremendous amount

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.820
for Islamic architecture
was PT Barnum

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.770
who built a building
he called Iranistan.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.500
And this and the
next image are both

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.910
from The Library of Congress.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.420
He was such a great promoter

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.640
that when the building was
being built and afterwards,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.400
people would go by on the
train from New York up.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:57.330
I can't think of the
town now in Connecticut.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.700
Bridgeport.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.350
And he got the time
tables and he hired a guy

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.740
who he dressed as a Hindu.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.200
Why, I don't know.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.640
And an elephant that
he put a plow on,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.850
and he had it plowing the fields

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.500
when the train went
up and came back.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.880
And this, of course, overnight
was a sensation in newspapers.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.180
Everybody picked up on it

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.270
and said Barnum's building
this Islamic styled house

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.930
and he's got, you know,
Arabs working in the fields.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.850
So the amount of information
was really messed up.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.920
This again is from The
Library of Congress.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.040
It's Iranistan, which
we know about the stans

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.900
and this is an interesting
depiction.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.880
He had one cardinal rule,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.040
and that was no smoking
in the building.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.030
He entertained Jenny
Lind here, who hated him.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.460
And when she came to this house
she said, "I'll work for you.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.960
I'll sing whatever you want."

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.910
So he got her under his wings.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.210
Somebody was working in there.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.140
They left their pipe
overnight and it burned up.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.220
It was completely destroyed.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.650
Another thing that
induced people's interest

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.940
in the Middle East or The
Orient, as it was referred

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.930
to again, was Jefferson Davis

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.200
who created the camel cores
just before the Civil War,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.820
where they brought camels from
the Lavont in Saudi Arabia

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.040
to the US for the US Military.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.410
And the calvary thought
this was kind of weird.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.840
And then when they got
on them to ride them,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.440
they absolutely hated
the camels.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.650
But this was in every
newspaper all

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.660
over the country
for a long time.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.850
They brought this
gentleman with him.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.850
He was actually a Greek
who had converted to Islam.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.140
His name was Haji
Ali [phonetic],

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.440
and they couldn't
pronounce his name

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.580
so they called him
Hi Jolly [phonetic].

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.750
And Hi Jolly was the
leader of the camel core.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.590
And when he died, they
buried him in Quartzite,

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.270
Arizona which is in the
middle of the desert,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.570
high desert in Arizona.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.120
And my wife Elaine and I visited
his grave a few years ago,

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.690
and would had not understood
about it was they used red,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.160
white, and blue rocks
in building the pyramid.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.780
So it's this very American
pyramid of Egyptian origin

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.500
with a camel at the top.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.690
But his story really induced
a lot of interest in things.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.530
And one of the most incredible
buildings is by Haller Nutt.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.040
Nutt's Folly they called it.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:19.250
This was built in Natchez,
Mississippi by Holler Nutt

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.770
who was a plantation owner.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.260
He was a cotton grower.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.160
And he and his father had gone
to Egypt and stolen some seeds

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.430
under the threat
of death, came back

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.420
and became fabulously wealthy.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.290
And for his wife, Holler
Nutt hired Samuel Sloan

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.050
from Philadelphia to
build this building.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.620
They started a year,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.080
couple years before
the Civil War started.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.920
And right when the Civil War
started, they were given a date

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.830
that all the Yankees, if they
weren't on the other side

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.930
of the Mason-Dixon
Line, would be executed.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.430
So all his workmen ran away.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.670
They only finished the exterior.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.590
The roof was unfinished,
but the roofer came back

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.070
and said I've got finish
it even if they kill me.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.140
The building's got to
be, have a proper roof.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.440
So he did fix it.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.840
But even today, if you go
there, you'll see buckets

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.620
of paint the way they
were left in 1862.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.260
The workmen just
abandoned the building

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.920
and it's been preserved
in that state.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.900
Here you can see all
the building materials

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.870
and the arches for
the stonework.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.620
The building's used now by a lot

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.880
of universities and
institutions.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.940
Architectural students
will come here to look

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.560
at building techniques
from the 19th Century.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.900
So it's a really
interesting place.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.430
It's a time capsule of
what went on in that era.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.440
Here you're looking
up into the dome.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.530
This is an interesting building.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.930
It's the Scroll and Key Tomb.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.600
For those who couldn't get
in to Skull and Bones at Yale

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.760
in New Haven, they
took their rejection

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.210
and said we'll build
our own tomb

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.900
and we'll do it in
Islamic style.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.950
And if you look at the two
buildings, Scroll and Key,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.490
and the bones men, as
they call themselves,

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.800
this is much more beautiful,
much nicer a structure.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.290
This is a Turkish pavilion from
Saint Louis in the park there.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.150
It's one of the more
interesting buildings.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.130
It should have a carousel
underneath it, but it doesn't.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.420
And it's a fantasy depiction

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.110
of what obviously a Turkish
pavilion would look like.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:32.940
This is an Israel synagogue
in Owensboro, Kentucky.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.340
And it utilizes two very
prominent Islamic designs,

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.420
the Turkish turbines at the top
and the gothic arched windows.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.260
And the gothic arched windows
are originally inspired

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.790
by Islamic architecture
in the Islamic arches.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.160
So we see this heavy
influence in both instances.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.340
This is the home
of Charles Curtis,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.750
the only Native American
Vice President in the US.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.520
It's in Topeka, Kansas.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.600
Charles Curtis was a Kaw
Indian, and he bought this house

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.880
from a doctor and
the doctor had.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.790
This was quite popular
at the time,

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.810
and that was putting
an accouterments

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.270
on an existing building
to make it more exotic

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.130
and give it an ambiance of
knowledge and experience

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.810
that the person may
not actually have.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:28.700
So they use these modified of
Moorished art, Moorish domes.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.320
This is in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.870
It was built by a doctor.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.950
Or actually it was built first.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.360
Sorry. It was built
by a lumber baron

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.410
who hired a Swedish-American
architect

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:42.710
to building the building.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.370
And he told him I
need two domes on it.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.400
So he built the barrels
to support the domes,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.350
and just below you can see
there are some circular designs.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.840
And those are Swedish, from
Swedish myths and stories.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.320
So we have another amalgam of
an Edwardian style structure

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.870
with Swedish accoutrements
in Islamic design.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.890
This was a building that was
instrumental in development

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:13.270
of the gasoline- fired soldering
iron, because the tinsmith

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:17.250
who was working on the modified
Islamic dome had an assistant

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.670
that ran up the ladder with a
hot iron and handed it to him

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.730
and he could seal about an
inch and it would cool off.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.060
And the kid would
have to run down

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.360
and grab another
one, run back up.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.130
So he thought I need
to do something,

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.990
and he invented this
particular device.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.290
While buildings were built,
so were tombs and cemeteries.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:39.640
And in New Orleans,
this was a tomb built

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.680
for the Lariden [phonetic]
family

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.930
in Islamic style,
rather interesting.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:45.820
If you see a Victorian cemetery,

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.990
you'll see depictions
periodically

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.530
of Islamic style buildings.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.590
This is a Tampa Bay hotel built

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:59.360
between 1888 and
1891 in Florida.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.030
The building is so huge
that when we went there

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.040
to photograph it,
we walked around it.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.650
It's one mile around the
exterior of the building.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.860
There are like something
like 500 rooms, hotel rooms.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.510
The developer, who was like
Flagler on the west coast,

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.040
had tons of money and went

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.350
to Europe while the
building was being built

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:25.660
and bought 18 train carloads
of antiques and European

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.350
and Islamic objects to
furnish his hotel with so

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.950
that New Yorkers
would be induced

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.660
to something they
were comfortable

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.150
with during the winter to be
ensconced in the same ambiance

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.060
that they had in New York.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.340
These are some of the
carpenter gothic details

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.140
of Moorish arches.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.680
And I love the minarets, the
domes on them in a Turkic style

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.140
in that they're painted silver
in the wonderful ironwork.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.460
This is the Union
building in New York

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.780
where Andy Warhol had his second
studio, where he was shot.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.810
And I believe a woman,
the other guy was killed.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.170
And his part of the studio was
the central part that you see

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.230
with the Moorish arch.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.300
These are buildings from the
20th and 24th Century now.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.600
This was very common.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.200
This is a Turkish corner
for smoking in Hannibal,

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.010
Missouri in a mansion.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.510
And actually Mark
Twain came here

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.540
and Samuel Clemmons came
here and gave a talk

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.140
and was very impressed by this.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.600
In fact, Moorish smoking
rooms became so popular

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.390
that Sears catalogs would
sell you the whole room

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.690
for about $80.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:40.930
You could have an ottoman,
a divan, a hookah, drapes,

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:44.390
all this stuff so that you
could have this in your mansion.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.770
And many of these
buildings had an extra room

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.990
that nobody identified with,

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.010
or the room was designated
specifically

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.900
for viewing a coffin when
one of the owners died.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.070
And after a while,
people found that as kind

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.780
of a morose kind of thing.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.080
So they decided to upgrade it,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:04.710
with the new smoking room,
Turkish smoking room.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.510
This is the Sauntry Mansion
in Stillwater, Minnesota.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.670
And Sauntry was a lumber baron.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.180
He was a very wealthy guy,
and he built the gymnasium

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.950
on his house in an
Islamic style.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.260
And he got his architect to
get passages from the Koran

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.820
in Arabic to stencil on
the walls, and they did.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.660
They stenciled them all
over the walls religiously.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.440
The only problem was they
couldn't read Arabic,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.210
so they were all
stenciled backwards.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.060
So it has this kind of
great character about it.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:35.580
Good intentions; bad,
you know, follow through.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.880
Berkeley, California.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.330
This is one of a number of
houses that look exactly alike,

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.770
except for this one which has
the OG [phonetic] Islamic arches

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.250
on the front porch.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.240
And I'm sure everybody in
the neighborhood talked

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.350
about this house and related
to it, in some way or other.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.530
But it's a very interesting
building.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.960
This is a wonderful
building in San Francisco.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.020
I remember this from many, many
years ago and from my youth.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.140
It's an Edwardian
structure that was built

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.450
by the Vindanta [phonetic]
Society, which is a followers

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.090
of a Swami who was
into medication

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.490
and vegetarianism and so on.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.790
He was at the World's
Fair in San Francisco,

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.550
and then he decided to stay.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.850
And he built this building.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:19.300
And the interesting part of
the design is across the top

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.030
of the building, each
of these structures.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.730
This is for Christianity.

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.210
This celebrates the
Hindu Temple in India.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.050
This was Islamic
Crescent and Trident.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.350
This one I love.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.910
It's the Hershey Kisses
domes, it's called.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.150
Below is a Mugal [phonetic]
style from Taj Mahal,

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.730
and then we have Moorish
columns and Mogel arches.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.200
So it's got really
everything thrown into it.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.340
And it's so exotic that
when you look at it,

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.640
you almost get retinal fatigue.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.060
There's so many things going on.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.430
This was a building built
by a very wealthy developer.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.330
It's called the El Hambra
[phonetic] Apartments.

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.270
He built his penthouse
at the top.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.210
I was not able to get in there.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:02.350
But it was a very expensive
building and very expensive,

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.650
at the time, part of town.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.250
Now everything around
it is pretty stressed,

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.260
but this building's been
maintained quite well.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.920
This is another favorite
building of mine, the Islamic.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.400
It's called The Islam Temple,

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.820
and it's now the
Alcazar Theater.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.120
And the Shriners were good.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.420
When they built the building,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.720
they always had commercial
spaces.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.820
And when I would show this to
my class, when I was lecturing,

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.990
they'd go that's the parking
lot, because they have a garage.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.310
It was built by T. Patterson
Ross, who was the architect

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:32.090
who rebuilt Chinatown
after the 1906 earthquake.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.740
And he built it in a hyper
Chinese style to look

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.040
like a series of temples.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.250
And to the westerners
it looks exotic,

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.920
and to Asians it looks
exactly like temples.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.940
And nobody can dispel
the difference there.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.140
But they hired Patterson
because he was a Shriner.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.960
And they said we want you
to build the new mosque,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.690
and he said I'll
be happy to do it.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:51.990
And he did.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.480
And he said there's
one thing I want to do.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.600
I want to put my name
on the cornerstone.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.290
And they went, no,
you can't do that.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.020
It's only for the potentate.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.360
Only his name can be there.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.810
And he said I got
to have it on there.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.520
And they had this
argument back and forth.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.970
So it was about 30
years after it was built

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.180
that somebody actually
who could read Arabic came

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.480
to the building.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.790
And they looked, and they saw
that across the top it said

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:16.940
in Arabic in these
glazed tiles "All Those

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.630
That Enter, Enter in Peace".

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:21.040
And on the right it says,

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.490
"Ross is an Architect
of No Equivalent".

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:27.040
And on the left side, it
has another depiction.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.210
So it was too late
to do anything.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.240
And he got his name
exactly where he wanted it,

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.120
which was pretty interesting.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.200
This is the tallest minaret
in the United States.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.740
It's 142 feet tall.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.830
It's in Helena, Montana and
it's attached the Algeria Temple

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.630
built in 1921.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:51.810
And around 1925 they decided to
take the top of the minaret off

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:56.130
and put a huge search light
so that aircraft flying

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.340
in would know they were
getting close to the airport.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.450
And fortunately the people
in town raised a ruckus.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.800
They went to City Hall and
they screamed and yelled.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.980
And they went, okay,
okay, we'll put it back.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.280
And they did put a top piece
on it, but it's very different

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.730
than what was there originally.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.710
This is another very funny
building, the Corn Palace

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.530
in Mitchell, South Dakota,
where all the paintings

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.190
on the building itself are
done with wheat and rye

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.630
and various grains and grasses

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.890
that are grown commercially
in the area.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.840
Corn palaces were used
to get people to move

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.500
to the upper midwest in the late
1800s when land was very cheap.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.050
And they wanted to display
what you could grow,

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.710
the bonny of the land.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.630
And so they would have these
pavilions and festivals,

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.830
and people would come from
different parts of the country

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.130
and decide that they
wanted to settle down there.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:50.150
So it was an inducement
to develop the land.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.030
This is the Angeles
Abby built in 1923.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.360
It's a cemetery in LA.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.720
This is a column barium.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.580
There are three primary
buildings there,

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.620
all incredibly rich styles.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.380
Some very academic, and
some more fantasy like.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:10.040
This is the town of Gerard,
California developed in 1923

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.250
by a guy by the name
of, what else, Gerard.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.340
It's now called Woodland Hills.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.250
But he built a faux Turkish
Village at the crossroads

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.730
and he had a published newspaper
every day about what was going

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.410
on in town, which was nothing
because it was empty lots.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:27.710
And he had a butcher shop

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.360
and a grocery store,
and a gas station.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.810
And he had what he called sucker
buses to bring people from LA

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.790
to the valley, where nobody
would ever live today.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.460
It's, of course, one mega city.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.430
But he used the Turkish
theme as an inducement

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.020
to draw people to
his development.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.070
This was one of the first
temples in New York, 1923,

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.440
The Mecca Temple built
for the Shriners.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.680
It just underwent another 60
million dollar renovation.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.440
I think they've had two
in the last 12 years,

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.060
if I remember correctly.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.160
It is an absolutely beautiful
building, both inside and out.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.020
The first female architect

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:09.080
in Los Angeles was Marie Russick
Hutcher [assumed spelling],

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.520
who was part of the Cortana
Society, who moved to LA

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.210
from Chicago and New York

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.430
and built their own
structures all in Islamic style.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.770
And they later moved to Ojai,

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.280
California when they
found cheaper land

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.490
and had different needs.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.750
This is the Sparklets
Drinking Water company,

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.400
which looks so Moroccan to me.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.820
It had two minarets that were
cracked during an earthquake,

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.410
so they were taken down.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:34.870
So this is all that's
remaining today.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:38.580
This is Patio del Moro,
which is a Tunisian tower

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.960
that you can see
in the background.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.160
It's El Mahad [phonetic],
so it's a square minaret.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.550
And then it has this
Islamic Moorish style,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.290
very beautiful building.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:52.250
Humphrey Bogart and one of his
mistresses had two rooms here

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.490
and there's a lot of Hollywood
history behind this building.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.180
It's rather interesting.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.480
I love this building.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.370
The Crescent Laundry
in Tyler, Texas,

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.030
and I love the railroad
crossing sign.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.400
And it's the perfect
composition, in my mind.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.250
They've renovated it.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.120
And in my mind, they've
completely destroyed it.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.750
They painted it and put flowers.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.500
But at the time that I
was able to photograph it,

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.160
it was still pretty
in its normal state.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.460
Apartments.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.760
Interesting building.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.650
If you look, there's a
Hershey's Kiss dome on the left

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.360
and around the dome
on the right.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.860
And if you look on the
windows just below the domes,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.970
the shapes of the exact
opposite from the one.

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.650
So it's this diagonal
crisscrossing.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:37.070
I like the American
flag in the window, too.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.860
And the Alamo parapet,
which takes us back

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.160
to the original building.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.840
I'm sure they used it
for other purposes.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.320
This is a wonderful
academically correct building,

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.920
if you'll accept that
it's both Endo-Islamic

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.410
and it has some Moorish
accouterments.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.250
The Shrine Temple and it's a
Tripoli Temple in Milwaukee.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.930
And I often wondered
what Shriners did.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:03.140
And Lynn and I, when we were
there, got to go inside,

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.520
and I found out they
drink beer and play pool.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.420
Because inside it's mostly pool
tables and big kegs of beer,

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.300
which is rather interesting.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.850
But here's the dome, the
interior of the dome,

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.390
which is absolutely beautiful.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:21.480
It has Star of David, and
then Koranic inscriptions.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.090
This is in Washington, DC,

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.950
the Almas Temple at
McPherson Square.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:31.520
They were building what's
now the new Washington Post

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.600
building, and the
developer wanted

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.400
to buy the property
and tear it down.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.020
And they fought him,
hook and nail.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.090
They finally struck a deal that
they would move the building

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.850
to the end of the lot, because
it was going to be in the center

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.490
where the building was.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:47.790
So the Shriners agreed to it.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.090
If they didn't have
to pay for anything

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.610
and they built everything
behind it brand new,

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:52.820
to meet their needs,
which they agreed to.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.930
So they took 30,000 tiles
off of the building,

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.830
built the new building,
went back to put them back.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.560
And somebody said
where's the plans?

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.980
And the answer was, what plans?

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.240
So they had to work for
three years in a warehouse,

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.280
reassembling 30,000 tiles back

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.780
to the original depiction
of the buildings.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.190
So I'm sure somebody lost
their job over [inaudible].

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.440
I can only imagine.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.480
This is, I call it,
the Vertical Castita.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.440
It's in San Francisco.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.740
You look at it.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.250
It has parabolic
arch, very Islamic.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.440
The Islamic screen and
so on is superimposed

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.700
between these other
two buildings.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.470
This is on 18th Street,
like 18th and Connecticut,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:40.260
I believe, a beautiful building.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.940
It's got some huge banner
about beer in front of it now.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.240
I don't know.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.510
It's a nightclub
perhaps, or something.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:50.430
This is a Moorish mosque
residence in Los Angeles,

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.040
has this wonderful dome
covered with mosaics.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.750
This was a Turkish building
at Crossroads of the World,

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.350
which is a studio that
Charlie Chaplin built.

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:03.820
And it has thematic
clusters of buildings.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:07.290
There's English Tudor buildings
and French Provincial buildings.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:11.020
And this is their depiction
of the Turkish building.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.150
Another tomb from
Metairie Cemetery

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.130
in New Orleans from 1939.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:22.520
This is Aub Zam Zam Cocktails.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.800
Zam Zam water is the
holy water from Mecca,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.200
and this guy is a Syrian.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.300
He didn't like Islamic theme.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.740
So he opened a cocktail
bar called Aub Zam Zam.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.200
And it's got these little
minarets above the top.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.930
You go inside, it looks
like Omar Kyam [phonetic].

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.890
There's all these paintings and
gazelles running on the wall.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:45.790
This is from 1947, the
National Date Festival

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.690
in Indio, California.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.300
It's a backdrop for the things.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.490
They have a play every
year, a thematic play.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.850
The year we were
there, it was Chinese.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:58.230
So it was almost like an
Iban Batuta [phonetic] thing

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:01.700
with this overlay, with
this in the background.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.600
And here's just one of the other
parts of it, which is, I mean,

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.150
out of context like this,

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:11.560
it could be anywhere
in the Muslim World.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.540
This is Frank Lloyd Wright's
Civic Center, Marin County,

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:17.240
were we live part-time.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.730
Frank Lloyd Wright was
hired by the King in Iraq

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.200
in the early 1950s, who
said I want to rebuild,

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.260
destroy Baghdad, want
to tear everything down.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.880
I'm going to build a
modern Islamic City.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.430
And Frank Lloyd Wright did a
tremendous amount of research

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.520
and came up with
all these designs.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.140
The King was deposed.

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.650
The project didn't move forward.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:44.440
In 1957 the community, county
community came together

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.160
and decided to build
a new civic center.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.360
They wanted to hire
an architect of note.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.890
So they hired Wright.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.380
They said we want
to build a building.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.680
What do you suggest?

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.150
He came to the site and he said
I know exactly what you want,

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:57.450
what you need.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:02.380
And he used his design to build
what's essentially a mosque.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.040
It has these large loyas
[phonetic] with arches,

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.490
and it's got this huge
dome and the minaret,

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:12.340
which in this case exhausts all
the exhaust for the building.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.280
But it's a beautiful building
and people pass it all the time

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.640
in recoliating [phonetic].

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.830
This is in a country club
plaza in Kansas City.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.380
The first, what can I say?

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.400
Shopping center that you
needed an automobile to go to.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.150
This started the
scorage on the land,

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.430
but in Islamic style as well.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.700
This is an interesting building.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.450
It's called The Mosque
by its neighbors.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.960
It's in San Marino
California, and every building

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.740
around here is a
ranch style house.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.160
And this is completely
incongruent

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.480
with its surroundings,
but very distinct.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.340
It was built on the
courtyard of the architects

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.590
from a famous El
Handra [phonetic].

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:54.850
This is the Palace of Wax
in Grand Prairie, Texas.

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:57.460
It was Ripley's building.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.680
So it's a thematic
building to induce people

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.630
for entertainment
when they enter.

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.190
This is Medina Wassel
[phonetic].

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:10.230
This is a US Army National
Training Center for troops

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:14.530
for pre- deployment
certification before they go

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:18.560
to Iraq or Afghanistan
and on this base.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.280
There are many bases that
have similar operations,

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.050
but on this case there are
13 what they call lanes

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:27.350
which are scenarios

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.260
for different depictions
of situations.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.570
And this one, it's
very calm looking

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.670
and then suddenly
everything starts happening

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:37.410
where some troops come
into town unguarded.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:40.790
And the so called insurgents
are trying to take them away.

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:44.350
And so they have to come in and
try to negotiate with people

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.170
and fight their way in
and fight their way out.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.990
So this is just one depiction.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:53.370
All the actors who are working
here are actually Iraqi natives.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.740
So they only speak Arabic.

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.120
And the buildings are all built
out of shipping containers

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.030
by a company that builds
Hollywood backdrops.

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:03.330
Here's another portion.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.600
You can see a solider standing
back, in the background,

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.920
and these guys are walking.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.750
But everything is domes and
arches and minarets, and so on.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:13.050
This I found interesting.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.000
This is from the college

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.110
that I showed you
earlier, Tampa University.

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:19.830
And this is an American
flag flying

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.030
under a crescent
ever since 1884.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.160
So it's been around
for a very long time.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.510
And that's the end.

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:34.930
[ Applause ]

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.330
I'd be happy to take
any questions

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:39.470
or comments that you have.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:40.770
Yes, ma'am?

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.650
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:49.450
I want to know [inaudible] very
curious [inaudible] Ukrainians.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:50.750
&gt;&gt; Ukrainians, right.

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.300
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's my [inaudible].

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.540
So it's up behind
their national shrine

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.840
up there with [inaudible].

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.140
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.370
&gt;&gt; It looks more like
a mosque than it does.

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:02.670
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: I'm
not familiar with it,

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:03.970
but I'll have to check it out.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:05.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:06.570
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, on like [inaudible]
and Taylor.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.170
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Okay.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:10.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, looks it's in
white with gold domes,

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.980
a number of gold domes.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.280
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Interesting.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.260
&gt;&gt; While it could be
in Saint Petersburg,

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.150
the colors don't match.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:18.450
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's just, yeah,
something to look [inaudible].

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.940
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Well,
there's the onion-shaped dome

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.940
on Russian Orthodox buildings.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.930
And that's borrowed, if you
will, from Islamic design

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:31.640
as well because where Russia is
and where these things overlap.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.990
So there's a lot of
cross-pollenization like that,

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:35.290
but I will check that out.

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.120
&gt;&gt; I think that dome
has a [inaudible].

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.160
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: It
could, yeah, interesting.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.100
Yes?

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.400
&gt;&gt; How [inaudible].

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.110
Because that number
being [inaudible].

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:51.700
I actually thought
it was a mosque.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.000
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.450
&gt;&gt; Until you walk up
to it [inaudible].

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.360
And they weren't expensive.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.660
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.960
Yeah.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.260
&gt;&gt; What is the connection?

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.560
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini:
So it goes back

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.620
to I can't remember the year,
but it was early 1900s I believe

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:09.050
that there was a
guy who was a mason

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:10.660
who was in Southern France.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.000
And he was invited to a party
for an oriental potentate.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.110
And we got there, everybody
was in oriental dress.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.160
They had Tarboosh
fezzes [phonetic]

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.870
and they had balloon
pants and turned-up shoes.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.190
And he thought this is great.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:28.560
This is exactly what
we need in the masons,

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.810
because it's so drab and boring.

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:32.110
And he came back to New York.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:33.640
And he met a fellow mason.

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.750
He was an actor, and the guy
that he met was a doctor.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.340
And they decided that
they would do something.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.310
So they said, well, let's
start a separate offshoot.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:44.280
We'll start the Shrine,
because they were thinking

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.970
about mosques and shrines.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.700
And so they started
The Shriners.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.780
And their depiction,
it's very Egyptian

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.920
if you look at the symbology.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.550
They have the Spinx and then
there's the Simatar [phonetic].

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.000
And when they meet somebody
they say [foreign language].

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.310
And the response is
[foreign language].

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:02.200
And they have a secret
handshake,

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.790
which I haven't been
able to get to the bottom

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:05.490
of because I don't belong.

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.870
And they originally
named their buildings.

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:12.050
And they purposely built the
buildings in an Islamic style

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.360
to make them distinctive
on the landscape.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.180
And this is what German Jews
did with mosques starting

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.680
in the 1850s in Germany.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.060
They decided they wanted
a distinctive style

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:29.280
for a synagogue that would
also delineate their presence

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.580
on the landscape.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.960
So The Shriners decided
to build these buildings.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.650
And when you see them,
they always have a fez on.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:38.610
And if you look, you
know, they have ties

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.250
with pyramids and so on.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:43.890
So they have become really
affected by all of that,

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:47.150
which I find really interesting
especially in today's world.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.320
And so many of these
things are disconnected.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.530
I don't know how many
people really know

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:56.380
that a fez has orientalist
or Islamic origins

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.900
or now it's been used a
sign, a symbol of repression

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.850
under the Ottomans and so on.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:03.720
So there's all these
historical, you know,

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.800
things that go on
with it was well.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.220
That's kind of a backdrop.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.330
And I do go into the history
of The Shrine in the book,

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.140
because I wanted to
contextualize that as part

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.130
of this history as it
evolves and moves forward.

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.060
But they're significant.

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.370
And since doing the book, I
think I found over 235 buildings

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:23.180
that are still existing
in this style.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.210
So they're pretty
much everywhere.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.270
And a lot of people will say
to me afterwards, you know,

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:31.370
I was in Philadelphia and I
was going down this street.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:34.110
And after I saw what
you had in that book,

00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:35.410
I saw this other building.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.980
So these people have
become, you know,

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.820
sensitized to opening their
eyes and seeing these things,

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.200
which I think is really
positive, you know, good thing.

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:46.330
Yes?

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:51.560
&gt;&gt; On a more contemporary level,
I know when you go down I-75,

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.920
Toledo, Cleveland, there's a
big mosque there on the side

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.810
of the highway of I-75.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.200
Are you familiar with that one?

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.500
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: No, I'm not.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.730
I haven't gotten outside of
the beltway, when I'm in DC.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.200
It's a big problem for me.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.130
&gt;&gt; And the second thing
I was going to ask.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:18.570
I was just at a convention
in New Jersey [inaudible].

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:21.840
You've been to Harlem?

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.140
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini:
In New York, yeah.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.600
&gt;&gt; Okay. When you go, there's
a building that's now called

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.900
[inaudible] Malcolm
Chabazz [phonetic].

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.200
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah, Chabazz.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.500
I know it, yeah.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.420
&gt;&gt; The architect who
put the dome on there,

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:37.600
he was given an award,
a lifetime award.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.900
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Oh, good.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.710
&gt;&gt; His last name is Sampson.

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.400
He's 90 years old now.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.370
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah, that's
an interesting building.

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.390
That's about a block away
from the Chabazz Market,

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.020
I think, which is near there.

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they actually
run the market.

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:53.840
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini:
Yeah, they do, okay.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.140
Yeah, I thought it
was connected.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.440
That's cool.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.740
That's a good building.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.040
Yes, Joan?

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.340
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: I'm just
absolutely fascinated with all

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.890
of the way, his stories
behind his buildings

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.950
and how he uncovered
some of those stories.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:11.070
[Inaudible] historical societies
or have you come across people

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.590
who kind of remember how
these things [inaudible].

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:17.060
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: It really
somewhat serendipitous and a lot

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:22.110
of hard work, and a lot of
Googling, a lot of reading,

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.010
a lot of looking at maps
that were located in the map

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:29.750
and geography division in
The Library of Congress.

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:31.560
And then just a lot of
real hard searching.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.020
And in some cases, I was able to
find the architect of buildings

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.740
that nobody knew who
the architect was.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.770
It had gotten lost in
historical records.

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.800
Some people, when I went to the
building, they said, oh, yeah,

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.100
we love this building.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.230
It's the only one
in the US like it.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.160
And I felt terrible telling
them no, it's one of many.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.940
But it was a good learning
experience for them,

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.890
because then they
realized that, you know,

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:54.690
Islamic design has been
part of American culture

00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:57.420
for a very long time,
before we were a country.

00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.490
And so, you know, they somewhat
came more around to thinking

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:04.520
about these things
as not threatening,

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.290
but as part of a
historical thing.

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:08.890
But a lot of reading.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:11.460
I met a lot of wonderful
people who are caretakers

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.170
for the buildings, who
are really into it.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:16.150
Many of them had stories.

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:20.820
Holler Nutt's Building
in Natchez.

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.010
I met a woman who lived
there, when she was a kid,

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:26.010
because her aunt was
a descendant of Nutt.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:29.540
And they lived there as a
child and tourists would come.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.970
And she'd tell people,
oh, don't go in that room.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:32.270
There's a ghost in there.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.570
And these people are,
oh, my God, you know.

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:36.580
And so they had their
own interpretation

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.880
and depiction of the building.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.290
So I did learn quite a lot from
people who owned the buildings.

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:44.530
And then I tried to,
each plate in the book,

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.890
there on the left
side there's the names

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:49.560
of the building's been known
under, the year of construction,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.100
the style, the architects'
names, and then whether

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.880
or not it's something
historical,

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.530
the National Registry
for Historical Buildings.

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.530
And then I put as much as
the history that I could find

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.720
about the building
there as well,

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.500
and then on the right side
is the full photograph

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.800
of the structure.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.620
So it acts both as the
historical reference

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.990
and a catalog of
these buildings.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:14.880
Some, as I said, are in bad
shape and need rehabilitation.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.340
But it was a labor of love.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.570
It took me five years, and we
traveled around at 25 states.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:25.060
And then we'd have to stay in
a town at least four days just

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.520
so I could shoot buildings at
different times of the day.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.910
And one day it would rain,

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:30.790
the next day the sun
would be out, you know.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.040
The usual thing, trying to catch
everything in its perfect light.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.440
So a labor of love it's been.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.020
&gt;&gt; So how did you [inaudible].

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.200
I mean what was your approach?

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.860
As you said, you went to
these five different states.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:48.240
So did you know already that
these buildings were there

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.880
or did you discover them, or
how did you find out about them?

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.200
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Well,
I did a lot of research.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.190
So, for example, I
went to Tennessee

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:58.560
to photograph a number
of buildings.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.110
And I was driving back
to the hotel in Memphis.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.000
And I went, oh, my God, look.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.240
Here's this beautiful Islamic
building I knew nothing

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.540
about it.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.840
It's now a law office,

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.700
but it was an apartment
house I think originally.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.270
So somewhat serendipitous.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.530
The one I talked about with the
inventor of the soldering iron,

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.490
we were walking down
the street in Rapid City

01:02:17.490 --> 01:02:19.080
and turned the corner,
and here's this building.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.070
You know, it was almost maybe
divine intervention I was pulled

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.410
to these buildings.

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:25.830
So it was a combination of
both, of concerted effort

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:29.150
and in a few instances
just happening upon things.

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:31.900
Or someone would tell me, well,
if you like this building,

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.780
you should see the one, you
know, five blocks over there.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.370
And I'd go and it would
either be an Islamic building

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:40.040
or it could be a Russian
Orthodox church or something,

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.430
you know, not connected.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:44.830
But it had some of the same
similar architectural details.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:48.880
And so that's a good question
and it did evolve in some ways.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.180
Yes?

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.640
&gt;&gt; So what was your
original inspiration?

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.350
Did you go to Morocco first?

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.820
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: In
1970, I went to Morocco

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.940
and it seemed very exotic to me.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.240
And only later did I find

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.050
out that my mother's family
had lived there 500 years

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:09.830
in the year 1010 to
about 1121, or something.

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:12.200
So that kind of pulled
me into it.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.130
But I always liked
Islamic styled things,

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.690
because it seemed
so exotic to me.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:18.460
And as a kid growing
up in Sacramento,

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.080
California where
there's really nothing.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.540
And I went to El Hambra
Theater when I was a kid,

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.130
and it was orientalist.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.050
And that totally, you
know, got my interest.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.080
I did the book, as I said
earlier, because I wanted

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.420
to dispel the notion that
this call came about on 911,

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:38.810
that Muslims arrived in
America with nefarious intents.

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:41.780
And I wanted to contextualize
that history properly

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.750
in the sense that
Muslims have been

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.980
in America before it
was even a country.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.290
And we know that
historically on many levels.

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.870
And there's a wonderful book,

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.790
and I can't recollect
the title of it now.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:59.250
But in it, he talks about the
history of music and poetry

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:03.210
and dance and design and many
things that have Islamic roots.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:08.850
Mathematics, for example, that
are not often credited properly

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.550
and seem as a construct of
Western European invention,

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.310
and we know that not to be true.

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:16.570
It's always interesting
when people are arguing

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.920
about diversity, and
they pick up a newspaper

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.290
and I think you're reading
something in the Latin alphabet

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.800
and you're looking
at Arabic numerals.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.530
I don't know how more
diverse that can be.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.070
So we kind of remove
ourselves from these things.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.370
Does that answer your question?

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:31.670
&gt;&gt; It does.

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:32.970
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yes,
you had a question also.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.270
I'm sorry.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.570
Yes?

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.870
&gt;&gt; Well, do you know
about the [inaudible],

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.030
which was the Turkish Embassy?

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.330
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yes.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:45.320
&gt;&gt; About 20 years ago?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.620
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.770
&gt;&gt; And now they have
a different building,

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:52.560
but that building serves
as the [inaudible].

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.860
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Right.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.110
&gt;&gt; And not so much
outside of it.

01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:57.410
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Right.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:58.710
&gt;&gt; But it's [inaudible].

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:00.010
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: I haven't been
inside, but the exterior, yeah.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:04.030
&gt;&gt; A Turkish ambassador
lives there.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.330
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Right, right.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.630
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible].

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.930
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:09.230
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:10.530
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: I'll get in
there one day and check it out.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.830
&gt;&gt; But that would be.

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.130
My understanding,
that was built.

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.620
That building was built by
an American who maybe lived

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:18.850
in Istanbul or was very familiar
with the Islamic architecture.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.150
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Interesting.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:21.450
&gt;&gt; He was very inspired.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:25.090
And then he built
that building, house,

01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:26.390
mansion [inaudible] Circle.

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:34.600
So it came up for sale, I
think, about maybe the '30s,

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.860
'20s or '30s of last century.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.160
So the Turkish [inaudible].

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.460
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini:
They bought it, yeah.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the
story I [inaudible].

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.060
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Interesting.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.360
&gt;&gt; That might be
of interest to you.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.660
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yeah, I would.

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.150
&gt;&gt; When you're expanding
your research.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.450
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: You know,

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.750
someone asked me why
didn't you do the interiors

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.050
of the buildings.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:54.950
And I didn't want to do a book
that was this thick, you know.

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:58.160
But the interiors of many
of these buildings are

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.350
so beautiful, and many
of them are thematic.

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:04.140
And some of them are completely
incongruent with their exterior.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.700
They've just never built
anything, you know,

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.850
really exotic on the inside.

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:13.370
But there's a lot of
wonderful buildings around.

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.780
Anything?

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.310
&gt;&gt; Can I also ask you?

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:17.610
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Yes.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:18.910
&gt;&gt; Is it too late?

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.600
Okay, I'll ask.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:26.320
That's okay.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.880
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank you so
much for a fascinating lecture.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.180
[Applause]

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.480
&gt;&gt; Phil Pasquini: Thank you.
