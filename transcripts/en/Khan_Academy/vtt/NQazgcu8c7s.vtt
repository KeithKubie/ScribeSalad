00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.770
We're on part b.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.940
Write the first four non-zero
terms of the Taylor series

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.200
for cosine of x
about x equals 0.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.420
Use this series and the
series for sine of x squared,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.440
found in part A, to write
the first four non-zero terms

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.990
of the Taylor series
for f-- so, for this f

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.340
right over here--
about x equals 0.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.260
So let's just do the first part.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.450
Let's find the first four
non-zero terms of the Taylor

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.240
series for cosine of
x about x equals 0.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.820
So let's just say-- well, we'll
put our formula for the Taylor

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.780
series up here around
x is equal to 0.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.320
So we're centering it around
x equals 0 right over here.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.520
And so if we say that h of x
is equal to cosine of x, then

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.550
h of 0, is going to
be equal to cosine

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.860
of 0, which is equal to 1.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.460
And then, if you
have h prime of x,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.842
that's going to be equal
to negative sine of x.

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:00.050
And you could look over here.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.270
This is essentially h of x.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.870
And this is going
to be h prime of x.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.459
So it's essentially
one step ahead

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.090
of where we were with g of x.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
Well, we'll just redo it
over here just so it's clear.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
So the first derivative
at 0 is negative sine

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.830
of 0, which is just 0.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.344
And then you have the
second derivative of h of x.

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:23.260
So the derivative of
sine of x is cosine of x.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.760
But we have that
negative out front,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760
so it's negative cosine of x.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.210
So h prime prime of 0 is going
to be equal to cosine of 0

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.796
is 1.

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.170
You have that
negative out front.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.650
So it's negative 1.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.740
And then you have the
third derivative of h

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.680
is equal to derivative
of negative cosine of x

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.080
is positive sine of x.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.630
So the third derivative at
0 is going to be equal to 0.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.410
And then you take the
derivative of this,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.290
you're going to get
cosine of x again.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.650
So then the cycle starts again.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.920
So I could write, this is also
equal to the fourth derivative

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.460
at 0.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.960
Right, you take-- let me just
make it clear what I'm saying.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.430
If I take the derivative
of this, I get cosine of x.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.037
The fourth derivative of
h is cosine of x again.

00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:15.620
So the fourth
derivative at 0 is going

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.786
to be the same thing as the
function evaluated at 0,

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:18.720
which is 1.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.860
And so the fifth derivative
at 0 is going to be 0.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.780
The sixth derivative at 0
is going to be negative 1.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.400
And then the seventh
the derivative at 0

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.070
is going to be 0.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.240
So that's enough, now.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.050
I think we definitely
have four non-zero terms.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.450
We have this term-- let me
pick a nice color here--

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.870
we have this term, because
we have a 1 coefficient.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.390
This is going to be a 0 because
we have a 0 coefficient.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.870
This is a non-zero term.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.470
Then this is a non-zero term
because we have the 1 again.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.040
And then this is a non-zero term
because we have the negative 1.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.430
So we could say that cosine
of x is approximately

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.600
equal to-- because we're
just approximating it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.360
with the first four
non-zero terms.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.130
So f of 0 is 1.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.010
So that's this term
right over here.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.121
Instead of f of x,
we're calling it

00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.120
h of x right here, so
that we don't get confused

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.117
with that original f
defined in the problem,

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:18.200
and that we're going to
work on in the second part

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.630
of this section of the problem.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.620
So cosine of x is equal to 1.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.850
h prime of 0 is 0, so
there's no term there.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.240
Then f prime prime of 0, second
derivative, it's negative 1.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
So it's negative x
squared over 2 factorial.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.740
And then you get another 0
for the third degree term.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.860
Then you get a 1 for
the fourth degree term.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.030
So plus 1.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.760
But we don't have to write
the 1, it's implicitly there.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.930
Plus 1 times x to the
4th over 4 factorial.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.720
And then the next non-zero term
is this negative 1 over here.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.360
So minus 1-- we can
just write minus--

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.080
and that's the
sixth degree term.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.216
So x to the sixth
over 6 factorial.

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:00.840
And we're done.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.660
Those are the first four
non-zero terms of cosine of x.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.787
Now let's do the second
part of the problem.

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:08.870
So we did this first part.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.930
Use this series and the
series for sine of x squared,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.190
which we found right over
here, sine of x squared--

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.820
actually, I think
we wrote it, this

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.470
is the series for sine of x
squared when we simplified it.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.600
Use those-- that was
found in part A--

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.220
to write the first four non-zero
terms of the Taylor series

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.510
for f about x equals 0.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.830
So where's our function again?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.140
So our function is sine of
x squared plus cosine of x.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.670
Let me rewrite that.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:47.230
So f of x is equal to sine of
x squared plus cosine of x.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.806
So let's write the first
four non-zero terms.

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.680
And you want to start
with the lowest degree.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.749
So you could say
that f of x is going

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.790
to be approximately equal
to-- because we're just

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.970
approximating it with this
polynomial right over here.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.930
So, from cosine of x-- so
you have this right over here

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.540
is cosine of x.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.950
And sine of x is over there.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.750
So between both of these,
the lowest degree term

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.900
right over here is this 1.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.450
So I'll write this 1 over here.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.360
And then after that, the next
lowest-- in either of these,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.700
we have no first degree terms.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.340
We have no x terms.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.340
But then, in both of these,
we have an x squared term.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.375
Actually, let me write it this
way to simplify what I'm doing.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:30.500
Let me just write them out.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.280
So sine of x squared-- let
me do this in a new color.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.390
Sine of x squared is this thing.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.020
This is what we
figured out in part A.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.454
So that is x squared minus
x to the sixth over 3

00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:43.620
factorial-- I'm going to
just write the whole thing,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.000
and then later we'll pick
out the first four terms--

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
plus x to the 10th over 5
factorial minus x to the 14th

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.580
over 7 factorial.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.186
So that's the first
four terms of that.

00:05:56.186 --> 00:05:57.310
So this isn't exactly that.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.768
That's approximately
equal to that.

00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:00.060
So approximation.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.250
And then cosine of x,
we just figured out,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.600
is plus 1 minus x squared
over 2 factorial plus x

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.210
to the 4th over 4 factorial
minus x to the 6th over 6

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.400
factorial.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.130
Now we can pick out the
first four non-zero terms.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.172
And since we're assuming
this is a Taylor series,

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.171
the first term is going
to be the lowest degree,

00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:25.750
then we're going to keep
going at higher degree terms.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.070
So the lowest degree
term right over here.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.230
So once again, f of x is going
to be approximately equal to.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.090
The lowest degree term
over here is this 1.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.782
So let's write the 1 over here.

00:06:36.782 --> 00:06:38.740
And then, we don't have
any first degree terms.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.781
We don't how many just x
to the firsts over here.

00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:42.570
But we have a couple
of x squareds.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.390
So that will actually
be the next term,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.140
because we can add
those x squareds.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.167
So this right over here,
you have x squared-- so let

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.250
me just write it this way.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.160
So plus this x squared minus
x squared over 2 factorial.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.270
And x squared over 2 factorial
is just x squared over 2.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.670
So minus, I could
write 1/2 x squared.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.620
And I'll simplify
this in the next step.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.536
That's just going to be
one term, because this

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:10.310
is going to end up
being 1/2 x squared.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.810
All right.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.720
Do we have any third
degree terms here?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.940
We do not have any
third degree terms.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.130
Do we have any fourth
degree terms here?

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.860
We do.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.970
We have this character
right over here.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.470
It's a fourth degree term.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.025
So plus x to the 4th
over 4 factorial.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.270
And then finally, do we
have any 5th degree terms?

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.430
We don't have any 5th
degree terms, no x

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.450
to the 5ths over here.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.070
Do we have any 6th degree terms?

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.800
We do.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.610
We have this one and this one.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.089
So this is going to be minus--
there's a negative sign out

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:50.130
in front of both of them.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.900
So it's going to be minus x
to the 6th over 3 factorial

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.400
plus x to the 6th
over 6 factorial.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.770
You could say it's minus x
to the 6th over 3 factorial,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.269
and then you could distribute
the negative sign if you want.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:03.530
I just factored it out.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.320
And now we can just simplify
this thing right over here.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.860
So this is going to be equal
to-- so f of x is approximately

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.330
equal to-- 1 plus-- and then,
if you have an x squared

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.560
minus half of an x squared,
you're going to have 1/2

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.210
x squared.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.390
Or I could just write x squared
over 2, plus x squared over 2.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.860
And then you have, in that blue
color, plus x to the 4th over 4

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.150
factorial.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.130
And then, to simplify this,
3 factorial 6 factorial.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.059
So this 6 factorial
is the same thing,

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.450
just to make
everything clear to us.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.940
6 factorial is the same thing
as 3 factorial times 4 times

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.410
5 times 6, or 3
factorial times 120.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.390
And so what we can do is
multiply the numerator

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.370
and the denominator here by
4 times 5 times 6, or by 120.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.710
So let me just rewrite this.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.580
So I'll do this
over here because I

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.540
want this to be my final answer.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.080
So if I have x to the
sixth over 3 factorial,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.930
I can multiply the
denominator by 4 times 5 times

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.750
6, and then multiply the
numerator times 4 times 5 times

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.580
6, which is the same thing
as multiplying it times 120.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.440
So you have 120 up there.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.729
4 times 5 times 6 is also 120.

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:26.270
And now we have the
same denominator,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.620
because this is the same
thing as 6 factorial.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.320
So you have 120 x to
the 6 over 6 factorial

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.290
plus x to the 6th over 6
factorial gives you 121 x

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.570
to the sixth over 6 factorial.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.470
And we have this
negative sign out here.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:50.550
So it becomes negative 121 x
to the sixth over 6 factorial.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.740
And we're done.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:58.630
We've figured out the first four
non-zero terms of our f of x.
