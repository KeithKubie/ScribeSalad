00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.600
Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World History.
Today we're going to talk about drought and famine.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.640
Really, Stan? When are we going to talk about, like,
peace and happiness? I feel like we've been

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.920
on kind of a sad run here at Crash Course.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.950
You know what, actually I'm gonna talk about
peace and happiness, but not until the very

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.250
end. In the mean time, drought and famine.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.400
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! This is science again. Famines
are just natural disasters, they happen sometimes.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Yeah, Me From the Past, no. For the most part,
famines have historically been man-made disasters.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.000
So Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen
commented that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.510
"starvation is the characteristic of some
people not having enough food to eat. It is

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.440
not the characteristic of there not being
enough to eat."

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.829
In other words, people starve it's often because
they are unable to obtain food that might

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.039
be available somewhere in their vicinity.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.629
The issue isn't existence of resources, it's
access to resources.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.969
And there are a lot of ways that humans can
contribute to famines. Right, like, take governments.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.139
Sometimes governments just do a bad job of
providing relief to starving people. Other

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.439
times, they have deliberate policies that
lead to starvation.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.369
The most obvious example of that is Stalin's
collectivization and subsequent terror, which

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.249
killed millions of Ukrainians and Russians
between 1932 and 1933. There's also Mao's

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.500
Great Leap Forward which caused famines that killed
up to 10 million Chinese people in the late 1950's.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.599
And in the Capitalist world market forces
can cause famines, such as when there's enough

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.359
food to keep people from starving but they
can't afford to buy it.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.990
Shortages or panic cause prices to go up,
then people who can afford to pay end up hoarding

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.679
resources and people who can't afford to pay
end up starving.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.380
Now, drought and other natural disasters can
create shortages but hoarding makes them much

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.149
worse. Like, think about the price of bottled water
in Florida when a hurricane is about to hit.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.900
But of course, when it comes to the disaster of famine,
people can't do it alone. We need weather's help.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.739
Okay, so here's a map of famines. You'll notice
that they often occur in what historians sometimes

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.559
call the global south.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:08.200
Good job with the naming there, historians.
I might have called it The Drought Belt. Or

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.439
the, ah, Southern Hemisphere.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.959
Southern latitudes are more effected by weather
related to El Niño. El Niños affects wind

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.769
and rain patterns and they're associated with
weak monsoons and droughts is parts of Asia,

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.129
Africa and north-eastern South America.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.239
By the way, the fact that north-eastern South
America is a grammatically correct phrase

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.170
in English indicates that there is SOMETHING
WRONG with historians and naming!

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.829
Right, but my point is that weak monsoons
can be devastating to agriculture in Asia.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.109
If the spring rains don't come, the wheat
crop will be poor and if the summer monsoon

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.590
fails the entire year's harvest can be lost.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.099
And El Niño also contributes to famine in
East Africa where it accounts for about 50

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.459
percent of the variance in rainfall. Now,
El Niño probably contributed to recent famines

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.689
like the one in China between 1957 and 1959,
that's associated with Mao's Great Leap

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.659
Forward, but we're going to focus on some
perhaps lesser known food disasters. Especially

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.049
the ones that occurred in India, in the late
19th century.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.310
India was Britain's most populous and most
important colony in the 19th century and also

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.379
the scene of it's greatest colonial failure,
which is really saying something.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.310
The famines that struck India in the last
quarter of the 19th century claimed millions

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.170
of lives and they highlight the devastating
combination of market forces, government policy,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.859
ideology, and bad weather.

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.269
Now, it's tempting to blame those devastating
famines on the severe El Niño events that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.599
occurred in those years, but it's important
to note that there have been El Niños that

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.030
didn't result in famine and also famines that
aren't related to El Niño.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.049
When studying history - and also when doing
anything else - we seem to have this urge

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.849
to essentialize, to find, like, the one secret
cause of terrible or great things. I understand

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.010
that urge to find the one true problem, because
then maybe we could find a one true solution

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.999
but it just doesn't work that way. The truth
is always nuanced.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:58.180
Okay, so until about 1800, India was the world's
leader in textile production with the industry

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.719
employing millions of people at wages that,
while not extravagant, were more than enough

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.659
to avoid starvation. This was largely due
to the fact that food prices were low because

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.849
Indian agriculture was very productive.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.480
And then, the British happened.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.290
Let's go to the thought bubble.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.180
As industrial manufacturing took off in Britain
the labor intensive Indian textile industry

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.280
couldn't compete. So, former Indian textile
workers turned to growing cotton for export

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.330
which required land, seed and fertilizer,
which cost money. And that drove many Indian

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.190
cotton farmers into debt.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.099
Government policy made things worse, especially
tax policies.

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.830
Now, I like taxes, when they pay for things
like schools and infrastructure, but taxes

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.240
can be bad when they fall on those least able
to pay them. In British-India colonial taxes

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.449
forced peasants further into the market economy
because they had to be paid in cash.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.430
Now, to service that debt, and pay all of those
taxes with money, Indian farmers needed a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.400
cash crop which meant yet more land devoted
to cotton and less land devoted to growing food.

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.389
During the 1876 to 1878 El Niño drought,
British administrators continued to collect

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.240
taxes which meant that Indian peasants continued
to have to grow cotton instead of food. And

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.919
when droughts struck again at the turn of
the 20th century, the British raised taxes

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.240
24 percent and then confiscated the land of
farmers that refused to pay.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.620
Those taxes largely went pay for the British
military and only rarely did Indians see a benefit.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.699
The only area where the British did locally
invest the money they collected was in railroads,

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.669
but those were a mixed blessing. The railroads
could have been used to alleviate famine by

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.750
bringing much needed food, but usually they
just shipped raw materials to markets.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.479
In fact, during the 1876 to 1878 famine, to
quote one historian, "The population decreased

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.479
more rapidly where the districts were served
by railways than where there were no railways."

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.770
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.180
Oohh, it must be time for the open letter!
Bet it has something to do with railroads.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.310
Oh my gosh, it's lions! An a open letter to
The Ghost and The Darkness.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.220
Hey there, The Ghost and The Darkness. You are
the two most famous man eating lions of all

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.259
time. But the story of why you actually ate
humans turns out to be pretty fascinating.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.289
So the British also built railroads in Africa,
and in order to build them quickly, they needed

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.780
lots of labor, and that labor needed lots
of food. Hunters killed almost all of the

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.039
available game which deprived local lion populations
of food and then because there was lots of

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.449
malaria, all the people with malaria were
together in a sick tent, and then The Ghost

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.080
and The Darkness would, y'know, go to
the sick tent and eat.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.629
So, the Ghost and the Darkness, you're part
of the reason that we see lions as these terrifying

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:38.000
human eaters. But in fact, you were just reacting
to the lion version of a man-made famine.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.729
Best wishes, John Green.

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.600
So we've talked about how both collectivist and
market economic policies can lead to famine, right?

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.300
But I think it's unfair to pin famine on one
ideology or another, like the disastrous consequences

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.960
of the ideologically motivated policies of
Mao and Stalin are self evident. Both were

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.909
totalitarian states, where collectivist policies
led millions to starve.

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:03.419
But, liberal free trade policy can also lead
to famine.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.220
The godfather of free market capitalism, Adam
Smith, asserted that, quote, "Famine has never

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.789
arisen from any other cause but the violence
of government attempting by improper means

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.590
to remedy the inconvenience of dearth."

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.009
Stan, how come we don't use the word "dearth"
more often? It was such a big dearth, gotta

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:24.699
a great sound. It's like all the best parts
of death and all the best parts of Darth Vader.

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.990
I'm sorry. We're not talking about the dearth
of dearth, we're talking about famine.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.039
So Smith blames famine on mother nature and
government's efforts to alleviate suffering.

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.370
But, the famines in colonial India show us
that a laissez faire approach to starvation

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.889
from the government can also lead to millions
of deaths.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:45.849
Victorian Britons often justified their policy
of doing nothing to help starving people by

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:51.639
referring to Thomas Malthus's concept that
population inevitably outstrips resources,

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:56.050
claiming that India's population, quote, "Has
a tendency to increase more rapidly than the

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:02.009
food it raises from the soil," thus providing
a natural justification for the suffering.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:06.490
But to reiterate, famine isn't natural! Or
at least it's not simply natural.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.020
So, when the British did try to provide relief
for famine victims, they feared that too much

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.259
help would lead Indian subjects to become
dependent on handouts.

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:20.349
So they set up work camps. Often hundreds
of miles away from the worst areas of famine,

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:26.500
where starving Indians could work to earn a ration
that worked out to 1627 calories per day.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.460
Now that, of course, isn't enough fuel to
do heavy labor, so the death rates in some

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.650
of these work camps reached as high as 94
percent.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.700
Meanwhile, the British clung their ideology
and their racism. Like here's a quote from

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.960
the Lieutenant Governor of the Bengal,
Sir Richard Temple.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.000
"The infatuation of these poor people in respect
to eating the bread of idleness; their dread

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.960
of marching on command to any distance from
home; their preference often for extreme privation

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.910
rather than the submission to even simple
and reasonable orders, can be fully believed

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.630
only by those who have seen or personally
known these things."

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.920
Basically, he's saying that people would rather
be lazy than well fed, which ignores the fact

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.130
that on 1627 calories per day, no one can
work.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.200
So, I promised to talk about happiness and peace
and rainbows and puppies here at the end.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.450
Famines don't just happen naturally. Now,
some famines may be the inevitable result

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.600
of of drought but certainly we don't have to have
as much starvation in the world as we do.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.830
In fact, with current agricultural technologies,
we don't have to have any starvation. And

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.100
here's where the really is some happiness
and peace and puppies and rainbows: 

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.540
there are fewer undernourished people today than
there ever have been at any point in centuries.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.730
More people have food security and fewer people
are starving.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.600
That also isn't the result of weather. And
yes, we will face tremendous droughts as the

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.570
climate changes. But, as we face them let
us remember that there is nothing natural

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.270
about some starving while others have plenty.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.600
In short, let's remember to look for the fingerprints
of humans where we would perhaps prefer to

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.250
see acts of God.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.110
