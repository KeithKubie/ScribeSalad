00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.210
As we all know, acting is a precarious, roller-coaster
type business.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.070
The Meryl Streeps, Jack Nicholsons, and Brad
Pitts are few and far between.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.619
Most actors or actress will hit at least an
occasional “dry spell,” if not a permanent

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.619
one.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.429
For a very select few, a seemingly easy solution
to help get them through the dry spell financially

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.029
might be to sell their Oscar statuette.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.050
I mean, it’s just otherwise collecting dust
on a shelf somewhere.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.000
Given only a little over 3,000 Oscars have
been awarded since 1929 and there are countless

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.910
collectors and movie fanatics out there, you’d
think an Oscar statuette would be worth a

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.200
small fortune… right?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.250
Alas, not so.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.870
At least, not legally.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.310
Every Academy Award nominee since the mid-twentieth
century is required to sign a “winner’s

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.440
agreement” contract in which they must agree
that neither they nor their heirs will ever

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.050
sell their Academy Award without first offering
to sell it back to the Motion Picture Academy

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.700
of Arts &amp; Sciences for $1.00.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.680
Yes, you read that correctly- one measly buck.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.990
This, despite the fact that the Oscar statuette
in materials alone is reportedly worth about

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.860
$900, mainly thanks to its relatively thick
gold plating.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.300
This forced contract is primarily the Academy’s
way of controlling the acquisition of its

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.300
trophies.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.070
They want to make sure no Oscar arrives in
the hands of private collectors- only those

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.080
who earned them or their heirs.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.951
As one Academy representative noted, “They’re
not tchotchkes to be bought off of a shelf.”

00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:46.630
So what happens if someone refuses to sign
the agreement?

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.799
The Academy will take back the statuette itself.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.640
It wasn’t always this way, however.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.390
Much to the chagrin of the Academy, those
given Oscars before the 1951 award ceremony

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.990
were under no such agreement and many of those
have been sold over the years.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.810
For instance, Orson Welles’ heirs were able
to sell his 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:16.180
2011 for $861,542 (about $930,064 today),
despite the Academy previously attempting

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.989
to bar them from doing so via a lawsuit.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.799
But, in the end, the courts ruled that as
Welles had signed no such agreement, his heirs

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.870
were free to sell the statuette.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.579
Other heirs who’ve tried similar sales on
the pre-1950s statuettes have had mixed results

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.590
in winning such court battles against the
Academy.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.910
Despite the Academy being extremely aggressive
combating any attempts to sell any Oscars,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.319
regardless of era, it is generally estimated
that at minimum 150 Academy Awards have been

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.889
sold since the first Oscar ceremony in 1929,
out of over 3,000 awarded.

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.139
Many of these are sold at least semi-secretly
so that neither the buyer nor the seller has

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.459
to deal with the Academy’s wrath.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.779
So of the known sales, how much do these awards
typically sell for at auction?

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:07.159
All amounts, ranging from a minimum typically
in the tens of thousands of dollars range

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.950
on up.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.000
For reference, the most expensive of the known
sales is the 1939 Academy Award for Best Picture

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.390
for Gone with the Wind.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.120
This was sold to Michael Jackson in 1999 for
an astounding $1.5 million (about $2.2 million

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
today).

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.529
Steven Spielberg also famously bought Clark
Gable’s Best Actor trophy for It Happened

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.920
One Night and Bette Davis’ Best Actress
trophy for Jezebel for a combined total of

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.609
about $1.2 million.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.889
However, this didn’t upset anyone at the
Academy because Spielberg promptly turned

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.529
around and donated them to said Academy.

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.819
A few other actors have also purchased Oscars
in similar ways and donated them back to the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.819
Academy.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.639
You might be wondering at this point what
the Academy does with such old statuettes

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.319
that it re-acquires in one way or another…

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.459
Well, mostly just locks them away in a vault,
rarely displaying them to the public.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.299
While this all may seem quite unfair, apart
from potential black-market sales of a statuettes,

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.169
some who win Oscars are well compensated in
other ways for the Academy bestowing the award

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.169
on them.

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.340
For instance, according to a study done at
Colgate University, Academy Award Signaling

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.920
and Gender Bias in Hollywood, male actors
on average receive an 81% increase in their

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.280
pay in their post-Oscar acting years vs. pre-award
years, at least some of which seems to be

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.229
because of their Academy Award and not just
because they’ve been around in the industry

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.229
longer.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.660
For women, however, as noted in the study,
“winning an Academy Award did not have a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.729
statistically significant effect on women’s
salaries in the sample.”

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.580
Why this is the case isn’t clear, with a
variety of speculative reasons suggested in

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.580
the study.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.890
For instance, they noted that younger women
in Hollywood tend to get a majority of the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.270
available high paying leading female roles
vs. their more seasoned counterparts.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.490
This, combined with the fact that the average
age of an actress winning an Oscar is 36.77

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.041
years old, around the time most actresses
see their earnings decline sharply, it may

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:59.639
be the case that these award winners simply
have fewer prime roles to pick from at this

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.639
stage in their careers, so have less ability
to negotiate higher salaries post-Oscar win.

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.419
They are also often forced to round out their
careers taking minor roles that pay much less,

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.139
which may be potentially masking any statistically
significant benefit an Oscar might be giving

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.919
them in pay increase given the limited sample
size of award winners we have to work with

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:19.919
on the data sets.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.990
On the flip side, the researchers noted that
the average age of a male actor winning an

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.340
Oscar is 44.67 years old.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.650
Unlike with actresses, leading roles for older
male actors are drastically more prevalent,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.330
allowing them greater flexibility in the roles
they choose and greater leverage in salary

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.439
negotiations.

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.650
The researchers also noted that, whether a
male actor wins an Oscar or not, their salaries

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.759
on average begin to markedly increase past
42 years old, just more so if they also have

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.759
the Oscar.

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.390
On the other hand, as noted, actresses tend
to earn the most early in their careers with

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.699
salaries beginning to drop off significantly
as they approach the age male actors’ salaries

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:54.970
begin their rapid rise.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.990
Unfortunately, I could find no similar study
done comparing non-actor Oscar wins to see

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:56.269
what, if any, future earnings benefit the
Academy Award provides them.
