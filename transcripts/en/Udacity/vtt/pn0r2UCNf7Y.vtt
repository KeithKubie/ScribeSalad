00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.975
We have previously talked about the danger of using inheritance to

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.939
implement generalization.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.300
If objects are used for components and if inheritance is used inappropriately,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.530
then subclass objects may violate component contracts.
