00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.000
After a year of studying the laws of the universe
together, a year of studying and calculating,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.560
learning about motion and fluids, thermodynamics,
electricity and magnetism, light and sound,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.400
We find ourselves here:

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.130
Space, the final frontier.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.560
We’re all voyagers on a mission to understand
the universe, using the power of physics.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.420
And even though we’ve been doing it for
centuries, there’s so much we have to learn
about the cosmos!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.600
Some of the most exciting research in physics today
is being done by astrophysicists and cosmologists.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.620
Astrophysicists study the physics of celestial
bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.660
Their research takes us inside phenomena like
black holes and supernovae.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.200
But we can use physics to try to answer even
bigger questions about the universe.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.080
Cosmologists study the universe overall and
ask questions about the origin of everything,
as well as its future.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.440
It’s their job, and yours, to continue looking
into the night sky, searching for answers using the
tools and knowledge that physics can provide.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:09.360
[Theme Music]

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.880
Before we can talk about something as big
as the universe, we need to be able to describe
just how big it is.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.840
When talking about things on Earth, we typically
use measurements in the range of nanometers
to kilometers.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.200
But when we’re in space, we need something
a whole lot bigger.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
For instance, I could say that the nearest
star to earth, besides the sun, is 4x10^13
kilometers from us.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.060
But that’s a mouthful for something that’s
basically right next door, in cosmic terms.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.960
So it’s easier to say that this star, Proxima
Centauri, is 4.2 light-years from Earth.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.140
A light-year is a unit of length, with one
light-year equaling the distance that light would
travel in a vacuum in one year.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.440
If you take the speed of light, about 300
million meters per second, and multiply it
by how many seconds are in a year,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.720
you find that one light-year is approximately
10^16 meters, or 10 million, billion meters.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.020
To give you a sense of scale, it takes light just
over 8 minutes to travel from the sun to the Earth,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.140
and the Milky Way is roughly a hundred
thousand light-years in diameter.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.060
Sometimes we also use a unit called a parsec,
which is equal to 3.26 light years.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.040
Now, when we say that Proxima Centauri is
4.2 light-years away,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.680
this also means that when we look at the
star through a telescope, we’re seeing what
Proxima Centauri looked like 4.2 years ago.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.440
It takes light that long to get here from Proxima
Centauri, so we’ll never know what that star –

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.460
or any star or other distant
object – looks like at this exact moment.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.260
This means that, as we observe celestial
objects far away, we’re looking into the past,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.460
seeing what stars and galaxies looked like millions,
if not billions, of years ago.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.300
While we’re observing these stars, we can use a
spectrometer, the device that separates wavelengths,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.280
to reveal the star’s absorption
spectrum and its elemental composition.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.940
But when we study very distant bodies, we find that their absorption spectrum is slightly different from what we’d expect, given our knowledge of typical star compositions.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.640
Remember the Doppler effect?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.400
How the pitch of an ambulance siren becomes higher
as it approaches you and lower as it moves away?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.140
The same effect happens with light!

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.140
If an object is moving away from you, the
speed of light doesn’t change, but the peaks

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.890
of the electromagnetic wave that it emits
move farther apart.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.620
This effect – which occurs with light emitted
by an object moving away from Earth – is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.440
called redshift, because the longer the
wavelengths get, the closer they are to the
red part of the visible spectrum.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.840
Once astronomers recognized and could
measure redshift, they found that the spectra from
nearly every distant galaxy was redshifted,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.880
meaning that every galaxy
was moving away from us.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.760
And if that wasn’t strange enough, astronomers such
as Edwin Hubble noted that the amount of redshift is
proportional to the distance from Earth.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.080
So the farthest galaxies are moving away even
faster than the close ones!

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.160
Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist,
proposed this relationship as Hubble’s Law.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.420
It expresses the velocity at which a galaxy
is speeding away from Earth, in terms of its
distance from us.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.460
The equation uses a proportionality
constant called the Hubble parameter,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.060
which says that for every million light-years of
distance from us, a galaxy is moving away at an
additional 21 kilometers per second.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.500
Now, the fact is that nearby galaxies might
be going away from us or toward us, based on
how they’re moving within their local cluster.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.680
But the overall tendency for distant galaxies
to recede from us is much more common, so
Hubble’s Law holds true in most cases.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.520
And this trend of distant galaxies moving
away from us, and from one another, is called
cosmological redshift.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520
By the way, this expansion looks the same
whether you’re on Earth or not.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.020
No matter where you are, all distant galaxies
appear to be moving away from you.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.640
So this leads physicists to believe that at
some point in time, all the stars and galaxies
were closer to one another – a lot closer.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.580
In the 1940s and 50s, Russian-American
physicist George Gamow, developed a theory of the
early universe that explained,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.020
among other things, why so many light elements,
like hydrogen and helium, were observed throughout
the cosmos.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.880
He suggested that the universe began in a
state of highly compressed hot plasma – a sort
of hot soup of elementary particles.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.380
His theory became known, somewhat dismissively
by his colleagues, as the Big Bang Theory.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.740
And this same theory ultimately predicted that
there should be radiation left over from the initial,
rapid expansion of that compressed plasma.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.620
This is because hot plasma, like the plasma
in the flame of a candle, is not transparent.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.620
But ordinary gas – like the air around a
candle’s flame – is transparent, and it lets
light travel freely through it.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.600
So it would make sense that the early, hot
universe was originally opaque, until it cooled
down to the point where it became transparent.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.060
Once that happened, the thinking goes, light
from the Big Bang was able to travel freely.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.160
But its wavelength kept stretching out, redshifting
until it could only be detected as microwave radiation.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.980
Gamow's theory didn’t gain much acceptance,
and it was largely forgotten.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:53.640
Until, in 1964, American astronomers Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson pointed a radio antenna into space,
and they discovered cosmic microwave background
radiation.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.180
They basically discovered the radiation from
the Big Bang, by accident.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.880
They found that a low-energy microwave radiation
persisted at all times, day and night,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.880
and they concluded that the source of the
radiation was the universe itself.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.440
This cosmic background radiation provides
support for the Big Bang Theory,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.300
and it tells us a lot about the conditions of
the early universe.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.580
Thanks to these insights, along with the observed
expansion of the universe and other evidence,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.340
we have learned that the universe began in
a hot dense state, then cooled, and produced
galaxies and clusters that we see today.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.240
However, many mysteries remain.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.060
For instance, if the universe started with
such high density and temperature, wouldn’t
gravity make its expansion slow down?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.260
The fact is, the rate of expansion would
slow down only if the universe was filled with
nothing but matter and radiation.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.840
But that’s not the case!

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.780
Space is filled with a constant – or at least, slowly
varying – form of energy known as dark energy.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:52.560
And because of the pervasive presence of this
energy, according to general relativity, gravity is
actually causing space to expand, and accelerate!

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.460
This isn’t just theoretical.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:00.800
Recent evidence suggests that the universe
actually IS accelerating in its expansion,
showing no signs of slowing down.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.620
But beyond the fact that it exists, there’s
not much that we know about dark energy.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.360
Another one of the universe’s great mysteries
is the existence of mass that we can’t see,
but we know that it, too, exists.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.820
When we study a galaxy’s rotation, we can
estimate how much mass is in it by measuring
its radius and rotational velocity.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.520
But when we actually calculate that mass,
the result is far greater than what’s observable
as stars and gas.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.500
The conclusion is that there’s an immense
amount of mass in the universe known as dark
matter, which doesn’t reflect or emit any light.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.400
By current estimates, dark matter makes up
almost 85 percent of all the matter in the universe.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.360
This means that all visible matter, including
stars and planets, make up just a small percentage
of all energy in the universe,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.860
while the rest is mysterious dark energy
and dark matter.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.960
Research in these fields is ongoing and
new evidence is found every year, refining our
understanding of the universe.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.320
In the past year here on Crash Course, and
for thousands of years, we have used physics to
answer some of life’s most important questions.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.820
Whether it’s a ball flying through the air
or the origin of the universe,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.700
we can use our knowledge from Newton’s Laws
to special relativity in order to move closer to
the truth.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.920
And there’s still so much to discover, both
in the stars and here on earth.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.480
Some of the most groundbreaking research is
happening on the smallest scales,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.780
as physicists seek to understand the building blocks
of our universe and the nature of matter itself.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:26.680
It’s not an easy task, and it’s why we
need scientists and enthusiastic supporters
such as yourself to go out,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.420
be curious, ask questions, and to find
answers through scientific methods.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.960
Today we learned about light-years and how
looking in the distance is also looking into the past.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.880
We discussed redshift and used Hubble’s
Law to calculate how much certain parts of
the universe are expanding away from us.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:50.360
Finally, we introduced the Big Bang, cosmic
background radiation, and the mysteries of
dark energy and dark matter. Bye!
