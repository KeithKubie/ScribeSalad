00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.820
[Marcus du Sautoy] I've been quite obsessed with Gödel's incompleteness theorem for many years because it kind of places this extraordinary

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.000
limitation on what we might be able to know in mathematics. In fact, it's quite an unnerving theorem

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.340
because at its heart it says there might be

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.549
conjectures out there about numbers, for example something like Goldbach's conjecture, that might actually be true

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.269
So it might be true that every even number is the sum of two primes

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960
but maybe within the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.820
axiomatic system we have for mathematics, there isn't a proof of that.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.780
The real worry is what if there's a true statement that I'm working away on which actually doesn't

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.700
have a proof.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.759
Now his is a big kind of revelation for mathematics because I think ever since the ancient Greeks

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.439
we believed that any true statement about mathematics will have a proof. It might be quite difficult to find like

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.460
Fermat's last Theorem took 350 years to, before my colleague in Oxford Andrew Wiles found the proof.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.580
But I think we all have this kind of feeling like well surely every true statement has a proof

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.420
but Gödel shows that actually there's a gap between

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.000
truth and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
proof.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440
I wrote it down here because it's quite cute

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.550
So it's one of these cards: "the statement on the other side of this card is false".

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.740
So let's suppose that's true. So it means that the statement on the other side of the card is false

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.990
So we turn it over and then it says: "the statement on the other side of this card is true".

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.059
Well, that's meant to be false. So it means the one on the other side is also false

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.480
Oh, but we suppose that that was true, so that's false

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.480
So the other side is true, which means that --and you get into this kind of infinite loop.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.820
Verbal paradoxes are fine because you don't expect every

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.600
verbal sentence to have a truth value to it.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.540
But then, when I went up to university, I realized that [in] mathematics you can't have those; yet when I took this course

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.280
on mathematical logic, and we learned about Gödel's incompleteness theorem, he used this kind of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.540
self-referential statement to really undermine our

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.800
Belief that all true statements could be proved.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.440
There was a feeling like we should be able to prove that mathematics is something called consistent.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.860
That mathematics won't give rise to contradictions.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.120
This have been kind of inspired by certain kind of little paradoxes that

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.820
people like Bertrand Russell had come up with.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.780
People might have come across this idea of "the set of all sets that don't contain themselves as members"

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.060
and then you-- the challenges well is that set in this set or not?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.589
Actually, a really nice kind of version of this is another sort of mathematical

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.729
Kind of verbal Paradox is all those numbers that can be defined in less than 20 words so for example

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.810
[1729] which is the taxicab number that Ramanujan and hardy talked about you can define that in less than 20 words?

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.449
It's the smallest number which is the sum of two cubes in two different ways so that less than 20 words

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.539
So then you define the following number then the smallest number which cannot be defined in less than 20 words

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.640
Now I think if you count add up, I've just defined that number in less than 20 words, and you go well

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.799
That's a bit worrying because surely that is a sort of kind of number

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.828
We might define the smallest number which has a certain property.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.769
So there was a real feeling that these paradoxes these set theoretic paradoxes were beginning to be a real challenge

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.160
To mathematics at the turn of the 20th century and David Hilbert one of his

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.620
big problems that he challenged mathematics with in the 20th -- 20th century

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.009
[his] 23 big on unsolved problems the second one was [to] prove that mathematics was in fact consistent and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.959
included in that was that every true statement should be provable, but what a shock

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.369
he got actually 30 years later along comes this Austrian logician Kurt Gödel who blows this idea that we can prove math is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.789
consistent out of the water and shows there are true statements which can't be proved within any mathematical system.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.670
How does mathematics work? We set down things we called axioms which are the kind of things we believe are [the] way

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.250
numbers, geometry works, so for example if I take six and I add seven to that

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.160
I don't think it's going to be different from taking seven and adding six to that. That seems so blindingly obvious

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.329
and that's one of the axioms [of] the way numbers work. So maybe somewhere out there that [goes] wrong, but I don't really care

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.350
I'm interested in a mathematics where that is true of all numbers.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.669
And I have rules which allow me to make deductions from those axioms

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.899
And that's how mathematics works. Each time we make these logical deductions

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.799
we expand the conclusions from these axioms. We can add new axioms if we feel like you know what we haven't actually

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.360
captured the whole of mathematics

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.650
and that was somehow the -- the mission was we want to have a set of axioms which are strong enough and that we

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.709
believe are basic about numbers from which

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.800
we can deduce all through statements that we will have a proof and so there was a feeling like well, yeah.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.869
Well, maybe we haven't got all of the axioms and if we got a true statement which can't be proved

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.269
We could add that as a new axiom and it will expand what we can prove within mathematics

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.960
So this is very important for Gödel because we are trying to prove that there will be a set of axioms from which we can

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.389
deduce all truths of mathematics.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.999
Gödel did something

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.020
very clever because he cooked up a way of allowing mathematics to talk about itself.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.160
So what he produced was the thing we now called the Gödel Coding.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.200
So he showed that any statement about numbers

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.400
has its own particular code number. In fact you use prime numbers in order to make this coding. So every statement about

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:59.458
mathematics could be turned into a number so for example the axioms of mathematics from which we are trying to make all of our

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.189
deductions they would have code numbers and

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:09.298
true statements about mathematics, so for example Fermat's last theorem for example will have a code number, also

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.479
false statements like "17 is an even number"

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.460
will have a code number.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.560
OK so what do these code numbers look like? They're obviously whoppers.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.759
They're absolutely huge

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.398
but it's a unique coding so

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:31.319
every code number can be worked backwards into a statement -- not every number will have a meaningful mathematical statement

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.160
but it's more interesting the other way: every mathematical statement will have a unique number associated with it

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.720
A bit like how most things in a computer [have] zeroes and ones. Very good. So if I'm typing away

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.620
and I write the name 'Gödel' that be changed into ASCII code. It will have a number

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.540
associated with it. So Gödel cooked this up

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.459
but why is that useful? Because you can now actually talk about proof in mathematics using these numbers

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.469
So you can start to talk about mathematics using mathematics. So for example

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:05.338
you might want to know well, is this particular statement

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.859
provable from the axioms?

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.669
That -- I'm going to completely simplify this but it'll give you a

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:16.469
feel for it. Essentially it's a bit like saying any statement

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:21.238
whose code number is divisible by the code number of the axioms

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.159
will be provable from the axioms. That's an incredible simplification

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.758
but it's good because it means now we can talk about proof within --

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:37.078
mathematically to say that something is provable is to say for example that it's code number

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.179
must be divisible by the axioms

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:44.449
So now Gödel challenges you with the following

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.239
statement: "This statement

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:53.599
cannot be proved from the axioms that we have for our system of mathematics"

00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:57.169
So this is actually something that has a code number

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.460
We can talk about proof

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:07.100
using numbers so this will be a statement that can be changed into a mathematical equation. Now this means because it's an equation in

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.738
mathematics, it's either true or it's false

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:18.049
So let's start by saying that the statement is false. That means that "This statement is

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:23.748
provable from the axioms" is true, but a provable statement must be true

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:29.988
So now we've started with something which we assumed was false and now we've deduced that it's true

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:35.808
so we've got a contradiction and we're assuming that mathematics is consistent so we can't have contradictions

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:39.200
-- this is important -- so that means it can't be false

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.780
This means it must be true because a mathematical statement is either true or false. It's not like these

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.120
linguistic paradoxes which just don't have a truth value. It is an equation of mathematics

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.660
It's either true or it's false

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.640
We've just shown if it's false, that that leads to a contradiction. This means that

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.320
this statement must be true

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.360
Ah, great. We've got a true statement

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:03.269
but let's now

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:04.370
reinterpret what it says

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:10.399
It says "This statement cannot be proved from the axioms." We have now got a true statement

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.320
which cannot be proved true from the axioms of mathematics

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.360
And that's exactly what Gödel wanted. He's now got a statement of mathematics

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.370
which is true but cannot be proved. And you go hold on, how do we actually

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:27.829
prove that was true? We just proved

00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:34.789
it's true. And it's very important to articulate what we have done is within a system of mathematics with certain axioms

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:40.938
we found a true statement within there which can't be proved true within that system

00:09:41.459 --> 00:09:47.628
We've proved it's true by working outside the system and looking in because we can now add that as an axiom

00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:51.100
It's a true statement, so it won't make something which is consistent

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.020
inconsistent. So we could add that as an axiom and you say well now we've got a proof because it's just an axiom

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:58.709
It's one of these kind of infinite

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:03.948
regresses. Gödel says that's not going to help you because I can still cook up within this new system

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:06.889
another statement which is true

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:07.980
but unprovable

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:14.569
So it's a sort of infinite regress thing that says that no matter how much you expand mathematics, adding axioms,

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:21.319
they will always be missing something, a little bit like if you remember the proof that there are infinitely many primes

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.180
You say suppose there are finitely many primes, then you prove that there's some primes missing from that list and you say well

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.980
I'll add those and Euclid just keeps playing the same trick

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.260
Well that's still not good enough because there are still some things missing

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.640
Gödel has a similar kind of feel to it that

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.329
you might try and expand your mathematics to add that as an axiom

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.599
but that won't help because he can keep on playing the same game

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.980
It feels like though this problem is just restricted to this

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.220
little self-referential corner, like it doesn't feel like this puts Goldbach out of reach

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.220
and other things out of reach

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.940
It's just this one little game you can play with referencing to itself

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.860
This was mathematicians hope that, okay, there's some weird

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.640
logical Gajillion sentences which who really cares about because they don't really have much mathematical content

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.640
And I think people just hoped that things like Goldbach would

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.120
not be one of these, but that hope was really blown away

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.020
in 1977

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:27.229
mathematicians came up with some statements about numbers that you think of a kind of like Goldbach nature that you think well

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.569
yeah, that's something I'd want to be able to prove is true. And they showed that these were sentences which

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:35.009
were

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:39.438
were true, but not provable within quite a standard system for mathematics

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:43.519
So we've now discovered that we can't hope that it's just weird

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.809
self-referential

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:50.260
Gazillion sentences that are going to be knocked out.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.069
It could be Goldbach. It could be Goldbach

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:57.678
Twin primes might also be something like that. Gödel even talks about the Riemann hypothesis

00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:00.709
We might be having trouble proving it, but just because we haven't

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.350
expanded the axioms of mathematics

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.240
to such a level that it is provable

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:13.500
Now there are some sentences like Riemann which are intriguing because if Riemann turns out to be a

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.319
mathematical statement which doesn't have a proof, if we could prove that, that it doesn't have a proof

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.690
weirdly this would prove that the Riemann hypothesis must be true

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.849
Now you go ahh why? Because if the Riemann hypothesis is false

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.149
this means that there's a zero off the line

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.130
this means there's actually a constructive way to find that. You can set computer off and

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.830
eventually after a finite process if it's false it will find the reason why it's false

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.009
So if it's false it must be provably false

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.520
So if we find that Riemann is actually undecidable, cannot be proved from the axioms of mathematics,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.469
there's no way it can be false because that will be provable, so it must be true

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.859
So this is a really weird way that you might prove Riemann

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.719
Hypothesis is to prove that is actually an undecidable statement within the axioms of mathematics

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.259
If you're watching this video thinking you've got even more questions about Gödel incompleteness

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:20.339
Don't worry so did I and there's a whole lot of extra interview footage. Click the links on the screen or in the video description
