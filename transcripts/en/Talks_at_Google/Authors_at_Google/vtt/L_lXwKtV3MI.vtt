[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.690
ABBY: I'm thrilled
to be here today

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.550
with Kelly Hoey, the author
of "Build Your Dream Network."

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.050
Kelly is a connector
and has been

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.750
on the "Forbes" one of five
women changing the world in VC

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.110
and entrepreneurship.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.750
She's appeared on
CNBC's "Power Pitch,"

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.610
keeps a column on inc.com, and
tweets frequently at @jkhoey.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.040
In addition to her portfolio
of angel investments,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.130
she's an LP in two
funds and an adviser

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.740
to the New Zealand Trade
and Enterprise Commission.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.930
On top of these
professional pursuits,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.990
Kelly is a chief tech
ambassador for the YWCA

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.244
up at NYC [INAUDIBLE]
Girls' Club.

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:44.660
Please join me in
welcoming Kelly.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.487
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:51.070
We're really excited
to have you here.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.903
KELLY HOEY: I'm excited
to be here with you.

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:53.470
ABBY: Great.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.020
So the word
networking sends a lot

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.230
of chills down people's
spines, including my own.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.850
And I might even
dare to say there's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.460
other people in the room that
would prefer to treat the word

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.480
networking like an
elephant in the room,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.140
and maybe keep it
in closed corners.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.730
But without
networking, your career

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.200
would have never gotten
to where you are today.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.950
And you talk about
this a bit in the book.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.560
But would you mind
sharing with us

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.980
how this idea of networking and
how it's creatively developed

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.670
brought you from 2002
to where you are today?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.130
KELLY HOEY: Yeah, so my
background is I'm an attorney.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.477
I practiced law in Canada
and in New York City,

00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:31.060
made a career change,
decided I wanted

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.330
to make a career change
in 2002 and realized

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.197
I didn't have the
network to do it,

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:37.780
even though I was
looking for a career

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.920
within the same industry.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.820
And everything since then has
come about because of networks,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.930
and relationships, and purposely
building strong connections.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.090
So as Abby mentioned,
the word networking

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.350
put chills in their spine.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.630
It puts a chill in my spine.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.050
I confess in the book--

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.190
I am a reluctant networker.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.210
I was also very reluctant
at public speaking,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.789
so the universe does really have
a way of coming back at you.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.350
When you think of networking
as working a room,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.380
if you all think about--

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.046
say the word networking,
you're probably

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:17.680
imagining a cocktail party.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.440
There's a name tag that
you have to pin somewhere.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.450
You're probably balancing
some sort of a drink,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.490
trying to talk to someone.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.600
Someone introduces you.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.030
You're pulling off some
satay off a little stick--

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.014
the horrors, right?

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.180
Like having to talk about
the weather or something--

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.200
you're just like, ugh.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.910
That is not networking to me.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.940
That's a networking tactic.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.780
But networking, to me, when
you think of it as an activity

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.440
is every single
human interaction.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.860
So when you think about
your own lives, for me,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.340
networking was your
decision to be here today.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.570
Your networking is your
email signature line.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.230
It's the headshot you all
have on fabulous name tags

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.260
or on social media.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.650
It is-- I don't know,
maybe, did someone

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.430
leave a voicemail message
for someone else today?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.680
Did you hand out
a business card?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.600
Did you, I don't know,
leave an out-of-office

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.970
responder that says you
weren't going to be around?

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.330
To me, every time we
interact with someone else,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.730
that is networking.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.180
And those micro-actions,
in my mind,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.280
are what are more
effective in moving

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.150
our careers, and our ambitions,
and our relationships

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.090
forward than relying on
balancing a cocktail plate,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.670
and handing out a
business card, and having

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.910
something smart to say
at a cocktail party.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.530
So if networking
is an activity, I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.820
want you to think about it
as every human interaction,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.750
and how can you do those better?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.400
Networking is a mindset.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.700
I want you to
think about it as--

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.180
this is really hard
for a lot of people--

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.259
how can you be a
decent human being,

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.800
because I think
that's all we're ever

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.260
looking for is, how can we
have someone who listens to us

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.660
and is considerate?

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.454
And then networking is--

00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:11.620
well, where do you start
when someone says something

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.380
foolish to you like, do more
networking, because we've all

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.608
heard that one.

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:16.149
That's great.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.829
How do I start doing that--

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.390
is where are you headed?

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.460
Where are you going?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.140
What are you trying
to achieve right now

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.790
with the help of other people?

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.060
And then who are the
people who can help you?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.950
Are they people already
in your network?

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.870
Are they groups or
organizations that you may

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.370
be thinking you need to join?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.990
Now, how can you communicate
with them better?

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.530
Because part of networking
is our preference

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.290
on how we communicate
and engage.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.290
And the other is the person
you want to interact with.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.700
So I mentioned that
I said voicemail as--

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.060
I think it's an
act of networking.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.980
My voicemail message,
if anyone calls me,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.600
says, please don't leave
me a voicemail message.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.770
I don't listen to them.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.270
The number of people who still
leave me voicemail messages

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.760
is comical.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.650
And I can tell you what I do
with every single one of them--

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.720
Delete.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.250
I've stated my preference.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.190
Text me, or email
me, or tweet me.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.930
Do not leave me a voicemail--

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.100
I don't listen to these.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.183
ABBY: There you are with
the Twitter handle again.

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:15.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.600
So this is a pretty
significant re-brand

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.520
to the idea of
networking, and especially

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.330
what we hear in business
communities, or in an MBA

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.900
session, or anything like that.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.694
KELLY HOEY: Well, I want
to say we get so enamored--

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:30.110
I want to say I
think we've become

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.230
so enamored with technology
and ways things can do things

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.820
faster.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.350
We don't have to pull
out a paper map anymore.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.420
Thankfully, Google can
get us our directions.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.230
We can click, and
swipe, and tap.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.830
But we need to remember-- behind
all of this is human beings.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.510
And we have messy,
complicated, unusual lives.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.270
And on any given day, we can
be in a good mood or a bad mood

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.120
or have some trigger
that sets us off.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.650
And your reaction
to something might

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.330
be different than my
reaction to something.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.260
And so I think if nothing
else from this book, if people

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.060
put people back in the
center of your networking

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.180
and think, how can I
be someone other people

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.070
want to network
with, how can I be

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.610
the person I want
to network with,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.590
and just add that
little consideration

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.270
into your daily activities.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.504
I think it will make all
the world of difference.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:30.920
ABBY: So digging into that a
little bit, one of the themes

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.430
that Kelly talks about in her
book is the "Give, Give, Get"

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.330
theory.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.580
And while it might seem a
little bit self-explanatory,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.121
we'd love to hear
your thoughts on it

00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:40.580
and how you came
to it, when we're

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.849
thinking about putting
people back in networking,

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:44.390
people back in
relationship building.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.440
KELLY HOEY: Well, it's great
to be talking about it here

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.090
at Google and in the heart of
Silicon Valley, where there has

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.200
often been, and it has been
built on this "Give, Give, Get"

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.040
mentality.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.410
But that is sort of one of
those old rules of networking.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.280
I think there's an element
of resurrecting Miss Manners

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.400
or Craig Claiborne and wrapping
them around our networking

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.040
activities again.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:18.266
And the idea is, have you been
a good person in the community

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:19.920
within which you are operating?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.800
Have you been that
colleague who has

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.570
been helpful to other people?

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.700
Kathryn Finney, who is--

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.320
the book is very
case-study driven.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.370
Kathryn Finney, one of
the interviewees-- and she

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.940
has the BIG accelerator
out of Atlanta.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.320
And she says if you can't
call upon a network,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.200
you probably have a low
return on generosity.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.680
And then you need to look at
what your own interactions are.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.050
I think that idea of the
"Give, Give, Get," though,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.150
is hard for some people,
because there's often

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.220
a networking imbalance.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.830
You're looking to
network with someone

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.370
who is higher up a corporate
ladder or someone who

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.587
apparently has more resources,
connections than you do.

00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:06.170
And that's where I come back to
what I said before about being

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.840
a decent human being.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.660
Are you considerate of
somebody else's time when

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.970
you're asking them for advice?

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.830
Do you follow up
and let them know

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.470
what you did with that advice?

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.110
Have you done enough
research so that if you're

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.330
taking someone's time to
ask them the question,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.700
you're asking them
the right question?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.560
If they've already
written it on a blog,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.590
if they've shared it
on a YouTube video,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.649
if they have posted
it endlessly,

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.190
why would you ask
a question that you

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.520
could find out the answer
to in a Google search?

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.720
You could do that work,
read it all, take it all in,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.580
and then ask them
a better question.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.830
In my mind, that is
networking generosity.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.730
And that is an essential "give,"
I think, in this day and age,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:56.480
before you ask for time, because
we have two resources in life,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.590
really--

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.720
time and reputation.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.079
One, you can maybe earn
back-- your reputation.

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:03.620
You can never get
back your own time,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.990
and you can never give
back anybody else's time.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.470
So really, that essential
"give" in networking,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.470
for me, is doing your homework
before you make that ask.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.650
ABBY: To maximize
that time and maximize

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.950
the giving of the other person,
instead of wasting their time.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.290
KELLY HOEY: Right, and
realize that that level

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.895
of consideration is enough of
a "give," because like I said,

00:09:26.895 --> 00:09:28.020
people are like, oh my god.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.182
If I ask someone
for an introduction,

00:09:30.182 --> 00:09:31.390
what am I going to give them?

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.300
You don't need to give
them an equal introduction.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.890
You may never have
that opportunity,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.480
and they may never want it.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.570
But you can give
them consideration.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.220
You can give them that kindness.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.200
You can give them
that thoughtfulness.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.740
And that-- it sounds like
a really low base level,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.610
but the number of people
who sort of, like,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.312
this is all we need--

00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:54.270
one of the other people
interviewed in the book

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.060
is Alison Levine.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.230
Alison is-- and how many friends
do you get to say in life

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.420
are an adventurer?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.060
She's a bestselling author,
but she's also an adventurer.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.650
She has led the first all-US
women's team up Everest,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.570
amongst other accomplishments
and mountains,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.700
literally, that she has climbed.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.270
And when I asked her about
networking generosity

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.460
and what was the "give"--
because, of course,

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.730
she's accomplished so much,
people ask her for so much.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.110
And she just said,
you know what?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.250
Just be considerate.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.250
Be considerate about the
time that you're asking for.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.534
Be considerate about
what you're asking for.

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:33.075
Don't ask me if I've
climbed Everest.

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:35.370
A Google search
will reveal that.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.900
And she was so
adamant on this, I

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.760
had to call her and
say, Ali, I need

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.980
to edit your
answers for my book,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.840
because if I kept
her original answers,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.180
the book would come in
a brown paper wrapper

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.350
with a parental warning on it--

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.400
a lot of all caps, a lot
of imaginative words.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.100
And it sounds crazy, but just
that little consideration

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.490
makes all the difference.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.360
ABBY: So Alison was actually
at Google last week.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.530
And now you're making me--

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.520
I'm going to watch
her talk, when

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.210
it was recorded, because
she sounds fantastic, yeah.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.910
KELLY HOEY:
[INAUDIBLE] seriously,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.743
if you missed her in
person, watch her talk.

00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:10.357
Alison Levine is extraordinary.

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:11.870
ABBY: OK, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.290
Fantastic.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.560
So on that idea of
frequent networking

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.621
asks that we might
get or questions

00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:21.120
that might come in
often, especially

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.120
for someone like you who
identifies as a connector, one

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.250
of the ideas I wanted
to run through by Kelly

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.150
was to self-assess and look at
some of the networking emails

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.205
I've sent or I've received
with leading questions.

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:34.830
And I want to read
these out, because I

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.340
think these are often networking
crutches that we land on.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.800
I want to pick your
brain about something.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.740
KELLY HOEY: Talk to the
hand on that one, seriously.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.714
Don't send that email.

00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:47.880
ABBY: And we'll break some
of these down afterwards.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.056
But if you think of
anyone for this--

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:53.580
KELLY HOEY: Uh-uh, nope.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.010
ABBY: Do you have any
opportunities in mind

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.524
for me to grow?

00:11:58.524 --> 00:11:59.940
You mean you don't
know everything

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.211
about my personal and
professional development?

00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:04.420
KELLY HOEY: No, no.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.920
ABBY: Do you know anyone that
might want to cover this story

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.592
or give me some publicity?

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:12.300
KELLY HOEY: The number
of that last one--

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.270
the number of times I get that
from emerging tech companies

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.000
who've hired PR firms, and
that's what they email me--

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.560
oh, for the love of god.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.930
ABBY: So as someone
who's relatively

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.310
young in their career, and when
I'm thinking about networking

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.814
vertically, and I'm talking
to folks that I know

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:30.480
I want to make most
value of their time,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.896
but I also don't
want to overstep.

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:35.460
I don't want to come
off as asking too much.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.920
So sometimes it can feel
more comfortable to go back

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.850
to these general statements.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.710
KELLY HOEY: But those
questions are asking too much.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.530
ABBY: Why is that?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.030
KELLY HOEY: Think
about an email you

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.409
get from a friend that
says, I'm looking for a job.

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:49.950
How does that feel
when you get that?

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.267
You're like, I don't
know where to start.

00:12:52.267 --> 00:12:53.850
So what do you have
to start by doing?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.500
You have to start by
asking a lot of questions

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.458
and racking your brain.

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:59.370
Well, do you want
a job at Google,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.980
or were you looking
for a job at Wal-Mart?

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.820
I don't know.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.910
What are you looking for?

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:09.970
And when you ask big,
general questions,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.490
you're making your network
do the work for you,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.750
rather than giving
them that target.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.090
Think about it like darts.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.970
You've got a target
that you're going for.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.670
Tell them what your bullseye
is, because then we have

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.460
a radius of ways to help you.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.210
So if you said, hey, I'm
looking for a job at X,

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.960
and you're like, I
don't know anyone at X,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.030
but I know someone at Y--

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.717
I don't know anyone at NBC,
but I know someone at ABC.

00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:37.050
Would you want to talk to them--

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.460
we have something to aim at.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.220
But if you said, I'm just
looking for a new job,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.990
I don't know what to shoot for.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.580
And now you've put
the work on me,

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.950
and that is too heavy of an ask.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.940
I think our networks have been
extraordinarily strained, when

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.590
I think of it from, probably,
about 2009, when you think

00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.030
the economic collapse, and
Lehman Brothers, all of that

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.160
stuff going on, and people
strained and looking

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.000
for opportunities.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.740
I think our networks
are strained

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.830
because our nature
of work has changed.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.620
So many of us do freelance.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.640
Or we're looking to get
opportunities and experiences

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.320
within one company, and then
we're moving to another.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.740
So we're constantly
moving in and out

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.900
of opportunities and networks.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.230
So you're better off, and
you're helping your network,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.820
you're helping
yourself, and you're

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.300
helping you get a better
answer if you're specific.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.540
And people are afraid
of going specific.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.460
And maybe they're afraid
of doing the work.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.959
But a lot of people say to me,
but if I do all that research

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:40.360
and ask the question, I
have to do a lot of work.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.901
And I'm like, yeah,
that's the point.

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:44.280
That's why it's "net-work,"
so that "work" word in it.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.796
But it's also-- if you
get off on just sending

00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:50.670
50 emails saying, hey,
I'm looking for a job,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.980
can you help me, that's time.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.260
Sitting around waiting
for an answer is time.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.230
Why not do the research?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.630
Find a smaller group of
people within your network

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.450
who can provide you
with the right answer

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.670
or closer to the right answer.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.020
Spend your networking time on
that front end, doing that--

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.270
ask a better question.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.280
You don't need 50 people
emailing you back.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.930
You need one or two
to email you back

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.580
with the right opportunity.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.650
ABBY: I think-- so
yes to all of that,

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.210
and to give a plug to your book
"Build Your Dream Network," one

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.960
of the things that I
loved about this book

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.580
is that you talked about how to
figure out what you're asking

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.590
in the networking, anyways.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.880
You should have a goal in mind.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.630
KELLY HOEY: Right.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.290
ABBY: And sometimes we know
that this ambiguous networking

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.510
concept is important,
but we don't know

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.700
why we need to be doing it.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.990
And that brings to random
acts of networking.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.520
KELLY HOEY: Right, well, when
we think of what you started,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.360
like the bad name
on networking--

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.660
if I don't know why I'm
in a networking room,

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.110
I'm equally sweaty palms
and anxious as anyone else.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.110
I'm like, why am I here?

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.970
What am I going to talk about?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.830
But if I know why I'm there, if
I've made a conscious decision

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.050
to be there, it's a heck of
a lot easier to figure out,

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.540
all right, what are we
going to talk about?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.310
What's an introductory
question that I

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.780
would want to say to someone?

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.670
Or if my networking
is I just need

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.730
to discover what this group
or organization or association

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.270
is all about, I'm happy to
go and sit quietly and assess

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.700
the landscape to
understand, right,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.069
do I want to spend more
time here in the future?

00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:21.110
ABBY: But that all should
align back to the goals

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.750
that you have set before even
walking into the room, correct?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.980
KELLY HOEY: Right, because
yeah, otherwise you

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.160
run around like a chicken
with your head cut off.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.300
And listen, our time is--

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.280
we have not been
able to hack time.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.830
There's still only 24 hours--

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.610
ABBY: Anybody working on that?

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.651
KELLY HOEY: I don't know.

00:16:34.651 --> 00:16:36.440
Maybe someone's
working on it here.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.800
We could just reverse things
every once in a while--

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.740
met George Takei at
[INAUDIBLE] a few years ago.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.750
And I said to him, still
mad with "Star Trek"

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.610
that we don't have that "Beam
me up, Scotty" technology.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.750
That would be good too.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.450
So we don't have
more time in the day.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.054
And for many of us,
well, work is important.

00:16:55.054 --> 00:16:56.720
There's other things
that are important.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.000
And your networking is also
important for your community

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.550
service.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.760
It may be important for
other things in your life.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.980
And frankly, just having time
to be with other people that

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.210
are close to you--

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.400
make a priority for that.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.089
So I'm very much about
efficiency, you know?

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.530
Maybe it's women-- multitasking,
how can you pack more

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.660
into things we're
already doing, rather

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.530
to add more things on
when our time is limited.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.031
ABBY: Great, thank you.

00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:24.530
I would say for folks that are
interested more in about goal

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.949
setting and thinking about
those meta levels of career

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.490
development, I would
highly recommend

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.690
checking out the book.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.872
The chapters on goal
setting helped me a lot,

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:33.830
personally, with thinking
about time at Google.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.440
And it made some of those
networking questions

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.540
a little bit clearer and
some of the steps easier

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.850
too-- so just a plug.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.720
KELLY HOEY: [INAUDIBLE]
it was funny.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.592
One of the early
readers of my book

00:17:43.592 --> 00:17:45.050
sort of called me
up and said, I've

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.470
got some bad news
about your book.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.550
And I said, what's the bad news?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.370
And she's like, it's
not about networking.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.490
And I'm like, yeah,
I had that suspicion.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.250
I had that suspicion.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.320
And I think it is a
bigger look at what

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.382
is it that you want to achieve?

00:17:59.382 --> 00:18:01.590
And you achieve things with
the help of other people.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.650
Now, how can you form
better relationships,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.660
and how can you
focus what you're

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.940
doing so you can achieve it?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.270
So the case studies
in the book range

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.530
from working up the
corporate ladder

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.710
to crowdfunding to getting
on a national board

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.600
to, I want to say, landing
a job right out of college--

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.650
how Tina Roth Eisenberg
created CreativeMornings,

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.140
a global network for
the creative community.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.280
So it's more than just how you
balance a drink and work room.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.050
And it has gotten a few people
thinking about, all right,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.200
what do I want to
achieve with my career?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.655
What do I want to
do after I retire?

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:45.650
I have a friend's mom inspired
to start her own business

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.440
after she retires as a
schoolteacher in June,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.849
because she read the book.

00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:51.890
ABBY: That's pretty cool.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.500
It's going to be exciting to
see where this book brings

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.750
people over the years as well.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.875
I'm sure you're going to
be getting some fun emails

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.100
or tweets tracking that down.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.391
KELLY HOEY: And those are
the things that matter to me.

00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:02.710
When I get those, to
think that something

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.040
has unlocked something
for someone else,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.790
and now they can pursue a
path to their own success--

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.800
something very
gratifying in that.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.020
ABBY: So I want to
jump back to something

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.660
you were talking about earlier,
around us owning our reputation

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.130
and owning our time.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.740
And one thing that really
stood out to me in the book

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.555
was, you kept bringing
back this idea of,

00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:26.980
who knows what you know?

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.125
Or the way I would rephrase
it is, what are you known for?

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.560
And I think my question
for you, right off the bat,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.830
would be, how do you know
who knows what you know?

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.930
If everyone keeps up with that--

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.710
KELLY HOEY: Well, because
part of the way I see that is,

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.230
I think about how the job
market and opportunities have

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.386
evolved from who you know--

00:19:50.386 --> 00:19:53.080
you know, those
insider networks--

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.630
to maybe what you know,
because it was a world driven

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.630
by help wanted, and
recruiters, and classified ads,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.770
to now a world where I put
it as, it's not who you know

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.129
or what you know, but
who knows what you know.

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:07.420
And I mention this in the book.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.400
I remember when I
was researching,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.780
and I pulled up something.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.432
And it popped up--

00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:13.390
and it was in LinkedIn.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.190
It popped up an
opportunity at Google.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.130
So I went and clicked on it.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.860
And then it said, by the way,
who do you know at Google?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.060
Why don't you contact them?

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.730
And I'm like, yeah, what
is the information you're

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.670
sharing with your
network, in terms

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.810
of what your interests
are, what maybe

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.810
you want to do next, what
in your life and your career

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.440
that you want more of, because
the signals you send out

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.690
may be the stuff
that starts coming

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.870
to you as the opportunities
that you're really seeking.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.875
So go and look at
your own profiles.

00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:49.000
Go and look at the information
that you're sharing,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.150
whether it's in person,
online or offline,

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.060
with your community, because
you may be sending out

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.790
the wrong signals in terms of
what you want to be found for.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.870
I know on my profile,
you don't see anything

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.830
about being a lawyer.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.190
It is so buried and so
minimal with search words

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.930
and everything
else, because lord

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.300
knows I don't want to
be contacted on that.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.000
ABBY: So when we're thinking
about our email signatures,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.670
or our Twitter
headlines, or even

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.030
our bios on our internal
job-search boards,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.500
do you think that those
should all be the same,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.860
and we should know what
people are identifying us as?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.620
KELLY HOEY: Right, make sure
it's powerfully moving forward

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.350
your ambition.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.677
If you're posting things
online, what are the stories

00:21:31.677 --> 00:21:32.510
that you're sharing?

00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:37.950
If you're sharing
rich content that

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.419
is dealing with your profession
or your career interests,

00:21:41.419 --> 00:21:43.710
are you sharing in a way that
people are identifying it

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.980
with something that you
either are an expert in,

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.460
or you want to move into, or
something that you care about?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.680
We have that
ability and mobility

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.260
to move between things.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.520
My own personal story
was, in 2011, 2012,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.530
I co-founded a
startup accelerator.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.260
It was not my idea, though I
was one of the co-founders.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.020
The original idea came
from my two co-founders,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.530
and they realized in launching
this nutty, crazy idea

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.040
that they needed somebody
else to help them.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.800
And they kept talking
to people and describing

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.410
the skill set,
and the abilities,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.000
and the background
they were looking

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.470
in this third co-founder,
nameless third co-founder.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.150
And my name kept coming up.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.930
Everyone kept saying,
you know what?

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.650
You need to talk to Kelly-- you
know who you should talk to?

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.950
You should talk to Kelly.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.250
So what do you want
to be known for?

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.740
Network that experience.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.000
Network that ambition.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.770
Network that skill set.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.871
Let people know what
you're interested in,

00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:45.370
because they may be like, oh,
I know who you're looking for.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.954
You're looking for
someone like Kelly,

00:22:46.954 --> 00:22:48.619
or you're looking for
someone like Abby.

00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:50.010
Let me-- you should
talk to them,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.810
sounds like a great opportunity.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.300
And that's how
everything in my life

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.372
has happened,
really, since 2009.

00:22:57.372 --> 00:22:59.330
ABBY: For folks that are
listening in right now

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.330
and saying that sounds great,
I need to update my headline,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.360
or, my goodness,
I don't know what

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.330
people know me for right now,
do you have any take actions--

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.180
and I won't say a
quick win, but areas

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.650
that people could
take away today

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.240
to start to change
their headline,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.800
change what they're known for?

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.590
KELLY HOEY: Right, well,
take an audit of every place

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.010
where you're interacting
with other people and say,

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.450
is there this consistency?

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.170
Is this networking me forward
in the way I want to be found?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.310
And then stop and think.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.310
And say, all right, how is my
network interacting with me?

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.320
What are they asking me for?

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.820
How are they engaging with me?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.940
Now, how much of
that is my network?

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.490
Do I have the
right mix of people

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.320
in it, in terms of
relationships and diversity?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.660
Or how is my terms of
engagement with it,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.170
that I've enabled them to keep
calling me back and asking

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.000
for these things?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.950
It's a little of both.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.720
So go and do that audit, and
sort of assess and say, oops.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.700
What needs to shift and change?

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.855
ABBY: Great, action item for me.

00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:04.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.610
KELLY HOEY: I do it myself.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.450
I was saying it is one
of those things that's

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.430
kind of funny-- write
a book on networking,

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.430
and you have to eat
your own dog food.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.040
And I have to follow the
advice between the two covers.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.600
So I'm not just sitting up here,
flippantly tossing out, oh, you

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.390
should do this.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.060
It's like, I have
to do it myself.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.814
And I do catch myself
every once in a while.

00:24:27.814 --> 00:24:28.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.584 --> 00:24:30.000
ABBY: So you
actually just started

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.450
to touch on something that
I'm excited you brought up

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.600
around diversity of networks and
where we find these groupings.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.060
And we actually had a great
speaker at Google last year,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.720
Tara Winston.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.857
I'm not sure if other
folks were able to tune in.

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.440
She's from Interact
Consulting and was

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.170
giving a skills-building
session at Google last year.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.990
And she had a quote that
stood out to me that I'd

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.540
love to hear your thoughts on.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.270
She warned us against
putting your entire network

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.990
in the same food chain.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.745
And I'll leave it
at that, and I'd

00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:01.370
love to hear what
you think about that.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.953
Break it down.

00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:05.300
KELLY HOEY: Well, that was
the position I was in in 2002.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.730
I had a network that
was very narrow and very

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.982
deep within the legal
industry, but very particular

00:25:10.982 --> 00:25:12.065
within the legal industry.

00:25:12.065 --> 00:25:14.810
It was New York
City and Toronto.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.570
It was bankers, investment
bankers, Wall Street,

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.500
I want to say trustees.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.140
It was within a very
narrow area of practice.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.010
And even though,
then, my next career

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.920
move I saw within
the legal industry,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.840
I had nowhere to go unless I
wanted to go a general counsel

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.900
or move to another firm
and do the same thing.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.499
And so that was a big
wake-up call for me.

00:25:41.499 --> 00:25:43.290
So I'm doing this
because there's basically

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.740
two types of networks.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.940
Some of them are
associated with gender.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.070
And some of it, I
want to say, like

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.140
I describe my own legal
career-- some of us,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.230
because of our industry
and our profession,

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.750
we do this with our network.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.020
It becomes very expertise
and very narrow.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.480
So there's a
narrow, deep network

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.210
that's often associated with
women, the types of networks

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.260
they have.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.040
As I described it, I guess I
had the double whammy on that.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.790
I also had it because
I was a lawyer doing

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.027
a particular area of law.

00:26:14.027 --> 00:26:16.110
The power in that network
is that's where you have

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.790
people who've got your back.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.080
They're the people who can
give you that feedback, maybe

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.310
some deep mentorship.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.920
They really know you well,
that team you can instantly

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.960
pull together on
a project when you

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.240
have a narrow, deep network.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.930
You can already see
the problem with it.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.260
It doesn't create a
lot of opportunities.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.360
So the other network is
a broad, shallow network.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.820
That's typically associated
with the types of relationships

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:39.960
that men have.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.940
The reality is, you need both.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.100
You need those loose ties.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.310
Those loose ties are where
opportunity comes from.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.080
You may not be able
to get deep feedback,

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.780
but you can sure spread
a message in a long way.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.850
You sure can find someone
to go, oh god, yeah, right,

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.120
I went to college with
someone who's doing that.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.911
Let me reach out to
them and see if they're

00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:03.720
interested in talking about
it, or meeting, or whatever.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.350
You need both of those.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.184
And the reality is,
our lives do that.

00:27:07.184 --> 00:27:08.850
You think about when
you are in college,

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.360
and then those relationships
ebb out this way,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.590
further and further.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.930
But find ways to keep those
people in your periphery.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.060
We're a case study of
that quote in many ways.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.960
If you had just
said, all right, I

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.960
had my nice internship
for two months

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.820
in New York City in 2012.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.130
Thanks very much, see you later.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.950
ABBY: No way, yeah--

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:34.940
wouldn't be here today.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.106
KELLY HOEY: I wouldn't be
sitting here today, right?

00:27:37.106 --> 00:27:38.890
So Abby had been my intern.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.480
And I think that's also-- when
you think about food chain,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.870
we often think of networking
as up the food chain.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:49.160
And the reality is we
live in a 360 world.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.900
You never know
where opportunities

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.370
are going to come from.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:56.510
Your next boss may be 30 years
older or 30 years younger.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.010
Nurture and take care
of all the relationships

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:05.550
around you, back to being
that decent human being,

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.960
because you never know.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.850
You never know who's
going to mentor you.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.610
You never know who
an opportunity's

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:11.790
going to come from.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.190
You never know who
you can help, and that

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.680
just creates that vibrancy and
resiliency in a network, which,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.380
in my mind, creates the
vibrancy and resiliency

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.370
in your own career.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.830
ABBY: Great, thank you.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.140
I have a lot of more
questions, quite a few

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.200
more questions for you
around social media.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.420
You talk a lot about
generosity and how

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.890
that plays in the network.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.492
But right now I want to
ask you one more question,

00:28:37.492 --> 00:28:39.700
and then I want to open it
up to folks on live stream

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.500
and in the room for questions.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.007
So start thinking about them,
or put them on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:44.007 --> 00:28:45.215
if you feel more comfortable.

00:28:45.215 --> 00:28:47.760
But my last question
for you for now

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.570
would be, if anyone here
was to go home and change

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:56.060
only one thing about how they
network, what would it be?

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.660
KELLY HOEY: Change one thing--

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.660
ABBY: It's like "The
Hunger Games" of your book.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:28:59.910
KELLY HOEY: Exactly.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.821
KELLY HOEY: You know
what I would do?

00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:04.750
[INAUDIBLE] this is the
biggest networking--

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.330
because I'm often asked, what is
the biggest networking mistake

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.990
people make?

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.940
And the biggest networking
mistake people make

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.220
is a failure to follow up.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.959
And I don't mean by
that the, hey, Abby--

00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:17.750
you know, the email I
could send that said,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.290
hey, Abby, thanks very much
for arranging this chat today.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:25.150
It's when can I follow
up a month from now?

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.610
When is there some time
that you cross my mind

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.960
that I could follow up again?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.440
And that failure to follow
up with a piece of advice,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.280
maybe an introduction someone
made, whatever it may be--

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:44.420
and if you do nothing else from
today, go back to your desk,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:44.920
whatever.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.570
Sit there and look
at your calendar,

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.880
and think, right,
where is someone

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.700
who has done something for
me that other than the, hey,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.960
thanks a lot, where can I
circle back and let them know

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.430
what I've done
with that guidance

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.560
or how something turned out?

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:04.880
And that type of follow-up
changes things within networks.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.900
And that changes relationships.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.910
So if you do one thing from
today and change one thing,

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.130
master the art of the follow-up.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.340
ABBY: That's a great note
to take some questions on.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.400
Thank you so much.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.190
I want to first open
it up to the room

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.550
and see if we have
any live questions.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.070
AUDIENCE: I have a question
on the gender issue.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.020
So you're hinting that
men and women are very

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.390
different in networking styles.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.180
And how does that
differentiate the two genders

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.880
in terms of career development?

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.510
KELLY HOEY: That is a terrific
question in terms of networking

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.720
and career development.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.570
Here's the two things that
are running through my mind.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.840
One is, for people
earlier in their career,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.100
I often recommend to them--

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.050
I said, look at what it
takes for other people

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.004
to be successful in the
area you want to go into.

00:30:55.004 --> 00:30:56.420
And part of how
they're successful

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.711
is not just the knowledge base.

00:30:57.711 --> 00:30:59.210
It's how they interact.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.680
And ask yourself, will
I be as successful

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.797
within that interaction?

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:07.880
So I knew I could be
successful as a legal career.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.860
But if I'd chosen to
be a tax attorney,

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.550
I would have been
an abject failure.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.460
Their way of networking
is very technical.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.700
It is very research-driven,
and it is very paper-driven,

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.840
in terms of writing papers and
things and sending updates.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.620
That is not me.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.110
I was much better
off hanging out,

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.900
as I used to refer to them,
with my frat boy Wall Street

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.050
clients, because giving
someone a tequila shot

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.480
was a heck of a lot easier
than spending endless hours

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.710
researching.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.090
But that was my
personality type.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.540
So look ahead and say,
how do they interact?

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:45.530
I also think this
is where there is

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.220
power in knowing
why you want to seek

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:54.880
the advice of other people,
because we all operate within,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.020
I want to say, proximity
and communities

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.450
that they may have their
patterns of interactions,

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.330
and how you can--

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.520
you may not want to
completely disrupt it.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.890
But you want to be part
of the conversation.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.430
And this is where you have
to find those opportunities

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.330
to seek out people, in
my mind, on their advice

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.940
and their guidance of
how they can help you.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.400
So for example, to reach
out to someone and say,

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.960
please explain to me why this
happened in your career--

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.030
how did you make the move
from HR to engineering?

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.540
That intrigues me,
and it doesn't seem

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.150
to be a linear career process.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.340
How did that come about?

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.240
People want to talk and share
that kind of particular advice.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.012
And so if you find yourself
within an environment

00:32:44.012 --> 00:32:45.470
that you don't
think, well, I'm not

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.580
going to go out and do
that type of networking,

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.460
find other ways to have
conversation that focuses back

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.580
on the nature of work.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.367
Does that help?

00:32:55.367 --> 00:32:55.950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.860
AUDIENCE: I have a
[INAUDIBLE] question.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.327
So what advice do you
have for introverts?

00:33:00.327 --> 00:33:02.410
KELLY HOEY: [GASPS] This
is my favorite question--

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.277
advice for introverts.

00:33:04.277 --> 00:33:05.360
We didn't talk about this.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.330
I did mention that the
book is case-study driven.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.720
And I saw people
within my network

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.460
that had a particular outcome.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.980
And I said, I need
you to unpack this,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.330
because I have a suspicion
that you have achieved

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.980
this goal in a networked way by
building relationships, seeking

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.040
the help of others,
building your own expertise,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.110
sharing that within
your network,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.790
and moving towards
whatever your goal is,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.180
whether it's up the
corporate ladder, starting a,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.630
I want to say, a venture
capital fund, climbing

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.430
Everest, et cetera.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.140
So I sent out questions to
these people in my book.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.280
And I did not ask
them one question.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.230
I didn't ask them
their personality type.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.685
I didn't ask, how'd you
do on the Myers-Briggs?

00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:52.340
How'd you do?

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.280
No, didn't ask that
question, and my answers

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.120
started coming back.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.330
Most of the people who
were featured in the book

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.470
are introverts, and not
a little bit introverted,

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.690
really introverted.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.130
I think in this
day and age, when

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.670
we are bombarded with
opportunities and information,

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.400
online and off,
and choice, I think

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.239
people who are more purposeful
and conscientious in how they

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.520
network are better networkers.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.710
And my guess is,
those are introverts.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.989
In managing your own discomfort,
in managing your concern

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.679
on what your ask may be and
how it may feel or impose

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.550
on someone else, I think
you're better positioned

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:37.690
to succeed than extroverts.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.790
I'm going to go really out
on a limb and say that one.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.310
So my advice to introverts
is, any time someone

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.429
sends you a networking
tip that says--

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.380
maybe it's a link to
an article that's, hey,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.360
10 things introverts can do to
network more like extroverts--

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.649
I want you to hit
Delete immediately.

00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:55.940
Someone sends you that advice--

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.940
I want you to ignore it.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.440
Continue to be conscientious.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.020
Continue to be purposeful.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.330
Continue to understand
why it is you

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.920
need to undertake
networking activities.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.010
One of the great case
studies in the book

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.080
is a guy by the
name of Joe Styler.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.430
Joe is at GoDaddy.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.560
He networked his way
up from the help desk

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.180
to the after-markets department.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.460
So I like to say on my
way from being in New York

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.430
and on Wall Street, from being
the receptionist at Goldman

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.230
Sachs to lead trader--

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.380
he's made that
change in his career,

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.720
networking, building
his expertise,

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.200
moving his career forward
within his industry very

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.440
purposely and very
intentionally within GoDaddy.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.390
And he's like,
hey, there's things

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:48.610
I know I have to do that, if
I look at my personality type,

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.240
I know I'm not
comfortable doing them.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.390
But I understand now
why I need to do them,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.670
so I can step into that room.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.490
And he is so purposeful
and so well researched,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.590
any time, I think it's to
manage that discomfort.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.620
But his case study is an
absolutely brilliant one

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.470
in terms of someone
who is introverted

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.240
moving their career
forward, because if he

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:12.500
had succumbed to introversion
and just been told,

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.607
go network, go work
cocktail parties,

00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:16.190
he'd probably still
be, you know, hey,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.314
thanks for calling GoDaddy.

00:36:17.314 --> 00:36:17.960
This is Joe.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.950
How can I help you-- instead
of in a very fulfilling role

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.097
within that company and
within the industry.

00:36:25.097 --> 00:36:26.930
AUDIENCE: A technical
question on LinkedIn--

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.910
what is your thoughts on the
LinkedIn open networkers?

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.796
And how can you use
them as a resource--

00:36:34.796 --> 00:36:36.227
struggling with that.

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:38.810
KELLY HOEY: The open networkers,
so people actively connecting

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.087
with other people on LinkedIn?

00:36:40.087 --> 00:36:42.170
AUDIENCE: Right, so if you
send them a connection,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.836
you don't have any
connection with them.

00:36:43.836 --> 00:36:46.759
They will automatically
approve you in their network.

00:36:46.759 --> 00:36:48.050
KELLY HOEY: I want to know why.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.930
AUDIENCE: So one of
the benefits they do,

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.970
which might not be a
benefit for individuals,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.210
but they're able to connect
groups that are not actually

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.150
connected together.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.870
So there's a good society
view that these people play.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.180
But I didn't know how
other, as an individual,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.600
you tactically use
this for those folks.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.990
KELLY HOEY: Yeah,
here's the thing.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.950
As a networking platform, and
to date myself, as a Rolodex,

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.070
as a way of keeping
eyeballs on contacts

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.520
and thinking about who and
when to contact people,

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.390
depending on where I'm going
or industries I'm looking into,

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.710
I'm a massive fan of LinkedIn.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.919
And I think also, too,
it has revealed to us--

00:37:27.919 --> 00:37:29.210
it's not only your own network.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.310
It is the second- and
third-degree connections

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.090
and sort of unveiling
that concept to people

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:36.420
who hadn't heard of it.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.337
I think it's vitally important,
that LinkedIn as a platform.

00:37:41.337 --> 00:37:42.920
But there's two
things with LinkedIn--

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.040
I think we look at it as
a platform in technology,

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.270
and we forget that people
use it differently.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.440
And we use it differently
at different points in time.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.620
So a request to connect without
a personal message, I think,

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.930
is meaningless.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:05.060
Tell me, remind me,
prompt me how and why.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.020
And then when you do
that with other people,

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.420
also remember some of us may be
using the network differently.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.500
I know some people who use
LinkedIn very closed off.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.150
If we haven't sat face to face,
if we haven't broken bread,

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.370
you're not in my
LinkedIn network.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.040
Other people are,
oh, you know what?

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.240
I'm expanding my business.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.650
I've got a new role in sales.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.950
In my own case, I've
got a book to sell.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:34.400
It's a lot wider, so if someone
was to message me on LinkedIn

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.410
and said, hey, loved
hearing your talk

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.540
at the University
of Tampa, I was

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.340
the one who asked
this question, I'm

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.900
likely to connect with them.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.320
It also makes it--
when someone says,

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.660
can you make an introduction?

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.000
I see you're connected on
LinkedIn to this person.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.310
Can you make the introduction?

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.726
That's also where you need to
understand that they may not

00:38:54.726 --> 00:38:58.070
have the strongest connection to
people to make an introduction.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.620
So I would be able to say,
oh, yeah, that person?

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:01.250
I know them.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.394
We connected in
Tampa for 10 minutes.

00:39:04.394 --> 00:39:05.810
You can reach out
and use my name,

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.434
but I don't think I can be that
meaningful in terms of anything

00:39:08.434 --> 00:39:10.250
in-depth in a connection.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.190
But we use it
differently, and I think

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.130
you've hit on something, in
my mind, which is bigger,

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:22.580
is that when you have digital
tools around networks, when we

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.330
focus on the tools themselves
and the technology,

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.890
we forget that people
use them differently.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.540
And just remember always,
it's human beings behind that.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.240
And think about the way that--

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.070
you using something
is not necessarily

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.210
the way somebody else uses it.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:44.140
And I would say, for anyone in
the room and anyone watching--

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.510
so on my website,
jkellyhoey.co--

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.510
dot co, it's a dot co,
not a dot com-- there's

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.700
a little box that
says Ask Kelly.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.320
Crazy thing-- it comes to me.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.310
It comes into my Gmail account.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.780
There is no one in between that.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.800
So if you don't get your
question answered today,

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.884
just fire me the question.

00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:06.341
Say that you were watching
this, and you've got a question,

00:40:06.341 --> 00:40:07.270
and I'll answer it.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.100
ABBY: jkelly--

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.100
KELLY HOEY: jkellyhoey--

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.641
ABBY: Dot co?

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:10.560
KELLY HOEY: Dot co--

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.630
it's Ask Kelly,
and Kelly answers.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.077
ABBY: Great, thank you.

00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:15.910
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.460
To build on top of
the previous question,

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.940
what other tools do you use
to keep track of your network?

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.260
Oftentimes, I realize that
I don't remember people

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.910
very well.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.451
And a lot of engineers,
I think, have

00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:29.200
this problem of short memory.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.625
And oftentimes, I
would find myself--

00:40:32.625 --> 00:40:34.080
hey, there was this problem.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.960
And I didn't think of contacting
this person, and only two

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.651
weeks later, to realize he would
have solved this issue very

00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:41.150
quickly.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:45.510
KELLY HOEY: Yeah, yeah, I
wish I had the magic solution

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.040
for remembering these things.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.950
I am very, I want to say,
geography-based in my thinking,

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.029
in terms of when I
start problem solving.

00:40:56.029 --> 00:40:58.570
I think of networking as-- it's
the way you've just described

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.611
it, like problem solving.

00:40:59.611 --> 00:41:02.230
Who can help me
with this problem?

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.267
I'm often very geography-
or company-based when

00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:06.850
I think of it.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.920
Sometimes I'm like, OK,
where did I meet them?

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.836
Where did I meet them?

00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:12.700
And I have to kind of
go down this waterfall.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.950
I would say for
anyone, figure out

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.600
how you start to problem-solve
in these situations.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.202
Who have I met?

00:41:21.202 --> 00:41:22.660
And then you'll
probably figure out

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.840
what is the best way for you
to organize your contacts.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.120
Are you someone who
would go to LinkedIn?

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.400
Is a spreadsheet
the answer for you?

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.630
Is there some other--

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:39.580
is it groups on Google+?

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.360
Figure it out.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.920
Start to think about
how you problem-solve

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.840
and need the help
of other people.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.790
And figure out from
there, what are

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.846
the ways I can clump
people in different things

00:41:50.846 --> 00:41:52.220
to be able to say,
you know what?

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.530
I just met this person.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.390
We talked about this stuff.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.910
He or she may be a good person
to ask this type of question

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.200
in the future.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.040
Figure a way to tag
them or do something.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.700
But part of it, I
think, maybe all

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.540
of this with the
book and networking

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.640
is a whole lot of
self-awareness,

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.250
a whole lot of
self-awareness about

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.290
how you operate
within this world,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.390
but how you reach
out to other people

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:20.280
and how you can do that in a
way that is more effective,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.360
but I wish I had the
ultimate dashboard.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.570
Maybe that's the
next thing I create.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.290
ABBY: 2018.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:26.290
KELLY HOEY: There we go.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:28.123
Because I didn't have
enough projects to do.

00:42:28.123 --> 00:42:29.390
I'll come up with a dashboard.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.660
Because it is something--
people are always like,

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.740
where is the Rolodex,
the CRM system?

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.650
I am not a spreadsheet person.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:43.559
But if that's what works for
you, put it in a spreadsheet.

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:45.100
ABBY: It's so great
to have you here.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.390
And I hesitate to
say if you want

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.390
to leave us with any
departing wisdom, because I

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.244
think that's what the last
45 minutes was all about.

00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:51.744
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.744 --> 00:42:55.715
But any closing thoughts or
final remarks before we wrap?

00:42:55.715 --> 00:42:57.340
KELLY HOEY: I just
want to say go forth

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.730
and be better human beings.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.630
That's all that we
all can ask for.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.900
And I think if we understand
that we're networking

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.580
with other people,
that their lives are

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:12.640
complicated and messy, if we
can stop and observe and listen

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.300
a little bit more
before we interact,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.110
we will improve
our interactions.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.360
ABBY: Thank you, that's great.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.556
Kelly, it's been awesome
to have you here.

00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:21.390
KELLY HOEY: Thank
you, thank you.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.990
ABBY: We really
appreciate it, thank you.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.906
KELLY HOEY: Thank you.

00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:24.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.540
ABBY: Thanks, everybody.
