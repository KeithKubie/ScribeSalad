WALTER ISAACSON: You know,
we're very, very lucky here.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.050
I mean, when I
wrote this block, I

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.190
thought, who are the
great heroes of it,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.970
and Dr. Khan and Vint
Cerf are among them,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.770
and I hope you appreciate
how cool it is, especially

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.150
for somebody like me
who loves history,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.001
to be able to talk the
internet with you all.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.250
VINT CERF: Well, it's a real
pleasure to have you here

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.100
and to have the rest of you
here in our new offices.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.780
For those of you who
came in more on time,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.070
we kind of started
just informally.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.940
This man sitting
next to me has had

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.440
quite an interesting
history, so I'll

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.830
repeat a little bit of that.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.180
He's currently the chairman
of the Aspen Institute

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.870
and was formerly
the chairman of CNN.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.055
He was also managing
editor of Time Magazine

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.320
and has written a whole bunch of
books, the most recent of which

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.040
you have before you,
"The Innovators."

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.760
The most recent before that
was Steve Jobs's biography

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.690
and many others before
that, all of which

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
are well worth reading, so we
welcome you to our presence

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.010
and to an opportunity to ask you
some questions about this book.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.720
Sitting over on my
right is Bob Kahn.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.130
I was going to say the late Bob
Kahn, that would be bad taste,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.460
so I won't do that.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.350
BOB KAHN: Wasn't that late.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.640
Your problem is your garage
says it closes at 7 o'clock,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.410
so we were about to go find
some other garage to park in.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.326
VINT CERF: Well,
since we're all here,

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:28.700
I can make the
door open for you.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580
How's that?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.830
WALTER ISAACSON: All you
have to do is say, OK, glass,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.416
open the door.

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.290
VINT CERF: That's it.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.150
I'm wearing one right there.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.930
BOB KAHN: Is the
audience all from Google?

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.000
VINT CERF: No, no, no.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.708
These are people from
all over the place.

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:42.170
WALTER ISAACSON:
Who's from Google?

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.160
VINT CERF: Fair number
but not everybody.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.640
So what I thought
we would do, Bob,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.910
is start out with a couple of
questions about the book itself

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.280
and what Walter has discovered.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.100
This thing covers
quite a broad range

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.330
of topics about things
that were highly innovative

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.750
and made huge changes
in our history.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.770
So what is it that
you would distill

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.680
from what you've
already discovered

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.030
in writing the book that you
would like us to take away?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670
WALTER ISAACSON:
Thank you, and let

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.330
me say that when we
get further along

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.310
and we're discussing
the internet,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.080
I'm going to turn the
tables because to be

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.140
able to ask questions
of the two of you

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.480
about both the ARPANET,
the RFCs, and then

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.860
the internet protocols.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.685
So watch out because that's
going to be a two way street.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.625
VINT CERF: Fair deal.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.500
WALTER ISAACSON: The
main thing I discovered.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.620
I've written biographies
a lot-- Steve Jobs,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.150
Einstein, Franklin--
and those of us

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.050
who write biographies kind of
know in the back of our minds

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.850
that we distort history with
the great man theory of history.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.820
We make it sound like there's
a guy or a gal in a garage

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.750
or a garret who has a light bulb
moment and innovation happens.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.320
True innovation, and there's
no better example of it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.680
then the ARPANET RFC process
and then the TCP/IP process,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.290
really comes from pairs of
people, teams of people,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.270
and from collaboration, bouncing
ideas off against each other,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.060
finishing each
other's sentences,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.910
and the internet
age in particular

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.610
allows such teamwork
and collaboration.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.950
The other thing was I started
this book when I said,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.250
way earlier before
we started, we

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.810
were talking about when I ran
digital media for Time Inc

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.410
in the early 1990s, and I first
met Vint when he was at MCI,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.550
and I was trying to convince
Time Inc to do things

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.880
with the internet.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.680
And so the president of
Time Inc says to me, well,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.820
who owns the internet?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.774
So first of all,
I think to myself

00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:48.190
because I don't
want to get fired,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.520
that's a clueless question.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.750
I say, nobody owns it.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.810
He says, well, who built it?

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.380
Who created it?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.680
And I realized
after thinking how

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.130
clueless that question was
that I did not really now.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.680
And if you feel detached from
the history of the things you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.440
use, there's sort of a
detachment that leads to you

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.650
not feeling comfortable with it.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.390
So I wanted to know, how
did computers happen?

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.380
How did the PC happen?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.279
How did the transistor
become the microchip,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:25.410
and then how did the internet or
digital packet switch networks

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.270
come into being?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
So that's why I did this book,
and in doing so, as I said,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.380
you learn about the
importance of collaboration,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.880
but you also learn
that there wasn't

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.520
one person who
invented the computer.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.329
And certainly, even
after doing this book,

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.120
you and I have been
discussing some of the,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.270
no, I should get more
credit type feelings,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.570
but it was done creatively
and collaboratively.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.660
VINT CERF: This notion
of collaboration

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.960
resonates very
well with all of us

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.880
at Google because a lot of
the tools that we make and use

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.130
are exactly
collaborative elements,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.790
things like Shared Documents,
things like the Google

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.040
Hangouts, things like that
where multiple parties can

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.670
communicate all
at the same time.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.810
WALTER ISAACSON: That was
the original intention

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.420
of the internet or
ARPANET was time

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.220
sharing research computers,
and then collaborating.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.840
I even did that with this book.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.790
When I was writing
that, I said, wait,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.540
this is how we collaborate,
and I put parts of this book

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.350
online, like on a medium
with Google Docs, whatever,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.810
and said, everybody share.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.780
Help me collaborate.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.300
Help put stuff in.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.620
And people like Stewart
Brand, who I knew,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.240
started rewriting the demise
of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.490
and exactly what drugs were
being served at the demise

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.810
partly because I
got the drugs wrong.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.740
But people like Dan
Bricklin were explaining,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.950
no, VisiCalc was done this way.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.690
And so they're in the book
from having been crowd sourced.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.040
BOB KAHN: Walter, I'd like
to ask you a question.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.630
Vint and I were both on a
panel at the National Academy

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.210
about a week ago, and one of
the questions that came up was,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.670
what is the internet?

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.560
One of the panelists
took the position

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.810
that the internet is
what people think it is.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.750
So if you think the
web is the internet,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.950
then that's the internet.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.830
If you think the web is this.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.990
I just wondered,
do you care much

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.360
in writing a book like that
of clarifying that example.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.310
Because a lot of places
in the book, you say,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.130
the ARPANET morphed
into internet, and not

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.042
exactly clear what the internet
is from reading your book.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.750
Are you comfortable
with that definition?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.280
WALTER ISAACSON: I
see the internet,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.696
and I'm going to turn it to
you, because you should answer

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.660
it better, but I see it
as the TCP/IP protocols.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.540
Now, the question is
when Tim Berners-Lee

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:47.760
puts a layer of that [INAUDIBLE]
that have hypertext protocols

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.790
and markup languages, to me,
that's still the internet.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.050
Now, the question then
becomes, if I'm using Twitter,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.140
is that the internet?

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.827
And the answer
technically is no.

00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:00.660
I mean, that's not--

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.360
VINT CERF: Well, actually,
we could argue that because--

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.320
WALTER ISAACSON: Oh,
we could argue it,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.100
so let me turn it
back to you all.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.266
VINT CERF: Wait, wait, wait.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.610
You're right in the
middle of chapter six,

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.790
and I wanted to at
least point out to you--

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.800
WALTER ISAACSON:
Start at chapter one?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.216
VINT CERF: Well, we don't have
to go through every chapter

00:07:19.216 --> 00:07:22.710
but this starts out
with Ada Lovelace, who

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.840
was Lord Byron's daughter.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.610
And I wanted to start
out by just asking, what

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.920
was it that drew you
to that story first,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.670
because it's in the
1850s in England,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.870
and it's the earliest
manifestations

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.521
of mechanical computing?

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:39.020
What made you decide
to start there?

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.478
WALTER ISAACSON:
To be honest, what

00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:44.300
drew it to me first was my
daughter had not written

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.220
her college entrance essay,
and my wife, who we've talked

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.270
about, was going nuts the way
Yuppie wives do, and saying,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.220
get it done.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.100
And one day, Betsy
said, I did it.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.820
I said, what was it on?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.370
She said, Ada
Lovelace because she's

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.870
a computer geek and stuff.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.070
And I paused.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.250
I kind of knew the
name Ada Lovelace,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.030
but I didn't know
exactly what she did.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.430
VINT CERF: You didn't mix
it up with Linda Lovelace?

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.721
WALTER ISAACSON: No, I did not.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.130
I'm surprised that people
all remember who she is.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.030
So I became much more
interested in Ada Lovelace.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.960
Now, Ada Lovelace is partly
a symbol in this book,

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.900
because as a person, she's
kind of controversial,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.630
but what she does as
Lord Byron's daughter is

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.049
her mother, Lady Byron, was
optically fond of Lord Byron

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.000
by the time Ada was growing
up, for reasons that Byron

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.429
fans will understand, and
so had her tutored mainly

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.679
in mathematics as if that were
an antidote for her becoming

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.180
a romantic poet, which Lady
Byron did not want her to be.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.220
So she embraces what she
calls poetical science.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.830
It's the ability to link
the poetic and the beauty

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.650
of humanities with the
technology of science.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.660
She loves, for example,
traveling the Midlands

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.650
and looking at the
punch cards that

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.420
are being used in the mechanical
looms of the Industrial

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.510
Revolution in the 1830s.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.580
VINT CERF: The
Jacquard looms, yes.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.220
WALTER ISAACSON:
The Jacquard loom,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.360
and showing how
they weave patterns.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.420
Her father, Lord
Byron, was a Luddite,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.750
and I don't mean
that figuratively.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.770
His only speech in
the House of Lords

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.607
was defending the
followers of Ned Ludd, who

00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:24.190
were smashing these
looms because they

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.220
were putting people out of work.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.400
And he also is there
with Mary Shelley

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.200
when they do
Frankenstein's monster.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.390
This notion that
technology can destroy us

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.910
was ingrained in Lord Byron.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.040
Ada felt the opposite.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.610
She had this friend,
Charles Babbage,

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.240
who had made a pretty
good calculator called

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.000
the difference
engine, was trying

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.440
to conceive one
which he never got

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.420
built called the
analytical engine, which

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.240
uses punch cards to do the
processing of the numbers.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.490
Ada writes a set of notes
that are totally fascinating.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.060
You've got to read them.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.410
And among the
notes to this thing

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.530
is how if you use punch
cards, the machine

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.190
will be able to weave
patterns like Jacquard's loom,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.320
as she puts it.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.620
In other words, the machine will
not only do numbers, she says.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.620
You can make it do
words, or even music.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.310
I can feel her father
rolling over in the grave.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.720
Patterns, anything that can be
notated in symbols, she said.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.480
So to me, that is
the core notion

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.090
of what a computer is, anything
that can be notated in symbols.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.790
She has many other
things, but I'll

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.650
only mention one, which
is her final note is

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.380
that they'll do
anything but think.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.880
Machines will never be creative.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.680
Machines will never think.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.863
And 100 years later,
assuming you're

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:47.390
going to jump there, Alan
Turing, who really comes up

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.000
with the concept of the
universal computing machine,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.600
and then works at Bletchley
Park to break the German ENIGMA

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.740
code with some people.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.810
They build the Bombe
and then Colossus.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.600
He writes a wonderful paper.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.370
The movie's about to come out
called "The Imitation Game."

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.050
He called it the imitation game.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.460
We now call the
Turing test to address

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.710
what he calls Lady
Lovelace's objection,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.480
because Turing was
fascinated by Lovelace.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.940
And he says, well, you say
machines will never think.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.750
How would we know that?

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.220
If you had a machine in a
different room and a person,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.230
you couldn't tell
their answers apart,

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.590
you'd have no empirical reason
to say machines don't think.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.910
And so he believed in
artificial intelligence,

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.900
that eventually, we would have
machines that think without us.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.870
I basically use that as
one of the framing devices

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.950
in the book, the
notion of those who

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.340
believe that the intimate
partnership between humans

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.830
and machines will get
us forward and those

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.400
who believe that the pursuit
of artificial intelligence

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.360
will get us forward.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.860
Sorry for the long answer.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.375
BOB KAHN: One of
the first programs

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:57.265
that I ever used--
Vint actually wrote one

00:11:57.265 --> 00:11:58.390
about PARRY and the DOCTOR.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.315
This is about the
DOCTOR program.

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:02.940
It made some
outrageous statement,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.700
and it was supposed to be
a conversation about you.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.670
I remember when I saw that, I
responded to it, "my oh my,"

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.610
and its response back
was, "your oh your?"

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.100
And I knew we
wouldn't get very far.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.760
WALTER ISAACSON: With all due
respect to my Google Android's

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.970
ability to talk to
me, it is really hard

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.735
to do language processing.

00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:28.360
VINT CERF: Yes.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.755
We have a lot of people
who have confirmed that.

00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:33.255
BOB KAHN: And we know quite a
bit about it from [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:35.088
WALTER ISAACSON: You
know more than anybody.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.770
VINT CERF: The
earliest experience

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.375
I ever had with trying to
do language translation

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:42.330
was at Stanford when I was an
undergraduate in the 1960s,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.610
and we were pretty naive.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.935
We had this
Russian/English dictionary,

00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:48.860
and we poured it
into the computer.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.830
We typed in, "out of
sight, out of mind."

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.410
We translated that
into Russian, then

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.980
we translated it
back into English,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.308
and it came back,
"invisible idiot."

00:12:58.308 --> 00:13:02.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.610
Which told us that
there was more

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.025
to this than the dictionary.

00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:07.566
WALTER ISAACSON: By
the way, the book

00:13:07.566 --> 00:13:09.920
ends with a chapter called
"Ada Forever," which

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.885
is what you just said, this
notion of understanding

00:13:14.885 --> 00:13:18.940
a bit of language, or being
able to spot your mother's

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.500
face in Grand Central
Station, which

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.830
if you go to the total
domain awareness system

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.090
down in lower Manhattan,
they have all these cameras.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.930
They say, oh, we can do that.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.940
Or a robot that can walk across
the room and pick up a crayon.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.060
A four-year-old can do
it but a machine can't.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.470
It's called Moravec's paradox.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.400
VINT CERF: It's
getting better, though.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.233
WALTER ISAACSON: It's
always getting better,

00:13:40.233 --> 00:13:41.730
but it's always 20 years away.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.122
It's always a mirage.

00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:46.080
VINT CERF: Look, the
latest Tesla announcement,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.030
the D thing parks itself.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.220
We're getting closer and
closer to something useful,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.854
even if it isn't as
fully creative as--

00:13:51.854 --> 00:13:53.520
WALTER ISAACSON: I
was onstage yesterday

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.720
with Elon Musk, who told me that
the singularity is so close he

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.590
wants to go to Mars because
machine learning will make

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:05.830
machines want to destroy us,
and he's smarter than I am.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.870
You all at Google
are smarter, but I've

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.350
been reading that since
1955 right after Alan Turing

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.460
does his Turing test, and they
always say, 10 years from now,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.450
we'll have machines that
can think better than we do.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.790
Maybe so, but as the
heroes of this book,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.570
Lick Licklider, Doug Engelbart,
Alan Kay, say, in the meantime,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.180
let's make our machines
connect to us better

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.500
than try to out-think us.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.050
VINT CERF: Well, let's
make partners out of them,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.716
if nothing else.

00:14:36.716 --> 00:14:39.350
I have to admit Google search
is a pretty cool partner when

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.220
you think about it.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.450
It does stuff that
I couldn't do.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.220
WALTER ISAACSON:
And Google search

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.890
is done not by an algorithm
that thinks without us,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.460
but an algorighm that
harvests millions of links

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.560
put every day onto
websites by humans.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.030
VINT CERF: That's right.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.446
BOB KAHN: I wanted to ask you
one question about something

00:14:53.446 --> 00:14:57.320
that struck me when I
first really understood

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.600
what Turing and company
were doing at Princeton.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.540
I gave the keynote at the
100th anniversary of his birth.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.650
VINT CERF: His birthday.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.750
BOB KAHN: Last year [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.420
It was one of a
multiplicity of them.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.440
But one of the
things that struck

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.210
me back then was
when Turing wrote

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.360
that paper on computable
numbers, that was actually

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.570
not easily accepted by people
because they didn't think

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.720
computing was something that a
machine could do at that time,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.240
really.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.950
If you looked at what Church
did with the lambda calculus,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.410
it was a conceptual thing.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.160
If you looked at what his
colleagues, like Kurt Godel,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.340
and there were a number of
really excellent logicians

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.330
there at the time,
they were thinking

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.462
of conceptual frameworks
for organizing things

00:15:43.462 --> 00:15:44.670
so that the logic made sense.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.190
WALTER ISAACSON: You have
to remember that, as you do,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.160
uncomputable numbers
was not written

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.284
to invent a universal
computing machine.

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.700
That was just a
thought experiment

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.840
he uses to solve
one of Hilbert's

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.450
mathematical questions about
whether all problems are

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.220
decidable.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.960
BOB KAHN: But it seems to me
that the one thing that really

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.860
came out of that was the
idea that you could actually

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.260
create a machine that would
do these computations.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.030
They eventually showed
that recursive function

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.130
theory and the lambda calculus
and the Turing machine all

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.730
could do all the
computable functions,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.190
but that wasn't known at the
time, nor was it obvious.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.690
The realization that
pops out at that time

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.910
that you can actually
build something

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.047
around these numbers
that was so fascinating,

00:16:31.047 --> 00:16:32.630
but I didn't get
that out of the book,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.770
and I wondered, was that
something you just didn't think

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.970
the public would
understand, or was--

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.370
WALTER ISAACSON: I thought
that was important, totally

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.010
fascinating.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.760
I drilled down, read
the entire Turing thing.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.610
That is a sideline
because it's not

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.250
about the actual what they were
doing at Bletchley Park, which

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.210
I was trying to tell.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.543
BOB KAHN: This was at Princeton.

00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:54.610
WALTER ISAACSON: Right.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.500
What happens there, and I
would love your feedback on it,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.190
is they are trying to figure
out whether all problems are

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.590
computable, whether it's
decidable to know which ones

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.280
or not, and you
end up with Godel

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.490
saying there's an incompleteness
inherent, and with Turing

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.040
and Church both saying,
and we can't even

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.240
decide what is completable
and what's not completable.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.980
I'm oversimplifying.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.490
So there's still
a mystery that's

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:26.460
wonderfully inherent in math,
that not all things-- I mean,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.840
there is an incompleteness
in the mathematical system.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.540
BOB KAHN: But there
was also the fact,

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.160
I believe, that
what Turing had done

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.000
was not appreciated that much
by the other people around him

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.800
because they were the
pure theoreticians,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.850
and Turing was more
of an engineer,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.030
if I can use that term, even
though he never built anything,

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.320
much like the conflicts that
we've seen in computer science

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.920
in recent days
between the people who

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.366
are the pure theorists and
the people who are actually

00:17:57.366 --> 00:17:57.990
building stuff.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.610
WALTER ISAACSON: You're
absolutely right,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.068
and I do say in
the book that there

00:18:00.068 --> 00:18:02.480
are only four or five people
who even comment or review

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.080
his paper.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.030
It's not very well thought of.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.470
And throughout history,
you see that where Penn,

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.790
they're building
these computers,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.380
and yet it seems a little
beneath their dignity

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.590
because it's not an academic,
theoretical pursuit,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.170
so then they get
rid of the computer.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.790
And even at Princeton,
if I may say,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:22.670
the IAS finally, after
von Neumann leaves,

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:27.019
they don't feel computing is a
grand endeavor in its own way.

00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:28.435
BOB KAHN: Well,
there was physics.

00:18:28.435 --> 00:18:29.620
WALTER ISAACSON: Yes, right.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.660
VINT CERF: Well,
everything is physics

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.910
when you get right down to it.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.930
WALTER ISAACSON:
Everything is math.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.870
VINT CERF: Well, OK.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.680
So we start with math
and we go to physics,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.700
and the abstraction of
physics is chemistry,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.730
and the abstraction of
chemistry is biology,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.607
and the abstraction of
biology is psychology,

00:18:42.607 --> 00:18:43.940
and it keeps on going like that.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.850
BOB KAHN: But you remember
the symposium we had up at MIT

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.850
when Richard Feynman came
and a bunch of others,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.280
and it was called "The
Simulation of Physics,"

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.530
and they didn't like that
one bit because they said,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.089
physics is not a simulation.

00:18:57.089 --> 00:18:59.380
It's not some bigger, digital
thing that's creating it.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.630
WALTER ISAACSON: You're
losing control of the bus.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.630
VINT CERF: I'll come back
to a couple of things.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.880
Well, it's impossible.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.410
Nobody could manage these guys.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.370
But I do want to draw you back
for just a couple seconds.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.650
First of all, the point
about Turing, for example,

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.400
reinforces the notion
that theory is helpful

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.970
if you can underwrite or
underscore or somehow support

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:21.730
applications.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.560
If you don't have much theory
underneath the application,

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.410
then you don't quite
know what to expect

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.970
and what you're doing.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.820
So it's clear that the
Gedankenexperiment that Turing

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.040
did is not unlike the
Gedankenexperiments

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.360
that Einstein did.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.210
A lot of his work was not math.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.930
It was Gedanken imagery.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.149
He thought in those terms.

00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:42.940
WALTER ISAACSON: Visual
thought experiment.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.560
VINT CERF: Now let's go to
something more concrete,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.110
though.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.780
You have a really
interesting story

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:53.240
here about what happens when the
transistor gets built in 1947.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.050
The three guys who do this go
off-- well, Shockley anyway,

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.290
goes off to start a company
to build transistors.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.980
And I think it's
worth recounting

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.260
what happens because
the focus that we got

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.364
to early in this game
was collaboration

00:20:10.364 --> 00:20:12.780
and what happens when you get
groups of people all focused

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.310
on trying to do something.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.940
So what happens in that case?

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.570
Shockley goes to the West
Coast and starts his company,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.930
brings some really
smart people together,

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.250
which should have produced
an important collaboration.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.277
What happened?

00:20:28.277 --> 00:20:30.610
WALTER ISAACSON: It goes to
the theme of the book, which

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.370
is that vision without
collaboration and execution

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.166
is just hallucination.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.940
What you have at Bell Labs
is this wonderful environment

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.966
where Shannon is riding a
unicycle up and down doing

00:20:45.966 --> 00:20:47.590
information theory,
but you also have--

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.860
VINT CERF: Did he do
that when you were there?

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.900
WALTER ISAACSON: Yes.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.910
BOB KAHN: Shannon had left.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.657
I started my career
at Bell Labs.

00:20:54.657 --> 00:20:56.240
One of the things I
got from your book

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.660
that I found very
interesting was

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.680
he started at the
same place that I did,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.492
which was 463 West
Street in New York.

00:21:01.492 --> 00:21:03.575
WALTER ISAACSON: Right on
Greenwich Village's side

00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:03.950
of the Hudson.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.720
BOB KAHN: It was right
on the Hudson River,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.553
and you could watch the
Queen Mary and Queen

00:21:07.553 --> 00:21:09.012
Elizabeth coming
in every Tuesday

00:21:09.012 --> 00:21:10.220
and going out every Thursday.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.303
WALTER ISAACSON: It's still
a wonderful warehouse,

00:21:12.303 --> 00:21:14.510
and then they moved
it to New Jersey.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.020
BOB KAHN: Murray Hill existed
at the time that I was there.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.895
I think it probably
didn't when he was there.

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:20.700
WALTER ISAACSON: It
becomes a cauldron

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.810
in which you have information
theorists, quantum theorists,

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:29.375
like Shockley to some extent,
and certainly Bardeen.

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:30.585
VINT CERF: Bardeen for sure.

00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:31.960
WALTER ISAACSON:
Walter Brattain,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.740
who is a great experimentalist,
but also people with grease

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.600
under their fingernails who've
climbed a pole to figure out,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.620
how are we going to amplify
a phone signal between New

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.990
York and San Francisco,
and they collaborate.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.960
They work together.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.530
They have a little
bit of a problem

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.130
once the collaboration was
over, does Shockley get

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.160
to be in the pictures
with Bardeen and Brattain,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.980
and who gets credit and
who gets a Nobel Prize,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.130
but before you fight over Nobel
Prizes, you collaborate well.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.480
Shockley was really
bad at collaboration,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.910
and he got worse, and the
Nobel Prize didn't help.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.930
I'm glad we've not
all won one yet

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.530
because it made him
into a bit of a jerk.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.680
He goes off and he forms
Shockley Semiconductor,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.280
and he gets more and more
uncollaborative with his team,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.630
and more and more
top down dictatorial,

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.330
unlike, say, a
[INAUDIBLE] environment.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.590
VINT CERF: Hiding his research
results from other people.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.740
WALTER ISAACSON: Hiding his
research from his own people,

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.620
making them take
lie detector tests,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.620
worrying who's going
to get the credit.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.270
So obviously, the
great thing about it

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.370
is it disintegrates because
of this, and the people who

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:47.390
fly off from this big bang
are so allergic to Shockley's

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.530
way of doing things that they
move to the other extreme, two

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.930
of the best examples being
Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.610
who form Fairchild
Semiconductor,

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.220
and then eventually form Intel.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.990
VINT CERF: Why was it called
Fairchild Semiconductor?

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.531
WALTER ISAACSON:
Because they did not

00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:04.150
have venture
capitalists back then,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.280
so they wanted to start their
own semiconductor company,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.880
but they couldn't just
go to Sandhill Road

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.140
and tell Kleiner Perkins,
give me an investment.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.535
Arthur Rock was just
starting, and so he

00:23:16.535 --> 00:23:17.700
helped put it together.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.600
Arthur Rock was not yet
a venture capitalist.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.570
He was still a
banker from the east.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.380
So he calls his east coast
buddies-- IBM, Bell-- and says,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.360
do you want a
division we can start

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.950
that will make semiconductors?

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.630
And they'll say, no,
we don't want that.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.239
We don't want an
autonomous division.

00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:36.780
We don't want to
give them the power.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.710
He's just about to
give up and then went

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.950
to Sherman Fairchild, who's a
bit of a nutcase and a playboy

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.490
and always out in
nightclubs and 21 Club.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.950
They make a deal and
Sherman Fairchild says,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.890
yeah, I'll stake you.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.230
I'll make you a Fairchild
Semiconductor division.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.600
They were also doing
cameras and aircraft.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.630
And of course, it becomes
the biggest division

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.510
in the company, and
eventually, Fairchild

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.930
exercises the right to buy
them out, after which Noyce

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.610
and Moore start their
own company, Intel.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.890
VINT CERF: That's amazing.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.940
So this is sort of like one
of those black hole explosion

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.700
things that--

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.825
WALTER ISAACSON: Well, they
call them fairchildren,

00:24:15.825 --> 00:24:18.490
because Fairchild
then breaks up a bit,

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.644
and if you look at Silicon
Valley, you can do a Google map

00:24:21.644 --> 00:24:23.060
and just say
Fairchild, and you'll

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.787
see all the companies
that spun off.

00:24:24.787 --> 00:24:26.370
BOB KAHN: You know,
there are actually

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.490
two parallel stories with
Intel and the work that

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.350
went on before that
are interesting.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.170
You focused on one
of them in the book,

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.310
and I knew two of
those people very well.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.030
I've met Gordon Moore, but
I knew Bob Noyce very well,

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.990
interacted with him a
lot, especially when

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.660
I was doing the DLSI
program at DARPA

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.710
and he was fighting the
VISIC program in the DoD.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.630
And the other was Andy
Grove, who was in my class

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.580
in undergraduate
school, so I knew him.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.330
WALTER ISAACSON:
That's in New York.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.450
BOB KAHN: At City College, yes.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.550
So I knew those two well.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.180
But the other story
that's quite interesting

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.677
is who gets the credit
for the microcomputer.

00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:01.135
WALTER ISAACSON:
The microprocessor

00:25:01.135 --> 00:25:02.520
or microcomputer?

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.390
BOB KAHN: The
microprocessor in this case.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.890
VINT CERF: This is after the
integrated circuit, about which

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:08.840
there was another big argument.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.798
BOB KAHN: That's right.

00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:14.400
This was in the early '70s, when
Intel was trying to figure out

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.200
internally how you connect
one piece to another piece,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.660
and instead of
doing a one of, they

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.650
decided, let's build
a programmable thing.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.330
So you have a guy named
Frederico Faggin, who actually

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.100
did the actual
implementation of it.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.640
You had a guy named Ted Hoff,
who is credited by everybody,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.580
and Bob Noyce told me,
when he was pushing

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.140
some of the nominations
for awards for him,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.960
that he was sort of the
architect of the whole thing.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.700
But you had it all
done in a lab that

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.830
was run by a fellow
named Les Vadez,

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.950
and Les always
claimed that he set

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:51.590
the environment and the tone,
which enabled it all to happen.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.900
Between three of them,
they don't really

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.942
necessarily all see the
development the same way.

00:25:55.942 --> 00:25:57.608
WALTER ISAACSON: You
know, it's a shame,

00:25:57.608 --> 00:25:58.620
and that happens a lot.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.800
And in this book, I'm
already getting emails,

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.720
and you are, too.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.900
I won't name names
because we're online,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.250
but people say, he didn't
quite give me enough-- oh,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.460
actually now I've read it,
he give me enough credit.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.960
The one I love is
Kilby, as you know,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.460
Jack Kilby does it at Texas
Instruments, the microchip.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.580
I'm moving back earlier,
the integrated circuit.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.660
And Noyce does it at
approximately the same time

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.480
and separately.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.924
And Kilby wins the Nobel
Prize, and unlike Shockley, it

00:26:28.924 --> 00:26:29.840
doesn't go to is head.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.380
And he also says, if Bob
Noyce was still alive,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.780
he'd be sharing
this prize with me.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.840
They both deserve it.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.760
They don't give Nobel
Prizes when you're--

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.570
VINT CERF: Kilby didn't get
that award until he was 82,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.750
and he passed away a
couple years later.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.833
WALTER ISAACSON: But when
they finally bring Kilby

00:26:43.833 --> 00:26:47.095
and he's awarded it, the
Norwegian scientist introducing

00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:51.400
him says, everything we have
in the digital revolution

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.110
comes from what you did.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.960
And Kilby says, that reminds
me of what the beaver said

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.110
to the rabbit at the
foot of the Hoover Dam,

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.640
which is, no, I didn't
build it, but it

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.360
is based on an idea of mine.

00:27:08.072 --> 00:27:11.010
One of the things
about collaboration

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.870
is it gets hard to
allocate credit,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:17.140
and I try very hard
in this book to say,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.960
OK, here's how I would parse
the credit for the computer.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.470
I mean, is it basically
Mauchly and Eckert at Penn?

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.760
Is it Atanasoff at Iowa State?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.830
Microchip, transistor?

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.250
We all want to parse out
credit, whether we're

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.390
intellectual property lawyers
fighting over the patents,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.550
whether we're Nobel
Prize jurists,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:47.470
or whether we're biographers,
and I tried to minimize,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.760
and you and I were
talking beforehand.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.750
There's dispute
amongst the people

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.110
who conceived of
packet switching, which

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.440
are three or four
or five people.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.180
They all fight over it.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.290
They're all quoted by name
on the record, will tell you,

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.530
oh, this guy's an idiot.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.170
I try to say, no, it
was the collaboration.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.550
Packet switching
was an amazing idea.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:18.140
It is the heart of,
obviously, what you two did,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.220
and I was slightly
annoyed by the people who

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.220
wanted to disparage
their colleagues'

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.950
contribution because there is
enough credit to go around.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:31.400
VINT CERF: Exactly, and this
emphasizes several things.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.500
The first one is a
lot of stuff happens

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.600
because it's now
possible to happen.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.670
The economics are possible or
the amount of memory available

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:43.270
makes it possible or the speed
of something makes it possible,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.930
and so concurrent
invention is not

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.384
unusual under those
circumstances.

00:28:47.384 --> 00:28:48.800
WALTER ISAACSON:
Especially, there

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.170
was a miracle year
of 1939, let me say,

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.000
where conceptual breakthroughs
have happened, including

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.210
Turing's papers published
on universal computing,

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.570
but Shannon and other
people are starting

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.160
to apply Boolean algebra to
how to do it in circuits.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.020
But you also have mechanical
inventions, including

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.065
the vacuum tube and
telephone switchboards,

00:29:14.065 --> 00:29:16.590
that have come together,
but you also have the drums

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.180
of war, both in Germany
with Herman Zuse,

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.240
and at Bletchley
Park in England,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.510
and at Aberdeen Proving
Ground in the United States.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:30.150
It's dawning on people that
firepower is actually not

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.010
going to be as important as
computing power in winning

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.130
the next war, and
so that's why I'm

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:38.280
convinced that you have a
fertile ground from 1940

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.070
to '45 for the creation
of the computer.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.020
And likewise,
another fertile stew

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.295
happens, which
Google is part of it

00:29:47.295 --> 00:29:50.280
out in California,
Mountain View and all,

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.840
that in the early '70s, there
was just this yeasty brew

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.845
of counterculture types,
electronic geeks, people who

00:29:57.845 --> 00:29:59.470
had been in the
defense industry,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.270
people who had read the Whole
Earth Catalog once too often,

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.000
all of whom are coming
together and want computing

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.760
power to the people to take it
back from the big corporations,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.061
and they're creating the
Altair and the Apple and all

00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:12.685
those machines.

00:30:14.977 --> 00:30:17.310
VINT CERF: I was waiting for
you to leap into something.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.930
BOB KAHN: I have so many
thoughts going through my mind,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.650
I'm not sure where
to jump into this.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.620
One of the questions
I had about the book

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:31.610
was, what prompted you
to choose the things

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.990
that you did to emphasize?

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.620
It's a wonderful read.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.300
WALTER ISAACSON: That's the
toughest of all questions.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.550
BOB KAHN: About the
only complaint I have is

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.440
that you couldn't
touch everything

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.930
with uniform treatment.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.700
So for example, there are things
that don't show up here at all,

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.690
like, for example,
the role that NSF

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.630
played in bringing
the internet out.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.220
There are people who I think
played an important role that

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.714
never get mentioned, like
Steve Wolf is a good example.

00:30:58.714 --> 00:30:59.630
VINT CERF: Absolutely.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:00.630
Gordon Bell.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.180
BOB KAHN: I just wondered,
this is a reflection

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.572
on what you felt you
wanted to write about.

00:31:05.572 --> 00:31:07.530
WALTER ISAACSON: I had
about a 1,000 page book.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.610
BOB KAHN: How did you
get to this rendition?

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.060
WALTER ISAACSON: When
I did all my notes,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.268
there were about 1,000 pages.

00:31:12.268 --> 00:31:14.700
Wolf is in them, and
the other things.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.790
There's a certain limit
in this day and age

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.590
to books, which is
approximately 500 pages.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.910
I mean, that's--

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.701
BOB KAHN: I've read
books bigger than that.

00:31:23.701 --> 00:31:27.800
WALTER ISAACSON: I know,
but I meant-- not many.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.614
BOB KAHN: I read "Godel,
Escher, and Bach" in one swoop.

00:31:30.614 --> 00:31:32.280
WALTER ISAACSON:
That's what, 600 pages?

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.000
Not much more.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.100
BOB KAHN: I think it
was more than that.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.910
WALTER ISAACSON:
That's a good book.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.522
BOB KAHN: One sitting.

00:31:38.522 --> 00:31:40.230
WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah,
but you know what?

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.510
Not everybody can read
"Godel, Escher, and Bach"

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.690
in one sitting.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.202
You're not the best focus group
for the publishing industry.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.520
But I did decide, hey, I want
to keep it in the package,

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.020
and I'm going to
get to why we don't

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.780
need to do that in the future.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.640
So I ended up picking 12.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.530
I just made a list
finally at the end,

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.520
12 major things I wanted to do.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:11.080
I wanted to do the computer,
and so I focused on those three,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.950
and by that, I mean the
people who really began it,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.110
not Control Data Corporation
and others that pick it up.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.371
I wanted to do the transistor,
the microchip, video games,

00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.120
because I actually do
think that they were

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.060
important in the
interactive computing realm.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.800
I wanted to do software
and how original

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.810
operating system
software, and the women

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.460
as well as men who did it.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.339
And I go down the
web and others.

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:37.880
I could have picked
many other things

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.588
and I could have picked
many other people

00:32:39.588 --> 00:32:42.580
in each one of those
categories, but I said, OK,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.010
who made a conceptual leap that
I really feel passionate about?

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.310
Now, I know that leaves
out more than it includes,

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.080
but it makes for a narrative.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.640
The problem with
narrative history

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.840
is narrative is defined by
you leave out a lot of things

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.194
so that you have a thread.

00:32:58.194 --> 00:32:59.860
BOB KAHN: But that's
really interesting,

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.380
because if you focus it
all on the conceptual leap,

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.970
you minimize the contributions
of the people who actually

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.550
then implemented those ideas.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.697
As an engineer, and I think
Vint would agree with this, too,

00:33:12.697 --> 00:33:15.030
a lot of the details are in
making things actually work.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.530
WALTER ISAACSON:
Right, and I really

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.600
try to emphasize in
the book that you

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.100
have to execute on
vision, and that's

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.640
why I focus on the engineers and
the software engineers of ENIAC

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.440
more than on this
conceptual leap

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.830
that Atanasoff has at
Iowa State because he

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.070
doesn't implement it.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.710
And I hope-- I mean,
you can be the judge--

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.250
that with Fairchild
and Intel, we

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.060
get into a lot of the
engineers who are making it.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.300
Let me leap forward
to what I hope

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.280
is the solution to this,
which is I would love it,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.090
and Google is the best
place to invent it

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.346
with Google Docs,
networks, everything else,

00:33:54.346 --> 00:33:54.970
and I've tried.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.969
I've worked with people.

00:33:55.969 --> 00:33:58.030
I'm still not there
yet, but I would

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:04.300
be quite happy to take this
book and make it a curated wiki

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.120
Google Doc, and I have done
that with some of the chapters.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.120
It's why Dan
Bricklin-- you say, why

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.020
is Bricklin in there
for doing VisiCalc?

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.840
Well frankly, because he
gave me all of his documents

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.139
when he read an early draft
and it was on Medium, which

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.690
is like a Google Doc
place where people put in.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.250
I think the book
of the future will

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.969
be a collaborative,
crowd-sourced,

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:33.580
and yet author curated,
meaning you just can't run off

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.330
anywhere, multimedia,
where, let us

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.929
say you want to talk about--
let's pick one thing--

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:46.030
how the planar process worked
and how the planar process led

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.070
to the microprocessor being
easily invented at Intel.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.300
I would love the videos, I'd
love the original documents,

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.140
I'd love people to upload
those things, because online,

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:01.320
on a Google Book, I'll call
it, you couldn't make it

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.410
not 500 pages but
500,000 pages and video.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.410
BOB KAHN: Is that still
your book at that point?

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.785
WALTER ISAACSON:
And that's why I

00:35:08.785 --> 00:35:12.910
would like to curate
it, meaning that you're

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.260
going to have fights.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.710
I won't name names
again, but even

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.660
with your friends who
were originally there

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:24.430
with packet switching, just like
the revision wars in Wikipedia

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.070
fought with more intensity than
we seem to be fighting wars

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.660
in the real world
these days, you

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.700
would have to have some
curator who would say, OK,

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.400
enough of this
fighting about who

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.110
came up with packet switching.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.660
Let's try to just put it
all and synthesize it.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.410
But I suspect, like
Wikipedia, the crowd

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.970
would also curate pretty well.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.150
I also think, and
this is the next thing

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.050
I would love Google to do,
for that to be really fair,

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.510
there has to be
a payment system.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.514
I would be happy to
put this book online--

00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:00.930
I shouldn't say
this too publicly,

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.032
but after "Steve Jobs" I'm not
looking for more book sales.

00:36:04.032 --> 00:36:05.490
VINT CERF: This
only just came out,

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.354
so don't say that to
your publisher yet.

00:36:09.354 --> 00:36:10.520
He'll cancel your book tour.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.650
WALTER ISAACSON: But let us
say that Vint Cerf and Bob

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.530
Kahn looked at this
and said, there

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.260
are 22 things you
really left out

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.460
of the RFC process
and the ARPANET,

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.430
and then the TCP/IP process
we went through in '73,

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.640
I think it was.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.307
And here's all our
documents, and here's

00:36:27.307 --> 00:36:29.140
somebody who should
have gotten more credit,

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.930
here's his picture,
here is an interview

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.110
I've just done with him.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.910
I want to put all that up.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.080
You would be doing that, as you
would be editing a Wikipedia

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.802
entry, just for the
good of the commons,

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:41.260
but there would be
other people who

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.940
might want to contribute
and actually make

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.740
a living out of it.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.830
BOB KAHN: So this would be
like sticky notes on your book?

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.246
WALTER ISAACSON:
Well, it would be

00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:49.640
like making my book
into a Wikipedia page

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.390
where everybody could
put documents up,

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.460
and I would love the
royalties to then

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.650
be allocated in some
crypto currency way

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.360
that Google could invent,
so that if people are paying

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.510
$30 for this book and
they read these parts,

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.350
the royalties get allocated
to whoever contributed.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.402
VINT CERF: So that's
a challenge before us.

00:37:11.402 --> 00:37:13.110
WALTER ISAACSON: And
I hope my next book,

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.410
I'd love to write about Louis
Armstrong, but you need music.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.070
I would need a Wynton
Marsalis to say,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.280
here's the 17-bar cadenza
that opens "West End Blues,"

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.470
and here's how he changed it
from King Oliver's version,

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.360
but that would need to be
crowd-sourced and multimedia,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.580
and I want Google
to invent that.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.305
BOB KAHN: I always thought that
one of the really nice things

00:37:32.305 --> 00:37:36.840
that historians rely on
are crafted treatises

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.850
on various topics.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.130
There's a lady that
Vint and I both know

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.030
who wrote some monographs on
infrastructure development.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.070
She would not write a
single sentence in there

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.380
that she couldn't curate from
some well known historian who

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.460
quoted something
and made a point.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.360
So how do you treat
something like this

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.910
when the only real
authority behind it

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.670
is the party who
put it all together

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.080
and everything else is all
this other stuff that's

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.370
stuck in there?

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.244
WALTER ISAACSON: This
is much more footnoted,

00:38:03.244 --> 00:38:05.530
source noted than, say,
the Steve Jobs book,

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.380
which mainly came from
interviews with Steve

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.430
and 60 or 70 other
people around him.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.024
I am probably not
the best reporter

00:38:14.024 --> 00:38:15.190
in the history of the world.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.280
I just saw Bob Woodward
when I was walking here.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.850
He's much better.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.390
I'm probably not the
best academic historian.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.570
I mean, somebody like you just
talked about who does that.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.667
I do have, I hope--

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:28.250
BOB KAHN: Yeah, but
you write so well.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.708
WALTER ISAACSON:
Thank you so much.

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:32.100
But I also have, I
hope, the ability

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.570
to combine historical resource,
like looking at the monographs

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.000
or whatever, with just being
able to call Gordon Moore

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.315
and saying, I'm going
to get in the car,

00:38:40.315 --> 00:38:41.898
I'm going to drive
to Woodside, you've

00:38:41.898 --> 00:38:43.700
got to spend all
day with me, and I'm

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.430
lucky because I've
been at Time Magazine.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.180
Gordon Moore, who would
not take the phone

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.270
call of my second cousin
from Louisiana if he said,

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:57.220
I want to drive up to Woodside,
I get to see these people.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.530
So I do a lot of interviews.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.090
There are about 100 or so,
including you and others,

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:08.190
in the book, but I also go
back to the papers and the IEEE

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:13.420
and everybody, your
collaborated document

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.360
on the invention of the
internet, a little original Len

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.290
Kleinrock and Paul Baran papers.

00:39:22.286 --> 00:39:23.910
There's no quote in
this book, I think,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.570
or no major quote in this book
or assertion that's not source

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:33.870
cited by name on the
record, but all history

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.000
is just the next
draft of history.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.030
There will be people who
will build upon this.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:42.290
I think I bring some
journalistic skills.

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:45.360
Other people bring better
historical-- Janet Abbate,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.420
others who have done
great academic histories

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.410
of the internet.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.600
And someday, when it's all part
of this curated, crowd-sourced

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.070
system, you'll be able
to hop around and get

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.500
whatever you want.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.470
VINT CERF: So I
have a suggestion.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.300
He was threatening to
turn the tables us,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.985
so maybe we should
do that, and I'd

00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:05.450
like to let everybody else have
some time to ask questions.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.345
BOB KAHN: Are you trying
to filibuster against that?

00:40:07.345 --> 00:40:08.080
WALTER ISAACSON:
No, I'm trying to--

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.790
VINT CERF: I figured
I managed to--

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.230
WALTER ISAACSON: I have spent
30 years as a journalist.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.630
I love asking the questions.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.310
Here I am having the people
who actually invented

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.190
the internet ask me questions.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.190
I'm going, that's wacky.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.570
I should be asking
them questions.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.640
BOB KAHN: Actually,
when you read the book,

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.470
the impression that
it gives, which

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.540
I thought is the one
you were trying to give,

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.410
is that collaboration
is really everything

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.820
and all these people really
created the internet.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.610
WALTER ISAACSON: Right.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:37.010
I really wanted
to, and it is true.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.930
I'm trying to show
collaboration, enough

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:42.586
credit to go around, and it
is true, I sort of think.

00:40:42.586 --> 00:40:44.710
And then afterwards, people
say, you didn't give me

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.950
quite enough credit,
or worse yet, they're

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.440
suing [INAUDIBLE]
over the patents.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.190
But generally, collaboration
is really cool.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.860
And I'll start, there's two
real segments of the internet.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.270
BOB KAHN: So when you
point out Vint and myself,

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.520
what makes you single us out?

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.020
I mean, we could
give you our views,

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.360
but I'm wondering
what your views are.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.943
WALTER ISAACSON: I
will turn it around

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.630
and make you give the views.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.020
I'll say that there's
two great phases

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.710
in the creation of the internet.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.280
Phase one was the
creation of ARPANET.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.024
I think you were
at BBN probably--

00:41:17.024 --> 00:41:18.815
BOB KAHN: I actually
was a system designer.

00:41:18.815 --> 00:41:21.540
WALTER ISAACSON:
Yeah, at BBN, right?

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.380
Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, which
was a private company but still

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.294
very associated with
MIT to some extent.

00:41:27.294 --> 00:41:28.210
BOB KAHN: And Harvard.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.210
WALTER ISAACSON: And
Harvard, and to some extent

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.650
with the government, because
you had from Larry Roberts,

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.170
and I guess the
original Licklider,

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:41.290
you had contracts to do
what was unfortunately

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:46.530
named IMPs, Interface
Message Processors, which--

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:48.210
BOB KAHN: Why is
that unfortunate?

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:52.011
WALTER ISAACSON: Well, because
when BBN got the contract--

00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:53.760
BOB KAHN: I actually
have the little slide

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.930
that Ted Kennedy sent.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.910
WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.650
I'm going to do a Ted
Kennedy joke here,

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.366
which I'll let Dr.
Kahn do the punchline.

00:42:01.366 --> 00:42:02.990
BOB KAHN: I gave it
to Licklider's wife

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.920
at the ceremony.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.670
VINT CERF: Wait, let
him do his punchline.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:06.220
WALTER ISAACSON: They
don't know the joke

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.100
before you do the punch--

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.030
VINT CERF: It's his punchline.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.790
Go ahead.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:09.623
WALTER ISAACSON: No.

00:42:09.623 --> 00:42:11.455
It's the Interface
Message Processor,

00:42:11.455 --> 00:42:16.020
and it's awarded to BBN, which
is in Ted Kennedy's district,

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.030
and he sends a telegram
congratulating you

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.410
on getting the--

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.312
BOB KAHN: Inter-faith
message processor.

00:42:22.312 --> 00:42:23.770
WALTER ISAACSON:
Which, by the way,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:29.800
is a wonderfully telling slip,
because it was inter-faith,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.381
in many ways.

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.880
VINT CERF: Well
actually, he thought

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.610
he was congratulating
them on what

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:35.330
he thought was an
ecumenical effort.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.022
WALTER ISAACSON: It was.

00:42:36.022 --> 00:42:37.550
It was the ultimate
ecumenical effort.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.590
VINT CERF: An inter-faith
message processor,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.310
the Jews and the
Muslims and the--

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.720
WALTER ISAACSON: We basically
call them routers now,

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.920
but these were the machines
that were going to--

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.820
BOB KAHN: Actually, I would say
we call them packet switches

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.319
now.

00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:49.780
WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah, but
these were the machines

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.350
that would be sent to the
original nodes on ARPANET that

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:58.400
would be an inter-faith or
interface between the host

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.360
machine and the
rest of the network.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.687
BOB KAHN: So Vint, you mean
if it wasn't ecumenical,

00:43:02.687 --> 00:43:04.520
we wouldn't have gotten
that thank you note?

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.525
VINT CERF: I don't know.

00:43:05.525 --> 00:43:11.170
It was supposed to be something
that was nondenominational.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:14.020
The whole idea was
it's non-proprietary,

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.720
and it was, from
Kennedy's choice of words,

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.990
nondenominational,
and that's very true.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.220
The IMPs were there,
packet switches,

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.350
to form this uniform,
homogeneous network

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.050
to deal with an extremely
heterogeneous collection

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.420
of computers that
were on the edges.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.480
And that demonstration,
to take your point

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.480
about these two phases
of the whole process.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.480
The first phase demonstrated
that heterogeneous computers

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.610
and operating
systems could be made

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:46.570
to communicate across
a homogeneous network,

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.591
and that was the
beginning of understanding

00:43:48.591 --> 00:43:49.340
what was possible.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.000
WALTER ISAACSON: And it was the
ultimate collaborative process,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.810
which is what I'm
going to ask you about,

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.880
because if somebody had to
say, if you could show me

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.280
the true nature of a
collaborative process-- this is

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.790
early on, before we're
getting to the internet TCP/IP

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:10.440
process-- is, how are these
IMPs going to communicate

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.660
with host computers
and each other?

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.780
And everybody vaguely
expected that, either

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.770
from the bosses of BBN or
the bosses in the Pentagon,

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.240
the word would be sent
down, but instead, it's

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.337
done collaboratively
mainly by graduate student,

00:44:26.337 --> 00:44:27.920
including you were
a graduate student.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.490
BOB KAHN: There are actually
two parts of that process.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:34.340
The one that had the computers
talking to the other computers

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.200
was what led to the
host to host protocols.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.970
That's one Vint was
very involved in,

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.196
along with a number
of other people.

00:44:40.196 --> 00:44:42.820
And the second part that had to
do with how the machines talked

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.850
to these interface message
processors was in a BBN report

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.330
that I authored
called "BBN Report

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:54.070
1822," so that interface was
all called the 1822 interface,

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.760
and that was a combination of
how the hardware would work,

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.360
because you had different
word size machines, how

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.790
the software would
work, and that

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.350
was a precursor to having the
machines talk to each other.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:04.660
WALTER ISAACSON: Right.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.400
And the one I focus
on, because you

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.150
asked, why do you
focus on things,

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:11.460
is the request for
comment process,

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.830
because it was so collaborative
and collegial, even the phrase

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.120
that Steve Crocker, who you
turned me onto and I went

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.500
and interviewed for the book.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.670
He's just a graduate
student with you,

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.230
and instead of having
the graduate student say,

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.550
here's the way we
should do it, he said,

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:30.650
I had to think of
a name that would

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.576
make people feel like they
were collaborators in this.

00:45:33.576 --> 00:45:35.700
And so when we sent them
out, I didn't want to say,

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.200
here's our plan or our proposal.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.780
He was standing in the shower
at his girlfriend's house,

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.940
he said, and it
came to him that he

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.220
should call it a
request for comment

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.210
because it was so open and
inviting, as opposed to, here's

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.617
what you're supposed to do.

00:45:54.617 --> 00:45:56.950
Let me let Vint tell the story
from there, and then Bob,

00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:00.610
but you were in the RFC
process, weren't you?

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.610
VINT CERF: Yes, but to
draw a little bit further

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.690
on what Bob was talking about,
in order to have communication

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.390
at all, you need to have
commonality, and so the 1822

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:14.790
hardware and software
interface between the host that

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.360
were heterogeneous and the
IMPs that were homogeneous

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.770
was the first important
piece of commonality.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:24.100
The next piece of commonality
is that the computers

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.160
at the edges of the net
needed to share something

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.120
in common so they
could communicate

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.590
with each other, packet
formats and protocols,

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.060
handshaking, and so on.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.170
That's what Steve
and I and others

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.805
worked on, the host
to host protocols.

00:46:36.805 --> 00:46:39.580
Steve and I and the
others, Jon Postel,

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.810
were graduate students in Len
Kleinrock's laboratory at UCLA,

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.850
and we kept thinking that
somebody, like Larry Roberts,

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.130
who was in charge of
the project at ARPA,

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.720
would come out and tell us
what we were supposed to do,

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.270
and he didn't.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.160
So we thought, well, we
have to do something.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.790
BOB KAHN: He didn't know.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.180
He was expecting
you to tell him.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.900
VINT CERF: Len didn't
tell us either.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.774
So basically, it's
graduate students who

00:47:03.774 --> 00:47:05.440
are scratching their
heads saying, well,

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.780
we have to do something.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.730
So Steve did a
beautiful job, exactly

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:12.750
as you say, organizing
this group, which

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.570
spanned across a dozen
different universities,

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:20.140
looking at not only how to
get the computers to exchange

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.830
postcards, so to speak, but
also to build on top of that.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.260
So this notion of layering
came out very early

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.240
on in the ARPANET history.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.380
We learned an enormous
amount from that experiment.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.870
Email came along in 1971, two
years after we turned the IMPs

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:43.620
on at UCLA, Santa Barbara,
SRI International, and Utah.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:48.520
BBN, where Bob was still,
was pumping out IMPs,

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.700
and they were popping
up on the network, one

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.920
a month for quite awhile.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:58.580
So we were experiencing utility
from this homogeneous network,

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.340
and got pretty
excited about that.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.540
So that's the first
phase, as you said.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.890
WALTER ISAACSON: And to me--
and tell me if I'm wrong--

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:08.780
but the notion that you all
did this to an RFC process

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.990
I found fascinating
because it almost

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.270
seems like it's ingrained in the
genetic code of the internet,

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:18.410
which is a collaborative
system, built collaboratively.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.186
VINT CERF: This, I think,
is fairly important.

00:48:21.186 --> 00:48:24.150
Bob, I think you've been
very articulate about this.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.460
Not only did we have
a bunch of people

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.670
who shared this
common excitement

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.050
and view that we could
make this stuff work,

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.010
but the institutions
that have been created,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:38.760
arising from the ARPANET project
and the internet project,

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.540
were equally bottom
up and collaborative,

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.560
and this notion of
multi-stakeholder models,

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.050
where all the parties who
have a stake in something

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.080
participate in the
development, whether it's

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.070
the technical development
or development of policy,

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:57.640
infuses all of this
internet environment.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.529
I have to say that
Steve's trailblazing--

00:49:01.529 --> 00:49:02.820
WALTER ISAACSON: Steve Crocker.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.390
VINT CERF: Steve Crocker's
trail blazing-- that's right.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.180
You would think
Jobs, wouldn't you?

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.010
So Steve Crocker's
trail blazing I think

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.990
helped set that tone, and all
the institutions who came out

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.269
after that had a very
similar character.

00:49:15.269 --> 00:49:16.685
BOB KAHN: The
counterpart to that,

00:49:16.685 --> 00:49:21.060
though, is that these computers
were all linked together

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.620
through a single
network called ARPANET,

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.310
and the process by which
the ARPANET was built

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.810
involved DARPA, generally
in the form of Larry

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.460
with a group that
be coordinated with,

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.760
essentially writing
the requirement specs.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.690
Half a second delay across the
net, 1,000 bit packets or less,

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:44.910
and so forth.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.120
But the actual
building of that net

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.510
was much more insular than
any of the other things that

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.010
went on.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:54.820
In fact, there was
almost a desire by BBN

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.535
to keep it that way.

00:49:57.535 --> 00:49:59.410
In addition to playing
a technical role there

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:02.090
that was pretty important,
I was the only one

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:06.010
that was assigned to deal
with the external community.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:06.690
That was my job.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.080
If anybody had a question,
I was the only one

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.484
they knew of
because nobody else,

00:50:11.484 --> 00:50:12.900
they were not
interested in having

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.670
them be deviated from
a very short time frame

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:18.400
to get something done with
questions from the community.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.570
And this BBN Report 1822 was
one of the hardest things

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.990
I ever wrote my life because I
had to make a document that all

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.540
of the sites that
would connect had

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.880
to be able to read
and understand,

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.390
and I have to solve
their problems,

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.250
at the same time
abstracting out everything

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.990
about the net that they
didn't need to know about.

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.290
So it was an intellectual
exercise of the first order

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.150
to actually write that
report in a way that

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.630
didn't get into so much detail.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.170
I get so many questions about,
exactly how does the routing

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:53.280
work, and exactly how
does the buffering work,

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.480
and how does the
[INAUDIBLE] control work?

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.438
WALTER ISAACSON: You just
answered the question

00:50:56.438 --> 00:50:59.410
of why I have to leave
some stuff out, too.

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.510
Whenever you're writing
something like that.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.380
I want to ask you all
a question, before we

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.870
get to the internet TCP/IP,
which is the next step,

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.020
is there's a great
controversy, which I show

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:14.070
both sides of in this book, as
to whether or not the ARPANET,

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:18.970
I'll call it, was designed
with partly surviving

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.050
a nuclear attack in mind.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.050
BOB KAHN: Yeah.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.845
Vint wasn't internal
to DARPA at the time,

00:51:24.845 --> 00:51:27.740
and I wasn't there
when it first started,

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.440
but I read a lot of the
internal documentation on that

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.430
and talked to a
number of people.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.630
There are two or three
points of view on this.

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.825
One is, and you call it out in
your book, Charlie Herzfeld,

00:51:38.825 --> 00:51:43.850
who Taylor likes to talk
about the 10 minute story,

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:45.670
and you clarify
that it was really

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.430
multiple years that [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.180
WALTER ISAACSON: I
hate clarifying stories

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.890
that are so good you
want them to just

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:52.390
be told the way
people like that.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.973
BOB KAHN: That one, and that the
Kleinrock story about sending

00:51:54.973 --> 00:51:57.940
the L and the O. That was years
before we had the protocols,

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.090
years before we had email
systems and the like,

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.590
but they're nice stories.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:08.050
When it comes to the
actual implementation, what

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:11.650
was motivating the
folks in the office

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.450
was the economics of sharing
computer resources that

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:17.520
were very expensive.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.600
I can recall Harvard
got a big disk.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.380
At the time, it was
probably $1 million,

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.250
and so some other university
like Carnegie Mellon said,

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.190
we need one, too.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:31.410
Well, why spend another
$1 million on Carnegie

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.720
when they could share the one at
Harvard, save DARPA some money?

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:40.710
Part of it was the economics,
but if you actually

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.890
look at the
documentation, it talks

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.870
about needing to build this net
to facilitate computer resource

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.380
sharing, so there were some
interesting technical problems.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.010
It points out that
the network itself

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:56.240
could have a big effect
on communications.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.890
But this was at
the office level,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.960
so there was nothing that
pervaded the office activities

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.190
that had anything to do with
nuclear survivability or any

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:06.890
of the military aspects.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:11.860
What Steve Lukasik wrote about,
and he's written very clearly

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.760
about this over the years, was
that at his level and above,

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.560
the reason they thought this
was a good investment for DARPA

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.990
to do is because it could
have all of this impact.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.948
VINT CERF: Distributed.

00:53:22.948 --> 00:53:24.710
There's no central
hub to the internet.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.840
BOB KAHN: It could be
reliable communications.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.420
VINT CERF: And it will route
around any Soviet attack.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.680
BOB KAHN: It could be a
better solution for command

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.980
and control and so forth.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.720
So to say that that wasn't
there because the office didn't

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.675
see it would be denying
what was going on elsewhere.

00:53:39.675 --> 00:53:41.050
VINT CERF: If I
may read, there's

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.175
a very funny exchange
in here about that.

00:53:43.175 --> 00:53:43.675
Go ahead.

00:53:43.675 --> 00:53:45.240
WALTER ISAACSON: This is the one
I think you're talking about,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.540
which is when Lukasik,
who said, hey,

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:49.554
we were doing it to
survive a nuclear attack.

00:53:49.554 --> 00:53:51.470
You down at the office
level didn't know that,

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.830
but that's why we were funding
it, and Crocker says, no,

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.840
you weren't.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.252
So anyway, I interviewed
them both, and--

00:53:57.252 --> 00:53:58.210
BOB KAHN: Yeah, I know.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.251
Crocker changed his mind.

00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:01.566
WALTER ISAACSON: And
Lukasik says, "I was on top

00:54:01.566 --> 00:54:02.940
and you were on
the bottom," this

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.390
is what he says
to Steve Crocker,

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.720
"so you really had no
idea of what was going on

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.500
and why we were doing it."

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.040
To which, when I
told Crocker this,

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.420
Crocker responded, "I was on the
bottom and you were on the top,

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.110
so you had no idea what
was really going on."

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:22.660
That's the way life is sometimes
in a collaborative process.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.910
VINT CERF: I get to add
one little codicil to this

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.850
because the original
work that Paul Baran did

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:32.560
on survivable networks,
the 11 volume series

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.960
called "On Distributed
Communication,"

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.880
was all about building a
survivable command and control

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.690
network.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.332
It was digital in nature but
it was caring digital voice.

00:54:41.332 --> 00:54:42.040
Think about this.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.230
He's doing this
around 1960 before we

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.030
have integrated circuits
or anything else.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.810
So he's looking at survivable
command and control,

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:53.730
then along comes this ARPANET
thing and for many of us,

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.080
it was a resource
sharing project.

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.640
Then internet comes
along, we come to that,

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.610
and I remember thinking,
when it was my responsibility

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.175
to manage the program, that
we should actually demonstrate

00:55:05.175 --> 00:55:08.610
that the TCP/IP protocols
would in fact allow

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.670
you to survive a nuclear attack.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:13.470
So although I may be
jumping ahead a little bit,

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.980
towards the end of
my tenure at DARPA,

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.620
we actually put packet radios
in the strategic aircraft

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.150
and flew them around and
artificially disabled

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:24.480
the ARPANET, broke
it up into pieces

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.340
and reassembled it using
packet radios in the air

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.780
and on the ground using
TCP/IP, to demonstrate

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.280
that you could actually
make a survival network.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.240
WALTER ISAACSON: And
since women programmers

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.750
don't often get
their due in history,

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.260
you had a great
woman, Perlman right?

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.200
VINT CERF: Radia Perlman
did a fabulous job

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.040
of designing the routing
system that would recover,

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.916
by figuring out what
the broken segments were

00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:47.373
and how to glue
them back together.

00:55:47.373 --> 00:55:48.420
She did a beautiful job.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.630
WALTER ISAACSON: Let me,
Bob, if I may, leap to I

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:55.560
think what would be spring of
1973, if I remember correctly.

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.380
What you have is
ARPANET, and as you say,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.140
I don't do enough
with the NSF net,

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.220
and there are other nets,
and ALOHAnet, and all--

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.030
VINT CERF: Of course,
they don't exist yet.

00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:04.470
BOB KAHN: I want to
stipulate for the record,

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.300
I didn't think you
could cover everything.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.880
I was just asking why
you picked what you did.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.750
WALTER ISAACSON: But
anyway, all of a sudden,

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.630
there are a whole lot of
packet switch networks,

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:14.400
but they don't
talk to each other.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.780
VINT CERF: There were only four.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.250
WALTER ISAACSON: Only four.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.750
ALOHAnet--

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.560
VINT CERF: At that
point, you had ALOHA,

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.740
you had packet radio,
you had packet satellite,

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.170
and you had ehternet.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.920
WALTER ISAACSON: And
then you had ARPANET.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.300
VINT CERF: And you had
ARPANET, so there's five.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.510
BOB KAHN: You're going at
the story from the back end.

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.310
I would like to tell
it from the front end.

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:34.143
WALTER ISAACSON: Tell
it from the front end.

00:56:34.143 --> 00:56:35.960
BOB KAHN: The front
end was we had

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.880
the ARPANET was DARPA
had commissioned that.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.160
We built it.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.590
I then go to DARPA
and I show up there

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:47.120
in roughly the end
of October of 1972,

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.910
and I go there to
start a program

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:53.900
that automated manufacturing,
which the Congress later kills.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.190
VINT CERF: They're back
at it again, though.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:57.524
I mean, automated manufacturing.

00:56:57.524 --> 00:56:59.065
WALTER ISAACSON: Or
killing programs.

00:56:59.065 --> 00:57:01.840
VINT CERF: Have you seen how
the Tesla-- anyway, go ahead.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.440
BOB KAHN: So when
they kill the program,

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:08.280
I'm thinking, all right,
what I signed up for here,

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.960
I'm going to go back to
MIT, where I had a standing

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.590
offer to go join
the faculty again

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:15.010
because I had started my
career out there after getting

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:17.910
a doctorate from
Princeton and before going

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.360
to BBN on a leave of absence.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.210
So I was thinking.

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:26.070
Larry Roberts, who's running the
office, persuades me, stay on.

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:30.820
You've been so involved in
networking, don't do that.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.140
So I agree to give it a shot,
but only if I can have nothing

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.952
to do with the ARPANET
because I did that before.

00:57:36.952 --> 00:57:38.160
I wanted to do something new.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.700
VINT CERF: Well, you would
have been constrained,

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.140
in some sense, because
you were at BBN

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.720
and they were
still a contractor,

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.856
and you can't manage
them as a program manager

00:57:46.856 --> 00:57:48.720
after having been at BBN--

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.250
BOB KAHN: This was before we
had conflict of interest rules.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.742
I mean, I got my own ability
to manage conflict, so not

00:57:55.742 --> 00:57:56.450
a problem for me.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:57.230
VINT CERF: No
conflict, no interest.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:58.740
BOB KAHN: Not a problem for me.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.850
But I finally said, all
right, I'll give it a shot.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:07.050
I started the packet radio
program after I got to DARPA,

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:10.070
and I started the packet
satellite program as a program.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.490
Now, let me just say,
Larry had started

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:17.250
to fund BBN to turn a
satellite IMP into one that

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:20.620
could use a satellite
as a modem relay.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.550
And one of the issues that
I had to deal with was, was

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:25.550
that a good idea or not?

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:26.700
I thought, no, it wasn't.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.330
Let's make the satellite
net a separate net

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.490
by splitting it
out, and this was

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:35.030
an interesting technical
discussion we had with BBN,

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:39.300
because they were of the opinion
that this would be much more

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.130
reliable if everything
was in an IMP,

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:45.610
but that meant you could never
do the equivalent of putting

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:46.740
a router in between it.

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.865
You'd just lose complete
control because everything

00:58:48.865 --> 00:58:50.850
was memory to memory transfers.

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.120
So we ended up
building a separate net

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.100
on a satellite net.

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.600
When Larry funded them, there
were no domestic satellites

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.220
at all.

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.290
There was no plan to use
a satellite anywhere.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:04.210
And so I ended up
negotiating with COMSAT,

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:07.280
and then an Intel sat
to actually set up

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.590
tariffs that would
enable this to happen,

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.460
and then we set up the program.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.740
The one who ran that program
technically was a fellow

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:19.450
named Irwin Jacobs, who later
became the founder of Qualcom.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:22.590
I was sort of chief architect of
the packet radio program, which

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:24.950
became essentially the
forerunner of today's CVMA

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:25.670
technology.

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:27.711
WALTER ISAACSON: The point
is that you have these

00:59:27.711 --> 00:59:30.176
all of these networks and
they don't interconnect.

00:59:30.176 --> 00:59:31.800
BOB KAHN: These three
networks show up,

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.017
and that was what motivated
me to work on the problem

00:59:35.017 --> 00:59:37.350
of inter-networking them, and
I had some architectural--

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:39.250
WALTER ISAACSON: Let me pause
right there because when I

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:41.141
heard the word
"inter-networking," I said,

00:59:41.141 --> 00:59:41.640
I get it.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.280
That's where
internet comes from.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:42.863
Is that right?

00:59:42.863 --> 00:59:44.570
BOB KAHN: That's
where it came from.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:47.270
And so I had that as a goal.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.960
I had some architectural
principles.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.500
We knew about putting-- we
didn't call them routers then,

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.440
we called them gateways.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.789
But I came from a
communications background,

00:59:57.789 --> 01:00:00.080
and so I was very comfortable
with building things that

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.040
could move the bits around,
but I was less comfortable

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.190
what the computers would do
with them when they got that.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.490
And Vint and I had
collaborated a lot

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:13.120
on the ARPANET side of things,
me on the communications part,

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.010
him on the computing part.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.830
He knew more about how
you embed these protocols

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:20.374
into the end computers.

01:00:20.374 --> 01:00:22.040
I approached them at
one point and said,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.670
look, here's what
I'm trying to do

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:25.420
and here's a whole
architectural approach.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.330
Here's what I really don't know.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.210
I don't know about
what it will take

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.690
in these different machines.

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.750
We agreed to collaborate, and
based on that collaboration,

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.251
I think both parts of
it came out better.

01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:39.250
We were able to improve
the communications part,

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:43.310
we were able to
improve the end part.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.230
I've had many collaborations,
but the one with Vint

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.162
was probably one of
the best, and we've

01:00:48.162 --> 01:00:50.120
stayed pretty good friends
over the whole time.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120
VINT CERF: In spite of that.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.540
BOB KAHN: In spite
of everything, right.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.480
WALTER ISAACSON:
That really does

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.917
show that this
was a partnership,

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:55.875
this was collaboration.

01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:57.630
BOB KAHN: Bit that's
where it came from.

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:02.560
It came from the need to connect
all these different nets.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.810
WALTER ISAACSON: So explain how
you turned that into TCP/IP.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:10.950
BOB KAHN: Well, we
did it together.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.640
VINT CERF: He and I
spent six months trying

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.370
to sort all this out, and
eventually, this notion

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.962
of gateway-- the system sort
of emerged out of requirements.

01:01:20.962 --> 01:01:22.420
You have a bunch
of networks and we

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.114
weren't allowed to
change any of them,

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:25.530
and the question
is, well, if they

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.370
can't know that they're part
of a distributed system,

01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:29.676
how do we link them together?

01:01:29.676 --> 01:01:31.300
The conclusion was
you needed something

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.070
in between that knew how
to talk to both networks

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.380
and would glue them
together even though they

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.000
didn't know they were connected.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.367
Then the other problem is
that the hosts at the edges

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:42.450
needed to be able to say
something like, send this

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:45.150
to another network, but there
was no language for that

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.650
because--

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.370
WALTER ISAACSON: It was
like putting a postcard

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.424
in another envelope?

01:01:47.424 --> 01:01:48.840
VINT CERF: Well,
the first problem

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.430
is language because the
network that you were connected

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:57.990
to locally had no vocabulary
for even understanding,

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:00.260
take this thing and send
it to some other net.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.030
Every net thought it was
the only net in the world.

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.863
BOB KAHN: I have to
tell you what addressing

01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:05.950
was like in the ARPANET,
16-bit addresses.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:08.220
When you sent something,
you said, essentially,

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.000
send it to this wire.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.810
Imagine that every wire are
on the network was numbered.

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:15.490
So you say, send
this to wire 17,

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.920
and what was supposed to
be attached to wire 17

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.490
was a big computer, so that
worked fine on the ARPANET.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:24.670
But if wire 17 then went
to some other net, which

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:27.500
had a whole bunch of computers,
which of those computers

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.230
was it for?

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.730
There was no way that
language could describe it.

01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.090
VINT CERF: You
couldn't say that,

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.494
so we had to invent the
internet protocol addressing.

01:02:32.494 --> 01:02:34.410
BOB KAHN: That's where
IP addresses came from.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:37.940
VINT CERF: And then we realized
that, in addition to that,

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.910
of course, we had to make sure
that all the data that we sent

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:42.700
in these little
postcard size pieces

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.637
would be received and
reassembled at the other end,

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.220
and we knew that
some of the networks,

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.334
like the packet radio net and
the ethernet, would be lossy.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.750
There would be
radio shadow, there

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.620
would be jamming and
all kinds of things,

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.000
so we had to, on an
end to end basis,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.009
make sure that the
communication was reliable.

01:02:58.009 --> 01:03:00.550
WALTER ISAACSON: So how did you
do that with the transmission

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:01.510
control protocol?

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:02.770
VINT CERF: Transmission
control protocol.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.490
Actually, the first papers that
we wrote had only one protocol.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:08.220
It was called TCP,
and it did everything.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.507
BOB KAHN: It had IP
integrated inside.

01:03:12.507 --> 01:03:14.340
VINT CERF: It solved
the addressing problem.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.600
It solved the end to end
retransmission and filtering

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.300
out of duplicates, flow
control, and reordering,

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.480
and everything was all
part of the one protocol.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.670
But after a few iterations,
finding some bugs

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:29.140
in the design, several people
beat us over the head and said,

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.310
we really need a way of
delivering things really,

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.520
really quickly even if
not everything gets there.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.840
So we split the
internet protocol out

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.440
from the TCP part, the
end to end reliable part,

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.250
and then created something
called User Datagram Protocol

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.596
so we could handle
real time traffic.

01:03:44.596 --> 01:03:46.720
WALTER ISAACSON: Let me
ask you a question I didn't

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.300
ask for the book, which is,
if you had to do it all over

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.770
again knowing what you
know now, what would you

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.292
have designed differently?

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:57.500
BOB KAHN: I would have
started with the digital logic

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.750
architecture that I've been
working on for the last 20

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:03.810
years, but that's not fair
because it's like saying,

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:07.040
how would radio
communications in this country

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.120
have evolved if
the semiconductor

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.494
chip was available in 1915?

01:04:11.494 --> 01:04:13.410
You can't run that
Gedankenexperiment anymore.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.180
VINT CERF: But there
are things that I

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.500
wish that we could have
done that we didn't,

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:24.700
like I wish that we had picked
128-bit address space instead

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.954
of a 32-bit address space.

01:04:25.954 --> 01:04:27.620
We wouldn't have to
go through this pain

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.320
of the IPv6 transition.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.755
BOB KAHN: What makes you
think 128 bits is enough?

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:34.130
VINT CERF: Well,
it might not be,

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:35.921
but it'll be enough
until after we're dead.

01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:38.260
Then it doesn't matter.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.260
WALTER ISAACSON: Let me
talk about more consumer

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.730
friendly things, rather than
addressable space, which

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:49.100
is things like, is there
too much anonymity built

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:49.850
into the internet?

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:52.380
Would we be better off if
people were a little bit more

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.810
responsible for
what they put up?

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:59.020
BOB KAHN: I think that
identity in the internet

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.790
is really important.

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:02.830
I would like to see
us come to the point

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:06.650
where everybody has unique and
persistent identifiers that

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.277
resolve to reasonable state
information about them,

01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:10.860
and they can have
multiple identities,

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.526
depending on the role
they want to play.

01:05:12.526 --> 01:05:15.730
And one of those roles we must
absolutely support, I think,

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:17.105
is the role of anonymous.

01:05:17.105 --> 01:05:19.480
WALTER ISAACSON: So you'd have
an anonymous, pseudonymous

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.012
thing.

01:05:21.012 --> 01:05:23.220
BOB KAHN: You can decide
how you want to participate.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.830
If I want to participate
as a government employee,

01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:28.330
I'm probably going to give a
government employee identifier.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:33.030
If I'm going to participate as
a representative of my company,

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.230
that's a different one.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.750
And then maybe the services
and the opportunities you get

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.834
are determined by how
definitive your identity is.

01:05:41.834 --> 01:05:43.333
WALTER ISAACSON:
But in other words,

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:46.200
you could create an internet
in which there's secure ID,

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.720
and when I'm dealing
with my bank,

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.334
I would have to use
that identity when

01:05:51.334 --> 01:05:52.250
I'm dealing with them.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:54.910
BOB KAHN: Well, if this
were back in 1972 and Vint

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.820
and I were doing it, I would
say, yes, we could do that.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.320
Today, I don't think
anybody can do that anymore

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.830
because there's so many places
and parties around the globe.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:04.890
We can work toward it.

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:07.630
VINT CERF: I actually think
it's possible to do some things,

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.760
to create strongly
authenticated identities,

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.450
and also to achieve
some anonymity,

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.867
but we're running out
of time, it turns out.

01:06:16.867 --> 01:06:18.450
BOB KAHN: But Vint,
I agree with that.

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:21.550
I was harping on his
question about you.

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.470
You could do it.

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.511
VINT CERF: We've got to
let these other folks ask

01:06:24.511 --> 01:06:25.184
questions, too.

01:06:25.184 --> 01:06:26.850
WALTER ISAACSON:
Having three moderators

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.510
is always hard, right?

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:31.110
VINT CERF: So I've
got one question.

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.365
Patrice?

01:06:32.365 --> 01:06:34.380
And then anybody else,
get your hands up.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:39.830
BOB KAHN: This is also my wife.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.840
I saw her come in.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.950
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to throw a softball.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.710
I've been sitting here looking
at your title, "Innovators."

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:50.930
I started life out years
ago as a copyright attorney.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:54.060
I'm very much interested
in the creative process,

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.285
and I've heard a lot
tonight about collaboration

01:06:56.285 --> 01:07:00.700
as if the spark of innovation
doesn't quite matter anymore,

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.430
that it's some kind of muddled
group, they get together,

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:05.290
and they come up with the idea.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:10.180
Now, I've worked with Bob
and Vint over the years,

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.350
and I was listening
tonight to their discussion

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:15.735
of the early days, which
that's an interesting story,

01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:19.450
but they each brought
their own innovation to it

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:23.269
so you could have a finer
level of granularity.

01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:25.060
So you can have a
collaboration, but if you

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.840
have a bunch of dullards and
one really bright card, then

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.434
the collaboration really
is a useless concept.

01:07:32.434 --> 01:07:34.100
You have to look at
the innovation, what

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.280
is the creative force?

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.140
I'm trying to nuance
a bit because I

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.580
heard the drumbeat of
collaboration a bit much.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.860
WALTER ISAACSON: That's why
it's a long book in a way

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.590
because a lot of
collaborative teams

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:46.270
don't work particularly well.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.590
I loved both the RFC
process, and then

01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:52.790
what you all talk about, about
the TCP/IP process, which

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:54.880
is two people each
bringing, you're

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.930
slightly more of a
communications mindset,

01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:00.790
whatever, but it ends up
being a collaboration where

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.060
innovation really happens.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.970
Now, by the way, that
happens with Steve Jobs

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:05.880
and Steve Wozniak.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.880
They are bringing different
things to the party.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.340
It certainly happened with
Andy Grove and Bob Noyce.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:15.590
One's a congregationalist who
loves singing madrigal songs

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:17.600
in a congregational
church, and the other

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:23.310
had to swim to escape the
Nazis and the Communists.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:25.859
I even tried to do that
with Benjamin Franklin,

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:28.450
because he was not the
smartest of the founders--

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:31.420
I mean, Jefferson,
Madison, and all--

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.840
but he was the one who was the
glue who could bring together

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.010
a Washington who's
indispensable,

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:41.350
passionate people like
John and Sam Adams,

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.369
smart people like
Madison and Jefferson.

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:47.430
It's almost like
a baseball team.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.420
You need a pitcher, a
catcher, you need the manager,

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.660
you also need
utility infielders.

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.939
What makes for a collaboration
that has both a visionary

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:57.180
but also executors?

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:59.590
BOB KAHN: Walter, who was
the smartest of the founders?

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:01.465
WALTER ISAACSON: The
smartest of the founders

01:09:01.465 --> 01:09:03.970
may have in-- I don't know.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:05.899
It's a good question,
and "smart" means

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.109
many different things.

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.676
I think Franklin
was really smart

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:10.800
because he knew how to
bring smart people together,

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.509
which is a skill.

01:09:11.509 --> 01:09:12.966
VINT CERF: Yeah,
but he was a twit.

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:15.450
WALTER ISAACSON: I think Madison
was intellectually-- what?

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:16.000
VINT CERF: He was a twit.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:16.999
WALTER ISAACSON: A twit?

01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:17.620
Franklin?

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.703
VINT CERF: Yeah, Franklin.

01:09:18.703 --> 01:09:21.254
Well, I read your book.

01:09:21.254 --> 01:09:23.000
You spelled it out.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.670
WALTER ISAACSON: John Adams
was a twit, not Franklin.

01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:32.460
I think Madison was the
most creative mind there.

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.438
Obviously, Jefferson
is very fertile mind,

01:09:34.438 --> 01:09:36.729
but we don't have to get into
a debate on the founders,

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:39.950
as much as I have my
problems with Jefferson that

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.410
go to the limits
of intelligence.

01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:44.560
VINT CERF: Let's let the
audience ask questions.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.011
WALTER ISAACSON: Susan?

01:09:45.011 --> 01:09:45.913
AUDIENCE: No, no.

01:09:45.913 --> 01:09:46.819
Who else has a question here?

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:47.600
WALTER ISAACSON:
You're the moderator.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.260
I shouldn't be able
to pick out people.

01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:52.960
AUDIENCE: I'm Alex Howard.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.650
I've enjoyed reading your books,
following along, and using

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:58.670
the internet for some time.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:02.200
I couldn't help noticing as I
opened this up that you have

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.910
Ken Kesey in there, and
Stewart Brand, who you mention.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.100
If you look at the
people in this book,

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:14.540
it's an American and British
story in a lot of ways.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.470
Since we're in DC and people
think about public policy

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:21.880
here a lot, how you create
the conditions for innovation,

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.265
if you look at that story,
how do you do that now,

01:10:25.265 --> 01:10:28.610
as people are thinking about
national competitiveness,

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.020
about education,
about being inclusive,

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.640
because STEM is a big issue?

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.280
The impact of you
writing about this

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:38.160
has caused quite a stir, too,
to recall the limit of ENIAC.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:43.060
It's important that the
original computers were women.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.200
When you think about the
conditions for innovation,

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.940
what have you learned from
that, and what have you

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.180
all seen, too, in terms of
the things being focused on?

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.599
BOB KAHN: This is not a
question about genetics, right?

01:10:50.599 --> 01:10:51.640
AUDIENCE: Absolutely not.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.359
No, it's a condition about how
we create the next big thing.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.900
WALTER ISAACSON:
But it is a question

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.400
about the primordial stew
from which the DNA emerges.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.050
VINT CERF: So at Google, I think
the most important ingredient

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.840
for innovation is
permission to fail

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.120
and the willingness to
let you try crazy ideas.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.860
The founders are
willfully determined

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:15.346
that we will push the envelope.

01:11:15.346 --> 01:11:16.970
That's why we have
a Google X and we've

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:19.220
got a moonshot
experiments and things

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.290
that, like self driving cars.

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:26.600
I think this attitude also
shows up in the Silicon Valley,

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.440
where venture capital is
willing to accept risk.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.550
They know that maybe only 10%
of the things they invest in

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:34.370
will actually work out.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.050
I don't think it's a
peculiarly American attitude,

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.930
but it is an American
attitude, and I

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:44.600
don't think we've lost that.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.084
I think we still have
it and we should use it.

01:11:47.084 --> 01:11:49.500
BOB KAHN: And that's also true
in DARPA to a large extent.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.583
VINT CERF: Oh, absolutely.

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:53.820
BOB KAHN: They shoot high
and are willing to fail,

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.310
even though they don't fail
too often because they often

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.860
don't shoot as high as they
start out shooting for.

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.360
WALTER ISAACSON:
I'd like to ask you

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.720
a question on that, which is--

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.700
VINT CERF: They're supposed
to be asking questions.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.090
WALTER ISAACSON: Oh, sorry.

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:05.730
BOB KAHN: A lot of
success stories.

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:08.021
WALTER ISAACSON: Well, I'll
just make a quick statement

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:10.330
that I think we have blown
it a bit in government

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:13.870
because it used to be you
were allowed to fail, and now

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.000
any little gaffe you
make in this day and age,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.660
you'll never get confirmed,
you'll get run out of town.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.250
In Silicon Valley, at least,
or in other innovative places,

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:23.270
you're allowed to fail.

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:25.370
I have Ken Kesey in
the book because it

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:28.180
was a rebellious
attitude that happens

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.740
in the late '60s and early '70s
in the Bay Area that involves

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.490
"The Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test"

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:36.940
and Stewart Brand, and also
Doug Engelbart, as you know,

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.500
with the mother of all demos.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.920
It's almost like one of the
electric Kool-Aid acid tests.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.770
It has Brand as the impresario.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:47.620
So part of that
cultural stew was

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:52.040
the rebellious counterculture,
anti-war, anti-authoritarian,

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.740
hippie, acid test mentality
that has been written about

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.780
by Fred Turner very well,
by Steve Levy, John Markoff.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.600
Many people have written
about that hacker mentality,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.030
and it ties into the rebellious
as it allows you to fail.

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:12.020
VINT CERF: Let's get
two or three questions

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.330
asked, and then
we'll try to respond

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:15.964
to them as a way
of getting more.

01:13:15.964 --> 01:13:16.880
Let's start over here.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jim.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.010
On the theme of collaboration,
with the internet

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:24.900
hopefully going to be accessible
by the next four billion people

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.390
on the earth's surface and
more than half the population,

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:31.010
in terms of the global
innovator community

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:34.330
and people's ability to
solve their own problems,

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:37.000
what would you like the internet
to help do in the future

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.810
to solve global problems, to
connect people to collaborate

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:42.452
on problems that seemingly
are insurmountable?

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:43.910
VINT CERF: So global
collaboration,

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:44.951
what can the internet do?

01:13:44.951 --> 01:13:46.890
Let's get a couple more.

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:55.870
AUDIENCE: I really love "Steve
Jobs," the book, rather,

01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:59.150
and I'd like to ask
Mr. Isaacson, what

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:01.030
are your impressions
of innovation

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.180
at Apple after the
passing of Mr. Jobs,

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:05.210
because it seems to
highlight that tension

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:08.020
between a strong singular
visionary and then

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.412
a collaborative team?

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:11.120
I think there is a
storyline that there's

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.187
been some drift since
you lost that visionary.

01:14:14.187 --> 01:14:14.770
VINT CERF: OK.

01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:16.140
So we've got
collaboration at Apple

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.264
and we have global
collaboration over the internet.

01:14:18.264 --> 01:14:19.660
One more if there are?

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.574
If not, we'll try
to tackle those two.

01:14:22.574 --> 01:14:23.490
There's one more here.

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:28.060
AUDIENCE: So Mr.
Isaacson, how did you

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.520
pick who the four people were
going to be on your book cover?

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.020
VINT CERF: All right.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.410
AUDIENCE: I appreciate that
there's a woman up there.

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:39.910
VINT CERF: I'm
pretty sure we're not

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.560
going to be able to integrate
one answer to all that.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.350
Let's start with the
last one, book cover.

01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.936
How did you do that?

01:14:45.936 --> 01:14:47.310
WALTER ISAACSON:
Boy, it was very

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:48.434
hard to do this book cover.

01:14:48.434 --> 01:14:50.190
I'm used to writing biographies.

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:53.590
The Steve Jobs cover was
probably the most iconic cover,

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.850
Steve Jobs and a picture,
so that's the easiest one.

01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:01.600
When you're doing something that
involves, say, 12 grand steps

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.900
and 30, 40 innovators,
how do you pick them?

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.720
In the end, it's Alan
Turing, if you're wondering,

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.010
who's on the bottom right.

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:14.207
You know the others,
Ada Lovelace.

01:15:14.207 --> 01:15:15.790
VINT CERF: They're
there the bookends,

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.670
in some sense, and
then the rich guys.

01:15:21.324 --> 01:15:23.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that's what I saw.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:27.000
WALTER ISAACSON: I think
that Steve Jobs and Bill

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.110
Gates are very
emblematic characters

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.510
of how you both have vision.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:37.450
Also, you execute, and business
execution is part of it,

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.200
and collaboration.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.730
If I'd had 10 people,
I could have put 10.

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:48.380
It was not a particularly
easy cover to do.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.970
If you go back and you
can find, Google things

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:53.890
that are cached
from earlier times

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.800
on Amazon, there's
probably eight

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.509
covers that they went through
before they got to this one.

01:15:58.509 --> 01:16:00.050
VINT CERF: Actually,
maybe you should

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.051
consider publishing a
book with multiple covers.

01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:02.966
WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah.

01:16:02.966 --> 01:16:04.470
At Time Magazine,
I used to do that.

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:07.220
It was a real gimmicky, but
especially every now and then,

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.260
you'd have four covers
for four different--

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.590
VINT CERF: If collaboration
was the intent,

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:14.690
I don't see collaborators
on the cover at all.

01:16:14.690 --> 01:16:16.680
Anyway, just a gripe.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.680
WALTER ISAACSON: Turing.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.763
Turing was a collaborator.

01:16:18.763 --> 01:16:19.810
VINT CERF: Well, mumble.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.882
OK, so let's go back to
this collaboration question.

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:25.090
You've got this question,
how do you use the internet

01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:26.341
to help solve global problems?

01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:28.090
BOB KAHN: You want me
to take that one on?

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:28.990
VINT CERF: Go ahead.

01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:31.460
BOB KAHN: I would
let's say you're

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.740
thinking of the
internet writ large now.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:36.080
When I think of the
internet, I think about it

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.654
in terms of the protocols
and the procedures

01:16:38.654 --> 01:16:39.820
that let you connect things.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.610
That gets back to the
definition of what it is,

01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:45.070
and then you can use it
for different things.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:47.545
So it really gets
into how people

01:16:47.545 --> 01:16:49.170
are going to get
together to solve some

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.780
of these global
problems and what role

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:52.240
the internet can play in it.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.580
You asked the question
the other way around,

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.996
what can the
internet do for that,

01:16:54.996 --> 01:16:57.160
and I would say that's the
wrong way to get at it.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.941
The question is,
what global problem

01:16:58.941 --> 01:16:59.940
are you trying to solve?

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.170
Is it clean water in
parts of the world that

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.600
don't have access
to clean water?

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.200
Is it how to get rid
of Ebola viruses?

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.292
Is it how to do
checkout of people

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:10.750
in airports when
they're coming in?

01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:13.260
Is it how to deal
with better targeting

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.780
in the field for the military?

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.350
You can figure out what
problem you're concerned about

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.308
and then you can figure
out what a solution is,

01:17:19.308 --> 01:17:22.710
and then you can ask, is
these an internet role

01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:23.710
in all of that?

01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:27.110
And most likely, there will be
because everything is disparate

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.270
and disconnected and you've
got to bring them all together.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:32.290
I wouldn't phrase
it exactly the way

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:34.130
you did, starting
by asking about what

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:35.450
the internet can do for you.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.854
It's the Kennedy
thing flipped around.

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:40.020
VINT CERF: Ask not what the
internet can do for you.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.800
Ask what you can do
for the internet.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.850
I actually want to draw
out of this another notion,

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:50.170
and that's the notion of
an enabling technology,

01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.040
because if you look
at these stories,

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.430
all of them, what you see
is this scheme of things

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:58.610
linking the stories together.

01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:01.050
Somebody creates
something, which

01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:05.330
enables someone else
to do another thing.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:08.270
This whole story is
all about enabling,

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:11.920
which I think is part of
the origin of your question.

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.260
What could the internet enable?

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.430
The thing it does
better anything

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.720
is it connects
stuff together that

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.590
was never connected before.

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:25.460
This casual idea that I can take
this can of Coke, for example,

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.740
or this book, put a chip in it,
and connect it to the internet

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:33.240
somehow is the
beginning of ideas

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.470
that people never
thought of before

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.570
because it wasn't possible.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:38.320
Now it's possible.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.480
BOB KAHN: Maybe you
don't connect it to it.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.220
Maybe it's automatically part
of it when you put the chip in.

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.670
VINT CERF: Well, if we
ever get to the point

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:47.890
where we can have self
assembling devices

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.540
through biotechnology, then when
people say, what do you think,

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.740
computers grow on trees?

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.150
And you say, yeah,
let me show you.

01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:57.090
Let's go back to the
collaboration at Apple,

01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:00.030
though, because I think that
was a specific question for you

01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.830
to try to tackle.

01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:01.230
WALTER ISAACSON: Yeah.

01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:03.780
I mean, when I first started
writing about Steve Jobs,

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.690
I thought he was an exception
to the rule about collaboration,

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:11.050
that he was a singular visionary
and his visionary did things.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:13.180
And I asked him
at one point, what

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.050
was your most visionary
thing that you created,

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:20.590
and I thought he might say
the iPhone or iPad or the Mac.

01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:23.000
And he said, no, creating
a particular product

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.140
or having a vision
for it is hard,

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.380
but the really hard thing
is creating a company that

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.365
lasts in which
people all know how

01:19:31.365 --> 01:19:34.990
to execute with vision
on various things.

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:38.790
So the most important
thing I ever created

01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:41.800
was Apple because I
realized it wasn't about me.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.860
This is him talking.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.750
I realized it was about a team
of people where I could walk in

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.030
and say, this sucks, or
this is great, or whatever,

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.150
but eventually, out of
that sturm und drang

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:53.160
would become a
particular product.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.650
And I think the most
important thing,

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:59.290
and it's probably a
[INAUDIBLE] as here,

01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:01.030
whether it's Google
or Apple or whatever

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:05.920
else, is to look at the
companies in which ingrained

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.140
in the genetic code was a
willingness to take risk

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:14.040
and to fail, and importance
about connecting beauty and art

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.920
and humanity, making our
machines more personal

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.450
so we felt intimate with them.

01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:23.240
There were a lot of companies
that came up with great ideas--

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.210
Xerox at Xerox PARC, Bell
at Bell Labs, IBM, whatever.

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:33.480
They didn't innovate as
a team and take risks.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.630
I see Google doing that.

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:37.620
I'm not just saying it
because I'm here with you all.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:42.300
Google is one of the few really
big companies in which it's

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.380
still like, let's
shoot for the moon,

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.970
let's try some weird
things, and let's understand

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:48.280
the importance of teamwork.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.620
I think Apple does that.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:52.110
Apple still has a team.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:56.180
What Steve did was not
just create a company.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.900
People read my
book and they say,

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.700
Steve was pretty much of a
jerk at times, wasn't he?

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.520
I say, yeah, but don't
forget how it turns out.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.546
He has the most loyal
people around him

01:21:06.546 --> 01:21:09.045
who will march through walls
with him, who will collaborate,

01:21:09.045 --> 01:21:10.880
who will stand up to him.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.910
That team at Apple
is a lot tighter

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:16.342
than the teams at much
friendlier companies like HP.

01:21:16.342 --> 01:21:17.800
BOB KAHN: Walter,
one of the things

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.310
that doesn't show
up in your book,

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:23.520
and yet one is often drawn
to a comparison between Apple

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.170
and Oracle, is Larry Ellison.

01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:28.222
Is he out of the picture
here because you just

01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:29.930
didn't have time to
get to him, or do you

01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:32.390
think he doesn't
play a role here?

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:33.640
WALTER ISAACSON: I don't know.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.660
You tell me.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.667
BOB KAHN: No, you're the
one who wrote the book.

01:21:36.667 --> 01:21:37.750
Why did you leave him out?

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.210
VINT CERF: Why don't
you [INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:43.010
WALTER ISAACSON: I
don't know that Oracle

01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:46.720
was one of the 12 great
leaps of the digital age.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.560
I think Larry Ellison's
a brilliant person,

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:55.917
but I don't find that the
creation of the Oracle systems

01:21:55.917 --> 01:21:57.750
was up there with the
transistor, microchip,

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:58.666
the personal computer.

01:21:58.666 --> 01:22:00.620
If I may, I would
love to get back--

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:02.700
BOB KAHN: I was just
curious as to your view.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.250
WALTER ISAACSON: So
what Steve is able to do

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:11.920
is really show how you get
every player on a team,

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.530
somebody like a
Tim Cook, who knows

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:15.950
how to make things happen,
somebody like a Johnny

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:18.280
Ives, who understands
the design,

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.240
and he creates this tight team.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.870
I think at Google, too,
there is this ability,

01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:25.900
when you watch Larry
and Sergey, but then

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.630
all the people around them
and all the people here.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:32.240
We can take risks, we can take
time off, we can collaborate,

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.860
and I think that the most
important thing for innovation

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:39.230
is not creating the
next new product

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:43.770
but creating the Apples, the
Googles, the Amazons, whatever

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:48.395
it may be, who are always
trying to do different things.

01:22:48.395 --> 01:22:49.270
VINT CERF: I'm sorry.

01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:53.190
It turns out that
this thing says 0S,

01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:55.190
and I'm pretty sure that
doesn't mean osmium.

01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:55.750
WALTER ISAACSON: It's
either zero seconds

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:56.620
or operating system.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.328
VINT CERF: Right.

01:22:57.328 --> 01:22:58.120
Or something.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.140
So I have a suggestion.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:01.960
Why don't we finish up here?

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.600
We have all kinds
of refreshments

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.095
out the doors here.

01:23:06.095 --> 01:23:10.456
Why don't we thank our
author over here, Walter.

01:23:10.456 --> 01:23:16.360
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.082
WALTER ISAACSON: And
let me make sure we

01:23:18.082 --> 01:23:21.940
thank the two great heroes
of the theme of this book,

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.700
but also of the digital
age, Bob and Vint.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:25.600
Thank you all.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.150
[APPLAUSE]
