00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:01.891
- [Voiceover] We now
begin a whole new area

00:00:01.891 --> 00:00:06.811
of circuit analysis called
sinusoidal steady state analysis.

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:09.561
You can also call it AC analysis.

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:12.718
AC stands for alternating current.

00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:15.341
It means it is a voltage or a current that

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:17.507
where the signal actually changes sign.

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:18.518
It is positive sometimes.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.378
It is negative sometimes.

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:22.696
And the conventional name for that is AC

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.263
or alternating current.

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:26.591
It could've been called
alternating voltage

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:27.663
but that's not the name.

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:28.913
The name is AC.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.065
What I want to do in this video

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.840
is we will do a quick review

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.881
of what it is like to solve an equation

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:35.987
like the one showed here.

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:38.194
This is an RLC circuit.

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:39.466
I'm going to show what
it is like to solve this

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.321
in differential equation form,

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.578
which is gonna be a lot of work.

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:45.371
I want to introduce the idea

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.556
of a new point of view
or a new analysis method

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:53.258
that we refer to as the
sinusoidal steady state.

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:55.246
And it is a transformation

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:57.167
that we are gonna do on this circuit.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.357
And it is gonna be a
big reward at the end.

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:01.265
I want to go through what's the reward

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:03.697
and what's it gonna look like at the end.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:04.831
Then we are gonna know some of the math

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.866
that we have to review in
order to fully understand

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.306
this change that we are gonna go through.

00:01:09.306 --> 00:01:12.028
This change of point of view.

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:13.797
Let's first take a look
at this circuit here.

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:17.158
This is a circuit that's
now a driven RLC circuit.

00:01:17.158 --> 00:01:18.378
So here's the drive function.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:19.656
It is a voltage.

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:20.979
It is some waveform.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.025
It is driving a sequence of an inductor,

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.680
a resistor, and a capacitor.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.918
Now in an earlier video

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:29.177
we derived the natural response

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:30.427
of this circuit

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:33.889
and to do that, we shorted out

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.028
we removed the source

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.054
and shorted it out

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.841
and added a little bit
of energy to this circuit

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.616
and saw what it did on its own.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:42.815
What was its natural response.

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:43.894
Now we've upgraded this.

00:01:43.894 --> 00:01:45.246
We've added a source

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:46.834
and now we have to solve this again

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.716
including the source.

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:51.618
If we use the differential
equation technique

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:53.316
this is how we are gonna go about it.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:55.898
So the first step in a
circuit analysis like this

00:01:55.898 --> 00:01:58.148
is to write a KVL equation.

00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:01.704
We are gonna solve for
this current right here.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.567
That's the one current that's in this.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.846
So I is our independent variable.

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:08.745
If I write KVL as you recall

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.696
when we did this for natural response,

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.481
we ended up with a differential equation

00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.535
that looked like this.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.952
We had L times the second derivative of I

00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:27.141
plus R times the first derivative of I

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:33.322
plus one over C times I.

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:39.457
So these are the voltages.

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:41.225
Each of these individual terms

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:45.058
are the voltages across
these components here.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:48.790
So that's the resistor voltage.

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:52.054
This is the capacitor voltage

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:53.579
and this here is the inductor voltage

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.445
so it is inductor voltage,

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:56.323
resistor voltage,

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:57.943
capacitor voltage.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:59.854
And all those if we add those up,

00:02:59.854 --> 00:03:01.771
those have to equal VN.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.905
So this is now a forced equation,

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.317
which means this is the forcing function

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:11.654
and we are gonna have to solve this

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:13.032
and the math for doing this is

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:14.204
pretty difficult.

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:16.500
It was hard enough to
do the natural response

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.271
and we add in this

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:21.021
and it gets to be even more work.

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:24.175
So as we did before,

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:26.822
what we do now is we propose a solution

00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:30.445
and the solution we are in
the habit of doing this now

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:32.930
is gonna be sum constant times E

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.013
to the sum natural frequency times T.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.520
So AE to the ST

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.114
is our proposed solution
for I as a function of time.

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:46.823
You remember we called S.

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:47.991
S is a frequency term

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:51.322
because S times T has to have no units

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:55.438
so S has units of one
over time or frequency

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.688
so that's called the natural frequency.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.052
And when we plug in I

00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:08.828
the way to tell if I is a solution

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:12.172
is to plug this into this equation here.

00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:13.744
And we got an equation
that looks like this.

00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:16.806
We ended up after factoring our I

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:18.139
we ended up with

00:04:20.258 --> 00:04:21.758
LS squared plus RS

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:25.788
plus one over C

00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:31.369
and all that is equal to

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:33.369
for the natural response

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:36.377
we put in,

00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:42.691
so we solve this equation by setting

00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.788
this term here equal to zero

00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:45.996
and solving for s

00:04:45.996 --> 00:04:48.267
to find out what the natural frequency is

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.571
and then we go back and we find out A

00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:52.874
by looking at the initial
conditions over here.

00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:55.166
Whatever initial energy
was in this circuit

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:57.452
determines the value of A here.

00:04:57.452 --> 00:04:59.298
The next step in this forced response

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:01.224
where VN is driving the circuit

00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:03.974
is we have to set this back to VN

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.332
and solve for the forced.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.404
Now if we let VN be sort of
any forcing function we want,

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:18.932
any kind of waveform,

00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:22.413
this is gonna be a really
hard piece of mathematics.

00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:24.412
This is gonna be a really
difficult calculation.

00:05:24.412 --> 00:05:26.855
It is gonna take a long time and basically

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:28.202
I don't want to do it.

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:29.650
I'm gonna wish there was
some other way to do these

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.212
kinds of equations and there is.

00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:35.409
The way we simplify this
process substantially

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.896
is we make a little
limitation on ourselves

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:39.396
on what VN can be.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:41.549
If we make a rule,

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:45.219
if we basically volunteer
to limit ourselves

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.052
to VN equals sinusoids

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:55.867
that means that VN is of the form

00:05:55.867 --> 00:05:58.034
cosine of omega T plus phi

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:02.771
where phi is some angle

00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:04.354
or it could be sine

00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:08.461
of omega T plus some angle.

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:13.295
Any waveform of this form here

00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:16.768
is called the sinusoid.

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:20.682
So sinusoid is the general
name for cosine and sine

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:23.600
and signals that look like that.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.972
Because we don't want this
math to blow up on us,

00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:29.184
with the general input over here,

00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:30.780
we are gonna develop a really elegant way

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.238
to solve circuits with this

00:06:32.238 --> 00:06:35.685
we limit ourselves to sinusoidal inputs.

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:37.044
We will take a pause right here

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:38.666
and continue on in the next video

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:42.003
to introduce the idea
of sinusoidal analysis.
