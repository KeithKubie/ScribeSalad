00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.421
i'm here at stanford medical school

00:00:02.498 --> 00:00:05.400
with Morgan Theis and Dr. Laura Bachrach

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.867
and they're going to teach us some things.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:11.133
Okay, so what are we going to learn about today?

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.067
I'd like to talk about precocious puberty

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:18.067
it seems to be on the minds of many parents these days

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:22.267
they worry that their child is developing too early,

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:26.600
they worry their child is going too small as a result,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.000
they worry their child is going to get picked on,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
and they worry they might have done something wrong.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.867
Fed the child the wrong food, or exposed them to the wrong videos,

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.267
to cause this all to happen.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:41.800
So could we just talk about what precocious puberty means,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
it almost sounds like they've done something too soon,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.733
is that correct?

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.667
It's exactly true.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:51.800
The normal process of puberty, in a girl, we think,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.067
we used to think, started around the aged of 10,

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.600
with a little bit of breast development.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.667
And around 6 months later, the girls would get

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.667
a little bit of pubic hair,

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.014
and around the age of 12 and 3/4 to 13

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:08.429
they'd get their first period.

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.751
Ok.

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:13.400
In boys, we used to think,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.733
the process was starting a little later,

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.267
at about 11 and a half.

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:20.933
The boys would get some enlargement of the testes.

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.467
They'd get some pubic hair about a year later.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.000
And by age 15 or so, they'd be mature.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.267
We have a definition of what's precocious,

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:37.533
uh, when there's signs of puberty before 8, in a girl,

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.933
or before 9, in a boy.

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:48.133
Ok. So, 8 or less in a girl, would be precocious,

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.467
and that's for the breast development?

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.400
For any signs of puberty:

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
the breasts, the pubic hair or the period

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.800
would be precocious if it happened before the age of 8 in a girl.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.467
And in a boy, before the age of 9.

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.867
Now this has become a little bit controversial

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:15.067
because there was one very large pediatric study

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:19.333
that involved over 17 000 girls

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:24.200
that found that as many as 25% of african american

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.133
girls would have sign of puberty before 8,

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.600
and as many 7% of the white girls had some

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.533
signs of puberty before age 8.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:37.333
But we're still basically using these guidelines.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.933
Not to say that this is definetely abnormal, but

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:43.267
this is something we're going to evaluate.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.267
If we see signs of puberty before those age landmarks.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:48.200
Ok, so it sounds like there's a lot of variability,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.667
it's kind of hard to know in any individual case,

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:52.933
whether it's normal or not, but we have to have

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.200
some kind of threshold for which we're going to

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.533
work someone up to make sure everything is normal.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.800
You hit on a really important word.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
And that is variability.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.400
And a lot of this variability, uh, is determined by genetics.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.867
So part of what we always need to know is

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:13.133
the timing of development in the family.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.267
So when did mom get her first menstrual period,

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:20.200
when did dad get his puberty and growth spurt?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.800
So that's part of it, genetics,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.000
and we need to know that, take that into account:

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.600
If mom had her first period at 10 and started

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.133
her breasts at 8

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:30.800
it might be perfectly normal for her daugher.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.133
If mom's period were at 14 and her daughter has

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.133
breast development at 7 and a half

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.200
it's more worrysome.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200
Ok.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.800
Ok, the second factor that seems to be contributing,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600
potentially,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.867
is the overnutrition of our young people.

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:44.867
Oh, yes.

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:47.600
And in the particular study that I mentioned to you,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.400
where they looked at over 17 000 children,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400
at least for the white population,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.267
the could explain the earlier signs of puberty

00:03:56.267 --> 00:04:00.400
as an association with a high body mass index.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.733
So it looked as if, if you overnourish your child

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.267
you may speed along their growth, and eventually,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.200
potentially, speed along the onset

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.800
of puberty.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.067
Now, this did not hold up as an association in the

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.533
african american population, so there's other factors

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.267
going on there.

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.333
But that's something that we rtake into account.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.800
THe bottom line is,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.533
the child may present with some signs of early puberty,

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.267
mom or dad get worried,

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:31.200
they go to the pediatrician,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200
and the pediatrician has to decide what's going on.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.800
Ok, now, JUST Backing up a little bit, is this a problem?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.133
I mean, what's the problem with, say, a 7 year old girl

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:45.867
starting puberty, or, uh, an 8 year old boy

00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:47.667
starting puberty early?

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:48.933
I imagine there could be some social implications

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:49.933
(as you mentionened)

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:51.667
but what are sort of the things

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:52.733
we worry about?

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:54.667
Well, that's an important question,

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:55.933
because it comes up not only how far do we go to

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.800
evaluate them, but how far do we go

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
to treat them?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.467
So, one of the concerns parents have,

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.267
relates to their final height.

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:07.800
So, if they start their growth spurt early in life,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.533
and close it off early in life,

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:11.867
are them gonna cheat themselves

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:13.933
out of some final height?

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:14.533
Right.

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.133
So height is a concern.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:20.067
And its impact really depends upon how young the child is.

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:21.533
A three year old going into puberty

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:23.400
is definetely going to end up short

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.533
if we don't do something.

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.400
A seven and a half old girl is

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
probably not going to be altered by this

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.467
in terms of height.

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.200
The second concern is definetely what you

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.867
brought up, in terms of social concern.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:39.733
Parents worry their child may behave in an older way,

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:42.400
or be treat in a way that

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.000
they're not quite ready for.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.933
They mey get unwarranted attention

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.333
from people because they look older.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.800
And there is even potential concern for abuse,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.133
sexual abuse.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:53.633
Um, right.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:55.600
So those are the usual parental concerns

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.800
for why they bring the child in.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.667
The other concern they have is, often

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:02.467
"what am I doing wrong".

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:02.967
There are a lot of questions about

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:05.733
"should I have fed my child organic food?"

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:07.933
"what about the soap i was using?"

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:10.733
"what about the soap operas my child was watching?"

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:11.667
You know, they're really

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.933
concerned about something they might have done.

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:16.667
And they worry about these additives in ourplastics,

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.267
in our theeth sealants, etc...

00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:21.467
They worry about evils inour environment.

00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:22.133
Okay.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:25.267
So things that you address in the visit that

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:26.400
you have with them are definetely

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.667
some of the, the concerns that parent have

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:31.933
about what they could have done differently.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.800
Exactly. We start out, assessing

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.200
in a sort of a systematic way.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.867
The first question we want to know, is

00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:40.533
when did this all start?

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.333
And what did they notice.

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:43.600
And it's really important

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.600
to break down the signs of puberty,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.667
because different hormones contribute to

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.267
the different signs.

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:51.533
For example, in a girl, if she is presenting with

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:55.400
some body odor, some acne, and some pubic hair,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.800
but no signs of any breast development,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.333
that leads us down the road to

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:02.200
worry about what we call her androgens

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.333
or her male hormones.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:06.800
If a girl comes in with just breast development

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.732
but none of the body hair

00:07:09.732 --> 00:07:11.933
or body odor, we think, aha! she's been

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.800
exposed to estrogens.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.667
And so we get a lot from the physical exam in

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.800
terms of thinking what hormones to go after.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.200
okay, so even though the definitions of precocious

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.200
is just any of these

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.467
different physical developments happening

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:27.933
too soon, the combination that you see

00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:29.733
is going to direct what yo uthing is going on

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:31.600
wit hthem clinically.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.400
Exactly.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.000
Ok

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.733
It will make us more or less worried

00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:38.133
and it will take us down one avenue or another,

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:41.267
thinking about what could be wrong,

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:44.800
what level of abnormality in the hormone system is at work.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.200
Ok. Can I ask you a question, just curious, so

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.667
what are the most common diagnosis given

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.133
to people coming in with their kids, that are

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:56.067
concerned for precocious puberty?

00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:58.467
The common diagnosis, is "variations are normal".

00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:00.800
Aha.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.333
There is a condition called

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:07.800
"isolated premature adrenarche" which is a

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800
fancy doctor way of saying

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.533
the adrenal glands producting their

00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:16.600
hormones, we see pubic hair, underarm hair, and acne.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.333
Uh... We also can see isolated

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.800
breast development in little toddler girls

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.333
that's not concerning.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.467
So that would just go away, or?

00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:27.667
Yes. Typically that begins between

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.000
six months and two years and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.800
goes away.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.667
But even within the more full blown cases,

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:37.200
where we're seeing breast and the pubic hair

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.667
in a girl, or the enlagrement of the testes

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:43.200
and the pubic hair in a boy, where's it's full on,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.067
full blown puberty, it may be idiopathic,

00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:49.800
or not pathological.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.267
We think that in girls,

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:57.267
who develop fully, 95% of the time, even if they

00:08:57.267 --> 00:09:00.133
have the full blown puberty,

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:02.733
it's idiopathic, or not pathological.

00:09:02.733 --> 00:09:06.400
Whereas in boys, about 50% of the time, there is pathology.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.133
So the condition is less common on boys, but

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:12.133
when it occurs in boys, it's more worrisome.

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:12.867
Oh, interesting.

00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:17.600
So it's less common for boys to have any signs of

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.467
precocious puberty, but when it does happen you worry more.

00:09:19.467 --> 00:09:21.333
Exactly.

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.733
Because it's more likeyl to be something bad.

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:24.267
Exactly.

00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:24.867
Ok.

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:30.667
So I'm guessing as an endocrinologist,

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:34.467
once you've sort of ruled out the normal things, then you start th

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:36.200
then you start thinking more about

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.600
sort of what's going on in terms of all the

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.800
different hormones that are controlling the

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.300
se

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.800
things, which maybe is something that

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.533
we'll talk about in a different

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:44.600
lecture

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.400
exactly.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000
is there any other sort of general things

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.600
that you wanted to adress when

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.533
we'll just talking about...

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:52.867
I think the general advice I would give to a parent

00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:56.800
if see signs of puberty in their child,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.933
before 8 in a girl, before 9 in a boy,

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.867
they should at least question their pediatrician

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.867
about it, uh, and the pediatrician should do

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:07.667
a complete exam, and the

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:10.400
other factor that needs to be looked at carefully is growth,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.200
because a child who is truly in puberty will have a growth spurt.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.267
So, those are things that parents can be

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:17.800
aware of at home, but I think it's

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.400
important that the parent asks the pediatrician about it,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.400
if they are concerned.

00:10:23.400 --> 99:59:59.999
Ok, well thank you so much.
