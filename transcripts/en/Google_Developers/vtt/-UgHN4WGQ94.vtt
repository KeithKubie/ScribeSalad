00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.150
Hello, there.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.680
I am Chukwuemeka Afigbo from
the Developer Relations team

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.010
at Google.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.170
As you may already
know, Google has

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.910
a ton of developer
content available online

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.980
that enables developers
all over the world

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.480
to create awesome
apps and solutions

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.470
on a variety of platforms.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.260
This content includes
developer documentation,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.480
software development
kits, and lots

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.020
of videos for
developers like you.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.780
Unfortunately, due to
internet challenges

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.620
in many parts of the
world, a lot of developers

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.310
are not able to
take full advantage

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.100
of this awesome content.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.960
An example of this is when
you want to run a codelab

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470
and need to download
and install the SDK

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.740
over a slow or nonexistent
internet connection.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.360
Another example is when
it takes 30 minutes

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.210
to watch that 10 minute tutorial
video on your favorite API

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.870
or platform due to
constant buffering caused

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.700
by a flaky connection.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.760
This is why we have
created a DVD series

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
with the latest and greatest
content on it-- such as videos,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.275
documentation, and
SDKs for developers

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.650
in internet-challenged regions.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.730
Now you will have
offline access to many

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.000
of the Google SDKs, developer
videos, and documentation

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.870
when you need them.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.340
If you're interested in
getting your hands on one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.160
of these DVDs or USB
drives, get in touch

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.230
with a Google Developer
group near you.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.970
I am Chukwuemeka Afigbo,
wishing you all the best

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840
from the Google campus
in Mountain View.
