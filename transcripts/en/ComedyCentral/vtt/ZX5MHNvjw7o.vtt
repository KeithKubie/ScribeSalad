AND TELL 'EM
WHEN YOU SEE 'EM,

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.097
THAT LEONARD WASHINGTON IS

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.565
GO ON.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.467
G-G-G-G-G-G...

AND IF YOU NEED MONEY,

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.838
I HEARD THAT'S WHAT
THEY DO AROUND HERE.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.681
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ?

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:12.352
DAMN, BITCH, WHAT'S THIS,
A LIGHT SABER OR SOMETHING ?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.721
NIGHT-NIGHT.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.190
HMM.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.860
DO YOU WANNA HAVE
SEX WITH ME, TODD ?

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.828

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.997
OKAY.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.666
OH !

UH, EXCUSE ME.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:35.007
DO YOU MIND IF I TURN OFF

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.287
UH, DO YOU WANNA TAKE OFF
YOUR PAJAMA BOTTOMS ?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.791
ACTUALLY, I'D FEEL MORE
COMFORTABLE IF I JUST

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.127
PULLED MY PENIS
THROUGH THIS HOLE.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.031
I'M SORRY, BABY,
I DON'T GO SOUTH OF THE BORDER.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:01.534
THAT'S JUST ONE THING THAT
LEONARD WASHINGTON DON'T DO.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.669
BUT-- BUT, LEONARD,
IT'S OKAY, I'M WAXED.

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:05.404
DAMN !

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.173
NOW, I DONE HEARD OF
TRIMMING THE HEDGES,

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.842
BUT YOU DONE
SCORCHED THE EARTH.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:12.511
( sniffing )

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:15.114
I SMELL YOUR
LIGHT SABER.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.717
LIGHT SABER ?

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.421
( buzzing )

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.363
LEONARD AND I HARDLY
EVEN TALK ANYMORE.

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.732 line:0%
THE OTHER NIGHT HE CAME HOME
AT THREE IN THE MORNING.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:34.533 line:0%
I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE HE WAS.

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:37.103
HE USES PROFANITY
AROUND JEFFREY.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.271
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE WE'RE SHARING.

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:41.707
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S
ANY RECIPROCITY THERE.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.344
( therapist )
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
ALL THIS, LEONARD ?

00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:48.381
BITCH, I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.983
GO ON, GET IN THE CAR,
WARM IT UP.

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.819
THIS IS GOOD,
YOU CAN LET OUT

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:55.621
WHATEVER YOU FEEL
IN HERE, LEONARD.

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:58.257
ALL RIGHT, I'MA TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, I AIN'T CRAZY,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.160
I DON'T NEED NO
PSYCHIATRIST.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:02.995
AND IF YOU EVER TELL
ANYBODY I'VE BEEN IN HERE,

00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:05.331
I'LL (BLEEP) KILL YA.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.233
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL
HERE, LEONARD.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.535
I WON'T TELL ANYONE,
IT'S JUST BETWEEN US.

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.170
WELL THEN,
CONFIDENTIALLY,

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:14.306
I AM CRAZY, AND I'LL
(BLEEP) KILL YA.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.276
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A WILD AND CRAZY MONTH.

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.247
LET'S SEE WHAT OUR INTERRACIAL
FAMILIES HAVE LEARNED.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.349
I LEARNED
A LOT FROM SHARRON

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.518
AND I LEARNED A LOT
FROM LITTLE T-MART.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.487
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I'LL MISS THEM BOTH VERY MUCH.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.524
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE...

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:36.429
I TASTED BROWN SUGAR,
AND NOT IN MY OATMEAL.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.230
( chuckles )

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:40.533
YEAH, BEING ON THIS SHOW
TAUGHT ME THAT,

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.269
NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ?

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:44.837
OR WHAT COLOR YOUR SKIN IS,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.006
WE ALL PRETTY MUCH DO
THE SAME THINGS IN LIFE.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:52.077
RAISE OUR KIDS, MAKE LOVE FROM
TIME TO TIME, AND WASH.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.080
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:57.383
I LEARNED THAT WHITE PEOPLE
DON'T USE WASHCLOTHS.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.452
DID YOU KNOW THAT ?

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.454
I'M SERIOUS, THEY HAVE
ONE BAR OF SOAP IN THE HOUSE.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.423
EVERY TIME I USED IT, SOMEBODY
ELSE'S PUBIC HAIR WAS IN IT.

00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.058
SO USE THE CLOTH.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:07.827
WHY YOUR ASS GOT TO PUT
THE RAW BAR OF SOAP

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.462
IN YOUR BUTT AND ALL THIS ?

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.898
MAYBE I NEED TO WASH MY FACE
OR MY FEET.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.869
TODD AND LEONARD ARE
VERY DIFFERENT.

00:07:16.902 --> 00:07:19.004
ALTHOUGH LEN IS
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:22.074
IN A DIFFERENT WORLD, I COULD
SEE MYSELF WITH TODD.

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:24.710
ALTHOUGH THE
PENIS-THROUGH-THE-HOLE THING

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:26.479
WAS KIND OF WEIRD.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:30.049
AND I AM MISSING
SOME OF MY DRAWERS.

00:07:32.484 --> 00:07:34.353
OH...

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:38.157
OH, MY GOSH--
HO-HO.

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.660
TITTY RESIDUE--

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:44.096
HELLO... HELLO ?
