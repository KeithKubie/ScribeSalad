00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.329
Computer simulation tends to be viewed as ...

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:04.496
rocket science.

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:06.457
So let's do rocket science!

00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:08.167
With just the basic laws of gravity

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:12.004
and a little programming, that is enough to rescue Apollo 13.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.716
You write a program to take the damaged spacecraft around the moon

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.928
and bring it home safely.

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.179
You look into how to stop the spread of diseases

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.432
such as malaria

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:24.558
and you'd stop cars as quickly as possible

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.519
using an antilock braking system.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.858
Finally you predict the cause of a wildfire.

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:36.487
My name is Jörn and I’ll be teaching CS222

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:40.033
-- making math matter -- differential equations in action.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.000
See you soon on Udacity.
