00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.160
doesn't lead good places
it really doesn't lead good places so

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.170
it really doesn't lead good places so

him today said well he went to a
 

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.800
him today said well he went to a
diversity training seminar and he

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:08.810
diversity training seminar and he
 

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.220

so then they asked for feedback so we

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:14.870

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:29.540
outside world but all he was doing was
 

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.780
outside world but all he was doing was
he was told a bunch of things he didn't

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:31.790
he was told a bunch of things he didn't
 

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.670
he was told a bunch of things he didn't
think were true he wrote down a bunch of

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680
think were true he wrote down a bunch of
 

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.160

things he thought were probably true he

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.170
things he thought were probably true he
 

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.480
things he thought were probably true he
launched that out and said well I think

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:37.490
launched that out and said well I think
 

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.850
launched that out and said well I think
these things are probably true it's like

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:39.860
these things are probably true it's like
 

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.650
these things are probably true it's like
well probably they're true well so he

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:44.660
well probably they're true well so he
 

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.420
well probably they're true well so he
paid a price for it but maybe we'll see

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:46.430
paid a price for it but maybe we'll see
 

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.830
paid a price for it but maybe we'll see
what sort of price he paid for it man

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:47.840
what sort of price he paid for it man
 

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.210
what sort of price he paid for it man
it's going to be a lot tougher in two

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:49.220
it's going to be a lot tougher in two
 

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.569
it's going to be a lot tougher in two
years than he was two years ago so

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:55.579
 
 

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:57.860

no they didn't answer his feedback
 

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.689
no they didn't answer his feedback
no no but well you can watch the video

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:02.699
no no but well you can watch the video
 

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:04.519
no no but well you can watch the video
the story's there but that's kind of the

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:04.529
the story's there but that's kind of the
 

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:07.249
the story's there but that's kind of the
outline of it so sorry to monopolize

00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:07.259
outline of it so sorry to monopolize
 

00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:08.689
outline of it so sorry to monopolize
this so I have one other question about

00:09:08.689 --> 00:09:08.699
this so I have one other question about
 

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.350
this so I have one other question about
this and I think it's important

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360
this and I think it's important
 

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.579
this and I think it's important
