So use the term psychoactive. You might wonder what is psychoactive? Well,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.488
psychoactive drugs are any drug that affect or change mood, cognition or

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:16.557
behavior. So, for example, cocaine is a psychoactive drug. It changes mood, it

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:20.526
improves cognition, it makes one think and feel powerful, like a competent

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:25.940
person and behavior. It increases motor activity. However, cocaine is not

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.159
prescribed for any of these things. Now, that leads us to psychotropic drugs.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.165
These are drugs that are prescribed, this is the key, to affect or change mood,

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:43.440
cognition, or behavior. So, an antidepressant, such as an SSRI, as we learned

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.315
about in Lesson 3, are prescribed to affect and change mood, cognition, and or

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:54.310
behavior. That makes anti depressants psychotropic drugs.
