like an energy independence is a false

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
like an energy independence is a false
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.530

goal we're never going to be energy

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540
goal we're never going to be energy
 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.020
goal we're never going to be energy
independent because oil and energy is

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
independent because oil and energy is
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970
independent because oil and energy is
fungible oil moves around but we

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980
fungible oil moves around but we
 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.950
fungible oil moves around but we
certainly can become less dependent on

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
certainly can become less dependent on
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.289
certainly can become less dependent on
foreign oil and oil from countries that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299

don't like us and that I think is our
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.070
don't like us and that I think is our
should be our goal and that's where we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
should be our goal and that's where we
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230
should be our goal and that's where we
should focus ourselves we're going to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
should focus ourselves we're going to
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.730
should focus ourselves we're going to
need to do more in conservation we're

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
need to do more in conservation we're
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.140
need to do more in conservation we're
going to need to do more in renewable

going to need to do more in renewable
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849
going to need to do more in renewable
resources and we're going to need to

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
resources and we're going to need to
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259
resources and we're going to need to
look at the base power that we have

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
look at the base power that we have
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939
look at the base power that we have
today and we need to do more with things

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
today and we need to do more with things
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.160
today and we need to do more with things
like nuclear energy that's an important

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
like nuclear energy that's an important
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170

part its twenty percent of our power

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
part its twenty percent of our power
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729

today if you care about climate change

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
today if you care about climate change
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.670

if you care about air quality nuclear is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
if you care about air quality nuclear is
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410
if you care about air quality nuclear is
the only form of base power that does

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
the only form of base power that does
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990
the only form of base power that does
not emit any of the regulated pollutants

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
not emit any of the regulated pollutants
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940

while is producing power we're going to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
while is producing power we're going to
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.380

have coal it's going to be part of our

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.119

futures or the fifty percent of our

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
futures or the fifty percent of our
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860
futures or the fifty percent of our
energy today we need to make sure it's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
energy today we need to make sure it's
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840
energy today we need to make sure it's
low so for coal and that it's burned as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
low so for coal and that it's burned as
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.250
low so for coal and that it's burned as
cleanly as possible and that we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
cleanly as possible and that we
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770
cleanly as possible and that we
understand what we can do with the co2

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
understand what we can do with the co2
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110
understand what we can do with the co2
that is emitted we're going to have to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
that is emitted we're going to have to
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240
that is emitted we're going to have to
have all of these things there's no one

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
have all of these things there's no one
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670
