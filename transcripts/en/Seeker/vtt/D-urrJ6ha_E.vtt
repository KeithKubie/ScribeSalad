00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.380
If you think you know how the Solar System
is arranged, think again.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.500
Because there just might be a Planet X lurking
well beyond Neptune.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.519
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.659
Most of us grew up with nine planets.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.260
Then Pluto became a dwarf planet along with
the other Kuiper Belt objects and the layout

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.939
of our Solar System changed: Now we’ve got
eight planets and hundreds of dwarf planets.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.570
All of these objects orbit the Sun more or
less regularly.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.500
Their orbits are all slightly elliptical and
vary in inclination, but lets call that regular.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.440
Because there are objects beyond the Kuiper
Belt that have extremely irregular orbits,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.300
and they’re throwing a bit of a wrench in
how we imagine the Solar System is arranged.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.220
Sedna is a dwarf planet that traces a highly
elliptical orbit around the Sun.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.640
1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the
Sun.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.680
Sedna only comes as close as 76 AU to the
Sun and goes as far out as 940 AU.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.810
And it’s got a companion out there, a recently
discovered dwarf planet called 2012 VP113

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.170
that only comes as close as 80 AU from the
Sun and travels as away as 452 AU.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.390
There are a small handful of other bodies
with similarly strange orbits, and the question

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.120
plaguing astronomers is why; why are those
bodies unlike all the other bodies?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.450
They aren’t part of a distant debris field,
they’re too far from Neptune to have their

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.650
orbits perturbed by Neptune, and they’re
too far from the Oort cloud.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.370
It’s possible a passing star pulled them
away from the Kuiper Belt at some point.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.250
Or it’s possible there’s a massive planet
out there that not only pulled these objects

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.430
into their irregular orbits but is keeping
them in their strangely distant place.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.340
It’s far too early to tell — astronomers
will need to make a lot more observations

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.860
to confirm anything — but studying the irregular
orbits of these distant tiny worlds could

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.490
uncover the existence of a ninth planet in
our solar system.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.820
Or tenth, depending on your feelings about
Pluto.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.890
The discovery of 2012 VP113 is adding compelling
evidence to this idea.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.409
This isn’t a new way of looking for planets.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.530
It’s actually how Neptune was discovered.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.310
Neptune’s orbit was predicted based on irregularities
observed in Uranus’ orbit; lo and behold

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.200
the planet was there.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.340
Irregularities in Neptune’s orbit led to
the prediction of an even more distant Planet

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.599
X. Pluto was actually found near this predicted
planet but is too small to really act on Neptune.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.790
So could the irregularities in these dwarf
planets, when taken together, reveal a new

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.120
Planet X orbiting our Sun in our own cosmic
backyard?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840
It might be a long shot, but it’s not impossible!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.980
So how do you guys feel about our ever-changing
Solar System?
