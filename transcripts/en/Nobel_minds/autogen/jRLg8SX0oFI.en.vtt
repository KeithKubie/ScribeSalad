hi my name is chris dodd's well and I

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
hi my name is chris dodd's well and I
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.530
hi my name is chris dodd's well and I
was just wondering what your opinions on

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540
was just wondering what your opinions on
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.940
was just wondering what your opinions on
string theory are and what do you think

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950
string theory are and what do you think
 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.550
string theory are and what do you think
it's provable or not hi Chris you're

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
it's provable or not hi Chris you're
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.009
it's provable or not hi Chris you're
asking about string theory well I'm not

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
asking about string theory well I'm not
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.450
asking about string theory well I'm not
the right person to ask that's not my

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
the right person to ask that's not my
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.190
the right person to ask that's not my
subject I actually like to measure

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
subject I actually like to measure
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320
subject I actually like to measure
things instead of making theories about

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
things instead of making theories about
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.420
things instead of making theories about
them but I can tell you why string

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
them but I can tell you why string
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.120
them but I can tell you why string
theory was invented if you try to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
theory was invented if you try to
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.640
theory was invented if you try to
calculate the energy of a particle that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
calculate the energy of a particle that
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.970
calculate the energy of a particle that
has a just a point in space and you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
has a just a point in space and you
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.460
has a just a point in space and you
calculate the few the energy in the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
calculate the few the energy in the
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.710
calculate the few the energy in the
electric field around an electron the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
electric field around an electron the
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510
electric field around an electron the
answer that you get is infinity this is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
answer that you get is infinity this is
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760
answer that you get is infinity this is
not the right answer so if you could

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
not the right answer so if you could
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620
not the right answer so if you could
imagine that instead of being a point

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
imagine that instead of being a point
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510
imagine that instead of being a point
the particle is actually spread out into

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
the particle is actually spread out into
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.410
the particle is actually spread out into
a string or a surface or other ways you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
a string or a surface or other ways you
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.479
a string or a surface or other ways you
can avoid this infinity problem and then

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
can avoid this infinity problem and then
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.619
can avoid this infinity problem and then
it becomes a much more interesting

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
it becomes a much more interesting
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139
it becomes a much more interesting
calculation and this has worked out

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
calculation and this has worked out
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760
calculation and this has worked out
pretty well mathematically so we're

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
pretty well mathematically so we're
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520
pretty well mathematically so we're
beginning to be able to do that but

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
beginning to be able to do that but
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650
beginning to be able to do that but
unfortunately there is very little way

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
unfortunately there is very little way
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.029
unfortunately there is very little way
that we can tell the difference between

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
that we can tell the difference between
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.549
that we can tell the difference between
string theory predictions and other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
string theory predictions and other
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.290
string theory predictions and other
theory predictions they've all been

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
theory predictions they've all been
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750
theory predictions they've all been
adjusted to match the reality that we've

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
adjusted to match the reality that we've
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.450
adjusted to match the reality that we've
already observed so so far a string

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
already observed so so far a string
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460
already observed so so far a string
theory has not made predictions that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
theory has not made predictions that
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.500
theory has not made predictions that
haven't already been tested that means

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
haven't already been tested that means
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899
haven't already been tested that means
it's not possible to demonstrate that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
it's not possible to demonstrate that
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.120
it's not possible to demonstrate that
it's a better theory than others but

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
it's a better theory than others but
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740
it's a better theory than others but
maybe that time will come

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
maybe that time will come
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.020
maybe that time will come
perhaps a string theory will predict

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
perhaps a string theory will predict
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.219
perhaps a string theory will predict
something that will be seen that the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
something that will be seen that the
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.230
something that will be seen that the
Large Hadron Collider that no other

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
Large Hadron Collider that no other
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749
Large Hadron Collider that no other
theory has predicted in that case then

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
theory has predicted in that case then
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.259
theory has predicted in that case then
we would say it was a great success
