00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.000
In the last video, where we
launched something at an angle,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.910
we figured out the horizontal
and the vertical components

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.425
of that launched velocity.

00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.460
And we used a vertical
component to figure out

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.630
how long that thing
is in the air.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.950
And then we used that
time to figure out

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.444
how far it will travel, given
a constant horizontal velocity.

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:18.860
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.890
to redo part of that problem.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.300
And I want to redo
the part to figure out

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.750
how long this object
stays in the air.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.490
And I'm going to do it in a
slightly more complicated way

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.380
than the way I did
in the last video,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590
but it's kind of a
more powerful way.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.924
And we'll see that it's more
powerful in future videos.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.340
So the last video, to figure
out how long it's in the air,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.923
we said, look.

00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:41.300
We're starting and stopping
at the same elevation.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.945
Whatever our vertical
velocity is here upward,

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:46.070
we're going to have the
same magnitude of velocity,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.440
but it's going to be downward.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.294
We used that insight to figure
out the change in velocity,

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:52.960
and then we used that
change in velocity

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.570
and the constant acceleration
due to the force of gravity

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.264
on an object in free fall, to
figure out the time in the air.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:00.930
And it was pretty
simple mathematically.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.292
What we're going to do now
is, to derive a formula that's

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:07.750
useful in physics,
although, I like

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.126
to always derive
it from scratch.

00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:11.208
And that's how we're going
to derive it over here.

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.167
And you've see me derive
this formula before.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:15.250
But just to start off, we
need to remind ourselves

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.875
that the vertical velocity that
we calculated in the last video

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.690
was five meters per second.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.490
And given that
vertical velocity,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.550
let's figure out how long
this thing stays in the air.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.850
So our vertical velocity, our
velocity in the y direction,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.010
is five meters per second.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.150
And also as a reminder,
our convention,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.650
when we're dealing with
vectors in one dimension,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.700
and this is essentially
in one dimension

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.450
now, since we know it's
in the y direction,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.442
is positive means up,
negative means down,

00:01:43.442 --> 00:01:45.400
when we're dealing with
the vertical direction.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.441
When we're dealing with
the horizontal direction,

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:51.110
positive means to the right,
negative means to the left.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.136
So just to make sure we
have those conventions down.

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.510
So how can we
figure out how long

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.130
this thing stays in the air?

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.190
So we can remind ourselves
that the displacement,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.010
and everything we're
talking about now,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.480
is, well, this
will actually apply

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.490
whether in any one dimension.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:15.160
But the displacement is
equal to the average velocity

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.545
times our change in time.

00:02:17.545 --> 00:02:20.110
Times the amount of
time that elapsed.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.180
And what is our
average velocity?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.910
Our average velocity is-- if we
assume constant acceleration--

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.384
it is our final velocity
plus our initial velocity.

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:34.800
Actually let me
write it this way,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.430
it'll make it a
little bit cleaner.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.650
It is our initial velocity
plus our final velocity divided

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.150
by 2.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.870
So literally the arithmetic
mean of our initial

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.240
and final velocities.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.040
And we're going to multiply
that times change in time.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.750
Now, what is our final
velocity going to be?

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.410
Our final velocity--
I'll write it over here.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:09.176
Our final velocity is the same
thing as your initial velocity,

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:13.520
plus acceleration,
your acceleration

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.360
times how much
time has passed by.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.250
This right here is
your final velocity.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.460
So let's substitute that back
into this, right over here,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.030
and what do we get?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.330
We get our initial velocity,
so our average velocity

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.080
is now our initial velocity
plus our final velocity.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.720
The final velocity
is this over here.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.940
So it's our initial velocity
plus the acceleration

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.300
times the amount of
time that passes by.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.130
All of that divided
by-- let me do

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.540
that same color-- all
of that divided by 2.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.710
And then all of
this is multiplied

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.270
by the amount of
time that passes by.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.030
Once again, this is
our total displacement.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.870
So this part right over here--
let me do it in magenta--

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.210
we have to vi's.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.050
All right.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.930
So that simplifies to two vi's.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.960
2 times our initial velocities.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.000
And so this expression right
here simplifies to two times vi

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.194
divided by 2 is our
initial velocity.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.440
And then we have-- well,
I'll just do it all here.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.920
And then I'll multiply it times
the time elapse after that.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.260
Plus the acceleration
times time,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.000
the acceleration times
the amount of time

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.840
that's passed by, divided by 2.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.150
And all of this is multiplied
by the amount of time

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.830
that passes by.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.390
And this is our
total displacement.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.520
And we're almost done.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.740
And if you have to take
a physics exam under time

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.820
pressure, it's not
ridiculous to not

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.310
have to rederive it every time.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.020
But I want to emphasize it.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.390
You should realize that these
formulas come from almost just

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.871
common, basic sense
principles, and you

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.120
should be able to derive them.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.860
But it's good to memorize them
if you have a time pressure

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.360
exam.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.930
So now if we multiply
this delta t,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.760
you get the total
displacement is

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.240
equal to your initial velocity
times your change in time,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.720
plus-- I'll do the same
color-- plus your acceleration

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.740
over 2 times-- you have a
delta t times a delta t.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.490
Remember, delta just
means change in time.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.450
This triangle just
means change in time.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.400
So change in time
times change in time

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.890
is change in time squared.

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.630
And this expression right here,
this is in some physics books

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.490
or in some classes, they'll
just give you this formula.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.640
But I wanted to just
show you that it's

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.030
derived from very,
very simple principles.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.200
From just, displacement is
average velocity times time.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.770
What is average velocity?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.090
What is final velocity?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.050
It's just initial velocity
plus acceleration times time.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.550
And you'll get this
expression right over here.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.937
So I did this to figure
out how much time we're

00:05:59.937 --> 00:06:01.020
going to spend in the air.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.640
So how do we do that for
this particular problem?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.767
Well, we know our
initial velocity,

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.600
that's the launch of
the vertical component,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.260
because we're dealing with just
the vertical component here.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.020
We know our initial velocity.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.600
We know the acceleration
due to gravity.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.950
And in this situation,
we want to figure out

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.640
when the displacement
is going to be--

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.350
and this is going to be
a little bit unintuitive,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.320
but hopefully it
makes sense-- when

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.737
the displacement
is going to be 0.

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:24.320
Because there's going to be two
times when the displacement is

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.270
going to be 0.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.330
There's going to be the time
right when we launch it,

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.090
right at time 0 the
displacement is going to be 0.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.470
Then this thing's going to be
launched and then come back

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.420
to the ground.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.170
And then when it comes
back to the ground,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.160
the displacement is
going to be at 0 again.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.080
So if we set the displacement
to be equal to 0,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.080
we should get two answers
to that, and one of them

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.280
should have a non-zero
time component.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.060
One of them will probably
be 0, and the other one

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.820
will have a non-zero
time, and that's

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.230
the one that we should go for.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.410
Because that's the
second time, that's

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.390
the time when we've
hit the ground.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.010
So let's apply that.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.510
So we have the
displacement is going

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.540
to be 0, so 0 is equal to--
our initial velocity is

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.460
5 meters per second upwards.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.100
I won't write the units
just for the sake of space.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:16.670
5 meters per second upwards
times change in time, plus,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.310
what's our acceleration?

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.630
Well, our convention is if
somethings going downwards,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.830
if the one dimensional vector is
going downwards, it's negative.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.100
So the acceleration is negative
9.8 meters per second squared.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.970
You divide that by 2.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.030
So we get-- actually just
let me write it all out.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.540
Actually let me
write it like this.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.400
It's negative 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.010
I'm not writing the units
here just for simplicity,

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.680
just so that we don't
take up too much space.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.570
And then all of this
times delta t squared.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.860
And lucky for us, this
one is pretty simple,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.264
we don't have to resort to
factoring, or we will factor,

00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:54.430
but we don't have to resort
to the quadratic formula

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.510
or anything like that to solve
this quadratic equation, right

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.010
over here.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.270
We can factor out a delta t.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:07.650
So we get 0 is equal to delta
t times 5 minus 9.8 over 4.2

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.390
is 4.9.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.890
And if you factor out a delta
t out of delta t squared,

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.090
you're left with a delta t.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.880
So there's two
solutions here, There's

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.630
two delta t's that
will give us 0.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.570
Either this delta
t is equal to 0,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.780
so either delta
t is equal to 0--

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.140
that's just our starting point.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.570
So that's not the time
that we're interested in,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.760
where no time has passed by.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.551
Or all of this business
could be equal to 0.

00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:35.550
If we have two things
when we take their product

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.419
that equal 0, that means
either one or both of them

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.600
are equal to 0.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:48.350
So we have 5 minus 4.9
delta t is equal to 0.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.360
We could add 4.9 delta t to
both sides of this equation.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.720
And we will get 5 is
equal to 4.9 delta t.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:08.720
And then we divide both sides
by 4.9 to get the elapsed time.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.900
So delta t is equal
to, 5 divided by 4.9

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:19.790
is-- we're at the home
stretch-- 5 divided by 4.9

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.530
is equal to 1.02 seconds.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.050
So it's equal to 1.02 seconds.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.177
And so once again, we
got the same exact answer

00:09:28.177 --> 00:09:30.510
we got in the last one, we
just used a different method.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.960
And that's one of the really
fun things about physics

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.050
is as long as you're
doing logically

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.890
consistent correct
things, there's

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.150
many ways to often
get that answer,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.070
but it should be
the same answer.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.390
If it's not, you
probably did something

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.120
wrong in one of those
two ways of doing it.
