00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 (Mitch) We've shown you over the past year the ins and outs of some crazy science 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.820
 But have you ever wondered about these hands? 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.880
 Or how are these videos made? 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.100
 You're about to know! 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.260
 (Snazzy) 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.860
 (Greg) Hi I am Greg (Mitch) and I am Mitch, and we are creators of AsapScience 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.380
 We thought it would be nice to give you guys behind the appearance of driving 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 In how to create episodes, who we are, and what to do. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 (Greg) instead of doing "draw my life", why we always draw our own science videos 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240
 We do "real life my life" 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.000
 We put a video asking you guys to ask us questions 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.240
 So we will answer some questions 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.780
 We'll give you a little backstage about how to create our own videos 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240
 That is what we will do today 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.460
 (Mitch) so the first question is "Which country do you live in?" 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160
 (Greg) 1, 2 and 3 (both) Canada! 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.940
 (Mitch) "What is your educational background?" 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.040
 (Greg) so I went to the University of Guelph 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.360
 Where I studied biological sciences and said in an art studio 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.020
 After that, I went to the Teachers' College, where I learned to become a teacher 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.880
 At UFT at the University of Toronto 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.580
 Last year, I was already in the UK studying people at the academy. Shout! 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.260
 (Mitch) also went to the University of Guelph and got a degree in biological science 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.540
 Obviously I am less educated because this is where it ended for me 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.160
 But then I worked in some laboratories and 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.400
 (Greg) Simple Mind (Mitch) Yes, a simple mind 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 (Greg) the next question "What made you start the channel?" 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060
 (Mitch) Well, we thought YouTube was great 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 We have seen some other educational channels, which we think are very effective 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 We believe that we love science. We love to explain science to people. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980
 Why not start this channel that looks like "fast access science" 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.040
 More specifically for people who do not believe they love science 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.320
 We thought it would be nice to communicate with people who think science is boring 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.840
 Or I think science absorbs or never reaches as far as we can find these really wonderful things 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 When you are in high school sometimes the science may seem boring 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.660
 They do not teach you really wonderful things. 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.620
 (Greg) I think one of the first ideas we had 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
 We had a lot of friends around us, and what we would do when we were lounging was 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.360
 Explain to them specific scientific concepts we know in a simple way 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.940
 Which we thought would involve them 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.380
 That was one of our first lamps, when we thought 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.460
 "We are likely to do so in a center where more people can reach it" 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.800
 So the question is "How did you think and formed the slogan of AsapScience?" 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.600
 (Mitch) so we had a big scheme, like, science-related names 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.000
 As you know, there was, for example, a couple we wanted and the YouTube channel was already transferred 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 (Greg) Some very bad! 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.080
 'but how?' (Mitch) was like "ever wonder?" 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.260
 "Quick Science" (Greg) No, "Ever Wonder" was good 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.400
 (Mitch) Yes (Greg) Kadana We did "surprised" 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760
 (Mitch) So, in the end, we were like AsapScience. 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.480
 We are a fan of A $ AP Rocky and we were like us 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.180
 This beautiful name is sweet and like 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 "As soon as possible" It was cool. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.920
 This type of message conveyed the message we were trying to address 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920
 (Greg) but "not" the dollar sign in our country 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.360
 (Mitch Muffin) Yes, unfortunately, we do not make as much money as him. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.160
 In terms of logo, if you watch our first video 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.820
 We did not even have a logo, we just painted it, the name of AsapScience. 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.140
 In my opinion, I was like "every time we change it" 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.040
 So, our audio track ended up creating an AsapScience logo 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.940
 But then we got a little laziness and then we just decided to use those clips 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.220
 Again and again, and then ended up becoming our motto forever 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.060
 (Greg) How do you choose your subjects? 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
 (Mitch) Well, when we started at the beginning, we had a list of things 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.500
 We went out before we even start the channel 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.780
 The things we thought were cool from the university or friends I had asked before 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.360
 So we just compiled a large list 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.180
 (Greg) You're all criticized through Facebook and Twitter 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.520
 In fact YouTube comments 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.040
 So I spend a lot of time reading all comments on Facebook and YouTube comments 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.380
 I have a list on my phone with 275 really genius themes 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.880
 I've thought about you, so this is something we really do 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920
 "What is video making?" 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.120
 (Mitch) Why do not we go to show you? 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.020
 (Very cheerful music) 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.040
 So this space our office 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.060
 We have a new office space 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.460
 (Greg) Im tired 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.740
 So the first step is to discover an idea 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.780
 So, sometimes on the basis of breakthroughs in science that we see interesting 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.280
 Or the books we read. Or what happens is that a lot of time do not know everything 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.520
 So we get a lot of great ideas from you, and we have to know what the answers are 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.420
 And how we will actually create a video of information 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.300
 This involves research. The second step is to do research 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.700
 Books, and a lot of online time using peer-reviewed journals and art material 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.240
 We love using PubMed, Google Scholar, and websites that can reach us with these types of information 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.560
 (Mitch) we have a lot of tags 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.120
 We are in business marks. 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.880
 Unfortunately, everyone had to be kept in the original, and began to drive them out after they started to dry out 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.020
 I usually set them up here and I have everything ready to go 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 Millions of signs of blackboard board. 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.840
 Ill make their cemetery one day. 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240
 Generally once our script, I just come here. 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
 We do not actually finish the script until we draw 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760
 Therefore, we have the camera pointing down on the blackboard. 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.700
 And you can only draw 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.240
 (Greg) so although Mitch was relying on a lot of whiteboard this year 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.780
 Originally we had an idea about the type of animation and explain science through art 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.600
 Because, in fact, I am an artist. In a lot of the time, I would like to combine art and art together 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.200
 So these are the paintings I made from proteins 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.060
 Optical images of proteins are through a program called PIMAL 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.340
 They are very precise and complex, so I used them 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.220
 Then painted on canvas using oil paint 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.360
 And finally this is BjÃ¶rk who is a great inspiration for us. The art and science blend in a very special way 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.620
 We really look into 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.700
 (Mitch) So, this is our most distinguished, most modern Estudione. 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.320
 As you can see, all the things you need. Clothing on the left. 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.560
 Towels and blankets on the right. 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.700
 I make it mainly with blankets and stuff, just to cool the noise, right? 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.560
 Because you want to get a room where there is not much echo, you can get only dry sounds 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.200
 "Dreams are an amazing phenomenon, given that you spend nearly 6 years of your dream life 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.000
 It is very strange that we often clean them aside to be quickly forgotten. 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.480
 But, what are dreams? 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.040
 Like many science fiction stories or movies, we can record them at all 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480
 And know what we see at the time we dream it? " 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.980
 Basically, you can bring stills - so we have a lot of different sections of the video 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.440
 We have a different voice that I have edited now 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.020
 So I have to match the video clips with the recorded sound. 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.880
 So not the other way around. Some people think I'm talking to video footage. 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.000
 But instead, we record one audio track when I come 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.240
 Take video and type of stream all together with different clips. 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.840
 Adds up to the timing of the video 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.500
 (AsapScience music is very passionate and cool) 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.600
 So the last step is to add music. Usually we use the original song that you wrote 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.760
 But every now and then I feel like I'm writing a new song or adding a new song that fits this video perfectly. 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.240
 So, I'm a musician and I have a musical background. 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.380
 You can check my own stuff at mitchellmoffit.com 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.840
 To listen to my music there. It was a nice way to integrate my own interests into videos 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.480
 We have kind of music and science to cooperate in AsapScience channel. 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.000
 (Superior techno rad) 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.960
 "So, what are your jobs outside of AsapScience? Ive always wanted to know." 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.020
 (Greg): I just completed a year of teaching abroad in the UK. 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.940
 In a place called Folkestone where I taught science. 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.680
 It was a really wonderful experience. I actually got to do practical experiments 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.980
 And interact with the classroom well. 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.780
 In addition to the side I will go home and I will help with this YouTube channel 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.060
 And involve millions of people. 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.020
 (Mitch) a year ago, we did not really know that this might be work 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.320
 Like, you just start for fun and then pick it up. 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.860
 Now both of our full-time jobs. (Greg) all of the full-time jobs, yes. 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.780
 "Are you planning to collaborate with SciShow, Vsauce, MinutePhysics, or any other site? 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.320
 Channels related to science? 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.940
 (Mitch) Yes, we absolutely love it. I mean we have a chance to cooperate with Vsauce3, Jake. 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.060
 We hope to do it again. We also have to cooperate with Bill Nye! 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.360
 Our dream has become a reality, which is really wonderful. 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.540
 "Have you ever tried to tell who has videos?" 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.160
 (Greg) his voice number is much better than my voice. 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.720
 Two of them, and true, I sounded like a badger honey. 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.820
 "Ever wonder why both coffee and alcohol have an unfortunate tendency to make you urinate?" 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.020
 (Mitch) "reveal one of your biggest secrets" 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.160
 (Greg) Um ... 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.480
 Oh my God, I can not think of any occasion. 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.420
 (Mitch) Yes, you do not have to answer 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.040
 (Greg) "Please sing to us in this voice, Mitchell, that would be very fun" 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.300
 (Mitch) Um ... what? Song periodic table? 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.640
 (Greg) or like Whitney Houston 

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.200
 (Mitch) no 

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.740
 (Greg) "Where did you learn how to draw?" 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.080
 (Mitch) I did not do that. Like, I just, Greg actually has an art degree. 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.560
 But it was in a different country so I had to start painting and it was like drawing 

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.840
 So, I just want to look for different images of animation and try to think of them 

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.020
 Try to make it as simple as possible, which is added to our aesthetics 

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.000
 (Greg) Everyone says "Oh, I cant do art". Anyone can do art. 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.600
 It is only practice. You are only teaching yourself. It is only a knowledge to make you a painter. 

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.100
 (Mitch) "What's your favorite movie?" 

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.520
 (Greg) 2001 "The Odyssey Space" by Stanley Cooper 

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.140
 For reasons we all know 

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.540
 "What is your favorite game?" 

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.960
 (Mitch) Zelda! In the best video game ever. I'm obsessed with it. 

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.000
 I have played all the Zelda game, and its awesome. 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.640
 So "Does it change your search for your videos?" 

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.480
 (Greg) Yes, I think it is. For example: after we did the scientific power of napping 

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.620
 We power plugs Gorse now 

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.100
 In fact, I have an electric nap every day and I always make sure they are less than 20 minutes 

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.900
 I honestly think they help. 

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.280
 Coffee and alcohol, consume a lot. (Mitch) Yes 

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.680
 Cure for Headache (Greg) Pee a lot ... treat a headache! 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.360
 (Mitch) and things like productivity. You learn about him then you want, or procrastination 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.860
 You're like, "I can not procrastinate now, I've said like a million people to stop procrastination" 

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.540
 (Greg) Then there are tips. In many of our videos, we provide tips and examples of things to do 

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.920
 It is much easier to follow now. I mean, we learn as we do these videos 

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.180
 Just as you learn when you see them and certainly affect our lives. 

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.980
 Hopefully the same way it affects. 

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.680
