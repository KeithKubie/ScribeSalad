00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
So this lecture is for facilitators and coaches, sometimes called the instructors or mentors.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.070
Why you're here is I'm just going to go through a brief explanation

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.960
of what it is you're doing while the students are watching the lectures

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.690
and working on their presentations and getting out of the building and presenting.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.310
What do you do?

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.730
My suggestion is to get us all aligned,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.690
rather than me have to repeat all of the lectures we're giving the students,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.050
is you need to go watch Lecture 0, Lecture 1, Lecture 1.5

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.020
and find your copy of the Lean LaunchPad Educators Guide.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.310
That's kind of your prep work for the rest of this conversation.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.730
This might take an hour or 2 to watch all these lectures

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.360
and kind of get up to speed on the material, but it's well worth your time.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.010
Also, if you don't have a copy, please get a copy of Alexander Osterwalder's

00:00:51.010 --> 99:59:59.000
Business Model Generation book and a copy of The Startup Owner's Manual.
