1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,860
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,870
We're continuing with our live performance
of apocalyptical from the paramount

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,850
Peter in Seattle, Washington.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,720
And we just heard a new theory
about the end of the dinosaurs,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,380
a very sudden fast, dramatic end with
a sudden musical boom at the very,

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:20,580
very end. Now for the next question, this
is sort of the obvious next question,

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:21,840
uh,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
which is what made it through and how
well we did ask scientists that question

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,120
and here is what they told us.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,420
[inaudible] if on that day you were a
creature in the ocean and you happened to

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,080
be within 300 feet of the water surface.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,640
So you imagine this room
filled with ocean water,

13
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:48,641
we're talking about you guys up in the
balcony up there will not surprise you to

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:52,140
learn. You don't do very well. Uh,

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,380
there's a certain amount of heat and
mostly there's acid rain pouring in.

16
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,510
So a lot of you will die.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,370
Look down with the higher paying
seats if you're below 300 feet.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,750
And this always happens to people with
different, with the better anyway.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,050
You do find,

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,180
and on land it turns out plain
ordinary dirt is a very good insulator.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,550
If you've got 1200 degrees on
the surface, then about three,

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,380
four inches down, you'd be comfortable
there for several hours. Oh,

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,670
just a couple inches. You
only need a few inches.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,060
So that means you could be a little warm
and if you squiggle down, you're okay.

25
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:34,610
You could be a Beatle
squiggling down. You're okay.

26
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:38,120
You could be a dinosaur
tending to an underground nest.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,260
And if the nest isn't far
enough below the ground,

28
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,610
and a lot of them were,

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,670
then the babies that hatch will have
babies that hatch will have babies that

30
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,550
hatch, we will call their
babies and years later birds.

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,160
And if you're an early
version of a crocodile,

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,140
you bury yourself deep
enough into the mud.

33
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:58,320
You also get through as do the plant's
roots. A lot gets through action.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,730
And that actually brings us to, uh,

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,810
what I find to be one of the
coolest parts of this story.

36
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,050
This is the part that involves
all of us in this room.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,340
So it turns out on that day as the
fire was raging above on the surface,

38
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,470
somewhere in a little hole in the ground
happened to be a furry little animal.

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,440
It has the distinction of being the same.

40
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,940
Great. Great, great, great, great, great,

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,880
great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great, great,

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,580
great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great,

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,580
great, great, great, great,
great, great, great, great, great,

44
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,720
great, great. Okay, great.
Great, great. Okay, great.

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,220
Et cetera. Grandma of everybody
in this room. It is true.

46
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,320
There was a creature down there. Um,

47
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,610
there is a creature down there.

48
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,010
I thought we should stop there
because we were getting away with

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,540
something and I didn't
want to push it too far.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,710
All of a sudden it was just usually, yeah.

51
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,420
Though there is a creature
down there, uh, in a,

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,880
in a little hole and when the
dinosaurs got cleared away,

53
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,400
this creature could step out of her
hole. She could step out of her niche.

54
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,460
She had more food, more places to roam.

55
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,080
She could populate the planet
ushering in the age of mammals.

56
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,040
And now here we all are in Seattle. Oh,

57
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,760
don't flatter yourself. It's not a
straight line. It's a weekly lie.

58
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,970
Well, here's the problem.

59
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,780
We've never known anything about this
animal that gave rise to all of us.

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,590
We've never known what she looked
like. We've never known, uh,

61
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,740
you know how she spent her days who'd
never known anything cause we've had no

62
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:41,610
fossils of her. But recently actually,

63
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:44,400
literally as we were reporting this story
right in the middle of our reporting,

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,090
uh,

65
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,090
a team of scientists led by a woman named
Maureen O'Leary who is herself a memo.

66
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,170
She took, uh, fossils that we do have
fossils of this creature's descendants.

67
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:58,580
And then using fancy algorithms was able
to cross reference the traits to work

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,850
our way back for the first time to a
composite picture of what we think our

69
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:07,420
great, great grandma look like. So
now Seattle, a radio lab exclusive.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,850
We present to you our
great, great, great, great

71
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,430
here. A giant rodent costume
thing runs out onto the stage.

72
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,230
All right, well this
is what she looks like.

73
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,000
And we got to point out certain
anatomical features that Papa scientists

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,140
admiration. First of all, she has
very, very pink and fleshy ears,

75
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:34,270
so show them that and
a pale soft underbelly.

76
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,150
It was all very nice for as
Jad is now demonstrating,

77
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,630
could you show them your profile
just so they can see your head?

78
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,350
Her skull is considered either
rat flight or a crocodilian.

79
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,920
You could go either way, but she
does have enormous BD, black eyes,

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,640
fleshy pink nose and would
you show them your teeth?

81
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,310
She's kind of proud of her teeth
because they can tear flesh,

82
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,790
they can rip medicine. She is an omnivore.

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,560
However, here was the issue.

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,810
You was the issue that we ran into when
we asked Maureen and the scientist who

85
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,510
did this work. We were like, okay, now
we've got an image of this creature.

86
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,740
That's amazing. What do we call her?

87
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,990
What is her name? This
was Maureen's response.

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,890
Its official name is the
hypothetical placental mammal

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,340
kind of a name. Was fat suddenly feeling
bad for this little creature? Well,

90
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:29,790
it's not something that we thought of as
we were sort of visibly working on the

91
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,100
paper. But then a funny
thing happened. Our producer,

92
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:34,890
Molly was talking to Maria
and she was saying, Jesus,

93
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:39,120
such an awful name and
Maureen system, Molly, well,

94
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,940
you can name it, and
Molly says to Marie, wait,

95
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,200
are you serious in Maureen
System, Ali? I don't know.

96
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,200
Are you serious? So we're like, hell yeah,

97
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,020
we're serious. Let's
crowd source this, right?

98
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,500
This is what mammals do these
days. We crowd source. I mean,

99
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,520
think of this opportunity. A
little radio show gets the name,

100
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,450
the ancestor of us all. So we
put out the call to the Internet.

101
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,500
We got a thousand submissions
in response. Great names.

102
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,160
Like let's send doors first.

103
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:18,140
First at Burs de Nova. Oh Ba, eh,

104
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,730
after eight rounds of voting, the
winning name was, wait for it,

105
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,690
wait for it, wait for it.

106
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,043
[inaudible]

107
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,770
on the screen. You see the following
letters appear one after another, s, c, h,

108
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,690
r, e. W. D, I, n. G, e, r,

109
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,013
shooting her,

110
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,423
shooting her.

111
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,630
I can't even tell you what a
crisis this was for the staff.

112
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,420
It's just such a bad day

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,680
and the whole experience made us wonder,
should we have died in that asteroid?

114
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,650
Do we deserve to be here? [inaudible]

115
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,750
so if you're asking yourself,
what is the moral of our story,

116
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:17,501
here's what we've shown you.

117
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:21,280
But we have a big mighty species
that died and then a smaller species,

118
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:23,530
which is you and I, we take it's place.

119
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,350
So you've gotten death and you've gotten
resurrection and you got it maybe in a

120
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:28,750
single afternoon. So that's
the argument we're making here.

121
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,260
This is Jay Molossia's
argument that it was boom over.

122
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,800
I mean it is the suddenness
of, of the whole over

123
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,780
that is kind of unimaginable.
I mean like there you are,

124
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:45,160
one day you have evolved over millions
of years to be this long neck,

125
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,170
beautiful creatures,

126
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:50,230
70 feet from your nose to your
ass and then tail or tail.

127
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,540
And then in an afternoon, like I'm on
one Tuesday afternoons, suddenly you,

128
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,490
everyone you knew gone.

129
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,330
Yeah. But there are other ways to
think about this. The extinction yes,

130
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:06,260
was sudden, but in the grand sweep of
time it wasn't. Yeah, really. In the end.

131
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:10,490
It was just a moment in a stream of
endless change cause everything we see

132
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,970
around us, the tallest
mountains, the size of oceans,

133
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,940
the animals about us that seem
so different from ourselves.

134
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,780
Every category that we have in
our heads that seems so permanent,

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,530
blurs given enough time,

136
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,590
mountains erode and become
hills. That beaches,

137
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,240
animals changed in any kind of all
kinds of ways and the only thing that's

138
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,410
constant, it's always is change.

139
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,400
You like to think of ourselves, we
humans are somehow inevitable or crucial.

140
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,080
Pivotal. The past was a time and
we were missing in the future.

141
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,180
We'll always have us in
it, but that's an illusion.

142
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,210
Says this great science
writer, Lauren Isley.

143
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,710
We are wrecked dolls made out
of many ages and skins. He says,

144
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,070
changelings who in wood nests or he
is still the uncouth guys and waddling

145
00:08:59,071 --> 00:08:59,904
amphibians.

146
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,920
We've played such roles for infinitely
longer ages and we had been men.

147
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,570
Our identity is a dream

148
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,150
[inaudible].

149
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,220
We are process not reality.

150
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,230
What we call realities as Isley
is an illusion of the day light,

151
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,950
the light of our own particular day.

152
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,123
[inaudible].

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,193
Yeah,

154
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,480
just a couple of notes before we go
on. Uh, that whole dinosaur thing,

155
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,600
but the sudden fast end,
that is just a theory. Uh,

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,500
verdict is obviously still
out. In fact, in 2011,

157
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:46,300
a team of scientists published a paper
saying that maybe the asteroid that hit

158
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,400
the earth that created that
devastation was not that distinct,

159
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,000
but another asteroid
with a different name,

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,540
but with the same size and dimensions
and all that. So who knows? Also,

161
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,120
when I said to the people up in the
balcony, if you were in the balcony,

162
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,490
you might've been killed off by heat.

163
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,040
I think that turns out
to be a little bit wrong.

164
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,890
If you've been in the
shallow ocean of the day,

165
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,790
he would've been acid rain and some other
factors would have been in not so much

166
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,713
heat.

167
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,200
Okay, so this is the part of the
show coming up where we, uh, we, we,

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,920
we traveled with a bunch of different
comedians. Patton, Oswald, Simon Amstel,

169
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,060
Ophir Eisenberg, Kurt
Braunohler. Actually, Kurt
opened this particular show.

170
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:28,980
You can see his full set at
radiolab.org/live super funny.

171
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,900
But on this night, we had two comedians.

172
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:34,650
And so right at this spot in the
middle of the show, out walks a guy,

173
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,340
one of the most talented
mammals he looks like, actually,

174
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,770
it's like someone with his
finger in an electric socket.

175
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,190
Huge amounts of here that are
standing like, ouch. You know,

176
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,320
like he's got a halo. His name

177
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,280
[inaudible]. We're just
going to play his whole set.

178
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,140
It's a little Seattle specific in
spots, but it's just, well, hello.

179
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,860
Hello, hello,

180
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,850
hello. What I get done.

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,120
And then [inaudible] 11

182
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,663
[inaudible] [inaudible]

183
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,840
[inaudible] you can eat
the, I could eat more.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,360
Oh, you're the height. Warm music.

185
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,800
Yeah. Zoom. Yeah.

186
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,110
Zoom more room.

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Microsoft.

188
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,130
Thank you. Um, this is a,

189
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,720
this is a moment that you
have to take, uh, if you can,

190
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,540
uh, and if you can't, uh, you
know, then you've lost it. But,

191
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,640
um, once you have it, once
you possess the moment, um,

192
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,580
you can do so many things with it. Um,

193
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,570
a lot of people tend to
just exist within it. Um,

194
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:33,310
others pawn it off to
moment brokers. Um, uh,

195
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,630
or if you're big fan fan of
moment. Shawn's, uh, um, you, um,

196
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,700
I can do that. Uh, also the moment,
a moment, glory blend of coffee,

197
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,010
single origin from Argentina is excellent.

198
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,390
You can get that at most
Bauhaus or participating in
Stumptown coffee roasters.

199
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,300
Um, so definitely check that out.

200
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm really stoked that we finally
closed down that awful Bauhaus. Um,

201
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,940
coffee and books. It was just
what a terrible location, right?

202
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,640
You know, right on a like a corner where
you can see it really visibly. And, um,

203
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,630
I don't like that. Um,
and, and I called the,

204
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:16,340
the city, the city
comptroller and I just said,

205
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,560
we need to get rid of it and
we need to get rid of many,

206
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,340
many buildings cause there's a lot of
those buildings are so old up on Capitol

207
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,520
Hill, it's just, it gets, it gets old. Um,

208
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,560
and so I'd like to replace them with
new constructions, um, mostly glass,

209
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:35,480
some contemporary metal. Um,

210
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,280
and I want to be able to see the
architect's idea and then see them have to

211
00:13:40,281 --> 00:13:42,550
shave off about 40% of that idea,

212
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,270
um,

213
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,750
by replacing a lot of the materials
with cheaper versions of the original

214
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:48,780
design. Um,

215
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,850
I enjoy seeing that and I would rather
see that than in a coffee shop that

216
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:53,810
promotes, um,

217
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:58,730
a type of communal living that can only
happen in an area that it is located in.

218
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,863
I just prefer it.

219
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,650
That's what I prefer. That's just me.

220
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:07,484
Sorry guys.

221
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,270
I love new buildings. Okay. Maria? My,

222
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,820
my, um, okay. So, um,
obviously as you know,

223
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,440
uh, Seattle is, is, uh, is, is
becoming Vancouver. And the thing is,

224
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,473
um,

225
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,550
I'm going to do a song,
um, that is about that.

226
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:31,480
So you guys can get a little bit more
used to the, the Vancouver Culture, um,

227
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,920
that is spreading down

228
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,560
Canada, Canada,

229
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,660
um, little, uh, uh, Mr.
Rogers reference, but, um,

230
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,180
Canada is Atlanta may belief.

231
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,013
Okay,

232
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,230
here we go. Oh,

233
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,550
okay. Okay. Here we go.

234
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,690
Any big fans of anybody born after 1990?

235
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,490
Yeah, that's about the
tonality you'd expect. Um,

236
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,610
why is it always higher?
I don't understand that.

237
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,470
Um, okay. Anyways, um, so you're
gonna know this reference.

238
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:24,640
This is a from the old,
uh, buck Rogers series,

239
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,430
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, g, Buck,

240
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,480
you know, that kind of stuff.

241
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,680
So that's for you guys after nine to 98
so you guys can relate to what I'm doing

242
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,580
on stage. And so,

243
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,423
um,

244
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,690
I hope you like this. This is, this
is definitely, definitely a song.

245
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,903
Okay.

246
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,503
[inaudible] [inaudible]

247
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,423
[inaudible]

248
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:08,950
[inaudible]

249
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,860
good moment that you

250
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,260
[inaudible] got home on my own food.

251
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,733
[inaudible]

252
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,490
[inaudible] [inaudible] right.

253
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,983
[inaudible] thank you very much.

254
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,450
Um, if you're, if you're
down, um, at a, in, in,

255
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,620
in Ballard and having
a good time, um, it's,

256
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,020
it's because there's so much
Scandinavian energy there that

257
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,390
they just do, they just do it. Right.

258
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:18,963
Um,

259
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,680
so when you hit the sunset
tavern and you're like,

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,110
why isn't this turned into a glass tower?

261
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:26,960
It's because the power of Norway,

262
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,450
it's Norway. They're going to screw
with that. You know what I mean?

263
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,130
Like Norway at all. No, what I'm saying,

264
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,940
there's no way out of this. I mean, you're
basically, you know what I'm saying?

265
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,920
It's like a hotdog. You know, you
think you want it and you're like, ah,

266
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,210
probably not. But

267
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,733
[inaudible]

268
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,680
um, and I'm pretty stoked
I've said this before,

269
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,900
but I am going to say it again
just because we're in Seattle.

270
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:04,730
I am pretty stoked. Um, I balance, uh,

271
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,270
of Vivace, um, being
replaced by the Starbucks.

272
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,690
I just think that it makes
sense. It makes sense.

273
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,160
Let the people who do it really well
do it better. You know what I'm saying?

274
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,480
That's what I'm saying.

275
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,780
So this song is going to be one of
those songs where you're gonna think to

276
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:26,520
yourself, is this better than
the original? Maybe. Okay.

277
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,713
Alright.

278
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,270
It's called pastiche in lieu
of originality. Here we go.

279
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,400
[inaudible] hey. Hi.

280
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,643
Whoa.

281
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,320
[inaudible] I want to
talk in the ones that

282
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,703
[inaudible]

283
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,560
I got it.

284
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,050
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. A little girl.

285
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,830
[inaudible] characters reading
her name's [inaudible].

286
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,583
[inaudible]

287
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,220
Yay. You, you

288
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,860
know, the thing is a, the thing is

289
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,873
I think

290
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,320
using, using, using logic, um, I think,

291
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:01,880
you know, obviously it, it is
smart to name a company after a,

292
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,920
a character from Battlestar
Galactica, but I just,

293
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,500
it makes sense.

294
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,050
And that's why I'm starting my
own coffee business called cylons.

295
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,620
Cylons coffee is the best coffee

296
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,873
[inaudible].

297
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,530
I have a new movie coming out
called silence of the lambs and, um,

298
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,110
it's a theme song, uh, is done
by Garfunkel notes. Of course,

299
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:35,111
you can probably guess what that song
is called a the sound of silence and,

300
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,770
um, which is just

301
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:44,840
[inaudible]

302
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,673
and sometimes

303
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,143
and sometimes,

304
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,963
yeah,

305
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,700
it's the sound of silence. Okay. So,

306
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,510
um, this song, thank
you for my next trick.

307
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,830
No, it's been a pleasure. This is
my last, uh, Radicchio lab and I am,

308
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,930
and I'll say no, in all seriousness.
That's a totally different show,

309
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:18,440
but I'm radio lab. Um, it's
been awesome, man. I mean, uh,

310
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,500
I discovered some really great friends
the first time I did something, um,

311
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,540
for radio lab and I continue to find
great friendships and a love and passion

312
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:31,360
for sound and um,

313
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,160
science and knowledge and art. And
so I think that, um, I'm lucky,

314
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,930
lucky to be a part of it in this small
way that I am. So thanks, Radiolab,

315
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,050
wherever you are.

316
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,170
Okay. So this is a, it's
a quick song that goes.

317
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,710
Okay. Okay. And, uh, this song is,

318
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,510
this song is a, that's
a, that's a good one.

319
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,803
Okay. There we go.

320
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,340
[inaudible] oh.

321
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,770
[inaudible] the snow.

322
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,793
[inaudible] [inaudible]

323
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,783
[inaudible]

324
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,440
but no, we know

325
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,990
and is nine.

326
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,040
Oh Du du, du Du du Du, Du, Du, Du, Du

327
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:12,880
[inaudible].

328
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,880
When I facing those dumb lizards walking
cross this barren plane last born baby,

329
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:28,981
ya can go and blame when
those [inaudible] go.

330
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,650
Tear into the sky,

331
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,830
squawking with the laser precision
swooping down seeking breeze and no wait.

332
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,380
That shining

333
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,240
little.in the distance is
not a super extra shiny star.

334
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:54,451
All the astro physicist dinosaurs
would have said in that time before the

335
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,780
[inaudible].

336
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,730
Uh Huh.

337
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,703
Matt.

338
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It was great to see the
earth concoct his dreams.

339
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,050
Large Lizard family,

340
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,340
those lizards made sounds and attacked
each other in more coats and clothing.

341
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:24,581
But whoa,

342
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:28,840
well all of that got burned off in the
evidence of the natural intellectual

343
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:33,100
society may not be
apparent to us. Whoa. Ooh.

344
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,473
I know

345
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,220
what happened to the sleaze stacks.

346
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,150
What happened to blow
those slurping sleaze,

347
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,130
eggs moving,

348
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:50,131
and probably a top speed of three miles
per hour or the aliens that donated

349
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:55,660
genetic material to the hominy hands in
order to create the society people that

350
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:56,494
we are now.

351
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,310
This explains our fascination for diamonds
and goals because we've just kinda

352
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,670
dug it up for their spaceships. Oh,

353
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,700
Yay.

354
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,853
[inaudible] [inaudible]

355
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,100
[inaudible] no knowing me, knowing
me, nobody. Nobody. Nobody,

356
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,080
nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.
Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.

357
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,440
Nobody. Nobody. Nobody my age.
Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody.

358
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,003

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,113
[inaudible]

361
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,673
okay.

362
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,410
Thank you so much guys.

363
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:55,850
[inaudible] [inaudible]

364
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,290
let's just take stock
for a second. Robert,

365
00:27:57,291 --> 00:28:00,320
we did our super fast radical dyno ending.

366
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,460
Reggie did his Reggie ending, which,

367
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,990
which you never quite sure
what he's saying. You know?

368
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,780
Can you imagine we have
scripts having magic.

369
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:10,880
If I just want you over through the river

370
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,483
[inaudible]

371
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,450
it would be outer space, man.
Okay, so what's the, what's next?

372
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:19,790
What's our next step? I think we're
ready for the pink ending now.

373
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,390
The pink thing, you mean like the color?
Yeah, this is the one that answered,

374
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:26,210
I think the most basic question you
could ask in a show like this. This asks,

375
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,520
when did endings begin?

376
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,950
It's a serious question. That's a
weird one. When did endings begin?

377
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,950
Wouldn't there always, I mean
the moment you had beginnings,

378
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:40,940
wouldn't that then imply an end because
the beginnings have to do something and

379
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,010
you'd think so, but if you think hard
about the origin of the universe,

380
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,960
I would propose that
when the universe began,

381
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:52,250
which by some interpretation was a huge
explosion of energy which then condensed

382
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:56,210
and cooled into matter that that whole
event came in without any notion of

383
00:28:56,211 --> 00:29:00,920
endings at all. Huh? When you get
matter, when you get that condensation,

384
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,630
you get a list of elements which we can
now turn to in the periodic table of

385
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:10,100
elements with which you I'm sure very
familiar and enjoy every evening before

386
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,570
dining or sleeping. Keith here now puts
the periodic table up on the screen.

387
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,210
So if we look at this at this chart,

388
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,270
let me start up in the upper left hand
side of the hydrogen and we move through

389
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,230
it, the helium and lithium and beryllium
and Boron and carbon and on and on.

390
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,520
As we move through the list,

391
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:29,750
I can tell you that every one of the
first 82 elements on this chart with two

392
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,130
exceptions, which I'll
mention in a minute,

393
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,270
every one of these has a version of
itself that goes on forever and ever and

394
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:39,500
ever until the end of time. Every one
of these you're saying is immortal.

395
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,130
Is that what you're saying? Yes. Now
here's the thing. When we get to, um,

396
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,690
number 83 B, that's business.

397
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,590
I would argue that this is
where the universe invents
in things. Really what is,

398
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,880
what is business? It's a rock,
a kind of a shiny black rock.

399
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,710
And you're saying this shiny black rock
is, is, is where death begins. Yes. Yes.

400
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,200
I would say that that's a fair
apply. Would that be well,

401
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,290
because all the atoms at the bottom of
this chart are a little heavier than the

402
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,100
ones on the top.

403
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,600
Meaning they have lots and lots
of of neutrons and protons here.

404
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,070
Keith brings up an image of a
business. Adam with lots of jiggling,

405
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,500
protons and neutrons. There's
so many of them. As you can see,

406
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:18,610
they're having a little trouble holding
their themselves together and French

407
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:23,470
scientists studying this. Adam
recently determined that inevitably,

408
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,280
inevitably something will happen to
this. Adam. It goes something like this.

409
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,330
Protons and neutrons fly off the atom
and Amazingly Roberts Pew was perfectly

410
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:37,900
timed in this case with Keith hitting
the button to do it visually and that had

411
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,190
never happened before. Whoa.

412
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,300
Do that again. Okay. I don't
think I can do it twice. No,

413
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,450
you don't add sound effects. I'm to
the sound effects when you do that

414
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,320
one more time. Oh Man.

415
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,670
Now you're bringing strike made him angry.

416
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,453
Stop it.

417
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,090
The point I'm trying to make
Keith, is that this Adam,

418
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:13,910
when it loses protons,
it loses its identity.

419
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,100
What an Adam decays this.

420
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:18,680
Adam is no longer bismuth if it doesn't
have the right number of programs.

421
00:31:18,681 --> 00:31:21,470
That's the way chemistry you were saying
like as it as it sheds its protons and

422
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:24,080
neutrons, it's dying. That's
right. Now here's the cool thing.

423
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,470
When we go back to the chart to number
83 every element after it po at room for

424
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,100
raw riff, dubs, dis and rig elements,

425
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,580
84 to one 18 also decay.

426
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,990
So on the periodic table you see two
teams basically that once the top there,

427
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,230
forever hours they go forever. And on
the bottom you have the ones that die,

428
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,370
right? That's correct, that's correct.
But with the two exceptions I mentioned,

429
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,940
I should say 43 and 61 that's
tech medium and promethium.

430
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,730
Nobody really likes those too.

431
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,310
There I find them actually unnecessary.
I'll tell you what if they,

432
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,190
if they mess up the whole logic here,
let's just, let's just get rid of them.

433
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,900
Let's to get rid of them. Get
Out, get them out of here.

434
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,460
We just spoke two holes into the table.

435
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,670
Let me just say when we
divided up like this,

436
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,630
now you can see that bismuth is at a
dividing line, maybe of the universe.

437
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,340
Cause this is like, this is where you see,

438
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,560
it's like the KT boundary
with the dinosaurs. This is a,

439
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,170
this is the for everything.
For everything, but the cute,

440
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:27,840
cool thing is business is
pretty good for you. Really.

441
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,260
People swallow a little bits of business
every time they get Tommy x to do this

442
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:35,190
all the time. You recognize this color,
maybe screen fills the think pink.

443
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:39,560
I mentioned, do you recognize the
product associated with this color?

444
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,760
You know this product. Pepto-Bismol.
Yeah, but just say it, right?

445
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,660
Say it the way it should be. Said pepto.
What did I say? What? Bismol no, no.

446
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,550
Say the only, the first syllable pepto is,

447
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,300
are you applying that you're playing
the Bismol stands for business.

448
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,880
I don't have to imply
it's true. [inaudible]

449
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,570
I don't know Robert and I was with
you right up until this point,

450
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,490
but if I had to guess,

451
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,760
I would say that Bismol is just the name
of the dude that made pepto B j Jake f

452
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,110
Bismol. I'm telling you that
each bottle of pink liquid,

453
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:16,000
there are little black rocks and that's
just the truth. I don't know man.

454
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't know. [inaudible] relevant to me.

455
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,700
I hear Robert Appears on the
screen in chemistry goggles,

456
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,380
you know, laboratories with
eight chemistry teacher.

457
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:32,381
By my time in Brooklyn and what you
then see us do is we take in tablets of

458
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,520
Pepto B. We Mush them up with a
mortar and pestle. We add some water,

459
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:40,220
we add some hydrochloric acid,
we shake it some aluminum,

460
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,490
and you get to see little bits of
black rock precipitate out of the pepto

461
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:49,130
bismal. Lots of them. I was surprised
at how much black stuff is in there.

462
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,400
And then I showed the test
tube to Jack Jad. Look,

463
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:57,401
you can't deny scientific fact at hiding
inside every single pepto bismal tablet

464
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,750
is pure street-level
grade crystal business

465
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,140
in the side, pepto B.

466
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,040
You will find an element
that not only cures eggs,

467
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,610
barely and introduces death
to the universe. I think
it's such a great element.

468
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,280
We should have a toast to
business. Yeah, it's toast.

469
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,713
[inaudible]

470
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,970
can we close the segment by both
of us taking two big pint glasses,

471
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,490
filling them up to the top
with pepto Bismol Chunky

472
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,443
[inaudible].

473
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,230
You always did it faster just by a hair.

474
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,110
So special thanks to Gail Carnow,

475
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,600
my chemist Sam keen who
helped write this thing.

476
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,190
Lauren swarthout who got us study,

477
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,160
got us the lab connection
and Zack Fan and who shot it,

478
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,330
edited it and re edited
it and re edited it.

479
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,060
In typical Radiolab fashion,

480
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,850
it's there now we will pause
only to do some business.
