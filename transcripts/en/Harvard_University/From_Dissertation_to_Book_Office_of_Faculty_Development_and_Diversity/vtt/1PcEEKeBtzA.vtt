00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.280
SPEAKER 1: Now we are going
to move on to our responses

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.630
from a couple of distinguished
professors at Harvard.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.690
First is Erez Manela,
Professor of History.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.070
And then Peter Der Manuelian,
the Philip J. King Professor

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.360
of Egyptology will follow.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.053
And then we'll take
your questions.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.660
EREZ MANELA: Well,
thanks to the organizers

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.650
for inviting me to do this, and
thank you all for being here.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.560
I think the perspective
that I can offer

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.600
will be very different
from that that you just

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.660
heard from the editors because
I don't have their experience

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.610
in receiving manuscripts
and don't generally

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.850
have the vastness of their
experience in the publishing

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.540
world.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.990
What I can say is based
on my own experience,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.770
having published my
dissertation book in 2007,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.570
having some other dealings with
publishers over other projects,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.000
and speaking to
colleagues and friends

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.280
about their own experiences.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.560
And the one thing that has
struck me with that experience

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.000
is how diverse and how
different these experiences can

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.300
be across disciplines, across
fields within a discipline,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.510
and among different presses.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.760
So for example,
to give an example

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.150
with the divergence
between disciplines,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.770
I don't know much
about linguistics

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.850
but my impression of monographs
in linguistics that I have seen

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.230
is that they tend to be
full of specialist jargon.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.370
They tend to speak to
a very narrow audience.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.070
And yet, at least those
that I've seen obviously

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.900
got published.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.760
I don't know, of course,
how many got rejected.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.290
But it seems at least
within that discipline,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.370
the norms of
monograph publications

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.070
do call for that type of format.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.540
Now on the other
hand, within the field

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960
of history, which
is my own field,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.090
I have seen people publish their
first books, their dissertation

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.280
books, with trade publishers.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.740
And in fact, I have seen
one of my own colleagues

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.060
win the Pulitzer Prize
for their first book based

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.340
on their dissertation.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.680
It's not common.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.270
I wouldn't expect it, but
it does, it does happen.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.790
And in fact, within
the fields in history

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.130
that I am most closely
associated with, that is,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.190
Modern American history,
Cold War history,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.760
international
relations, I think there

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.640
is quite a good
chunk of first books

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.570
that get published with trade
presses, with Random House,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.320
with Blackwell, several others
that I could name if I gave it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.580
a few minutes of thought.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.510
But it's not that rare.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.870
There's also a diversity
among institutions.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.360
I think there are
different institutions,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.990
different departments, view
publishing your first book

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.730
with a trade press differently.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.630
And so whichever department, or
institution if you're from MIT,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.010
you're in, try to get a sense
of what your colleagues might

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.730
think about your choice to
publish with a trade press.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.710
In some contexts, it might
be seen as a poor decision.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.710
In other contexts-- certainly
if it wins a Pulitzer Prize,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.120
and that book was
published by trade press,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.560
I forget which one,
but by a trade press--

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.110
it might be seen as
a brilliant decision.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.740
Now even within the scope
of university presses,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.840
there are significant
differences

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.190
I've found by talking to
people who have published

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.010
in different presses and by
reading books that have been

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.550
published in different presses.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.520
So for example, while some
presses will never publish

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.510
footnotes, that is, the
notes that are actually

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.360
at the foot of the
page, and will rarely

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.390
publish bibliographies,
other presses

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.120
regularly publish footnotes
and almost always publish

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.450
bibliographies.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.330
And so depending on what kind
of book you want to publish

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.920
and on who you think
your audiences are,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.210
it really pays to
do your research

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.260
on the different presses, to
look at books that they have

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.230
published recently
in your field,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.420
and to see if just in terms
of the format of the book--

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.980
footnotes versus endnotes,
art versus no art,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.430
bibliography versus
no bibliography,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.250
length of the book,
and so on and so forth,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.980
design-- whether these are,
this is the sort of format

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.390
that you imagine for your book.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.990
And if you do that
kind of research,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.700
I think you'll be
much, much happier

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.990
and perhaps have much quicker
success in the process

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.670
of finding a publisher.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.110
I've heard before from a
number of editors the advice

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.500
of eliminating jargon.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.620
Certainly some presses
emphasize that.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.404
On the other hand, for
example Duke University Press,

00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:20.320
I haven't seen a single
book they've published

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.040
that isn't full of jargon.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.980
And so again, there's
a significant amount

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.970
of diversity.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.070
With regard to length,
yes, 100,000 words

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.320
is a common recommendation.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.948
On the other hand, and
I've just now finished

00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:40.576
a-- in parentheses, I teach
a lot of what we call,

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:42.450
to my graduate students
and occasionally even

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.810
to undergraduates, what
we call first books.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.270
First books, that is, books
based on dissertations

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.660
because I think
graduate students

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.140
have a great deal to learn
from reading books that

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.830
are based on these sort
of intellectual projects

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.740
that they are beginning
to be engaged in.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.630
And so I read and have
read recently, first books,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.650
not just in my own field but
in a number of other fields.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.640
And so we just taught a book
called Gay New York, which

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.840
was published in 1994.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.260
It was based on a
dissertation, is a major,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.020
still considered a
major contribution

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.160
to American history, to queer
history, to gender history,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.910
and is at least twice as long as
the recommended 100,000 words.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.290
I can easily think of four
or five other examples,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.480
recent, more or less,
recent examples that

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.240
are much longer than that.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.350
My own book,
incidentally, is not,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.730
just because I don't like
to write a great deal.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.800
I prefer to say
things succinctly.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.200
But there are contexts and
there are ways in which you

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.890
need to say things at length.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.810
You need to have
thick descriptions.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.790
And some presses
do publish books

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.790
that are significantly
longer, do take a chance

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.290
on books that are significantly
longer if they think they're

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.244
important enough, if they think
they will sell significantly,

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:01.160
if they think they'll
be taught in classrooms,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.826
if they think they'll
go into a backlist

00:07:02.826 --> 00:07:05.560
where, 16 years later, people
are still teaching them

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.930
in courses.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.850
And so I don't
know what exactly,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.230
what set of judgments
editors have

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.120
in deciding whether to take a
chance on a book in that way

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.390
or not.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.910
But certainly just
looking at things

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.850
that have been published
more or less recently,

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:28.550
you can see a great diversity
of formats, of lengths,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.730
of shapes, forms, sizes.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.930
Now with regard to
getting a contract,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.580
approaching a
publisher, again, I've

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.660
found, at least
in my discipline,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.720
a significant
diversity among fields.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.390
It's fairly common
for me when I talk

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.870
to people in fields
that are considered,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.580
I suppose, by presses a
less marketable-- let's

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.700
say, I don't know,
medieval Russian history--

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.740
that they experience,
it's just an example,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.940
that they have significant, it
takes them a significant amount

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.190
of time to find a publisher.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.560
And it's not an easy process.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.920
I've rarely come across
a colleague, you know,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.820
who's at Harvard
or has graduated

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.510
from Harvard, who did not
manage to find a publisher ever.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.000
That's despite trying.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.880
But it can be a long and
can be an arduous process.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.840
On the other hand, and
I think, and I actually

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.710
would like to pose this as
a question to our colleagues

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.539
here from the presses, my
sense here is that in general,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.700
and again, there are
differences between presses,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.230
in general, academic presses,
university presses, have,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.990
are more reluctant
now to publish

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.750
what they see is narrow
monographs than they might

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.390
have been 10 or 20 years ago.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.240
On the other hand,
there's a flipside.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.200
They're more eager, I think
now, to publish things

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.810
that they think will have
a substantial market.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.950
So what that has meant for
people in American history,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.880
in Cold War history, again,
which is fields that I know,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.750
are fields that
I know very well,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:17.015
is that we are finding it very
easy to get publishing offers.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.890
In fact, we oftentimes--
and I've heard this,

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.220
I've experienced
this myself, I've

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.060
heard this from
others-- we don't

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.910
need to approach publishers
because publishers approach us.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.720
They somehow hear
about the projects

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.310
and they send us
inquiries about,

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.630
would you be interested
in sending me

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.360
a chapter or a proposal or
something along these lines.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.480
Quite a few of my
colleagues have

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.090
been approached by literary
agents, again, out of the blue

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.810
because they've heard
about their projects.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.600
I've so far myself have resisted
that temptation for reasons

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.266
which I can discuss in the
Q&amp;A if anyone is interested,

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:58.640
but quite a few
of my colleagues,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.181
again, in the fields of Cold
War and Modern American history,

00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:03.360
do have literary agents
and do publish through

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.600
literary agents, sometimes
placing their books

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.670
in university presses,
sometimes placing

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.740
their books in trade presses.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.070
And they have
found agents to be,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.100
so you probably didn't
want me to mention agents

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.260
in this context.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
I know it's a freighted,
it's a freighted issue.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.390
But they find them especially
useful in that part

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.120
about negotiating that
Phillip just mentioned

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.210
at the tail end of his talk.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.760
And while it's true that on the
whole, publishing with an agent

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.740
is more common in one's later
books, not the dissertation

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.600
books, I can think of,
again, quite a few examples

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.080
of colleagues who
have had an agent even

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.630
with their first book.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.460
So again, there's a great deal
and great degree of diversity

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.830
in this experience, I've found.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.960
And I'd like to keep my
remarks short so I'll end here.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.800
I'm eager to hear what
questions you have

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.315
and to respond to your concerns.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.250
PETER DER MANUELIAN:
Shall we move on to me?

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.430
Or, OK.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.980
Great.
