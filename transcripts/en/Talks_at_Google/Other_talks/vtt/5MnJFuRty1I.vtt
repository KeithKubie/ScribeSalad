JASON KRUEGER: I'm
super excited to be here

00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:05.259
with Doug Merlino
for talks at Google.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.800
Doug is an author
who's been featured

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.710
in a bunch of
magazines, such as Vice,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.231
Men's Journal, Wired, and Slate.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.730
He's also written
a couple of books.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.760
And today, we're going to talk
about his latest book, which

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.710
is called "Beast: Blood,
Struggle and Dreams

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.290
at the Heart of
Mixed Martial Arts."

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.470
So quick overview.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.840
If you're a fan of the sport,
mixed martial arts, or MMA,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.460
it's been exploding in
popularity over the last 20

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.600
to 25 years or so.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.900
If you're a fan, you're probably
familiar with the UFC, which

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.720
is the Ultimate
Fighting Championship

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.570
and, by far, the most popular
promotional event of the sport.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.950
Essentially, MMA was, kind
of, invented off of this age

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.070
old question, which martial
art is the most effective?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.790
For generations, people would
train in Maotai, or kickboxing,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.470
or jiu-jitsu And
pretty much, you'd

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.510
spend your entire life
training one martial

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.990
art committed to that art
because there was no format

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.230
to really test it.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.209
So the UFCs, kind of,
came to be in 1993.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.440
A bunch of Brazilian
jiu-jitsu practitioners

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.310
put this event on.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.350
And it brought fighters
of all shapes and sizes

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.350
from all over the world.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.308
And they specialized in
different martial arts.

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:15.810
And they put an event on to
really answer that question,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.520
which martial art is the best.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.650
So essentially, the rules are
similar to boxing in the sense

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.640
that there is points.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.980
But the actual objective is
to knock out your opponent.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.360
But in jiu-jitsu one of
the things that is popular

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.960
is submissions, which is
chokes or joint locks.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.810
So essentially, at the end
of three to five rounds

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.160
if no one's won, whomever
has won the most points

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.980
by the judges wins.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.650
So that's the basic format.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.224
It's no denying that the UFC
or MMA is a violent sport.

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:48.640
And that's one of
the things we're

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.724
going to talk a little
bit about today.

00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:53.390
But I think once you get to know
the details that Doug can, kind

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.010
of, share, you'll be a
little surprised that there's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.410
a lot of precautions for the
fighters health and making sure

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.390
they don't get injured.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.181
While it's, obviously,
a very violent sport

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:07.220
with many injuries, it
probably ranks slightly lower

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.550
than boxing, or
hockey, or football.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.700
So Doug, basically, spent
more than two years living

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.860
and fully immersed
with the American Top

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.900
Team, which is one of
the most popular training

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600
facilities in Florida.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.297
So his book is, essentially,
a first person perspective

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:26.380
of the lives of the fighters,
the business of MMA,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.346
and the history of fighting.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:29.720
But what I found
most interesting

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.280
was the highs and the lows that
these fighters went through.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.259
As you can imagine,
it's a very tough sport.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.800
You only fight a
couple times a year.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.930
So winning and losing is,
pretty much, everything.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.290
So he got to know
these guys really well,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.552
traveled all around the world,
and if you're an avid MMA fan,

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:46.260
it's definitely a cool
book to check out.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.770
But if you're curious to
learn more about the sport

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.740
or if you, perhaps, hold an
opinion that violence shouldn't

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.530
be promoted in
sports, maybe Doug

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.940
can share some
perspective on that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.580
and see if that opinion changes.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.955
So yeah, is that
a quick summary?

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:02.246
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, it's great.

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:03.096
JASON KRUEGER: Nice.

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:04.004
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:08.330
So thanks, Jason, for doing
this, for hosting this,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.770
and Google.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.630
I guess before I
even get started,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.400
I'm wondering how
many of you guys

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.200
either watch mixed martial
arts or do a martial art.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.048
Wow.

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:24.360
Well what do you guys do?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.110
Jiu-jitsu, boxing?

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.460
JASON KRUEGER: Shout it out.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.810
It's all good.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.710
AUDIENCE: Jiu-jitsu.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.082
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:30.767
AUDIENCE: Kenpo.

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:31.600
DOUG MERLINO: Kenpo?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.332
Cool.

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:33.880
AUDIENCE: I'm just a rapid fan.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.680
DOUG MERLINO: Nice.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.360
I mean, one reason I'm asking
is I've done a few book talks

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.400
and things at bookstores,
and I've talked

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.640
to the Columbia wrestling team.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.710
And there's a wide range
talking to wrestlers.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.970
They're receptive and,
sure, I get what it's about.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.875
In book stores, I've actually
had a very hostile reception

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.250
from people who
go to bookstores.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.530
They're like, why?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.470
This is totally sick.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.410
Why would you glorify
this in a book.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.840
And so, usually, when
you go to a bookstore,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.160
you don't get that.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.597
So I think it's a little bit
of a contentious subject.

00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:14.680
And hopefully, we can shed
some light on it today.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.860
And it's nice that most of
you guys have a basis in it.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.070
The way I got started and it
was actually just pure curiosity

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.140
about four years ago.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.210
My neighbor here in New
York was a big fan of UFC.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.830
And he kept telling me like, oh,
you got to come watch a fight.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.130
You got to come watch a fight.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.290
So I was like, OK, fine.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.160
We go to a bar.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.730
And it's packed in.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.360
It was a big UFC fight.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.210
And you know the feeling
when you're watching a fight.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.060
Everyone's, kind of, pumped up.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.040
It's an exciting thing.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.080
It's two men or two
women really going

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.110
at each other in what you'd
call the ultimate contest.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.260
And as we're watching
this not knowing, really,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.860
anything about it,
I thought, like--

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.490
well it's kind of crazy
because in my lifetime,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.290
this is a sport that's--
I remember when it started

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.060
in 1993.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.620
My friends and I
were like, oh, whoa.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.370
Like, they're going to be
ultimate fighting, cool.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.260
And after, it's grown
into a legitimate sport.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.830
It's broadcast on Fox.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.200
There's billboards
in Times Square.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.270
But I was watching
these guys thinking,

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.620
like, you see Brazilians,
you see Japanese, Americans,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.170
Europeans, and thinking where
do these guys come from?

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.700
Like, what's the deal?

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.140
What's the model of this?

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.606
I mean, I know nothing about it.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.160
How did this thing
even start happening?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.700
And when you look around, there
wasn't a lot written about it.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.460
There's not a ton
written, seriously,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.900
about MMA because I think
it's still a bit underground.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.740
Even as it gets more
and more popular,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.350
I found a lot of places don't
really want to touch it.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:13.150
A lot of editors you talk to
think it's gross or below them.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.730
So basically, I looked
around and found

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.910
there's about four or
five really big gyms

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.020
in the country that train
dozens and dozens of guys.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.170
One of these is American Top
Team, which is in Florida.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.990
It's subsidized by a guy who
has a timeshare and cruise ship

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.900
business.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.620
And it gets guys from
all over the world.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.200
So I went down there.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.839
And the first day I walked
in, I'm watching practice.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.630
Anyone can walk in.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.990
It's a very open sport.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.870
Anyone can walk in.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.400
Not like you could go
to the New York Giants

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.467
and walk into their
practice and just sit there.

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:53.050
But I walk in.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.430
No one bothers me.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.840
And I'm seeing people
from all over the world

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.130
and this whole scene.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.910
Kind of like a gladiator
scene of this training.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.505
And I was thinking
this is amazing.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.930
This is an amazing thing
here that no one's really

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.680
written about.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.080
And I talked to
some of the coaches.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.080
And they were very
open and said,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.410
well, if you want to
learn about this sport,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.320
you've come to the right place.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.780
Come into the gym.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.590
Follow us.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.860
Come to our fights.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.650
Do whatever you want.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.604
And so that's how this
project got started.

00:07:32.604 --> 00:07:33.506
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah.

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:35.010
And what surprised you most?

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.450
Like, did you have any
initial perceptions

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.390
of what fighters were like?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.137
I think, especially with the
promotions on television,

00:07:42.137 --> 00:07:43.970
you know, they're trying
to promote a fight.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.860
So you see only a quick
glimpse into their lives.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.750
But what did you expect?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.360
And when you got in
there, what did you see?

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.670
DOUG MERLINO: I mean,
really, to be honest,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.810
I was scared going in.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.310
I was nervous.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.400
And like, I'd been a
journalist for a while

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.930
and covered all
types of situations,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.240
and been in some weird places.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.430
So I always know you have
preconceived notions.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.025
But try to set it to the side
when you go in someplace.

00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:20.080
But of course you're seeing
the guys who are jacked up,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.050
and they've got
tattoos everywhere,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.480
and cauliflower
ear, and they make

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.465
a living imposing their
will on other human beings.

00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:33.789
So at some level, I
thought these guys

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.700
are going to be really scary.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:44.080
And in that preconception,
actually, that

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.420
was gone after a day or two.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.630
I started talking to fighters.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.450
And you know, these
guys I was talking

00:08:53.450 --> 00:09:00.530
to were very humble, very quiet,
and surprisingly thoughtful.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:04.790
And I think that was one
of the first indications

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.540
that, oh, maybe there is
really something here.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.680
Like, this is
pretty interesting.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.340
These guys aren't what one
might think right off the bat.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.610
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I actually
practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.330
Been training about
seven years or so.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.900
A couple of my training
partners are actually here.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.910
And you know, the
one thing we always

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.920
talk about is how if you're
not really in the mindset

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.639
where you can handle losing,
you usually leave very quickly.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.180
So there's a lot of
guys who come in.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.515
They're big, big weight lifters.

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:37.400
Maybe they've done some boxing.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.190
And the truth is, if
you're not trained,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.270
it's a very technical
sport, Brazilian jiu-jitsu

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.020
But it's pretty much
the same whether it's

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.010
Maotai, or kickboxing,
or even wrestling.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.945
And any wrestler
from high school

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:49.940
will tell you it
builds character.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.880
And if you can't
handle that, you're

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.300
pretty much out right away.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.850
So what's left is, sort
of, like a filtered group

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.146
of people that are generally
capable of being humbled.

00:09:59.146 --> 00:10:01.170
And was that the
perception you saw?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.290
And were there outliers to that?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.580
Or was that, pretty much,
the dominant presence there?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.788
DOUG MERLINO: I think that
was the dominant presence.

00:10:07.788 --> 00:10:10.460
I mean, they had sparring
sessions a couple nights

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.270
a week, which could
be really intense.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:18.460
We're talking 50 men
and a small minority

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.040
of women who train there
facing off and sparring.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.160
These are some of the
best in the world.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.050
And different nights
is different energy.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.925
Some nights, it's
fairly low key.

00:10:29.925 --> 00:10:32.300
And other nights, there's like
a really aggressive energy

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.790
in there that you can really
feel all through your body.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.570
So these are really, really
highly trained individuals,

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.744
champions.

00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:45.910
But you know, they're facing
off against each other.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:51.220
And you would see
at this top level

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.640
the edge between winning
and losing on any night,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.430
the margin was so
slim that even if you

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.910
are one of the best
fighters in the world,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.930
and this is what they
tell me, like, yeah,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:08.190
I can come into practice
and really get beaten down.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.950
So it's hard.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.420
When you're at that
level, you realize

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.050
every little thing counts.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.220
Every mental edge, your physical
being, and how you feel.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.475
And I think, maybe, if
you train in a little gym

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:20.850
and you're really athletic,
and you can beat everyone up,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.490
sure, you might
feel really macho.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.710
But when you get that high,
necessarily, it humbles you.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.230
Now that being said,
there's a couple fighters

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.950
who weren't like that who
definitely had temper problems

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.410
and other things like that.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.520
And these guys, this minority,
is still pretty high.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.740
But really, the
higher you get, I

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.060
can't think of any fight
who has gotten really

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.290
to the highest level who still
has that thing because you

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.790
hit a point.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.040
You really have to control
your mind and your reactions.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.237
And the higher you get, the
more imperative that becomes.

00:11:59.237 --> 00:12:01.070
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I
think in competition,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.590
one of the things-- I
compete a little bit

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.460
in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.730
And it's definitely
not the same.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:05.660
You don't get punched.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.710
Brazilian jiu-jitsu
is just grappling.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.280
It's basically wrestling,
except it, sort of, embraces

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.780
being on your back
where, wrestling,

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.340
the goal is to get pinned.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.265
So the goal in jiu-jitsu is
to get joint locks or chokes

00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:17.140
and things like that.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.820
But you know, you
quickly realize

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.990
that if your vibe is about,
like, high adrenaline, which

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.980
you think will give you energy,
it, kind of, blocks the mind.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.280
And I think very
quickly if you just

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.370
observe the highest
level of fighters,

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.990
you realize that
they're thinking

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.669
two, three, four steps ahead.

00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:36.460
They're watching their
opponents movements.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.790
They're adapting.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.350
And counter-intuitively, it's
not about getting raged up.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.090
And at that moment, you
don't think very clearly.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.110
And especially for energy
conservation and things

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.784
like that, I think
it's very quick.

00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:51.450
And you don't even
have to be a fighter.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.040
You just have to be around them.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.040
And be around the top
fighters, for sure.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.980
I think one thing
I noticed-- I've

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.170
trained at many martial
arts facilities,

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.540
from MMA to just
jiu-jitsu-- and you know,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.800
you can go to the
smaller places.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.556
But you quickly realize when the
instruction level has surpassed

00:13:08.556 --> 00:13:10.500
what you can get from it.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.949
And I think it sounds
like American Top Team is

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:15.490
like a breeding ground of people
that have left their smaller

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.980
communities and decided
to go to the big place

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.400
and say I was the best in
my local town, my region,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.514
but I need to go and
get humbled again.

00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:25.180
Can you tell us a
little bit about where

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.240
those fighters came from?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.810
And maybe they were the
best where they came from.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.210
And then they came
to ATT, and they just

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.674
started from the ground again.

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:35.715
Any specific fighters come
to mind in that sense?

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:41.525
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, I mean,
to give a specific example,

00:13:41.525 --> 00:13:43.316
I think we got this
slide of Mirsad Bektic.

00:13:43.316 --> 00:13:43.760
JASON KRUEGER: Oh, yeah.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.610
I think we got a
couple up there.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.860
DOUG MERLINO: Let's go to him.

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.220
JASON KRUEGER: Who
are you thinking of?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.056
DOUG MERLINO: Mirsad.

00:13:52.056 --> 00:13:52.892
JASON KRUEGER: Oh, Mirsad, yeah.

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:54.180
DOUG MERLINO: There he is.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.760
All right, so Mirsad Bektic.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.200
Truly, someone I really
respect and admire.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.780
So he's a good story of who
these guys in the sport are.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.040
So I mean, when I got
to this gym, of course,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.160
one thing I asked the coaches,
I mean, I want to write a book.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.806
And I want to follow a
few guys through the ups

00:14:21.806 --> 00:14:22.930
and downs of their careers.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:24.660
And I have to choose the guys.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.190
And so I asked, who's your
top prospect in this gym?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.450
And it was unanimous that
it's-- he was 22 at the time--

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.930
this kid, Mirsad Bektic.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:43.980
And so he was born in 1991 in
Bosnia when the Bosnian War was

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.420
started in Srebrenica, which if
you know that war in, I think,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:55.000
1995, 8,000 Bosnians,
men and boys,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.150
were rounded up there and
murdered in a couple days.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.260
So he was born there.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.070
But as a baby, as things
were going downhill,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.460
his mom was like, we
gotta get outta here.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.960
So she took him
and his brothers.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.740
His dad stayed to fight.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.610
And they went.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.920
They were in a refugee
camp in Germany,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.910
I think, until he was nine.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.546
And I think it's somewhat
still relevant because I've

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.670
been talking to him lately.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.586
As you see, all the
people coming out of Syria

00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:25.620
and going to Germany.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.550
This was a generation before.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.910
When he was nine,
she got permission

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.650
to emigrate to the US.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.580
They end up going
to Lincoln, Nebraska

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.110
where there's, actually, a
fairly big Bosnian community.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.590
They live there.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.370
I mean, I've been
back there with him.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.220
And you know, they're very poor.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.960
His mom is working as an
orderly in a hospital.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.070
This is getting to be post 9/11.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.814
So having a Muslim
background's hard.

00:15:55.814 --> 00:15:57.730
You know, he's saying,
at Lincoln High School,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.830
you have all these ethnicities
from all over the world.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.530
And everyone fights.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.840
Everyone fights.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.280
And he's getting bullied.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.720
People make fun of
him for, like he said,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.440
he was this kid
from a refugee camp.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.620
He was a European.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.270
He had long hair
and all this stuff.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.510
And so they're bullied,
bullied, bullied.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.760
He watches his older
brother get beat up.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.260
And he went through
all these phases

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.180
of trying to act like
Tupac and whatnot.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.275
But he said when he was about
15, he watched a UFC fight.

00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:30.900
He saw this fighter,
George St. Pierre,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.540
who's a really
amazing fighter who's

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.755
a very self-possessed,
real martial artist.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.860
Yeah, he's right
here on the screen.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.150
The guy doing the kick.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.220
And so he watches George
St. Pierre and he thinks,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.860
wow, here's a guy
who is a role model.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.790
He's totally in
control of himself.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.280
People look up to him.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.530
No one can bully him.

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.680
That's exactly
what I want to be.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.763
I want to be a role model.

00:17:02.763 --> 00:17:05.690
I don't want to be
this Tupac loving,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.240
kind of, wannabe be hooligan.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.260
I want to be somebody.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.176
What am I going to do?

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:10.490
I mean, he's a very smart guy.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.410
But college is going
to be a stretch for him

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.089
with his financial situation.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.890
And he's not
getting good grades.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.290
So he starts doing martial
arts at a little gym there.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.680
I mean really humble beginnings.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.220
As humble as you can imagine.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.550
And of a sudden in his life,
everything clicks into focus.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.250
It's like this is
his whole thing.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.500
And he trains, and trains,
and trains, and trains.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.350
And his grades come up.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.010
And he showed me a
clip after high school.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.950
The newspaper did a
series of profiles

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.600
on kids who were troubled kids
and turned his life around.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.230
And as he graduates
from high school,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.825
he's telling the reporter
MMA turned my life around,

00:17:52.825 --> 00:17:55.450
and I'm going to be in the UFC,
and I'm going to be a champion.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.200
It's that age.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.575
And he's like, I'm going to
go train in either California

00:17:58.575 --> 00:17:59.420
or Florida.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.920
And so he works his way up.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.580
And this is how
fighters come up.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.830
He moves to Omaha, and
works as a bouncer,

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.100
and starts training there,
and starts fighting locally

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.600
in these little
things where you get

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.250
a couple hundred bucks a fight.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.170
And fights, and fights, and
fights, and fights, and never

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:18.980
loses.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.271
He's getting better and better.

00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:22.340
But he's not again
the best training.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.540
And he writes to
American Top Team.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.510
And American Top
Team, it's interesting

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.410
because imagine if the
New York Yankees were

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.960
like any one of us, really,
can walk into American Top Team

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.040
tomorrow and be like,
hey, I'm a fighter.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.650
And they'll be like,
all right, go for it.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.360
I mean, I saw it all the time.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.360
And 95% of the people
last a couple days

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.420
because it's a very
tough environment.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.580
However, if you can
last, you can stay.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.220
So he drives down
to Florida and stays

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.810
with a friend of the family
and starts training there.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.820
And in one of his first
days, he challenges

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.620
one of the top
fighters there to spar.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.034
And so the coach is
like, this kid is insane.

00:19:14.034 --> 00:19:15.200
And they start watching him.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.620
And they see all this drive.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.070
And eventually,
after a couple weeks,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.450
they said come join our team.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.790
The owner of the gym, kind
of, subsidizes these guys.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.220
He has a house where he puts
promising young fighters

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.550
that they can live for free.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.996
And they're dirt poor
and starts going there.

00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:34.370
And he's getting
better training.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.860
And then, even when you're
at American Top Team,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.250
then you're moving up from these
rock bottom level to what they

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.000
call the regional promotions.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.230
I went to another
fight in Nebraska

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.650
with him while he was still
at the regional level.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.010
And they're televised on
some random cable channel.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.220
And you might get guys from
different states fighting.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.660
And he kept winning and winning.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.701
And during the time I was
following him-- I mean,

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:00.920
he's now in the UFC.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.480
I think he's 3-0 now and
definitely climbing up.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.240
But this is-- is he 25 now?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.810
Yeah, he's about to turn 25.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.040
So I met him four years ago.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.375
And this is how, even
for a top prospect,

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:18.980
this is how slow
the progression.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.760
It's just scrapping
every single level.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.730
And at every level,
you have to win.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.740
Win, win, win, win, win.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.230
And not only you
have to win, it's

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.880
best if you're good
looking, or charismatic,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.240
or you can finish people because
it's an entertainment business.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.756
Doesn't matter if you just win.

00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:36.630
People want to watch
things that are exciting

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.050
or people that turn
them on for some reason.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.690
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah,
I think the biggest

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:47.110
detail is one loss can really
put these fighters down.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.540
Not just emotionally,
but on their trajectory

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.120
to get to the UFC.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.350
Maybe you just have a bad
day or a hard weight cut.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.700
And you go off to one of
these regional promotions.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.599
You're thinking it's a couple of
fights away from your big shot.

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:03.140
And you know, you've
been struggling.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.100
You're in debt.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.420
And next thing you know,
you'd have a bad afternoon,

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.257
bad evening.

00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:08.090
You get knocked out.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.992
It looks really bad.

00:21:09.992 --> 00:21:10.950
You're physically hurt.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.640
You're injured.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.050
And then, you have
to wait many months.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.430
Six months sometimes,
if you can get a fight.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.050
And like you said, it's possible
that the UFC may never pick you

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:26.197
up if you had that horrible
knockout that other fighters

00:21:26.197 --> 00:21:27.280
were promoted upon, right.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.090
So I think it's simple
to say that it's

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.700
physically challenging
but emotionally, as well.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.170
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, that was
one of the most interesting.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.600
And again, why these guys
are, for the most part,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.280
quite humble because,
for one, we've all seen

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.100
there's tons of fighters in the
UFC who have been on the top,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.674
and lost two fights, and
then, they're done with it.

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:53.840
They just go into obscurity.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.460
And especially following these
guys working their way up,

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.850
there's so much pressure.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.975
It's very interesting because
it's pressure that we all feel.

00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:05.380
Oh, I want to get ahead.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.920
I want to achieve
something in my life.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.090
But it's like, if I had a
job where every four months

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.654
I had to fight another writer,
you know, like, one of us

00:22:17.654 --> 00:22:18.320
is going to win.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.445
One of us is going to lose.

00:22:19.445 --> 00:22:21.530
And the guy who wins
is going to move ahead.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.860
And if I lose, well,
I'm moving back.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.190
And then, you always see
the mental thing of you

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.930
have to be very even keeled
because the danger of winning

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.800
is you get over confident.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.000
And you don't train as hard.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.125
And you lose the next time.

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:39.150
The danger of losing is that it
can go into a downward spiral.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.440
And when you get that downward
spiral, you lose one fight,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.610
then you lose two fights,
and it's really easy

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:45.880
to slide right down.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.697
So I think following
them for so long, that

00:22:48.697 --> 00:22:51.280
was one of the most interesting
aspects is, like, it's so raw.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.620
It's a job like
anything else, but it's

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.201
so much more dramatic of this
is the trajectory of your life.

00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:03.950
And you're either
making it or you're not.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.660
And it's like, well, I've just
spent all these years training

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.370
to be a fighter.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.900
And I'm 28 years old.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.210
And now, if I lose, oh
man, what am I going to do?

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:19.320
So it was very, very,
raw and, kind of,

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.010
almost humbling to be
in that environment.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.497
And a lot of stress,
especially following the guys.

00:23:24.497 --> 00:23:25.830
You get to be friends with them.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.010
And you realize what's
on the line for them.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.790
And of course, you realize the
other guys on the other side

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.280
of the cage are the exact same.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.680
So one person's
going to advance.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.840
And one person's not.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.580
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I think
it's very common in many sports

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.440
to say this is a game of inches.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.550
Football, you can go
for the fourth down.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.720
You miss by an inch.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.490
You know, hockey, you almost
save the game winning save.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:48.980
But it deflects off the glove.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.890
But what's most
interesting about fighting

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.520
is it's just you.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.660
And the fights are so irregular.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:59.280
And one slip, one jab,
your timing is pulled off,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.490
your head's not
straight, and that's it.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.549
And like you said, these
fighters are often struggling.

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:06.590
And they have to balance.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.920
Am I'm going to work
a side job or do I

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.044
want to commit to training?

00:24:09.044 --> 00:24:11.700
And maybe they say, the next
fight, I'll see how it goes.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.239
And it goes well.

00:24:13.239 --> 00:24:14.280
And they keep pulling it.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.679
But if they have a family, what
do you do if you have to decide

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:19.720
is this the right career?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.178
Like, you know,
you lose two fights

00:24:21.178 --> 00:24:23.435
in a row in some bloody mess.

00:24:23.435 --> 00:24:25.580
And for that reason, you
can imagine the stress

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.869
these guys are under.

00:24:27.869 --> 00:24:29.410
What did you see
when you were there?

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.280
I got to imagine when the
UFC or these big promotions

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.540
are showcasing these highlight
reels, a lot of times,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.270
you see that tough attitude.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.570
But I have to imagine, when
you hang out long enough,

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.860
that shield, that front,
drops a little bit.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.630
Can you talk a little
bit about what you saw?

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.190
And if you're
watching, you're bound

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.020
to see fighters lose
in sparring or be

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.286
frustrated about something.

00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:56.410
Did you see a lot of that
when you were hanging out

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:56.900
down there?

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.691
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:24:57.691 --> 00:24:59.815
I mean, that was,
by far, the benefit

00:24:59.815 --> 00:25:02.190
of spending so much time there
and getting to know people

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:11.150
because, as a fighter, you don't
want to appear like you're not

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.280
confident.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.460
That's going to give your
opponent a great mental boost.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:23.220
So first of all, when they go
out and are talking in public,

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.510
it's all about projecting this
toughness and invincibility.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.060
And also because it's the
entertainment business.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.700
And a lot of people
who watch the sport

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.910
want to see that, too.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.070
They don't want to see,
like, Mr. Vulnerable.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.150
I mean, maybe a little
bit of a vulnerability.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.720
But everyone likes their
warriors to be tough.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.930
And when you spend
time with the guys,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.840
that's a lot of
pressure on them.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.530
And I'm thinking
of certain times

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.090
after sparring when a guy
had a bad sparring session.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.480
And we went out for
dinner afterwards.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.280
And one guy is like,
man, this is a mess.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.400
I'm broke.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.680
This is a very top fighter.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.180
He's like, I'm broke, and
I'm not fighting well.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.992
And what am I going to do.

00:26:07.992 --> 00:26:09.950
The other thing they have
is all these contract

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.740
issues with the promotions
they work for that the UFC

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.660
or Bellator, the big
promotions aren't going

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.690
to tell you in their promotion.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.148
But that's part of
the whole stress

00:26:17.148 --> 00:26:20.080
is that it's a really cutthroat
business in every way.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.260
So they're fighting
trying to get money.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.470
And then, the main
thing that really

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:32.120
is hard to see as another
human being with them

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.060
is, when the guys lose, that
30 minutes after a loss,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.221
you see someone really
reduce to really a low place.

00:26:42.221 --> 00:26:43.470
And you're in the locker room.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:50.767
And they're just shell-shocked
and don't know what's going on.

00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:53.100
And you can only imagine
what's going through their mind

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.370
of, like, I've just
wasted eight years.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:02.840
And then, I could see it of, I'd
say, it was a 30 minute window.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.255
And after 30 minutes,
you saw the ego

00:27:05.255 --> 00:27:07.380
start to go up because they
have to go to the press

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.629
conference and all that stuff.

00:27:08.629 --> 00:27:10.907
And it's back to cliches
of, like, oh, you know,

00:27:10.907 --> 00:27:11.740
it was a good fight.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.114
And I'm going to
come back again.

00:27:13.114 --> 00:27:17.170
But that was the gift
of being able to follow

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.712
them so closely is
that hardly anyone ever

00:27:19.712 --> 00:27:21.670
gets to see that because
even if you're writing

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.260
about the sport as a journalist,
you're usually in the press

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.760
area.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.468
And then, you go to
the press conference.

00:27:26.468 --> 00:27:29.570
And that 30 minutes
was like, wow,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.450
that's really what
this is about.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.050
That's really what
this person is

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.247
feeling before the [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:36.247 --> 00:27:37.830
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah,
I think one thing

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.720
that the UFC when they
first came out in 1993

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.350
was really the
first time, at least

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.467
publicly, that these
skills could be tested.

00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:50.050
And that's something
I wanted to touch

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.590
on a little bit is
fighters could have spent

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.630
in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and
70s, studying their Kung Fu

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.100
or their Jeet Kune Do with
Bruce Lee and all these things.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.520
But the UFC basically
said let's see what works.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.890
And thinking about a
fighter losing a fight,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.770
I have to imagine one
of the things that

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.341
goes through their
mind is should

00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:09.590
I have trained more jiu-jitsu.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.080
Should I have worked
on my movement better?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.520
You know, my
flexibility is weak,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.820
but I wanted to train
something different.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.290
And the fact that
this can be tested

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.420
is what I think is most
exciting about this sport

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.330
and why it's evolved.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.490
And the truth is fighting has
evolved more in 20 to 25 years

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.270
then the previous 2000
because there was really

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.280
no format, aside from
the gladiators in Rome,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.200
to test this stuff out.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.830
And for example, I
don't know if you

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:40.334
want to share the
history of the UFC

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:42.000
and the Mixed Martial
Arts a little bit.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.670
But what ended up
happening was in 1993,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.390
Royce Gracie came from Brazil.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.680
The Gracie family,
essentially, put him up.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.252
He was the smallest
of the family

00:28:53.252 --> 00:28:54.710
because they wanted
to show that it

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.150
was about technique and
leverage and not about size.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.540
And he just wiped the floor
with everybody two, three,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:01.430
four fights in a row.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.850
And it shocked everybody
to say, oh my God,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.480
have I been training the
wrong way for so long?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.850
So that kind of
attitude happens a lot.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.360
And that format of
sparring, whether it's

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.040
jiu-jitsu in the gym, or
boxing, or kick boxing, the fact

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.890
that it can be
tested, I think, is

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.790
what makes this the most
exciting sport right now

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.970
because, for so long,
it wasn't that way.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.525
Do you want to give the time
line of UFC a little bit,

00:29:24.525 --> 00:29:26.775
and what's changed, and where
do you think it's going?

00:29:26.775 --> 00:29:27.566
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:29:27.566 --> 00:29:33.060
I mean, the first UFC
really was a few things.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.800
One, a scheme by
the Gracie family,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:45.680
who were the jiu-jitsu
brand, to promote their sport

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:52.075
and to get this massive
everyone against everyone fight.

00:29:52.075 --> 00:29:54.200
And show that jiu-jitsu is
an effective martial art

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.160
because if you watch jiu-jitsu,
unlike, say, karate, which

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.739
has lots of punching
and kicking,

00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.780
jiu-jitsu is people rolling
around on the ground.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.277
So really, even though they were
trying to promote the sport,

00:30:06.277 --> 00:30:08.610
it was hard in the US because
I think a lot of Americans

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.776
saw people rolling around
on the ground and thought,

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:13.280
oh, that is not
like Steven Seagal.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.800
That's boring.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.374
So in one sense, it was
just to promote jiu-jitsu.

00:30:19.374 --> 00:30:21.540
In another sense, it was
to have a massive spectacle

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.200
that they promoted the
violence and the craziness.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:29.530
So if we go back to the
other slide-- other way--

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:35.610
the first fight with the sumo
wrestler versus the karate guy,

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.436
that was the very
first UFC fight.

00:30:37.436 --> 00:30:39.060
And the sumo wrestler
charges that they

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.750
cried agave cried a
guy moved to the side

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.670
and kicks the guy in the
teeth and knocked out

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.440
three of his teeth and
that's the end of the fight.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.220
So it lasted 26 seconds.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.990
And then, you had Royce
Gracie, the jujitsu guy,

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.460
against a boxer who's
wearing a glove on one hand

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.730
and the bare fist in other.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.440
So they have no idea what
they're doing, you know.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.550
And it's a spectacle.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.510
A lot of people
tune in to watch.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.480
Royce Gracie, the
jiu-jitsu guy, won.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.232
But I think it was
like, OK, cool.

00:31:11.232 --> 00:31:13.190
We'll get more people in
our jiu-jitsu schools.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.790
And hey, we can make
some money at this.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.480
And I know for a
fact that no one

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.480
planned that people would start
taking this seriously and being

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.500
like, oh, how can we really meld
all these disciplines together

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.250
because people started
learning jiu-jitsu.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.330
So if you just needed jiu-jitsu,
you couldn't win anymore.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.040
And then, they put in wrestling.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.690
And then, they started working
in different techniques.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.700
And as you see over
time, it's actually

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.930
involved into a real
fighting technique of its own

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.766
that, really, they
did not-- I know

00:31:42.766 --> 00:31:44.640
because I talked to the
founders of the UFC--

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.595
they did not expect that.

00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:50.000
I mean, how could you
predict it until we've got

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.930
people who are superstars now.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.340
And you have kids
who are starting

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.850
at five years old training
and all this stuff, which

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.460
is going to take it
to a whole new level

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.970
because now it's
a whole on thing.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.260
You don't just have people who
are an expert in jiu-jitsu who

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.251
learn a little bit of punching,
and then try to go in.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.172
Yeah, as far as where
it's going, I mean,

00:32:12.172 --> 00:32:12.880
it's hard to say.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.379
You know?

00:32:13.379 --> 00:32:15.336
It's hard to say.

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:17.990
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I
figured one of the topic,

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.380
like, a lot of friends of
mine don't watch the UFC

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.030
but everybody
knows Ronda Rousey.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:23.400
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.760
JASON KRUEGER: She's,
like, the most popular.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.320
I think even Donald Trump
and a few other celebrities

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.770
have tweeted about her and
her recent loss to Holly Holm.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.040
But you know, that just
shows how far it's come.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.330
You know, it's come from the
sumo wrestler, the boxer,

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:45.040
and the karate guy to a
fairly different image.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.107
And it's changed
the role models.

00:32:47.107 --> 00:32:48.190
It's changed the training.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.860
It's changed the
public perception.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.490
And when it comes to violence,
females fighting in a cage

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.780
is, traditionally, not what
you think about as fighting.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.780
But she is inspiring
a generation

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.140
of young girls or
boys, for that matter,

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.960
to say I can protect myself.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.340
And it's not about spending 30
years or being the biggest guy.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.940
You just got to train correctly,
and train the right things.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.270
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, a couple
years ago, the UFC has,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.820
every year in Las Vegas,
they have a big fan expo

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.490
at one of the casinos.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.310
So I went to that.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.720
And you got thousands of people
who come and meet the fighters,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.050
and hear everyone talk, and
get autographs and whatnot.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.100
But Ronda was speaking there.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.540
And she was on her rise but
hadn't exploded like she

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.400
has in the last two years.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.730
And it was amazing because
she gave a little talk.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.490
And she wasn't
nearly as polished

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.560
as she is now, which I
think was part of the charm.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.490
She really came across
as a normal person

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.940
that you could relate to.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.330
And then, they have lines
for questions, two lines.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:05.070
And it was all women and girls
telling her you're my hero

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.090
and you're an inspiration
again and again and again.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.610
It wasn't even really questions.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:22.290
And I think that shows how
this does tap into a deep need

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:26.090
that a lot of people feel
for strength, and confidence,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:31.170
and the feeling that they're
secure in their own bodies.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:38.050
And the fact that a woman is
the biggest star, I think,

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.679
shows our society is shifting.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:44.300
And certainly,
women are starting

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.710
to feel more empowered.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.520
At the same time,
I think you can't

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.090
say it's all one way or another
because the other side of Ronda

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.690
Rousey is that she is
very attractive, too.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.380
Would she be as big of a star
if she didn't look like she did?

00:34:59.380 --> 00:34:59.950
I don't know.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.280
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I
mean, ultimately, things

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.670
are changing very quickly.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.860
And what I think is exciting
is it changes what a role

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.541
model can be in the public eye.

00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:13.155
I don't think
anyone 30 years ago

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:15.530
would have thought that a
professional fighter could have

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.400
been one of the most
influential women in the world,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.000
in that sense.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.190
And she won the ESPY
awards last year

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.760
for the best female athlete.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.260
So she's getting a
lot of attention.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.710
And to your point, it's not
just about her appearance.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.050
You know, if you don't
train martial arts

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.860
or you've never
done Judo before,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.530
I think it's something that you
have to feel it to believe it.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.700
This 135 pound woman
will literally grab you.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.290
And you can be a 240
pound bouncer that's

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.870
been wrestling for years.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.080
But she's on a level
that she will toss you.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.802
And until you feel
that power, I don't

00:35:50.802 --> 00:35:52.510
think you can really
fully appreciate it.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.520
But that's what I think
the UFC is representing

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.636
is that massive transformation.

00:35:56.636 --> 00:36:00.085
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, and I think
with the other picture up there

00:36:00.085 --> 00:36:02.210
is the other biggest star
in the sport today, which

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:05.060
is Conor McGregor, who's Irish.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.454
He's fighting Aldo, right?

00:36:06.454 --> 00:36:07.370
Is that fighting Aldo?

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.070
JASON KRUEGER: Yep,
it looks like it.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:08.890
AUDIENCE: It's Diego Brandao.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.560
DOUG MERLINO: Oh,
that's Brandao, OK.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.300
Yeah because the Aldo fight
didn't last long enough

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.150
to throw a kick.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.710
But anyways, so another
interesting aspect

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.520
of the future of this
sport is that you've

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.620
got a Irishman
fighting a Brazilian.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.590
I mean, it's really the
international aspect.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.180
It's expanding across the world.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.830
And it definitely is
something that everyone

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.850
can understand fighting.

00:36:42.522 --> 00:36:46.990
I know Ireland is
crazy about McGregor.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:52.260
And everywhere that there is
a fighting tradition-- Japan

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.950
or Russia, Ireland,
Brazil, US, and Canada,

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.570
too, they're crazy about
it-- the sport is really

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.180
catching on.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.340
So it's really going more
in a global direction.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.164
And where that leads in the next
five or 10 years, who knows.

00:37:07.164 --> 00:37:08.580
JASON KRUEGER:
Yeah, it's so young

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.720
and it's trending so fast.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.720
I mean, I have friends now
that are text messaging me

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.730
during events, like, did
you watch this fight?

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.300
And these are friends that
don't watch really any sports.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.920
Or some other
friends that they've

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.520
been avid basketball
and football

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.440
fans their whole lives, and
they do tune in on Saturday

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.690
night instead of watching
college football for the UFC

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.190
now.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.570
So you can see it changing.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.960
But I think to your point
earlier, the five, and seven,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.340
and 10-year-old
that's starting today

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.110
will influence the
next generation.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.260
And really, who knows.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.280
I mean, it's a long way away
from being as mainstream

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.230
as the NFL or the NBA.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.890
But it's possible it
can get to that level.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:47.550
I mean, UFC is now available
for PayPerView on YouTube.

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:48.710
Fox is showing it.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:54.100
So it's no longer this
small, niche, kind of,

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.140
athletic competition.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.254
It's very much in
the mainstream.

00:37:57.254 --> 00:37:59.170
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah, and
I guess the last thing

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.480
I would say on it is that
was why I was playing

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.720
with this whole concept
of being a beast

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.290
because that's, obviously, a
very common term in the sport

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.640
of, like, this guy's a beast
or she's a beast and wider

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.130
than the sport calling,
oh, you're a beast,

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:19.770
you got that report done.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:21.790
Oh man, you stayed up
all night to do that.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.830
What a beast you are.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.904
And I actually use Google.

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:27.820
That thing where you can
search how many terms

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.410
are used in books and
I was looking at terms.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.580
And you see in the 90s, in the
early 1800s beast was way high,

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.295
which I guess must have had to
do more with biblical meaning.

00:38:37.295 --> 00:38:38.420
And then, it went way down.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.740
And then, in the 90s,
it started going way up.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.790
And I think it's more of this
thing of things like MMA,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.860
and CrossFit, and Tough
Mudder are really more

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.170
congruent with
the times of like,

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.480
OK, things are a bit unstable.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.350
I don't know.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:56.700
How long will I have this job?

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.241
I don't know.

00:38:57.241 --> 00:38:59.100
I got to develop myself.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:05.159
And I think it's why,
30 years ago, people

00:39:05.159 --> 00:39:07.700
went bowling because it was like
you're with your colleagues,

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.616
and you're having fun.

00:39:08.616 --> 00:39:10.834
And now what do people
do in their free time?

00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:12.125
They like to go to the MMA gym.

00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:13.550
And that's their community.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.000
You're also learning
these skills

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.980
and becoming tough and fit.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.560
So it's like you're
not wasting time.

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.230
And I think that's part of the
reason why it's caught on now,

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.880
too, is that it's individual.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.640
And it shows discipline
and toughness.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.830
And that appeals to people.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.490
And they identify it
with these men and women.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.240
JASON KRUEGER: And we
were talking earlier

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.950
about the education
level of the fan base.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.190
And you know, of course,
whoever tuned in 1993

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:47.345
was either a pro wrestling
fan or maybe they were

00:39:47.345 --> 00:39:49.410
a martial artists themselves.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.100
But through the 90s and the
2000s, and probably even mostly

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.260
today, the average fan
still wants to see blood.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.690
They want to see knockouts.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.880
And I still think, personally,
as a jiu-jitsu player,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.112
I appreciate the small
technical details.

00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:06.320
When it looks like two people
are just, like, hugging

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.030
and doing nothing
on the ground, I'm

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.610
looking to see the
angles they're going for,

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.270
and how they're countering
those angles and recountering.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.130
But the truth is
the UFC is still

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.990
is trying to attract
those big Irish fan

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.750
bases that want to see Conor
McGregor knock someone out.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:25.510
And over time, I think it will
evolve to have some variance.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.720
But there still is the core
of it, you know, blood lust.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.791
I don't know how you
would stack rank, like,

00:40:31.791 --> 00:40:33.040
the best and the worst of MMA.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.470
We talked a little earlier.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.330
What would be, in your
opinion, the best elements

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.599
of what Mixed Martial
Arts bring in?

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.932
And what would be something
that's, probably, the worst?

00:40:41.932 --> 00:40:43.860
DOUG MERLINO: I
think the best is,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:50.260
for me, is that you see really
the extremes of what humans

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.340
can do, in some ways,
in these fights.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.330
There are some fights where
the fighters are really,

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:01.590
really tested to
beyond any level

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.370
that you would think
a person could endure.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.640
And they still come back.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.840
And I've seen it on TV.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.940
And I've seen it with
guys that I followed.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:18.620
And you know what they've gone
through and the amount of pain

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.960
and mental toughness that
it would take to keep

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.330
going in that situation.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:28.060
For me, personally,
it's inspiring.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.640
And it's partly
inspiring because it

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.300
is on a very brutal level.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.550
I mean, you're getting beat
up, and still keep going.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:44.420
So you know, it's really a test
of human endurance and skill.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.470
And then, I've been
to certain fights

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.920
where there is a high
level of blood lost.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.046
And like we were
saying earlier, I

00:41:53.046 --> 00:41:54.420
don't know if
that's good or bad.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:01.290
I think it's part of this
whole sport because, you know,

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.530
it's really combat that's
ritualized inside a cage.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.325
And you have rules,
and you have a referee.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.180
But I mean, really,
it's human combat.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.590
And it's something that we have
done for thousands of years.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.140
But I think it should
bring about mixed emotions

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.840
because you do see these
great sides of people.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.810
And you see a lot of
blood lust and desire

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:29.440
to see someone get
knocked out or whatever.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.630
And I think that's actually part
and parcel of the sport there.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:40.640
Like, it's part of human nature.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.590
I think the same with
football or hockey, too.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.780
Like, you can say
I watch football

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.110
for the skill of Peyton
Manning or Tom Brady.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.770
But a lot people like
to see big hits, too.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.340
And if I look inside
myself, I like to see skill.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.300
And then, there is a
part of being a human

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.310
that it's amazing
to see violence

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.480
that's very skillfully
and forcefully applied.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.810
I mean, not that that's
necessarily good or bad.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.720
It just, kind of, is.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.630
But I found myself,
a times, at fights

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.630
feeling a bit uncomfortable
because it was like,

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.140
whoa, this crowd is really
revved up for blood.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.050
This doesn't feel good.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.354
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I feel like
I started at a small MMA gym.

00:43:21.354 --> 00:43:23.020
They trained a little
bit of everything.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.290
And I did the Filipino
[INAUDIBLE] stick

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.720
fighting or the kickboxing and
started getting really into it.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.915
And then, they finally
put you into sparring.

00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:33.870
And you got the pads
and the head gear on.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.022
But even then, it was like
the first couple times,

00:43:36.022 --> 00:43:37.230
you just get hit in the nose.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.146
And your eyes tear up.

00:43:38.146 --> 00:43:43.074
And you're like this is not
as fun as I thought it looked.

00:43:43.074 --> 00:43:44.490
And that's kind
of where I quickly

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:47.690
gravitated to jiu-jitsu because
it's like you can actually

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.940
test it without getting hurt.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.960
And for that, I think that's
one of the reasons why jiu-jitsu

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.800
was the catalyst for all this.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.920
It's a sport that you can
train at a very high level,

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.825
consistently, on a daily
basis where you can find out

00:44:01.825 --> 00:44:04.200
what works and doesn't work
without hurting your training

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.010
partner.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.010
And one of the things,
the fan base kind of just

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:10.890
gravitates to
their own interest.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.310
Some fans join a boxing
gym after watching the UFC

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:14.200
for awhile.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.224
But at my academy
where we train,

00:44:16.224 --> 00:44:17.390
people come in all the time.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.180
And they say, is this
UFC, or what is this?

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.690
And they're wrestlers,
for example.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.080
And over time, if you
start to gravitate

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.430
towards a specific art, you
just kind of go to those gyms.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.480
And I think that's
the best part of this

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.750
is getting young kids to
train jiu-jitsu, or learn

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.700
self-defense, and be inspired
by those role models, for sure.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.735
I think that's the best.

00:44:38.735 --> 00:44:39.610
And I agree with you.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:43.260
The worst is,
unfortunately, I fully

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.780
admit I do want to see
Conor McGregor knock out

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.530
his next opponent.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.710
Like, I'm super excited
to see him do it.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.080
So I do have to sit
down and say, well, I

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.930
agree that it's a
technical sport.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.610
There's definitely blood.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.340
And it's violence at its core.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.890
It's the most pure form of
sport and the most for pure form

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.910
of fighting, really.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.920
I think there's a
bunch of Dory questions

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.504
that I wanted to quickly get to.

00:45:08.504 --> 00:45:09.670
Just make sure we have time.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:13.650
And we can take some live
questions if anybody has them.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.946
But first, let's see.

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.070
It's hard to read up there.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.200
I think the question
is, what would

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:30.840
be the most effective martial
art for women's self-defense?

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.190
I'm super biased, but I
think jiu-jitsu just because

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:38.010
of its-- well for one, in
many self-defense scenarios

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.721
that women would probably come
across, being on your back,

00:45:40.721 --> 00:45:42.220
and learning how
to fight, and being

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.304
comfortable in those
scenarios is certainly great.

00:45:44.304 --> 00:45:45.928
But just the fact
that you can actually

00:45:45.928 --> 00:45:48.100
practice it without
getting injured, I think,

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.700
is super important.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.980
If you have a day job
where you can't really

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.426
afford to get scratched or
punched and have a black eye,

00:45:55.426 --> 00:45:56.047
it can happen.

00:45:56.047 --> 00:45:57.380
There's accidents in all sports.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.730
But I'd say jiu-jitsu.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.210
I don't know if you
share the opinion.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.970
DOUG MERLINO: I
would say the most,

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.190
like any self-defense
expert would say,

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:06.690
the most effective
self-defense is

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.937
running away or de-escalation.

00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.895
That would be the first
thing in any situation.

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.130
And I don't know.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:20.770
I mean, I think you can
go to self-defense classes

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:25.500
where if you are unfortunate
enough to be in a situation

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:32.510
where you have no choice but to
defend yourself that they will

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.444
teach you the most effective
techniques, which are what

00:46:35.444 --> 00:46:36.860
you would not do
in a martial art.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.720
A groin shot or
gouging someone's

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.120
eyes, the most violent things,
if it comes to that point.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.620
I mean, I would say
either run away.

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.200
Or if you are in
such a situation,

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.730
then you have to throw
off all the rules.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:52.540
And I don't know.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:56.520
Generally, I just think I'm a
big fan of doing martial arts

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.300
for one's own
personal development

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.130
but whatever you're called to.

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:03.589
If you like jiu-jitsu, cool.

00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:04.630
If you like boxing, cool.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.820
If you like Kenpo, cool.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.570
Whatever.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.790
But I'm not sure.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:11.380
I don't know.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.855
In a self-defense situation,
I would, generally, run away.

00:47:13.855 --> 00:47:15.990
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah,
and I also think you

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.380
can go to great jiu-jitsu
academies and academies that

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.380
are just sport oriented.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.713
And I've trained at all of them.

00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:23.360
And there's
definitely cases where

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.010
I would say I
would not recommend

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:27.270
one school for those reasons.

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.760
But I can definitely give a
plug for the Gracie University

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.450
or Rener and Rorion
Gracie who are

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.770
direct lineage to Helio Gracie.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.360
And they have this
women empowered series

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.020
where they, basically, do
those de-escalation techniques.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.640
And they also have a
kids bully proof program.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.380
It's really cool.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.394
And it's all online.

00:47:47.394 --> 00:47:49.810
But they also have affiliate
schools all over the country.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.610
But I think what they're doing
is a subset of jiu-jitsu that

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.850
really addresses the core
tenants of self-defense that's

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.400
separate from the sport.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.379
So I definitely recommend that.

00:48:01.379 --> 00:48:02.920
DOUG MERLINO: There's
one other thing

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.990
about self-defense
and martial arts

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.580
that might sound a little
weird, but I really believe in,

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.620
is that not just when
one is getting physically

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.310
attacked but, more
often, we're going

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:18.650
to be verbally or mentally
attacked or some other type

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.201
of aggression.

00:48:20.201 --> 00:48:21.700
That's going to be
much more common,

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.390
I think, for everyone here.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.690
And I think doing any
martial arts helps

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.120
you get more confidence
and belief in yourself

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.790
so that, if you are
in that situation,

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.070
you're much more calm.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.820
And you can respond
in a way that

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.710
doesn't escalate
and doesn't get in--

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.930
or you don't have to freak out.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.610
So I think, oddly, that's
another type of self-defense

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:45.204
that you can learn from whatever
martial art you want to do.

00:48:45.204 --> 00:48:47.370
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, I mean
even something like yoga

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:51.510
where learning how to
breathe in awkward positions

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.840
with good posture.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.624
You know, you look at videos
of kids getting bullied,

00:48:55.624 --> 00:48:57.290
it's usually the kid
that's hunched over

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.430
and like, kind of, you
know, don't, stop, stop.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.900
But the kid stands up
and he's been familiar

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.470
with the basic Judo throws and
done it hundreds or thousands

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.510
of times, it just
builds that confidence

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.760
because you know I'm
going to stand tall.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.968
And I'm not going to take it.

00:49:11.968 --> 00:49:14.070
So I think whatever you
can practice most often.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:20.860
After hanging out with
fighters for two years,

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.080
what surprised you the most
of the life of a fighter?

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.340
I think we touched
on that quite a bit.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.870
Are there any unrelated skills,
such as yoga or gymnastics,

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.370
that you'd recommend to
Brazilian jiu-jitsu enthusiasts

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.916
to explore?

00:49:34.916 --> 00:49:36.459
DOUG MERLINO: I
think yoga's great.

00:49:36.459 --> 00:49:37.750
That's just a personal opinion.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.550
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah,
I think just what

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.990
yoga or Pilates offer.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.640
I actually practice both as
a complement to jiu-jitsu.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.260
It's just movement
and flexibility

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.920
are great for injury prevention.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.240
I've been injured a bunch.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.120
And I've even stopped
training for many months

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:56.090
at a time and only trained
Pilates after a bad injury.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:57.966
And I came back, and
I was actually better.

00:49:57.966 --> 00:49:59.340
Like, my hips were
more flexible.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.494
And it felt like I can be more
comfortable to avoid bad spots.

00:50:02.494 --> 00:50:04.410
So I would definitely
recommend both of those.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.340
I think gymnastics
is wide ranging.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.520
But I don't know if I have
enough experience to say.

00:50:12.465 --> 00:50:14.090
Can you scroll down
a little bit to see

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.450
what the next question is?

00:50:17.834 --> 00:50:19.250
I think you touched
on this a bit.

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.166
But what generally happens
to the fighters who

00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:24.345
don't make it to the big time?

00:50:24.345 --> 00:50:25.935
DOUG MERLINO: They get a job.

00:50:25.935 --> 00:50:29.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:30.520
You know, it depends.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.480
A lot of the fighters come
from college wrestling.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:38.190
So they might have a degree.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.400
It's hard one, you know.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.552
One guy I got very close
to was a college wrestler.

00:50:41.552 --> 00:50:42.510
And he'd been fighting.

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.150
His career was ending.

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:46.860
And this is just like
a personal anecdote,

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.320
but he was freaked out.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320
He was in his 30s.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.980
And he was like, everyone else
is getting married, and having

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:51.930
kids, and has a house.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:53.130
And I'm broke.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.420
I've been following my dream.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.670
And what am I going to do now?

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:56.550
And we're friends.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.600
So I catch up with
him from time to time.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.050
And now he's been working
as a personal trainer.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.920
And now he's trying to
get his own gym going.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.960
A lot of these guys
are physical people.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.320
So they'll probably end up doing
something along those lines.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.630
But it's not easy because
where other people are building

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:18.330
their careers over their
20s and early 30s, by 35,

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:19.550
your career is done.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.750
So it's really hard
for all of them.

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:25.130
I mean, I don't know any fighter
who really transitions that

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.630
well.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.754
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, and
it's not just the fighters

00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:28.670
that don't make it.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.080
But there's plenty of
examples of fighters

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.600
that just make a conscious
decision to get out early.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.870
George St. Pierre, who
you talked about earlier,

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.370
he was on a number
of radio interviews

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.470
and talking about how he's
having horrible headaches.

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.700
And he's known for not
taking tons of damage.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.390
And even he is saying
he might be done.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:49.890
I think he's talk
about coming back.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.160
But I think it's worth noting
that it's not just the fighters

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.951
that don't make it.

00:51:52.951 --> 00:51:55.280
It's the fighters that
make a decision that

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.550
is it worth the five years of
damage to maybe make it or not.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.450
So some just make the
decision to get out.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.920
And in those cases, they
could be trainers themselves

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.795
or go somewhere else.

00:52:04.795 --> 00:52:06.378
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah,
and unfortunately,

00:52:06.378 --> 00:52:08.020
a very common thing
is guys who've

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:12.998
actually made it and done really
well still leave with no money.

00:52:12.998 --> 00:52:16.210
JASON KRUEGER: The last
question here is about MMA

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:17.740
and it's illegality in New York.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.990
I don't know if you have any
background to that story.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.690
But for those that
don't have the context,

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:25.695
it's illegal to have MMA events.

00:52:25.695 --> 00:52:27.820
So you can't have the UFC
at Madison Square Garden.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.600
They've been trying
to get it for yours.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.695
It's the only state,
actually, that prohibits it.

00:52:31.695 --> 00:52:34.486
And it's been constantly
turned down for, really,

00:52:34.486 --> 00:52:35.360
some strange reasons.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.110
I don't have the full story.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:38.200
I don't know if you have
any research into that.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.490
DOUG MERLINO: I've lived
in New York for 12 years.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.850
And I still don't understand
the politics here.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:48.160
So it seems like some
Byzantine New York State thing

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.840
involving unions and whatnot.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.377
I mean, I know yesterday the
senate passed the bill again

00:52:56.377 --> 00:52:57.210
for the fourth time.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.075
It's always the assembly.

00:52:58.075 --> 00:52:59.850
JASON KRUEGER: And it keeps
getting overturned, right,

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.560
after the fact?

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:07.530
AUDIENCE: The recently arrested
the speaker of the assembly,

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.156
whatever, the--

00:53:08.156 --> 00:53:09.613
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah,
Sheldon Silver.

00:53:09.613 --> 00:53:12.159
JASON KRUEGER: There's a mic
there if you want to hop up.

00:53:12.159 --> 00:53:12.700
Feel welcome.

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:13.345
AUDIENCE: Can you all hear me?

00:53:13.345 --> 00:53:15.090
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah, go for it.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.750
AUDIENCE: My understanding
is that the speaker who

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:22.660
got arrested has ties
to the culinary union

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.780
and general democratic
money stuff,

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:32.305
which because of the Vegas
Casino station casinos, which

00:53:32.305 --> 00:53:33.680
are owned by the
same people that

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.940
owns Zuffa, which owns the UFC.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:42.050
The union gets the speaker
to block the pass legislation

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:45.240
from going to the
assembly repeatedly.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.670
JASON KRUEGER: So you
mean there's corruption?

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.375
That's crazy.

00:53:49.375 --> 00:53:50.750
I think we're
almost out of time.

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.680
But does anyone else
have any live questions

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.990
they want to ask Doug?

00:53:56.852 --> 00:53:58.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
just one question.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.900
So I'm just curious
about your experience

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.440
when you were witnessing
these people train.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.320
Are there any new
entrants or maybe people

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.420
leaving from more purist
places, which, honestly, I

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.333
thought all the martial
arts were advocating only

00:54:14.333 --> 00:54:16.166
doing one thing would
have shut down by now.

00:54:16.166 --> 00:54:17.260
But they're still going.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.360
But are there new people
arriving and bringing

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.130
new elements?

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.430
And maybe, are
they experimenting

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.560
with something new that we're
not seeing in the fights yet?

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:32.530
DOUG MERLINO: You know,
it goes up and down.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.360
And for a number
of years, wrestlers

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.165
were really dominating
the sport because they

00:54:38.165 --> 00:54:39.040
have that background.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.350
And they can get in close
and use their physicality

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:46.130
to control and hold someone, and
punch them, or throw them down.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.890
And then, apply a jiu-jitsu
move or something.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.810
And it's funny.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.970
A couple years ago, one
of the striking coaches

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:55.357
at the gym-- of
course, he's bias

00:54:55.357 --> 00:54:57.690
because he's a striking coach--
but he was like, really,

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:02.500
the next thing is going to
be more striking techniques.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.230
Like, you're seeing these
weird spinning kicks

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.990
and other things.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:07.830
And guys are really
going to raise

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.310
the level of their striking.

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.214
And I think with someone
like Conor McGregor,

00:55:15.214 --> 00:55:16.380
you're starting to see that.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.230
He's great at movement.

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:20.360
You see how he's moving around.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.350
His strikes are coming
from all angles.

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:27.720
So I think what this coach
was saying to me it's true.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.036
Like, there's developments.

00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:32.650
And when one side gets
dominant, like wrestling,

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.670
and then you have a
bunch of wrestlers,

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:39.270
then there's a new space
for other techniques.

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:41.519
So I think striking
is where there's

00:55:41.519 --> 00:55:42.560
a lot of new development.

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.854
But it's more tweaking
rather than anything.

00:55:44.854 --> 00:55:46.270
I mean, I think
what you're seeing

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:47.330
is now a lot of tweaking.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:52.960
Another thing is just more fluid
melding between all the styles

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.750
that you get from people who've
trained it from a young age.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.250
JASON KRUEGER: The
one thing I'd add

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.900
is, for one, there's not
just fighting techniques.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.110
But there's weight cutting
techniques, for example.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.255
You know, there's fighters--
for example, Carlos Condit.

00:56:06.255 --> 00:56:07.934
I recently listened
to an interview

00:56:07.934 --> 00:56:08.850
he had with Joe Rogan.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.620
And he was talking about
how, early in his career,

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.700
he would be like eight
pounds away four days out.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.510
And he'd freak out,
and stop eating.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:19.510
And then, the day of the fight,
has completely burned himself

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:20.850
of energy reserves.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.040
And now he's working
with just a diet

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.110
coach that helps him with
preparations for that weight

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:26.610
cut.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:29.580
So he's actually eating
reasonably large quantities

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:34.240
of food 24 and 18 hours out and
naturally drops that weight.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.060
Just touches down on
his weigh in moment

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.660
and then goes right back up.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.890
And they're monitoring
them with technology

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:42.350
to make sure they're
not dehydrated

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:43.766
in the brain and
things like that.

00:56:43.766 --> 00:56:46.970
So I think a lot more,
at least right now,

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.730
is being focused on
how to actually prepare

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:52.301
for fights physically,
which complements,

00:56:52.301 --> 00:56:53.550
of course, all the techniques.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.000
That's happening a lot.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.510
And just to mention Conor
McGregor, him and even Carlos

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:02.500
are actually training less
or sparring less and doing

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.850
complementary exercises.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.090
They work with movement
coaches that deal

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.360
with balance and coordination.

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.369
The same thing with
the old methods

00:57:10.369 --> 00:57:11.910
of train, train,
train, train, train.

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:14.570
It turns out that more
is, sometimes, less.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.320
So I think a there's lot
of recent revelations

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.970
in that space, for sure.

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.470
I think We have time for, maybe,
one more question if anyone

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:25.220
has one or two.

00:57:28.148 --> 00:57:31.566
AUDIENCE: I'm taking
this spot again.

00:57:31.566 --> 00:57:35.490
In training, these people at the
top level, what did you witness

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:38.630
were the most common
types of injuries?

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:39.470
I mean training.

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:40.910
I don't mean in the fight.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:41.050
Obviously, they get destroyed.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:41.841
DOUG MERLINO: Yeah.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.270
Yeah, the injuries
happened all the time.

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.070
Every single guy I
followed, everyone,

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.390
was injured during
the time I was there.

00:57:56.764 --> 00:57:58.180
And we're not
talking head injury.

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.160
We're talking things
that come with wrestling,

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.930
and going to the ground,
and getting your head

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:04.580
tweaked around.

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.730
So there was neck
injuries a lot.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.240
Shoulders, knee,
and all your joints

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.440
because you're with someone
and you take a tumble.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.970
And it's really easy
to throw something off.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:27.810
So yeah, and a lot
of broken hands.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:32.780
Most of the injuries don't
happen in the fights.

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:34.905
But the one injury that
happens in the fights a lot

00:58:34.905 --> 00:58:38.280
is because they wear the small
gloves that they break a hand.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.290
And then, apparently,
once you break your hand,

00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.741
it's very easy to
break it again.

00:58:42.741 --> 00:58:43.740
JASON KRUEGER: And feet.

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:45.050
I mean, hand and feet.

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:47.050
Like, there's so many
little bones, they just,

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.220
often, don't recover.

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.930
And a good friend of
mine-- actually, he's

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:56.490
a trainer for the most recent
world champion in jiu-jitsu.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:59.330
And this guy was just
giving a seminar in Brazil

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.495
just before the Brazilian
world championships.

00:59:02.495 --> 00:59:03.970
Like, two days
before, he was just

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.830
sitting on the mat
talking to somebody.

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:07.980
And somebody just accidentally
rolled over his foot

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.690
and fractured it.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.440
And it took him months
to recover from it.

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.565
And it's like the things that
are not what you expect usually

00:59:13.565 --> 00:59:14.690
cause the most frustration.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.398
You know, it would be
one thing if he was

00:59:16.398 --> 00:59:17.590
in a fight or training hard.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:18.756
But he's just sitting there.

00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:20.984
And someone rolls on
his foot, and it cracks.

00:59:20.984 --> 00:59:22.400
DOUG MERLINO: And
the other danger

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.532
of this sport with
training is that you

00:59:26.532 --> 00:59:28.990
have to practice jiu-jitsu,
you have to practice wrestling,

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:30.573
you have to practice
striking, and you

00:59:30.573 --> 00:59:32.030
have to do conditioning.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.150
So you're seeing the guys
come in in the morning do

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:37.160
a practice.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.990
Then, maybe they work with a
striking or jiu-jitsu coach

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.499
on individual skills.

00:59:43.499 --> 00:59:45.790
Then, they come back at night
and have another practice

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.900
or a conditioning.

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.960
That's five days a week.

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.340
And then, on Saturday,
they practice once.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:56.820
So you got so much time
that you're working out.

00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.969
And time is short, and you
want to get the best you can.

01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:03.010
So you want to train,
train, train, train, train.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:05.580
But all that training
definitely leads

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.940
to over-training injuries.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:12.210
And it's a really hard
problem to address

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:15.420
because the more time you put
into it, the better you get.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.090
But if you put in
too much, you're

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:19.425
really exposing
yourself to injury.

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.800
And so I think that's
part of the reason why

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.395
the injuries are so rampant.

01:00:26.395 --> 01:00:27.936
JASON KRUEGER: The
one thing I'll add

01:00:27.936 --> 01:00:30.570
is I've had scares of my knee.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.730
And I've gone to my strength
and conditioning coach.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.840
And I've asked him,
what about this brace?

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.540
I've heard this
brand is really good.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.449
And he's like, man, you
just need to do more squats.

01:00:40.449 --> 01:00:41.740
You need to do more dead lifts.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.960
And you need to
strengthen your ligaments.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.780
And I think that's where the
science starts to come in.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.900
In the gym, everybody's
got a secret bro science

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.800
about what's the right
way to prevent injuries,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.380
and this is the best knee brace.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.970
I mean, the truth
is it's about injury

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:00.671
prevention through exercise
and, like you said,

01:01:00.671 --> 01:01:01.920
balance between over-training.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.461
DOUG MERLINO: And that was the
other thing at this very, very

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.150
high level world class gym.

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.220
The bro science was rampant.

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.380
Really rampant.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.240
Even for me, I was
like, oh guys, come on.

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.769
And I think that's another
way that, besides guys

01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:18.560
like Conor McGregor
who are hiring the best

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.410
coaches in the world, even
at the very high level,

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:26.810
it's still, I know, it's
a lagging behind football,

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.755
and basketball, and
other sports like that.

01:01:28.755 --> 01:01:29.960
JASON KRUEGER: Yeah.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.107
Well I think we're
just about out of time.

01:01:32.107 --> 01:01:34.190
So I just wanted to thank
you for coming to Google

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.820
and chatting with us here.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.270
And if anyone's interested
in checking out the book,

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.800
I definitely recommend it.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.990
I mean, I've watched a lot
of UFC kind of promotions.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.285
But you never really
get into the weeds

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.410
of where these fighters
came from and to the detail

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.110
that you provided.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.151
So I found it really
enlightening, in that sense.

01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:51.860
So I can highly recommend it.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.004
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.890
Cool.

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:56.688
Thanks for coming in.
