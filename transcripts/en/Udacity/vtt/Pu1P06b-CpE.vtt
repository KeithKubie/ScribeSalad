00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.982
So, we know this perimeter equation is really the same as 18 minus w equals l.

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.896
And here, our area equation stays the same. Now we're ready to perform

00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:14.556
substitution. We know the length equals 18 minus w, so we can replace this

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:19.980
length with this expression. Be sure you use parentheses when you replace the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.640
length with 18 minus w. And then, try and solve for the width and the length.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.224
Keep in mind that the length should be the longer side for whichever value you

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:31.080
find. Good luck.
