00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm Barton Zwiebach,
professor of physics at MIT.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.250
I will be teaching 8.05x, the
online version of our 8.05

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.190
course on quantum
mechanics at MIT.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.810
This is a course
designed to take students

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.760
with some basic grounding
in quantum physics

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.500
to the next level.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.770
I love teaching this course
because it shows the power

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.790
and elegance of
quantum mechanics.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.590
Quantum mechanics is
powerful because it describes

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.520
in an economic way
a lot of nature,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.230
from the physics of
atoms to that of stars.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.205
It is also elegant
because it has

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:47.640
a solid mathematical foundation.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.030
You will see that as we delve
into the fascinating subject

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.140
of complex vector spaces and
the operators that act on them.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.040
You should take this
course if you're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.900
excited about quantum
mechanics and already know

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.630
some of its basics.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.730
Here we will help you
master quantum mechanics.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.400
We will give you the tools
to do quantum mechanics.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.080
We will be looking closely
at spin 1/2 systems.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.020
These systems have great
practical applications.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.850
For example, MRI machines use
spin 1/2 particles dancing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.350
to the tune of magnetic
fields to look deep

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.160
inside the human body.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.320
Spin 1/2 systems also
show the deep mysteries

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.870
of quantum mechanics in the
properties of entanglement

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.780
or teleportation.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.200
The principle of
superposition and entanglement

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.110
may one day be harnessed for
the use of quantum computation.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.060
You will also be learning
about angular momentum

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.480
and about the addition
of angular momentum.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.690
The concept of
symmetry will play also

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.090
an important role as it is
used to understand and solve

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.470
quantum systems, especially
those having degeneracies.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.560
Thank you for your interest in
8.05x and I hope you will join

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.710
us in this course.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.350
