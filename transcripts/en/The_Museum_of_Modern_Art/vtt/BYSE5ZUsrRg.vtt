00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.359
- For me it was huge
surprise when you say to me,

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:12.679
"I have to know James."

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.570
Because you know, James
is Hollywood actor.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.910
So how is he connected to
performance in any way?

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.850
And then I met him and
I was very surprised.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.712
James, when we meet, that
you knew about performance.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:25.830
- There is an incredible difference

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.610
between acting and performing.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.590
Both of you talk very loud.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.670
Both of you are very present.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.032
You are a very performance-driven actor.

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:38.045
And you are a very theatrical performer.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.896
I basically said, "James,
you have to meet Marina

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.091
"to understand that it's
completely the opposite

00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:45.563
"of what you are doing."

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.116
- It's true on one level,

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:50.114
but this is also true on another
level when you really act.

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:53.294
And you get into this
character in such a deep level

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:55.134
that you become the character.

00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:57.415
And there's even danger
that you lose yourself,

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:59.355
like your person, your everything.

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:00.903
And performance I can't.

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:03.446
But in acting, you actually have to.

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:06.542
- When I've heard you talk
about your performances,

00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:08.897
although you're not playing a character

00:01:08.897 --> 00:01:11.578
there is kind of a performance mindset

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:12.938
or something that you go into, right,

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:16.318
where you can do things that normally,

00:01:16.318 --> 00:01:18.078
in your life, you're afraid of or

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.638
that you don't normally do
or that kind of thing, right?

00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:22.638
And that's a different, I think,

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:23.919
a different kind of head space.

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:25.539
- To me, the most interesting is

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.530
this new element comes out.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.210
Kind of border between
performance and acting.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.831
What's real; what's not real.

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.671
So in a way, that creates new dialogue.

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.191
That creates some new
territory to explore.

00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.551
With theater and acting
you create a distance

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.272
which you don't create in performance.

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:41.496
Performance is no distance.

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:43.445
It's like, go to the bones.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.833
But to the theater you can
actually play the character

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.154
even as your own self,
but you have the distance.

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:52.575
- Does the kind of documentation become

00:01:52.575 --> 00:01:54.495
a consideration in pieces
and that kind of thing?

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.455
- Yeah, it used to be documentation.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:00.236
It used to be photographs,
remaining objects,

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:02.227
it used to be video and film.

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.536
I think the new thing
about this exhibition is

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:06.276
it's really about re-performance.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.295
- [Klaus] So it's really
about having a score,

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.936
and having a person there for
2 1/2 hours, for one hour,

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:14.536
for eight hours, and it's authorized.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.857
- Normally it would be
just for the opening,

00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:18.546
maybe one performance and that's it.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:20.695
But now will be the
full time, three months.

00:02:20.695 --> 00:02:22.510
That's really, I think, revolutionary.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.492
- I think the performances will be present

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:26.694
as if they were a sculpture.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.630
- One of your rules with
Ulay, and I think maybe

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.598
for a lot of things you
do, there's no rehearsal.

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:35.168
Is that right?
- [Marina] Yes.

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:37.633
- So, to a certain extent

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.173
you've set up a circumstance, but then

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:44.033
the situation itself kind of
imposes itself on you, right?

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.576
You don't know exactly what's
going to happen. And...

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:51.059
- Yeah, is new as for me
as the public watching it.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.799
And that's kind of credible fresh

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.750
because there's no rehearsal.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.710
But there's another reason
why I can't rehearse.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.139
Because I will never have
that kind of stamina.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.414
Because public give you this extra energy.

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.215
If I rehearse any of these pieces,

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:06.161
in half of the piece I
will say, "I can't do it."

00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.075
I think the same does it when
you really do live acting,

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.236
with the front of public theater.

00:03:11.236 --> 00:03:12.756
There's something with the public

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.176
that gives you this extra thing.

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:16.468
This is going on for three months.

00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:19.196
And it's really endurance
kind of experiment.

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:21.216
And actors are not used to this.

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:23.442
And how this time change you because

00:03:23.442 --> 00:03:25.708
if you will do something for three months

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:28.700
I don't know if it's acting
anymore; become real life.

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:30.866
- But in many aspects of Marina's shows

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:32.937
are complete experiment.

00:03:32.937 --> 00:03:35.779
So I think we are both a bit nervous

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.790
and intensely curious
because it's an experiment.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.650
But every experiment you do it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.717
and then you don't know the outcome. So...

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:45.709
- Because in the end they really can say

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.051
"Okay, we done it."

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.078
But we don't know yet.
