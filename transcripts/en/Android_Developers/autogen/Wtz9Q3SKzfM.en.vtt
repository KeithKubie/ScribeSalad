there are a lot of games that do this if

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
there are a lot of games that do this if
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.230

they require a network and it just it's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240
they require a network and it just it's
 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.360

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.199
so jarring and and I want is it one I'd
like to build there's I don't think

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209
like to build there's I don't think
 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.699

there's any strong reason why this game

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
there's any strong reason why this game
 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.390
there's any strong reason why this game
can't be played offline but to it's if

getting too long-winded is I played this

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980
getting too long-winded is I played this
 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.650

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660
to be connected to a network and a lot
 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.900

now I think actually this device has

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130
now I think actually this device has
 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.220
now I think actually this device has
just lost Wi-Fi I think I you know that

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230
just lost Wi-Fi I think I you know that
 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.200
just lost Wi-Fi I think I you know that
due to you know probably some sort of

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210
due to you know probably some sort of
 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.140
due to you know probably some sort of

because it's not a tower defense game we

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
because it's not a tower defense game we
 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.100

mention that I actually like playing
games offline so I do I do do and test

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560
games offline so I do I do do and test
 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.450
games offline so I do I do do and test
that and let's get into the actual tower

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460
that and let's get into the actual tower
 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.940
that and let's get into the actual tower
defense games themselves now we're gonna

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950
defense games themselves now we're gonna
 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.200
defense games themselves now we're gonna
go pretty quickly through things we've

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210
go pretty quickly through things we've
 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.210
go pretty quickly through things we've
looked at already so why don't we why

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220
looked at already so why don't we why
 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.710
looked at already so why don't we why
don't we start with one of the classics

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720
don't we start with one of the classics
 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.990
don't we start with one of the classics

absolutely just to kind of display it

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370
absolutely just to kind of display it
 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.800
absolutely just to kind of display it
now I'm not sure we have a title card

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810
now I'm not sure we have a title card
 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.680
now I'm not sure we have a title card
for this one right oh we might not so so

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690
for this one right oh we might not so so
 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.580
for this one right oh we might not so so
we're just we're just gonna have to go

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590
we're just we're just gonna have to go
 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.360
we're just we're just gonna have to go
to a non title card equipped display and

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370
to a non title card equipped display and
 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.430
to a non title card equipped display and
there we are and and fieldrunners is one

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440
there we are and and fieldrunners is one
 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.510
there we are and and fieldrunners is one
of them there's there's a couple of

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520
of them there's there's a couple of
 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.250
of them there's there's a couple of
variations in the genre and fieldrunners

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260
variations in the genre and fieldrunners
 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.830
variations in the genre and fieldrunners
is the variation where you get to work

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840
is the variation where you get to work
 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.719
is the variation where you get to work
where you have guys running from one

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729
where you have guys running from one
 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.430
where you have guys running from one
side to the other and you actually get

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440
side to the other and you actually get
 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.490
side to the other and you actually get
to change their course by by putting

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500
to change their course by by putting
 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.290
to change their course by by putting
down towers right it's an open field

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
down towers right it's an open field
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.230
down towers right it's an open field
with path defined by towers exactly and

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240
with path defined by towers exactly and
 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.360
with path defined by towers exactly and
and and and and and the key strategy

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370
and and and and and the key strategy
 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.980
and and and and and the key strategy
element is the characters will always

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990
element is the characters will always
 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.980
element is the characters will always
take the shortest path to from one side

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990
take the shortest path to from one side
 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.409
take the shortest path to from one side
to the other so your goal is to make

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419
to the other so your goal is to make
 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.450
to the other so your goal is to make
their path long and then just when you

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460
their path long and then just when you
 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.550
their path long and then just when you
think you've gotten you've gotten you

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560
think you've gotten you've gotten you
 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.869
think you've gotten you've gotten you
know it's all taken care of

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879
know it's all taken care of
 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.999
know it's all taken care of
tarah carob they'll have you realize

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009
tarah carob they'll have you realize
 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.499
tarah carob they'll have you realize
that people actually will fly in the

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509
that people actually will fly in the
 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.719
that people actually will fly in the
shortest path over and we'll ignore all

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729
shortest path over and we'll ignore all
 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.549
shortest path over and we'll ignore all
of your defenses so ultimately you have

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:48.559
of your defenses so ultimately you have
 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.079
of your defenses so ultimately you have
to make some decisions whether you're

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.089
to make some decisions whether you're
 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:52.629
to make some decisions whether you're
going to continue to build towers in the

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639
going to continue to build towers in the
 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.119
going to continue to build towers in the
moat in the most logical crazy pattern

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.129
moat in the most logical crazy pattern
 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.279
moat in the most logical crazy pattern
or whether you're going to build towers

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289
or whether you're going to build towers
 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.850
or whether you're going to build towers
that will hit planes let's contrast that

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860
that will hit planes let's contrast that
 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.869
that will hit planes let's contrast that
with oh by the way let's scratch that

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879
with oh by the way let's scratch that
 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.619
with oh by the way let's scratch that
with another tower defense game that's

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629
with another tower defense game that's
 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.089
with another tower defense game that's
that's been quite popular it's also a

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:10.099
that's been quite popular it's also a
 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.100
that's been quite popular it's also a
very good game but it can takes a

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110
very good game but it can takes a
 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.609
very good game but it can takes a
completely different approach where

00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:14.619
completely different approach where
 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.469
completely different approach where
everything is constrained the both the

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479
everything is constrained the both the
 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.129
everything is constrained the both the
location of the towers and the paths

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139
location of the towers and the paths
 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:22.869
location of the towers and the paths
that people are going to follow you know

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879
that people are going to follow you know
 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:26.519
that people are going to follow you know
this game is is a beautiful game

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:26.529
this game is is a beautiful game
 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.749
this game is is a beautiful game
absolutely and actually you know it's

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759
absolutely and actually you know it's
 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.679
absolutely and actually you know it's
interesting because this this game

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:29.689
interesting because this this game
 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:32.079
interesting because this this game
involves levels that have a significant

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:32.089
involves levels that have a significant
 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:33.730
involves levels that have a significant
amount of craft in the levels because

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740
amount of craft in the levels because
 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.290
amount of craft in the levels because
the goal of the level is to provide a

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300
the goal of the level is to provide a
 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.109
the goal of the level is to provide a
puzzle for which towers you place where

00:07:38.109 --> 00:07:38.119
puzzle for which towers you place where
 

00:07:38.119 --> 00:07:40.449
puzzle for which towers you place where
and they limit the number of options and

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:40.459
and they limit the number of options and
 

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.689
and they limit the number of options and
so in a sense in a sense this game this

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:43.699
so in a sense in a sense this game this
 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:47.290
so in a sense in a sense this game this
game has a little more of different kind

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300
game has a little more of different kind
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.029
game has a little more of different kind
of a variation like the design of the

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039
of a variation like the design of the
 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.069
of a variation like the design of the
levels is actually more critical than

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:51.079
levels is actually more critical than
 

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:53.499
levels is actually more critical than
the design of the individual elements a

00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:53.509
the design of the individual elements a
 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.969
the design of the individual elements a
lot of times they'll throw they'll throw

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:54.979
lot of times they'll throw they'll throw
 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.959
lot of times they'll throw they'll throw
new players at you in order to in order

00:07:58.959 --> 00:07:58.969
new players at you in order to in order
 

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:00.759
new players at you in order to in order
to change the game up a lot and this one

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:00.769
to change the game up a lot and this one
 

00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:02.709
to change the game up a lot and this one
act or through new enemies this game

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:02.719
act or through new enemies this game
 

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:04.329
act or through new enemies this game
actually does both it throws completely

00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:04.339
actually does both it throws completely
 

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:05.589
actually does both it throws completely
different levels and completely

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599
different levels and completely
 

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:06.609
different levels and completely
different enemies and you have to use

00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:06.619
different enemies and you have to use
 

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.499
different enemies and you have to use
different strategies based upon the

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:08.509
different strategies based upon the
 

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:09.969
different strategies based upon the
places you're actually allowed to place

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:09.979
places you're actually allowed to place
 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:12.369
places you're actually allowed to place
towers but it's not as open-ended and

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:12.379
towers but it's not as open-ended and
 

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:15.040
towers but it's not as open-ended and
yeah it's a yeah I agree it's more of a

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.050
yeah it's a yeah I agree it's more of a
 

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.159
yeah it's a yeah I agree it's more of a
puzzle type of atmosphere it doesn't

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:18.169
puzzle type of atmosphere it doesn't
 

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:20.769
puzzle type of atmosphere it doesn't
feel like I'm playing a strategy game it

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:20.779
feel like I'm playing a strategy game it
 

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:23.199
feel like I'm playing a strategy game it
feels like I'm trying to figure out what

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:23.209
feels like I'm trying to figure out what
 

00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:24.909
feels like I'm trying to figure out what
the correct combination is and that can

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919
the correct combination is and that can
 

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:28.689
the correct combination is and that can
that can be its own set of fun Adelie

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:28.699
that can be its own set of fun Adelie
 

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:32.499
that can be its own set of fun Adelie
fences is has a fairly typical user

00:08:32.499 --> 00:08:32.509
fences is has a fairly typical user
 

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:34.959
fences is has a fairly typical user
interface where you're dragging towers

00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:34.969
interface where you're dragging towers
 

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:39.219
interface where you're dragging towers
from some ux/ui area and this gets down

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:39.229
from some ux/ui area and this gets down
 

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:42.909
from some ux/ui area and this gets down
in the corner and then you're placing

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919
in the corner and then you're placing
 

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.910
in the corner and then you're placing
them on specific points on the map yeah

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920
them on specific points on the map yeah
 

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.319
them on specific points on the map yeah
one of the things I actually one of the

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:47.329
one of the things I actually one of the
 

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:49.090
one of the things I actually one of the
UI changes to feel like you have to

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.100
UI changes to feel like you have to
 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.679
UI changes to feel like you have to
collect them yeah one thing you see I

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:50.689
collect them yeah one thing you see I
 

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:52.750
collect them yeah one thing you see I
just completely screwed this up

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760
just completely screwed this up
 

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.460
just completely screwed this up
because that the blue tower doesn't

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:54.470
because that the blue tower doesn't
 

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.980
because that the blue tower doesn't
doesn't do anything against the red guys

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:55.990
doesn't do anything against the red guys
 

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.269
doesn't do anything against the red guys
yes that's right but you can have a

00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279
yes that's right but you can have a
 

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:00.850
yes that's right but you can have a
tower that does both red and blue yes

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:00.860
tower that does both red and blue yes
 

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.860
tower that does both red and blue yes
exactly that's actually and that's

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:02.870
exactly that's actually and that's
 

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.210
exactly that's actually and that's
actually one of the unique things about

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220
actually one of the unique things about
 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.500
actually one of the unique things about
this game is that they actually have

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:05.510
this game is that they actually have
 

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.900
this game is that they actually have
this this concept of towers that are

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:07.910
this this concept of towers that are
 

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.340
this this concept of towers that are
that are that are ineffective against

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:09.350
that are that are ineffective against
 

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.629
that are that are ineffective against
one color or another and that's not

00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:10.639
one color or another and that's not
 

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.819
one color or another and that's not
going to probably build faster but yeah

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:12.829
going to probably build faster but yeah
 

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:14.439
going to probably build faster but yeah
and now that that's another interesting

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:14.449
and now that that's another interesting
 

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.660
and now that that's another interesting
thing is that some some games will have

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.670
thing is that some some games will have
 

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.910
thing is that some some games will have
towers that build medially and someday

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920
towers that build medially and someday
 

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.590
towers that build medially and someday
and some games will have towers that

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600
and some games will have towers that
 

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.639
and some games will have towers that
take a little bit of time

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:21.649
take a little bit of time
 

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.170
take a little bit of time
another thing that will differentiate

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.180
another thing that will differentiate
 

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.689
another thing that will differentiate
these is when we pause can we still

00:09:25.689 --> 00:09:25.699
these is when we pause can we still
 

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:29.680
these is when we pause can we still
build towers exactly and and some games

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.690
build towers exactly and and some games
 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.319
build towers exactly and and some games
are sort of real-time tower defense

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:32.329
are sort of real-time tower defense
 

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:34.060
are sort of real-time tower defense
games this one is is it true is a true

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.070
games this one is is it true is a true
 

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.560
games this one is is it true is a true
real-time tower defense game that's the

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:35.570
real-time tower defense game that's the
 

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.269
real-time tower defense game that's the
only way it's played now from a menuing

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279
only way it's played now from a menuing
 

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.829
only way it's played now from a menuing
structure there's really two styles one

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839
structure there's really two styles one
 

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:40.000
structure there's really two styles one
is where you dragged in the corner and

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.010
is where you dragged in the corner and
 

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.530
is where you dragged in the corner and
another one is where you select where

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
another one is where you select where
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.030
another one is where you select where
you want to build and by the way this is

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040
you want to build and by the way this is
 

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.019
you want to build and by the way this is
one of these things where if you have

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:47.029
one of these things where if you have
 

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:49.720
one of these things where if you have
icons sometimes it's tricky to see just

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:49.730
icons sometimes it's tricky to see just
 

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.090
icons sometimes it's tricky to see just
what caught what your icon is actually

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:52.100
what caught what your icon is actually
 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.639
what caught what your icon is actually
going to do at any given point so yeah

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:54.649
going to do at any given point so yeah

like the collect select where you want
 

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:01.300
like the collect select where you want
to build a tower and get a menu on the

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.310

defense in the title will actually get a

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.290
defense in the title will actually get a
 

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.009

nice polite letter from their lawyers

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:26.019
nice polite letter from their lawyers
 

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:31.509
nice polite letter from their lawyers
but yeah tower defense has a nice UI to

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519
but yeah tower defense has a nice UI to
 

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.439
but yeah tower defense has a nice UI to
it where most of the UI elements are

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:35.449
it where most of the UI elements are
 

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:37.120
it where most of the UI elements are
hidden until you absolutely need them

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.130
hidden until you absolutely need them
 

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.889
hidden until you absolutely need them
you know is it yes clicking on the

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:38.899
you know is it yes clicking on the
 

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:40.960
you know is it yes clicking on the
screen will actually activate them and I

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:40.970
screen will actually activate them and I
 

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.460
screen will actually activate them and I
did really like that in this game this

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.470
did really like that in this game this
 

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.290
did really like that in this game this
game is really nice high-res sharp

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
game is really nice high-res sharp
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.579
game is really nice high-res sharp
graphics it's it's it's fun my that's

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:48.589
graphics it's it's it's fun my that's
 

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:49.629
graphics it's it's it's fun my that's
the only thing about this particular

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639
the only thing about this particular
 

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:52.540
the only thing about this particular
game is this is this is another one this

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:52.550
game is this is this is another one this
 

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.250
game is this is this is another one this
is what I wish this is a fixed path

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.260
is what I wish this is a fixed path
 

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.410
is what I wish this is a fixed path
tower defense game so it's not as

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:56.420
tower defense game so it's not as
 

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.150
tower defense game so it's not as
limited in jelly defense in the sense

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160
limited in jelly defense in the sense
 

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.920
limited in jelly defense in the sense
that you can you can place towers in

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930
that you can you can place towers in
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.290
that you can you can place towers in
lots and lots of different varied places

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.300
lots and lots of different varied places
 

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.329
lots and lots of different varied places
but the path in which the in which the

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:04.339
but the path in which the in which the
 

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:06.640
but the path in which the in which the
characters run is is fixed

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.650
characters run is is fixed
 

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.040
characters run is is fixed
right and buddy's really cool just be

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.050
right and buddy's really cool just be
 

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.420
right and buddy's really cool just be
able to build towers kind of totally

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.430
able to build towers kind of totally
 

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.700
able to build towers kind of totally
nilly like that and you can see there's

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:12.710
nilly like that and you can see there's
 

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.840
nilly like that and you can see there's
actually you know this this and they

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:13.850
actually you know this this and they
 

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.340
actually you know this this and they
build immediately on this one yeah

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:15.350
build immediately on this one yeah
 

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.440
build immediately on this one yeah
exactly there's there's not nearly as

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:17.450
exactly there's there's not nearly as
 

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.190
exactly there's there's not nearly as
much time you know okay so I think we've

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200
much time you know okay so I think we've
 

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.750
much time you know okay so I think we've
compared and contrasted some of the

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760
compared and contrasted some of the
 

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.510
compared and contrasted some of the
styles let's talk about some of the you

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:25.520
styles let's talk about some of the you
 

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.510
styles let's talk about some of the you
know jelly defense I think one of the

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.520
know jelly defense I think one of the
 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.490
know jelly defense I think one of the
things that we saw is it actually just

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:30.500
things that we saw is it actually just
 

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.530
things that we saw is it actually just
want just one comment yeah so this game

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:32.540
want just one comment yeah so this game
 

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.120
want just one comment yeah so this game
has it has very very high resolution

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.130
has it has very very high resolution
 

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.580
has it has very very high resolution
background artwork but you can actually

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:36.590
background artwork but you can actually
 

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.890
background artwork but you can actually
see that on the icons and text it is a

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:38.900
see that on the icons and text it is a
 

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.570
see that on the icons and text it is a
little lower resolution than the screen

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:40.580
little lower resolution than the screen
 

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.490
little lower resolution than the screen
and you might not be able to see that on

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:42.500
and you might not be able to see that on
 

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.280
and you might not be able to see that on
the live stream but this is you know

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.290
the live stream but this is you know
 

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.160
the live stream but this is you know
even in this game which looks amazing if

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.170
even in this game which looks amazing if
 

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.720
even in this game which looks amazing if
they if we had a slightly higher

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:49.730
they if we had a slightly higher
 

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.310
they if we had a slightly higher
resolution font it would look a little

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320
resolution font it would look a little
 

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.950
resolution font it would look a little
less blurry and so I would say that

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:53.960
less blurry and so I would say that
 

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.630
less blurry and so I would say that
would be my one comment on the visuals

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:55.640
would be my one comment on the visuals
 

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.400
would be my one comment on the visuals
here because otherwise the game is so

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.410
here because otherwise the game is so
 

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.800
here because otherwise the game is so
high resolution so past all of my files

00:11:59.800 --> 00:11:59.810
high resolution so past all of my files
 

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.150
high resolution so past all of my files
are really high res Impala SH the the

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160
are really high res Impala SH the the
 

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.010
are really high res Impala SH the the
backgrounds and without actually making

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.020
backgrounds and without actually making
 

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.020
backgrounds and without actually making
a higher resolution font that's that

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.030
a higher resolution font that's that
 

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.460
a higher resolution font that's that
that is going to make the game look

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.470
that is going to make the game look
 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.110
that is going to make the game look
worse we see some other games here that

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120
worse we see some other games here that
 

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.270
worse we see some other games here that
are fall into that trap as well but if

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.280
are fall into that trap as well but if
 

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.560
are fall into that trap as well but if
you're going to spend strangely enough

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:14.570
you're going to spend strangely enough
 

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.130
you're going to spend strangely enough
if you're going to spend some extra you

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.140
if you're going to spend some extra you
 

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.810
if you're going to spend some extra you
know real estate application real estate

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:19.820
know real estate application real estate
 

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.580
know real estate application real estate
on anything in terms of high resolution

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:21.590
on anything in terms of high resolution
 

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.770
on anything in terms of high resolution
a font is great especially you know

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:23.780
a font is great especially you know
 

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.470
a font is great especially you know
since you can for a lot of these games

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480
since you can for a lot of these games
 

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.210
since you can for a lot of these games
take advantage of the fact that we have

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.220
take advantage of the fact that we have
 

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.700
take advantage of the fact that we have
really nice open type implementations if

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:30.710
really nice open type implementations if
 

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.440
really nice open type implementations if
you can get an outline font that will

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:32.450
you can get an outline font that will
 

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.390
you can get an outline font that will
work we do a pretty good job of

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:34.400
work we do a pretty good job of
 

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.680
work we do a pretty good job of
rendering that pretty quickly and that

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:35.690
rendering that pretty quickly and that
 

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.210
rendering that pretty quickly and that
that is really the way to go you'll see

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:37.220
that is really the way to go you'll see
 

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.250
that is really the way to go you'll see
a bunch of games that do use that as

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:39.260
a bunch of games that do use that as
 

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.520
a bunch of games that do use that as
well now you see this game also has

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:41.530
well now you see this game also has
 

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.390
well now you see this game also has
reasonably good animation it's not the

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:43.400
reasonably good animation it's not the
 

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.400
reasonably good animation it's not the
best I've ever seen there's no death

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.410
best I've ever seen there's no death
 

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.320
best I've ever seen there's no death
animation for the enemies it has the so

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.330
animation for the enemies it has the so
 

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.170
animation for the enemies it has the so
it's got the the feature where you can

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.180
it's got the the feature where you can
 

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.150
it's got the the feature where you can
actually call a wave early rate oh if

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160
actually call a wave early rate oh if
 

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.290
actually call a wave early rate oh if
you wouldn't mind going to the tablet

00:12:59.290 --> 00:12:59.300
you wouldn't mind going to the tablet
 

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.860
you wouldn't mind going to the tablet
now see not so easy is that when you're

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:02.870
now see not so easy is that when you're
 

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.460
now see not so easy is that when you're
on the other side yeah okay so you have

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.470
on the other side yeah okay so you have
 

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.570
on the other side yeah okay so you have
an early call button and this is

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:07.580
an early call button and this is
 

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.590
an early call button and this is
something that you'll see in a lot of

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600
something that you'll see in a lot of
 

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.660
something that you'll see in a lot of
these games where you just you hit a

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:10.670
these games where you just you hit a
 

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.490
these games where you just you hit a
button and you can actually send out the

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.500
button and you can actually send out the
 

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.500
button and you can actually send out the
waves a little faster another thing

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:14.510
waves a little faster another thing
 

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.080
waves a little faster another thing
you'll see is being able to speed up

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.090
you'll see is being able to speed up
 

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.300
you'll see is being able to speed up
speed up time yeah because really these

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:19.310
speed up time yeah because really these
 

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.870
speed up time yeah because really these
are

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880
are
 

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.030
are
of games where you take relatively few

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040
of games where you take relatively few
 

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.340
of games where you take relatively few
actions but you do them very frequently

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.350
actions but you do them very frequently
 

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.630
actions but you do them very frequently
yeah and actually one things I really

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:25.640
yeah and actually one things I really
 

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.860
yeah and actually one things I really
like is you can actually see you in this

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:26.870
like is you can actually see you in this
 

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.210
like is you can actually see you in this
game and actually shows you as ways

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:28.220
game and actually shows you as ways
 

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.550
game and actually shows you as ways
they're coming through so I mean this

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560
they're coming through so I mean this
 

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.650
they're coming through so I mean this
game is this game is good my main my

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:32.660
game is this game is good my main my
 

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.360
game is this game is good my main my
main thing about this game is that it is

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.370
main thing about this game is that it is
 

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.580
main thing about this game is that it is
you know it implements the basics of

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:36.590
you know it implements the basics of
 

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.160
you know it implements the basics of
tired events incredibly incredibly well

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.170
tired events incredibly incredibly well
 

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.650
tired events incredibly incredibly well
right but you know it's it's to me it's

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:41.660
right but you know it's it's to me it's
 

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.300
right but you know it's it's to me it's
not as fun as for the other games yeah I

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.310
not as fun as for the other games yeah I
 

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.800
not as fun as for the other games yeah I
thought I thought you know it's

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:44.810
thought I thought you know it's
 

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.540
thought I thought you know it's
definitely got a good selection of

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:46.550
definitely got a good selection of
 

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.010
definitely got a good selection of
powers and you have some some different

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.020
powers and you have some some different
 

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.720
powers and you have some some different
situations where you you need to use a

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:52.730
situations where you you need to use a
 

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.570
situations where you you need to use a
particular mix of towers and I like that

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:57.580
particular mix of towers and I like that
 

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.910
particular mix of towers and I like that
but I felt like I don't know I felt like

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920
but I felt like I don't know I felt like
 

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.650
but I felt like I don't know I felt like
it introduced them a little too slowly

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:02.660
it introduced them a little too slowly
 

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.330
it introduced them a little too slowly
mm-hmm and I don't know there's just

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:04.340
mm-hmm and I don't know there's just
 

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.860
mm-hmm and I don't know there's just
something about the gameplay that that

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:05.870
something about the gameplay that that
 

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.390
something about the gameplay that that
wasn't quite as fun some of the maps

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:07.400
wasn't quite as fun some of the maps
 

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.190
wasn't quite as fun some of the maps
were yeah maybe a little too hard to

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.200
were yeah maybe a little too hard to
 

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.010
were yeah maybe a little too hard to
begin with this like anyway the back key

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:12.020
begin with this like anyway the back key
 

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.240
begin with this like anyway the back key
isn't really is not working here

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.250
isn't really is not working here
 

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.890
isn't really is not working here
not exactly the back key isn't working

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:14.900
not exactly the back key isn't working
 

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.420
not exactly the back key isn't working
so that's that's a real problem yeah

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:16.430
so that's that's a real problem yeah
 

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.780
so that's that's a real problem yeah
other than that oh yes do these things

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:19.790
other than that oh yes do these things
 

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.490
other than that oh yes do these things
yes we're kind of funny sometimes they

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:21.500
yes we're kind of funny sometimes they
 

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.020
yes we're kind of funny sometimes they
do come up the full screen but when

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.030
do come up the full screen but when
 

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.980
do come up the full screen but when
you're doing your when you're putting

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:23.990
you're doing your when you're putting
 

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.690
you're doing your when you're putting
especially your own ads on a tablet you

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:25.700
especially your own ads on a tablet you
 

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.550
especially your own ads on a tablet you
know you know that no that's another

of wanted to see a little bit larger
 

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.800
of wanted to see a little bit larger
when I was on the tablet in terms of

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:32.810
when I was on the tablet in terms of
 

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.540
when I was on the tablet in terms of
scale yeah yeah you could definitely use

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:34.550
scale yeah yeah you could definitely use
 

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.460
scale yeah yeah you could definitely use
a little bit more testing on on large

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:36.470
a little bit more testing on on large
 

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.680
a little bit more testing on on large
devices yeah but I mean overall the game

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:38.690

the it's a little more obvious that
 

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.640
the it's a little more obvious that
they've they've ported from a 4x3 build

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:54.650
they've they've ported from a 4x3 build
 

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.140

that's something that if you design at

00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:40.669
that's something that if you design at
 

00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:42.249
that's something that if you design at
the beginning it's really easy if you

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:42.259
the beginning it's really easy if you
 

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:43.689

game is that it actually comes with an

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080
game is that it actually comes with an
 

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.840
game is that it actually comes with an
SD pack that runs pretty much everywhere

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:37.850
SD pack that runs pretty much everywhere
 

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.060
SD pack that runs pretty much everywhere
and then with just a little bit of

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.070
and then with just a little bit of
 

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.029
and then with just a little bit of
actually play some towers here so we

00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039
actually play some towers here so we
 

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:46.450
actually play some towers here so we
don't die now this again is the is the

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:46.460
don't die now this again is the is the
 

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.509
don't die now this again is the is the
drag-and-drop method of tower and I'm

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:49.519
drag-and-drop method of tower and I'm
 

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.669
drag-and-drop method of tower and I'm
not a big fan there's a few things about

00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679
not a big fan there's a few things about
 

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.830
not a big fan there's a few things about
this interface that that make it a

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840
this interface that that make it a
 

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.680
this interface that that make it a
little bit difficult I think that first

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:58.690
little bit difficult I think that first
 

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.580
little bit difficult I think that first
the fact that you have to drag and drop

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:00.590
the fact that you have to drag and drop
 

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:06.490
the fact that you have to drag and drop
is annoying but but fine the fact though

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:06.500
is annoying but but fine the fact though
 

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.879
is annoying but but fine the fact though
that the UI actually sits over areas of

00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:09.889
that the UI actually sits over areas of
 

00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:13.060
that the UI actually sits over areas of
the map that not in this map but in

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.070
the map that not in this map but in
 

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.789
the map that not in this map but in
other maps are actually playable too so

00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799
other maps are actually playable too so
 

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:17.590
other maps are actually playable too so
you see like the pause and the

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600
you see like the pause and the
 

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.200
you see like the pause and the
fast-forward button here those will

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.210
fast-forward button here those will
 

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.970
fast-forward button here those will
actually cover areas of the map where

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:21.980
actually cover areas of the map where
 

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.860
actually cover areas of the map where
you have to place towers and to me

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:23.870
you have to place towers and to me
 

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.680
you have to place towers and to me
that's unacceptable because it means

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:26.690
that's unacceptable because it means
 

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.470
that's unacceptable because it means
that I have to do a lot of map

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480
that I have to do a lot of map
 

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.700
that I have to do a lot of map
navigation that's just in I for the sole

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:33.710
navigation that's just in I for the sole
 

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.279
navigation that's just in I for the sole
purpose of keeping the UI from getting

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:36.289
purpose of keeping the UI from getting
 

00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:41.889
purpose of keeping the UI from getting
in my way so going with the philosophy

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:41.899
in my way so going with the philosophy
 

00:19:41.899 --> 00:19:43.720
in my way so going with the philosophy
that you should always be fighting the

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:43.730
that you should always be fighting the
 

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.460
that you should always be fighting the
enemies in the game and not fighting the

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.470
enemies in the game and not fighting the
 

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.129
enemies in the game and not fighting the
UI I think this one fails just a little

00:19:48.129 --> 00:19:48.139
UI I think this one fails just a little
 

00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:48.999
UI I think this one fails just a little
bit now we actually talk to the

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:49.009
bit now we actually talk to the
 

00:19:49.009 --> 00:19:51.070
bit now we actually talk to the
developers about that and there they

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080
developers about that and there they
 

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.529
developers about that and there they
were looking into some some ways to fix

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:53.539
were looking into some some ways to fix
 

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:55.359
were looking into some some ways to fix
it they certainly helped some I think

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:55.369
it they certainly helped some I think
 

00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.580
it they certainly helped some I think
the there used to be a big OpenFeint

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:57.590
the there used to be a big OpenFeint
 

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.770
the there used to be a big OpenFeint
button here

00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:58.780
button here
 

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.200

which nothing against open faith the
 

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.910
which nothing against open faith the
problem though was that if you press

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:02.920
problem though was that if you press
 

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.490
problem though was that if you press
that button it would start an open faint

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:05.500
that button it would start an open faint
 

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.230
that button it would start an open faint
cycle that took about 20 seconds and you

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240
cycle that took about 20 seconds and you

what's it going to decide it decided I
 

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.460
what's it going to decide it decided I
was talking about actually did you place

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.470
was talking about actually did you place
 

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.790
was talking about actually did you place
a tower - uh yes it did yeah there's a

tower there see now I'll show you
 

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:34.040
tower there see now I'll show you
because you have to zoom in there it is

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.050
because you have to zoom in there it is
 

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.240
because you have to zoom in there it is
yeah and see if I want to upgrade the

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.250
yeah and see if I want to upgrade the
 

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.820
yeah and see if I want to upgrade the
tower now they upgrade by you click on

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:38.830
tower now they upgrade by you click on
 

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.860
tower now they upgrade by you click on
the tower mm-hmm and hit the upgrade

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:40.870
the tower mm-hmm and hit the upgrade
 

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.590
the tower mm-hmm and hit the upgrade
button you can see that that tower is

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600
button you can see that that tower is
 

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.570
button you can see that that tower is
almost impossible to update upgrade

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:45.580
almost impossible to update upgrade
 

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.630
almost impossible to update upgrade
without doing a zoom and zoom and it's

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640
without doing a zoom and zoom and it's
 

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.340
without doing a zoom and zoom and it's
just it's one of those things where yeah

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.350
just it's one of those things where yeah
 

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.530
just it's one of those things where yeah
I know if they just limited the playable

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:52.540
I know if they just limited the playable
 

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.290
I know if they just limited the playable
areas a little bit you know it does help

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.300
areas a little bit you know it does help
 

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.550
areas a little bit you know it does help
me there's only two buttons but actually

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:56.560
me there's only two buttons but actually
 

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.090
me there's only two buttons but actually
to be honest you know the there's

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.100
to be honest you know the there's
 

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.940
to be honest you know the there's
there's no me I would actually say that

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:02.950
there's no me I would actually say that
 

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.170
there's no me I would actually say that
you could actually you know the

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:04.180
you could actually you know the
 

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.700
you could actually you know the
fast-forward button is nice to have I

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:05.710
fast-forward button is nice to have I
 

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.400
fast-forward button is nice to have I
mean that's that's have there well what

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.410
mean that's that's have there well what
 

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.380
mean that's that's have there well what
do you need both is it easy oh well no

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.390
do you need both is it easy oh well no
 

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.150
do you need both is it easy oh well no
no no so the fast-forward button is

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:12.160
no no so the fast-forward button is
 

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.440
no no so the fast-forward button is
fight the the pause button is actually

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:13.450
fight the the pause button is actually
 

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.940
fight the the pause button is actually
really important because in this game

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:14.950
really important because in this game
 

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.710
really important because in this game
absolutely yeah you want it you want to

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720
absolutely yeah you want it you want to
 

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.800
absolutely yeah you want it you want to
be able to pause and but you know it put

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:19.810
be able to pause and but you know it put
 

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.870
be able to pause and but you know it put
it in an area where you're not gonna

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880
it in an area where you're not gonna
 

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.510
it in an area where you're not gonna
have a lot of gameplay one of the major

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520
have a lot of gameplay one of the major
 

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.290
have a lot of gameplay one of the major
problems for this game is that there are

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:28.300
problems for this game is that there are
 

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.750
problems for this game is that there are
maps where the first choke point is

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760
maps where the first choke point is
 

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.850
maps where the first choke point is
underneath one of these buttons you know

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:35.860
underneath one of these buttons you know
 

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.180
underneath one of these buttons you know
so all of the initial action is confined

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.190
so all of the initial action is confined
 

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.470
so all of the initial action is confined
to just a corner of the screen and if

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480
to just a corner of the screen and if
 

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.790
to just a corner of the screen and if
you're if you're just in a corner of the

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:44.800
you're if you're just in a corner of the
 

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.350
you're if you're just in a corner of the
screen and there's buttons in the way

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360
screen and there's buttons in the way
 

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.110
screen and there's buttons in the way
you can be immensely frustrating mm-hmm

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120
you can be immensely frustrating mm-hmm
 

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.370
you can be immensely frustrating mm-hmm
absolutely

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:50.380
absolutely
 

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.900
absolutely
but this so there's a couple of other

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:51.910
but this so there's a couple of other
 

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.340
but this so there's a couple of other
things that are interested in so you got

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:53.350
things that are interested in so you got
 

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.120
things that are interested in so you got
the Avatar you've also got these gates

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.130
the Avatar you've also got these gates
 

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.850
the Avatar you've also got these gates
that he defends you get bonus points if

00:21:59.850 --> 00:21:59.860
that he defends you get bonus points if
 

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.640
that he defends you get bonus points if
the gates don't fall but the level

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:02.650
the gates don't fall but the level
 

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.060
the gates don't fall but the level
doesn't end if the gate Falls so you

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.070
doesn't end if the gate Falls so you
 

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.100
doesn't end if the gate Falls so you
actually have several different things

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.110
actually have several different things
 

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.220
actually have several different things
that you're defending and not just your

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.230
that you're defending and not just your
 

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.020
that you're defending and not just your
ultimate

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.030
ultimate
 

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.370
ultimate
you also have the ability to collect

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.380
you also have the ability to collect
 

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.320
you also have the ability to collect
resources in later levels although I

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.330
resources in later levels although I
 

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.030
resources in later levels although I
felt that was balanced a little poorly

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.040
felt that was balanced a little poorly
 

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.640
felt that was balanced a little poorly
because I could never get to the point

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:20.650
because I could never get to the point
 

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.920
because I could never get to the point
where resource collection was actually

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:22.930
where resource collection was actually
 

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.640
where resource collection was actually
paying for itself also one thing that's

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:26.650
paying for itself also one thing that's
 

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.470
paying for itself also one thing that's
interesting is that it is by placing

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480
interesting is that it is by placing
 

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.040
interesting is that it is by placing
towers in this case close to my mine

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.050
towers in this case close to my mine
 

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.570
towers in this case close to my mine
named Sentinel that actually gives them

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:33.580
named Sentinel that actually gives them
 

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.770
named Sentinel that actually gives them
it actually makes them more powerful

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:34.780
it actually makes them more powerful
 

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.790
it actually makes them more powerful
that's what that little circle there

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:35.800
that's what that little circle there
 

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.790
that's what that little circle there
means right and as you Sentinel gains

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:38.800
means right and as you Sentinel gains
 

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.070
means right and as you Sentinel gains
levels that circle actually gets bigger

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080
levels that circle actually gets bigger
 

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.250
levels that circle actually gets bigger
so you have this thing and of course

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:44.260
so you have this thing and of course
 

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.800
so you have this thing and of course
that affects your strategy later on when

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:46.810
that affects your strategy later on when
 

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.420
that affects your strategy later on when
there's multiple gates that enemies

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:48.430
there's multiple gates that enemies
 

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.510
there's multiple gates that enemies
could be coming through because what

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520
could be coming through because what
 

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.480
could be coming through because what
you'll do is you'll lie you'll send your

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:54.490
you'll do is you'll lie you'll send your
 

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.130
you'll do is you'll lie you'll send your
Sentinel over to one gate and then

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:56.140
Sentinel over to one gate and then
 

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.690
Sentinel over to one gate and then
another one starts getting attacked so

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:57.700
another one starts getting attacked so
 

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.950
another one starts getting attacked so
you jump over there and you really need

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960
you jump over there and you really need
 

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.050
you jump over there and you really need
to pay attention to where that guy is

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.060
to pay attention to where that guy is
 

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.390
to pay attention to where that guy is
yeah it adds a lot of RPG there's

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400
yeah it adds a lot of RPG there's
 

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.890
yeah it adds a lot of RPG there's
there's you know RPG elements and these

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:04.900
there's you know RPG elements and these
 

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.480
there's you know RPG elements and these
kind of games are cool and I think you

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.490
kind of games are cool and I think you
 

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.740
kind of games are cool and I think you
know I think that's this game so this

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:07.750
know I think that's this game so this
 

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.420
know I think that's this game so this
can matches it up a little even though

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:09.430
can matches it up a little even though
 

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.340
can matches it up a little even though
it is even even though it's basis it is

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.350
it is even even though it's basis it is
 

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.200
it is even even though it's basis it is
what we call fixed path which is one of

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.210
what we call fixed path which is one of
 

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.540

beautiful actually I was really I was
really really glad to see that but do we

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:54.580
really really glad to see that but do we
 

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.800
really really glad to see that but do we
have a title card for this one or not

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:55.810
have a title card for this one or not
 

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.970

actually I didn't think we had title
 

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.240
actually I didn't think we had title
parts for the first ten so we should

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.250
parts for the first ten so we should
 

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.280
parts for the first ten so we should
probably spend very little time on this

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:02.290
probably spend very little time on this
 

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.020
probably spend very little time on this
yeah exactly

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.030

the non fixed path style of tower

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.220
the non fixed path style of tower
 

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.610

fact that it's using this particular
 

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.240
fact that it's using this particular
theme and you see I was able to just you

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.250
theme and you see I was able to just you
 

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.650
theme and you see I was able to just you
know continue back from where I where I

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:19.660

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:38.680
and then and let's let's try out to find
 

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.930
and then and let's let's try out to find
out this is a really good question

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:39.940
out this is a really good question
 

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.730
out this is a really good question

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.660
you know traditional lights they have
these kinds of games I think you know

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:09.670
these kinds of games I think you know
 

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.550
these kinds of games I think you know
we're always really impressed when

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:11.560
we're always really impressed when
 

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.430
we're always really impressed when
someone takes a time to really do a good

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440
someone takes a time to really do a good
 

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.410
someone takes a time to really do a good
job at these high-resolution displays

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:16.420
job at these high-resolution displays
 

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.820
job at these high-resolution displays
and remember this is an Asus Transformer

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:17.830
and remember this is an Asus Transformer
 

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.430
and remember this is an Asus Transformer
Prime this is you know by far not the

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440
Prime this is you know by far not the
 

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.790
Prime this is you know by far not the
highest resolution display that's gonna

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:23.800
highest resolution display that's gonna
 

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.560
highest resolution display that's gonna
be on the market this year I think

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:25.570
be on the market this year I think
 

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.260
be on the market this year I think
you've already talked about at least one

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.270
you've already talked about at least one
 

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.820
you've already talked about at least one
1080p display but but you can tell that

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:32.830
1080p display but but you can tell that
 

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.860
1080p display but but you can tell that
the crispness of these graphics

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:34.870
the crispness of these graphics
 

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.930
the crispness of these graphics
especially if we zoom in a little bit

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:36.940
especially if we zoom in a little bit
 

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.560
especially if we zoom in a little bit
on these graphics right oh you'll see

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:40.570
on these graphics right oh you'll see
 

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.129
on these graphics right oh you'll see
that each one of the graphics from the

00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:44.139
that each one of the graphics from the
 

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:49.469
that each one of the graphics from the
towers to the UI is really really

00:26:49.469 --> 00:26:49.479
towers to the UI is really really
 

00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:51.509
towers to the UI is really really
detailed it's not just high-res it's

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:51.519
detailed it's not just high-res it's
 

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:53.549
detailed it's not just high-res it's
detailed high-res you know look at those

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559
detailed high-res you know look at those
 

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:55.950
detailed high-res you know look at those
cobblestones look at the the detail on

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960
cobblestones look at the the detail on
 

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.499
cobblestones look at the the detail on
those towers look at the vegetation it's

00:26:58.499 --> 00:26:58.509
those towers look at the vegetation it's
 

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:00.899
those towers look at the vegetation it's
amazing it's really really well done and

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:00.909
amazing it's really really well done and
 

00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:02.669
amazing it's really really well done and
that's impressive to me yeah absolutely

00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679
that's impressive to me yeah absolutely
 

00:27:02.679 --> 00:27:03.659
that's impressive to me yeah absolutely
and the other thing I would say about

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:03.669
and the other thing I would say about
 

00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:05.039
and the other thing I would say about
this one is it you know if you look at

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:05.049
this one is it you know if you look at
 

00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:07.589
this one is it you know if you look at
this game you look at the tower you know

00:27:07.589 --> 00:27:07.599
this game you look at the tower you know
 

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:08.849
this game you look at the tower you know
come to us ask our defense game

00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:08.859
come to us ask our defense game
 

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:10.830
come to us ask our defense game
side-by-side if you look at the tiles in

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840
side-by-side if you look at the tiles in
 

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.849
side-by-side if you look at the tiles in
the background they look relatively

00:27:11.849 --> 00:27:11.859
the background they look relatively
 

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:13.710
the background they look relatively
similarly detailed but if you look at

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720
similarly detailed but if you look at
 

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.479
similarly detailed but if you look at
the fonts here the fonts here are really

00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:15.489
the fonts here the fonts here are really
 

00:27:15.489 --> 00:27:17.759
the fonts here the fonts here are really
showing really high res and that makes

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:17.769
showing really high res and that makes
 

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:19.769
showing really high res and that makes
use different they're also rendered in a

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:19.779
use different they're also rendered in a
 

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:23.849
use different they're also rendered in a
style that that looks semi 3d and it

00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:23.859
style that that looks semi 3d and it
 

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:25.889
style that that looks semi 3d and it
just adds still a bit of a drop shadow a

00:27:25.889 --> 00:27:25.899
just adds still a bit of a drop shadow a
 

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.810
just adds still a bit of a drop shadow a
little bit of a Jo and it also get a

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:27.820
little bit of a Jo and it also get a
 

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.560
little bit of a Jo and it also get a
little bit of of a gradient on them and

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.570
little bit of of a gradient on them and
 

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.810
little bit of of a gradient on them and
it just it looks really pro I mean I

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:33.820
it just it looks really pro I mean I
 

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.549
it just it looks really pro I mean I
they did a really nice job with this so

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559
they did a really nice job with this so
 

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:37.619
they did a really nice job with this so
again you know I haven't played the game

00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:37.629
again you know I haven't played the game
 

00:27:37.629 --> 00:27:39.119
again you know I haven't played the game
long enough to be able to give a big

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:39.129
long enough to be able to give a big
 

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:41.190
long enough to be able to give a big
give a full you know in-depth review but

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200
give a full you know in-depth review but
 

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.859
give a full you know in-depth review but
why I like what I've seen so far you can

00:27:43.859 --> 00:27:43.869
why I like what I've seen so far you can
 

00:27:43.869 --> 00:27:45.419
why I like what I've seen so far you can
see by the way that this is not a full

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:45.429
see by the way that this is not a full
 

00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:48.960
see by the way that this is not a full
16 by 9 playing surface it's not four by

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:48.970
16 by 9 playing surface it's not four by
 

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.089
16 by 9 playing surface it's not four by
three either so it's interesting I'm not

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:51.099
three either so it's interesting I'm not
 

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:54.239
three either so it's interesting I'm not
sure where where that came from but or

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:54.249
sure where where that came from but or
 

00:27:54.249 --> 00:27:55.859
sure where where that came from but or
maybe it was four by three and they're

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:55.869
maybe it was four by three and they're
 

00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:57.930
maybe it was four by three and they're
just chosen to do it this way right can

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:57.940
just chosen to do it this way right can
 

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.129
just chosen to do it this way right can
you zoom no okay so that's interesting

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:01.139
you zoom no okay so that's interesting
 

00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:04.499
you zoom no okay so that's interesting
yeah so what you can see is they've done

00:28:04.499 --> 00:28:04.509
yeah so what you can see is they've done
 

00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:07.109
yeah so what you can see is they've done
a little bit of fill on the edges and by

00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:07.119
a little bit of fill on the edges and by
 

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:08.960
a little bit of fill on the edges and by
doing a tiny bit of fill on the edges

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:08.970
doing a tiny bit of fill on the edges
 

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.849
doing a tiny bit of fill on the edges
they've made something that I think

00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:11.859
they've made something that I think
 

00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:13.799
they've made something that I think
actually works on both a four by three

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:13.809
actually works on both a four by three
 

00:28:13.809 --> 00:28:17.549
actually works on both a four by three
and a sixteen by nine just as easily and

00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559
and a sixteen by nine just as easily and
 

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.519
and a sixteen by nine just as easily and
it looks great it looks intentional on

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:20.529
it looks great it looks intentional on
 

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:23.969
it looks great it looks intentional on
both resolutions instead of looking like

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:23.979
both resolutions instead of looking like
 

00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:25.680
both resolutions instead of looking like
it's been ported from one or the other

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:25.690
it's been ported from one or the other
 

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.239
it's been ported from one or the other
exactly what they did I you know putting

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:27.249
exactly what they did I you know putting
 

00:28:27.249 --> 00:28:28.799
exactly what they did I you know putting
this little little border on the side

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:28.809
this little little border on the side
 

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:30.210
this little little border on the side
here in order to in order to get some

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:30.220
here in order to in order to get some
 

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.460
here in order to in order to get some
additional additional real estate you

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:32.470
additional additional real estate you
 

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.960
additional additional real estate you
know makes a huge different having black

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:33.970
know makes a huge different having black
 

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.149
know makes a huge different having black
bars so you know sometimes it's even a

00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159
bars so you know sometimes it's even a
 

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:37.529
bars so you know sometimes it's even a
little thing like that makes a huge

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:37.539
little thing like that makes a huge
 

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:39.299
little thing like that makes a huge
difference and again notice that the

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:39.309
difference and again notice that the
 

00:28:39.309 --> 00:28:41.460
difference and again notice that the
borders are not just borders they've

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:41.470
borders are not just borders they've
 

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.060
borders are not just borders they've
also moved the UI into those areas so

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.070
also moved the UI into those areas so
 

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.639
also moved the UI into those areas so
it's not wasted space absolutely this is

00:28:47.639 --> 00:28:47.649
it's not wasted space absolutely this is
 

00:28:47.649 --> 00:28:49.649
it's not wasted space absolutely this is
great because the more UI on the playing

00:28:49.649 --> 00:28:49.659
great because the more UI on the playing
 

00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:50.730
great because the more UI on the playing
field the more

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:50.740
field the more
 

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.130
field the more
the game will get honestly yeah yeah and

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:53.140
the game will get honestly yeah yeah and
 

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.570
the game will get honestly yeah yeah and
this is it's great to have people to get

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:54.580
this is it's great to have people to get
 

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.430
this is it's great to have people to get
that stuff out of out of the way and

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440
that stuff out of out of the way and
 

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.780
that stuff out of out of the way and
they really do a good job with that so

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:57.790
they really do a good job with that so
 

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.520
they really do a good job with that so
yeah in general you know this this is

00:28:59.520 --> 00:28:59.530
yeah in general you know this this is
 

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.960
yeah in general you know this this is
this is a model if you don't actually

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:00.970
this is a model if you don't actually
 

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.540
this is a model if you don't actually
want to go deeper and create like would

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:03.550
want to go deeper and create like would
 

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.100
want to go deeper and create like would
have been you would be nicer if they

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.110
have been you would be nicer if they
 

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.840
have been you would be nicer if they
extended this border all the way out and

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:06.850
extended this border all the way out and
 

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.100
extended this border all the way out and
it didn't look like there was this hard

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:08.110
it didn't look like there was this hard
 

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.290
it didn't look like there was this hard
ledge here on the sides but if you but

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:10.300
ledge here on the sides but if you but
 

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.850
ledge here on the sides but if you but
if you can't do that this is the next

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:11.860
if you can't do that this is the next
 

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.470
if you can't do that this is the next
best thing and it honestly it really

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480
best thing and it honestly it really
 

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.730
best thing and it honestly it really
makes a huge difference it doesn't it

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:14.740
makes a huge difference it doesn't it
 

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.049
makes a huge difference it doesn't it
may not seem like it but if we just saw

00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:16.059
may not seem like it but if we just saw
 

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:18.540
may not seem like it but if we just saw
black bars here it would feel wrong it

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:18.550
black bars here it would feel wrong it
 

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.410
black bars here it would feel wrong it
would feel like we're watching

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:19.420
would feel like we're watching
 

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.240
would feel like we're watching
experience it was just less it would

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.250
experience it was just less it would
 

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.760

let's play against the CPU will play
against the Green CPU here and you'll

00:30:59.580 --> 00:30:59.590
against the Green CPU here and you'll
 

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.890

was even sort of debating whether we
would call this a true tower defense

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:16.879

towers I'm sitting down character

00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:33.259
towers I'm sitting down character
 

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:34.740

this is sort of I would say it's a so
 

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.419
this is sort of I would say it's a so
each one of these guys are gonna produce

00:31:43.419 --> 00:31:43.429
each one of these guys are gonna produce
 

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:44.649
each one of these guys are gonna produce
little characters that are ultimately

00:31:44.649 --> 00:31:44.659
little characters that are ultimately
 

00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:46.119
little characters that are ultimately
gonna do my battling for me

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:46.129
gonna do my battling for me
 

00:31:46.129 --> 00:31:47.830

so the towers aren't actually aren't

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840
so the towers aren't actually aren't
 

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.720
so the towers aren't actually aren't
aren't necessarily fighting themselves

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:49.730
aren't necessarily fighting themselves
 

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.850
aren't necessarily fighting themselves
although sometimes they are but they're

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:51.860
although sometimes they are but they're
 

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.519
although sometimes they are but they're
also producing characters interesting so

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:54.529
also producing characters interesting so
 

00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:56.080

00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:39.129
high-res unfortunately because the
resolution of this tablet is very high a

00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:39.139
resolution of this tablet is very high a
 

00:32:39.139 --> 00:32:40.840
resolution of this tablet is very high a
lot of them just look really really low

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:40.850
lot of them just look really really low
 

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.509
lot of them just look really really low
red I see but I really like I really

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519
red I see but I really like I really
 

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:45.310
red I see but I really like I really
like the idea of head-to-head combat and

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320
like the idea of head-to-head combat and
 

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.930
like the idea of head-to-head combat and
it makes so much sense with this kind of

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:46.940
it makes so much sense with this kind of
 

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.600
it makes so much sense with this kind of
with this tablet form factors so I you

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:49.610
with this tablet form factors so I you
 

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.399
with this tablet form factors so I you
know I just I can't wait to see you know

00:32:51.399 --> 00:32:51.409
know I just I can't wait to see you know
 

00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:52.600
know I just I can't wait to see you know
kind of where were you where they would

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:52.610
kind of where were you where they would
 

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:53.860
kind of where were you where they would
go with this like it seems like there's

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:53.870
go with this like it seems like there's
 

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.499
go with this like it seems like there's
a lot of potential here yeah you know

00:32:56.499 --> 00:32:56.509
a lot of potential here yeah you know
 

00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:58.240
a lot of potential here yeah you know
I'm not sure about all of the strategy

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:58.250
I'm not sure about all of the strategy
 

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.430
I'm not sure about all of the strategy
but you can build you know towers in all

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440
but you can build you know towers in all
 

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.690
but you can build you know towers in all
sorts of different places and you see

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:01.700
sorts of different places and you see
 

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.159
sorts of different places and you see
they get attack from all sides now you

00:33:03.159 --> 00:33:03.169
they get attack from all sides now you
 

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:06.070
they get attack from all sides now you
can draw AI just got killed by the CPU

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080
can draw AI just got killed by the CPU
 

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.169
can draw AI just got killed by the CPU
I'm the lowest level so I clearly didn't

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:08.179
I'm the lowest level so I clearly didn't
 

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:09.340
I'm the lowest level so I clearly didn't
do a very good job that's cool you are

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:09.350
do a very good job that's cool you are
 

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.909
do a very good job that's cool you are
playing sideways I am playing sideways

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919
playing sideways I am playing sideways
 

00:33:11.919 --> 00:33:14.470
playing sideways I am playing sideways
and that's mostly to keep the cable from

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480
and that's mostly to keep the cable from
 

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.029
and that's mostly to keep the cable from
from getting pulled out so you guys the

00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039
from getting pulled out so you guys the
 

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:18.070
from getting pulled out so you guys the
truth going on yeah we'd like some cable

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080
truth going on yeah we'd like some cable
 

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.519
truth going on yeah we'd like some cable
glue or something exactly it's some some

duct tape would work I think so

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:23.870
duct tape would work I think so
 

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.240
duct tape would work I think so
so yes that's pretty much all I want to

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:25.250
so yes that's pretty much all I want to
 

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.649
so yes that's pretty much all I want to

version but split-screen is kind of

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120
version but split-screen is kind of
 

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.519
version but split-screen is kind of
awesome and that's why and this is what

00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:36.529
awesome and that's why and this is what
 

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:38.169
awesome and that's why and this is what
really shines on a tablet and that's is

00:33:38.169 --> 00:33:38.179
really shines on a tablet and that's is
 

00:33:38.179 --> 00:33:39.399
really shines on a tablet and that's is
this is why I want to see them upgrade

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:39.409
this is why I want to see them upgrade
 

00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:41.380
this is why I want to see them upgrade

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:08.690
about it can they still do it or do they
 

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.359
about it can they still do it or do they
have to study coding or something okay

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:10.369
have to study coding or something okay
 

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:14.349

just right so surrounded by a halo of

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:25.190
just right so surrounded by a halo of
 

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.140
just right so surrounded by a halo of
light as always okay yeah it gets a

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:29.150
light as always okay yeah it gets a
 

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.810
light as always okay yeah it gets a
little bit annoying something so

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:31.820

I've been in in video games for almost

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680
I've been in in video games for almost
 

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.390
I've been in in video games for almost
20 years now

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400
20 years now
 

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.150
20 years now
and I think it's a really good question

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160
and I think it's a really good question
 

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.590
and I think it's a really good question
you know can you make a video game

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:56.600
you know can you make a video game
 

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.510
you know can you make a video game
without knowing coding well no no you

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520
without knowing coding well no no you
 

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.320
without knowing coding well no no you
really can't

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:02.330
really can't
 

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.120
really can't
oh yeah you can okay there are some

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.130
oh yeah you can okay there are some
 

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.310
oh yeah you can okay there are some
tools that will allow you to try and put

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320
tools that will allow you to try and put
 

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.460
tools that will allow you to try and put
together a game but eventually it boils

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:09.470
together a game but eventually it boils
 

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.400
together a game but eventually it boils
down to some form of coding whether it's

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:11.410
down to some form of coding whether it's
 

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:14.740
down to some form of coding whether it's
typing in a language like C sharp or C++

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:14.750
typing in a language like C sharp or C++
 

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.230
typing in a language like C sharp or C++
or Java or whether it's you know

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240
or Java or whether it's you know
 

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.930
or Java or whether it's you know
connecting bricks together in in some

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:19.940
connecting bricks together in in some
 

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.390
connecting bricks together in in some
sort of a game maker environment you you

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400
sort of a game maker environment you you
 

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.490
sort of a game maker environment you you
are going to be writing computer

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:24.500
are going to be writing computer
 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.050
are going to be writing computer
instructions yes I mean there are

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:26.060
instructions yes I mean there are
 

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.790
instructions yes I mean there are
certain kinds of tools that allow you to

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800
certain kinds of tools that allow you to
 

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.350
certain kinds of tools that allow you to
build really cookie-cutter games that

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:29.360
build really cookie-cutter games that
 

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.670
build really cookie-cutter games that
are that are very very similar but you

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680
are that are very very similar but you
 

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.410
are that are very very similar but you
know for even for a tower defense game

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:32.420
know for even for a tower defense game
 

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.230
know for even for a tower defense game
you want to know things like pathing you

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240
you want to know things like pathing you
 

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.490
you want to know things like pathing you
want to make sure that those guys are

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:36.500
want to make sure that those guys are
 

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.380
want to make sure that those guys are
always following the shortest path that

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:38.390
always following the shortest path that
 

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.850
always following the shortest path that
requires a little bit of code you might

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:39.860
requires a little bit of code you might
 

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.380
requires a little bit of code you might
want to have some AI and a lot of other

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:41.390
want to have some AI and a lot of other
 

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.450
want to have some AI and a lot of other
kinds of games so even if you have a

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:43.460
kinds of games so even if you have a
 

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.670
kinds of games so even if you have a
system that gives you a lot of stuff for

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680
system that gives you a lot of stuff for
 

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.930
system that gives you a lot of stuff for
free like that you're still gonna want

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:46.940
free like that you're still gonna want
 

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.970
free like that you're still gonna want
to code that being said you know there

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:48.980
to code that being said you know there
 

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.980
to code that being said you know there
are really great tools out there that

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:50.990
are really great tools out there that
 

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.890
are really great tools out there that
have a lot of the work for you and

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:52.900
have a lot of the work for you and
 

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.170
have a lot of the work for you and
honestly I'm a firm believer that anyone

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.180
honestly I'm a firm believer that anyone
 

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.050
honestly I'm a firm believer that anyone
with the drive can learn how to code oh

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:58.060
with the drive can learn how to code oh
 

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.720
with the drive can learn how to code oh
and you know I'm not okay because I used

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:01.730
and you know I'm not okay because I used
 

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.970
and you know I'm not okay because I used
to teach coding I used to a computer

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:03.980
to teach coding I used to a computer
 

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.900
to teach coding I used to a computer
science and the truth is if if coding

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:07.910
science and the truth is if if coding
 

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.190
science and the truth is if if coding
frustrates you and you really don't get

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200
frustrates you and you really don't get
 

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.120
frustrates you and you really don't get
it

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.130
it
 

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.910
it
you are my experiences you probably

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920
you are my experiences you probably
 

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.830
you are my experiences you probably
won't get it because the people that I

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:14.840
won't get it because the people that I
 

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.120
won't get it because the people that I
saw you're really successful in my

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:16.130
saw you're really successful in my
 

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.340
saw you're really successful in my
classes it's sort of clicked with them

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:18.350
classes it's sort of clicked with them
 

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.440
classes it's sort of clicked with them
fairly early on well and there's also a

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:20.450
fairly early on well and there's also a
 

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.300
fairly early on well and there's also a
difference between I think in my

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:22.310
difference between I think in my
 

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.430
difference between I think in my
experiences coding and coding class work

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440
experiences coding and coding class work
 

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.140
experiences coding and coding class work
versus coding in like one of one of the

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.150
versus coding in like one of one of the
 

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.130
versus coding in like one of one of the
people I went to school with who was

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:27.140
people I went to school with who was
 

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.930
people I went to school with who was
terrible at coding class work became one

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:28.940
terrible at coding class work became one
 

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.400

of the most sexual successful engineers

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:30.410
of the most sexual successful engineers
 

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.460
of the most sexual successful engineers
I know cool engineers you know I know

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:33.470
I know cool engineers you know I know
 

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:39.100
I know cool engineers you know I know
building so yeah I would say that I

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:39.110
building so yeah I would say that I
 

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.340
building so yeah I would say that I
would say that you know that mostly to

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:42.350
would say that you know that mostly to
 

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.590
would say that you know that mostly to
me it's you know at least at least a lot

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:44.600
me it's you know at least at least a lot
 

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.710
me it's you know at least at least a lot
of a lot of the coding is

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720
of a lot of the coding is
 

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.080
of a lot of the coding is
about right well and it was optimistic

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.090
about right well and it was optimistic
 

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.970
about right well and it was optimistic
make a distinction too if you want to

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980
make a distinction too if you want to
 

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.620
make a distinction too if you want to
build a game all by yourself

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:51.630
build a game all by yourself
 

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.800
build a game all by yourself
then yeah you're you you might be you

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:54.810
then yeah you're you you might be you
 

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.320
then yeah you're you you might be you
might end up with one of these tools

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:57.330
might end up with one of these tools
 

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.760
might end up with one of these tools
that help you to make a cookie-cutter

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:58.770
that help you to make a cookie-cutter
 

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.680
that help you to make a cookie-cutter
game but there's nothing really super

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:00.690
game but there's nothing really super
 

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:03.740
game but there's nothing really super
special about it but there are so many

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:03.750
special about it but there are so many
 

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.950
special about it but there are so many
things that you can do with a game that

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960
things that you can do with a game that
 

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.590
things that you can do with a game that
don't involve coding and I think that

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:09.600
don't involve coding and I think that
 

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.830
don't involve coding and I think that
you would find that there are far more

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:11.840
you would find that there are far more
 

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.870
you would find that there are far more

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:25.890
this info even if the app is ultimately
 

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.250
this info even if the app is ultimately
rejected and the reason was given that's

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260
rejected and the reason was given that's
 

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.590
rejected and the reason was given that's
a good question um I mean we have that

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:30.600
a good question um I mean we have that
 

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.250
a good question um I mean we have that
data and if you if you ping us we can

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260
data and if you if you ping us we can
 

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.690
data and if you if you ping us we can
tell you we generally when when we

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700
tell you we generally when when we
 

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.370
tell you we generally when when we
suggest apps and they get rejected we

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380
suggest apps and they get rejected we
 

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.640
suggest apps and they get rejected we
generally don't contact the developer

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:43.650
generally don't contact the developer
 

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.680
generally don't contact the developer
unless they got rejected for a reason

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:45.690
unless they got rejected for a reason
 

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:46.760
unless they got rejected for a reason
that's easy to fix

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:46.770
that's easy to fix
 

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.460
that's easy to fix
but you know if you're if you're curious

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:49.470
but you know if you're if you're curious
 

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.290
but you know if you're if you're curious
yeah you know drop me an email tell me

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300
yeah you know drop me an email tell me
 

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:52.610
yeah you know drop me an email tell me
what game it is and I'll look it up for

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:52.620
what game it is and I'll look it up for
 

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.220
what game it is and I'll look it up for
you and we might consider making that

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:55.230
you and we might consider making that
 

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.050
you and we might consider making that
information public but you know as with

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060
information public but you know as with
 

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.180
information public but you know as with
all internal

00:39:59.180 --> 00:39:59.190
all internal
 

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.829
all internal
Aysen making it public involves

00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839
Aysen making it public involves
 

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:02.420
Aysen making it public involves
something through a lot of who's yeah I

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:02.430
something through a lot of who's yeah I
 

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.829
something through a lot of who's yeah I
think I think I think it's a really

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839
think I think I think it's a really
 

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:05.240
think I think I think it's a really
interesting thing you know I think I

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.250
interesting thing you know I think I
 

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.440
interesting thing you know I think I
think the best thing is to really give

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:06.450
think the best thing is to really give
 

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.960
think the best thing is to really give
feedback and so I think that you know if

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:08.970
feedback and so I think that you know if
 

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.550
feedback and so I think that you know if
a game is rejected because well it's

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560
a game is rejected because well it's
 

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.020
a game is rejected because well it's
just never going to be featured it's not

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.030
just never going to be featured it's not
 

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.970
just never going to be featured it's not
very useful if the game is rejected

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980
very useful if the game is rejected
 

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.460
very useful if the game is rejected
because it has this or this wrong with

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:16.470
because it has this or this wrong with
 

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.290
because it has this or this wrong with
it then then the developer is contacted

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300
it then then the developer is contacted
 

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.940
it then then the developer is contacted
and I think the real question is was it

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:19.950
and I think the real question is was it
 

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.710
and I think the real question is was it
looked at at all right now yeah a lot of

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720
looked at at all right now yeah a lot of
 

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.849
looked at at all right now yeah a lot of
people are feeling I feel like it goes

00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:22.859
people are feeling I feel like it goes
 

00:40:22.859 --> 00:40:24.290
people are feeling I feel like it goes
into a cloud and they don't know so I'd

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300
into a cloud and they don't know so I'd
 

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.390
into a cloud and they don't know so I'd
loved I'd love to at least have a way

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400
loved I'd love to at least have a way
 

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.650
loved I'd love to at least have a way
that a developer could check that would

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660
that a developer could check that would
 

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.069
that a developer could check that would
be cool

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079
be cool
 

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.440
be cool
that would be great okay so let's look

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:30.450
that would be great okay so let's look
 

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.359
that would be great okay so let's look
at a couple so look why don't we take a

00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:32.369
at a couple so look why don't we take a
 

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:35.480
at a couple so look why don't we take a
look at Space Station yeah oh yeah this

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.490
look at Space Station yeah oh yeah this
 

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:40.010
look at Space Station yeah oh yeah this
is this is this is this is a cool game

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020
is this is this is this is a cool game
 

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.530
is this is this is this is a cool game
now it does have the button of shame and

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540
now it does have the button of shame and
 

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.870
now it does have the button of shame and
it does have beacon the compatibility

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880
it does have beacon the compatibility
 

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.730
it does have beacon the compatibility
mode stuff in it which is sad yeah

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740
mode stuff in it which is sad yeah
 

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.230
mode stuff in it which is sad yeah
what is it very sad what is interesting

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240
what is it very sad what is interesting
 

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.059
what is it very sad what is interesting
about it though is that it does actually

00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:50.069
about it though is that it does actually
 

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:53.450
about it though is that it does actually
have both HD and low resolution graphics

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460
have both HD and low resolution graphics
 

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.640
have both HD and low resolution graphics
and that graphics are really different I

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:55.650
and that graphics are really different I
 

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.960
and that graphics are really different I
think that's part of the reason why they

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:56.970
think that's part of the reason why they
 

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:58.640
think that's part of the reason why they
love it I actually in some ways liked

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.650
love it I actually in some ways liked
 

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.089
love it I actually in some ways liked
the low res layout but the HD graphics

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099
the low res layout but the HD graphics
 

00:41:02.099 --> 00:41:03.950
the low res layout but the HD graphics
are really really nice it's very pretty

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960
are really really nice it's very pretty
 

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.040
are really really nice it's very pretty
I'm very impressed and yeah the layout

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.050
I'm very impressed and yeah the layout
 

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.140
I'm very impressed and yeah the layout
isn't quite as creative you know that

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.150
isn't quite as creative you know that
 

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.150
isn't quite as creative you know that
circle thing is sort of a little bit

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160
circle thing is sort of a little bit
 

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.190
circle thing is sort of a little bit
feels a little more thrown together but

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200
feels a little more thrown together but
 

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.990
feels a little more thrown together but
it's very very crisp let's go ahead and

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000
it's very very crisp let's go ahead and
 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.579
it's very very crisp let's go ahead and
get into the game the interesting thing

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:16.589
get into the game the interesting thing
 

00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:18.829
get into the game the interesting thing
about this game is you know while we've

00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839
about this game is you know while we've
 

00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:22.579
about this game is you know while we've
talked about open field games where the

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:22.589
talked about open field games where the
 

00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:26.839
talked about open field games where the
enemies path is determined by the towers

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:26.849
enemies path is determined by the towers
 

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.460
enemies path is determined by the towers
that you build and we've also talked

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.470
that you build and we've also talked
 

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.050
that you build and we've also talked
about fixed path games where the enemies

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060
about fixed path games where the enemies
 

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.819
about fixed path games where the enemies
always follow a single path no matter

00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:31.829
always follow a single path no matter
 

00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:34.970
always follow a single path no matter
what you build this is a little more

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980
what you build this is a little more
 

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.339
what you build this is a little more
interesting you start with a space

00:41:37.339 --> 00:41:37.349
interesting you start with a space
 

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:40.849
interesting you start with a space
station core and then you build out from

00:41:40.849 --> 00:41:40.859
station core and then you build out from
 

00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:45.920
station core and then you build out from
that core and yeah ultimately you know

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:45.930
that core and yeah ultimately you know
 

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.230
that core and yeah ultimately you know
the goal is to and you kind of do two

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240
the goal is to and you kind of do two
 

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.550
the goal is to and you kind of do two
things you got it you've got it you see

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560
things you got it you've got it you see
 

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.809
things you got it you've got it you see
I've got to I've got asteroids

00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:50.819
I've got to I've got asteroids
 

00:41:50.819 --> 00:41:52.099
I've got to I've got asteroids
surrounding me I've got to actually

00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:52.109
surrounding me I've got to actually
 

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.980
surrounding me I've got to actually
build power nodes so that I can mine the

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:54.990
build power nodes so that I can mine the
 

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.240
build power nodes so that I can mine the
asteroids and I don't right so you have

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.250
asteroids and I don't right so you have
 

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.250
asteroids and I don't right so you have
a resource collection issue as well as

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260
a resource collection issue as well as
 

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.740
a resource collection issue as well as
just a defense issue exactly and and so

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:00.750
just a defense issue exactly and and so
 

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.660
just a defense issue exactly and and so
and the most important thing is to get

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:02.670
and the most important thing is to get
 

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.450
and the most important thing is to get
mining but you if you obviously mind too

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460
mining but you if you obviously mind too
 

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.800
mining but you if you obviously mind too
much and you don't actually build the

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:06.810
much and you don't actually build the
 

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.390
much and you don't actually build the
fences then your miners will just get

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400
fences then your miners will just get
 

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.829
fences then your miners will just get
destroyed so you've got to start

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839
destroyed so you've got to start
 

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:12.460
destroyed so you've got to start
building things like like turrets

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:12.470
building things like like turrets
 

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.720
building things like like turrets
and you've got and unfortunately now

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:13.730
and you've got and unfortunately now
 

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:14.770
and you've got and unfortunately now
that I build miners I don't actually

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:14.780
that I build miners I don't actually
 

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.839
that I build miners I don't actually
have money to build anything else so I'm

00:42:16.839 --> 00:42:16.849
have money to build anything else so I'm
 

00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:18.579
have money to build anything else so I'm
just gonna try to collect as much as

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:18.589
just gonna try to collect as much as
 

00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:21.400
just gonna try to collect as much as
much resource as possible but I've got

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:21.410
much resource as possible but I've got
 

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.640
much resource as possible but I've got
incoming destroyers I'm gonna get killed

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:23.650
incoming destroyers I'm gonna get killed
 

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:27.220
incoming destroyers I'm gonna get killed
here and go do you oh yeah this I'm

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:27.230
here and go do you oh yeah this I'm
 

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.599
here and go do you oh yeah this I'm
where they comin from where they come I

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:28.609
where they comin from where they come I
 

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:33.190
where they comin from where they come I
don't know see over in the top yeah you

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200
don't know see over in the top yeah you
 

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.839
don't know see over in the top yeah you
can zoom in so I I'm the I'm your

00:42:34.839 --> 00:42:34.849
can zoom in so I I'm the I'm your
 

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:36.790
can zoom in so I I'm the I'm your
potency now you got some money I have my

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800
potency now you got some money I have my
 

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.200
potency now you got some money I have my
I don't like I can't feel anything

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:38.210
I don't like I can't feel anything
 

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.359
I don't like I can't feel anything
useful oh my god this yeah the the I

00:42:40.359 --> 00:42:40.369
useful oh my god this yeah the the I
 

00:42:40.369 --> 00:42:41.950
useful oh my god this yeah the the I
guess I'm not sure if it's from the zoom

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960
guess I'm not sure if it's from the zoom
 

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.859
guess I'm not sure if it's from the zoom
or something else but the video is no

00:42:44.859 --> 00:42:44.869
or something else but the video is no
 

00:42:44.869 --> 00:42:46.510
or something else but the video is no
longer coming in I get a blank screen Oh

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520
longer coming in I get a blank screen Oh
 

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.800
longer coming in I get a blank screen Oh
hold on let's try it one more time 1 2 3

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:49.810
hold on let's try it one more time 1 2 3
 

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:54.010
hold on let's try it one more time 1 2 3
plug this in it is very easy to lose the

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.020
plug this in it is very easy to lose the
 

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.230
plug this in it is very easy to lose the
connection on these on this particular

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240
connection on these on this particular
 

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.740
connection on these on this particular
my friend of thinks HTM oka there we are

00:42:59.740 --> 00:42:59.750
my friend of thinks HTM oka there we are
 

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:03.280
my friend of thinks HTM oka there we are
back to it yeah all right so see that's

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:03.290
back to it yeah all right so see that's
 

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.170
back to it yeah all right so see that's
what so is now building a missile

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:05.180
what so is now building a missile
 

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.460
what so is now building a missile
launcher be super useful and I almost

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:06.470
launcher be super useful and I almost
 

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.740
launcher be super useful and I almost
have enough money to do that or a rail

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:08.750
have enough money to do that or a rail
 

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:16.059
have enough money to do that or a rail
cannon so I'm almost there almost okay

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:16.069
cannon so I'm almost there almost okay
 

00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:18.220
cannon so I'm almost there almost okay
missile launcher so this is cool because

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:18.230
missile launcher so this is cool because
 

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.470
missile launcher so this is cool because
most tower defense games will just give

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480
most tower defense games will just give
 

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.540
most tower defense games will just give
you money for enemies killed so if

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:22.550
you money for enemies killed so if
 

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:24.370
you money for enemies killed so if
you're not killing enemies you don't get

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:24.380
you're not killing enemies you don't get
 

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.530
you're not killing enemies you don't get
anything whereas this one you've got

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:26.540
anything whereas this one you've got
 

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.790
anything whereas this one you've got
this sort of continuous thing so even

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800
this sort of continuous thing so even
 

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.190
this sort of continuous thing so even
between waves of enemies you're cranking

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200
between waves of enemies you're cranking
 

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.720
between waves of enemies you're cranking
up the money I think that's kind of kind

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:31.730
up the money I think that's kind of kind
 

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:32.589
up the money I think that's kind of kind
of a cool idea

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599
of a cool idea
 

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:35.109
of a cool idea
absolutely and yeah you'll see now I

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119
absolutely and yeah you'll see now I
 

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:38.230
absolutely and yeah you'll see now I
have I have another laser turret and it

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240
have I have another laser turret and it
 

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.640
have I have another laser turret and it
takes time to build things if I don't

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:39.650
takes time to build things if I don't
 

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.370
takes time to build things if I don't
build the power nodes then I cannot

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:42.380
build the power nodes then I cannot
 

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.190
build the power nodes then I cannot
actually build out a laser turret there

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200
actually build out a laser turret there
 

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.660
actually build out a laser turret there
because I have only a limited number of

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:46.670
because I have only a limited number of
 

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.940
because I have only a limited number of
connections also so there is there is

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:48.950
connections also so there is there is
 

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.829
connections also so there is there is
there's a lot of there's a lot of detail

00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839
there's a lot of there's a lot of detail
 

00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:52.089
there's a lot of there's a lot of detail
in this game and you do need to know

00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:52.099
in this game and you do need to know
 

00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:53.140
in this game and you do need to know
where people are coming from to know

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:53.150
where people are coming from to know
 

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.819
where people are coming from to know
they're coming from there do I have any

00:43:54.819 --> 00:43:54.829
they're coming from there do I have any
 

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:56.140
they're coming from there do I have any
defenses out there no that's where all

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.150
defenses out there no that's where all
 

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.640
defenses out there no that's where all
my miners are so this is this is a

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:57.650
my miners are so this is this is a
 

00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.790
my miners are so this is this is a
really serious problem for me now so I'm

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800
really serious problem for me now so I'm
 

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.059
really serious problem for me now so I'm
going to want to build oh do I not have

00:44:04.059 --> 00:44:04.069
going to want to build oh do I not have
 

00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:06.150
going to want to build oh do I not have
a power nodes that miner that's not good

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160
a power nodes that miner that's not good
 

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.650
a power nodes that miner that's not good
so I'm getting completely squashed here

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:08.660
so I'm getting completely squashed here
 

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:14.410
so I'm getting completely squashed here
by these guys now how how important is

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:14.420
by these guys now how how important is
 

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.930
by these guys now how how important is
the actual topology of your station like

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:16.940
the actual topology of your station like
 

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.050
the actual topology of your station like
well or I should say the the physical

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:20.060
well or I should say the the physical
 

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.640
well or I should say the the physical
locations of things rather than general

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:21.650
locations of things rather than general
 

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:23.410
locations of things rather than general
topology the general topology is more

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:23.420
topology the general topology is more
 

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.910
topology the general topology is more
important okay you need to you need to

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920
important okay you need to you need to
 

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.989
important okay you need to you need to
make sure there's enough

00:44:25.989 --> 00:44:25.999
make sure there's enough
 

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:29.139
make sure there's enough
it's connecting things and yeah I'm

00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:29.149
it's connecting things and yeah I'm
 

00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:31.179
it's connecting things and yeah I'm
about to get lose a laser turret here

00:44:31.179 --> 00:44:31.189
about to get lose a laser turret here
 

00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:33.099
about to get lose a laser turret here
which is sad but at least he'll he'll

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:33.109
which is sad but at least he'll he'll
 

00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:36.159
which is sad but at least he'll he'll
he'll start firing on that guy yeah so

00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:36.169
he'll start firing on that guy yeah so
 

00:44:36.169 --> 00:44:37.929
he'll start firing on that guy yeah so
this is its interests it is kind of more

00:44:37.929 --> 00:44:37.939
this is its interests it is kind of more
 

00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:41.349
this is its interests it is kind of more
of a hybrid because the while we have a

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359
of a hybrid because the while we have a
 

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.449
of a hybrid because the while we have a
lot of elements of tower defense games

00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:43.459
lot of elements of tower defense games
 

00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:45.219
lot of elements of tower defense games
it feels like a tower defense games the

00:44:45.219 --> 00:44:45.229
it feels like a tower defense games the
 

00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:47.349
it feels like a tower defense games the
enemies to behave very differently they

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359
enemies to behave very differently they
 

00:44:47.359 --> 00:44:49.299
enemies to behave very differently they
come in from different directions they

00:44:49.299 --> 00:44:49.309
come in from different directions they
 

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:51.489
come in from different directions they
sit there and they actually attack your

00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:51.499
sit there and they actually attack your
 

00:44:51.499 --> 00:44:54.519
sit there and they actually attack your
towers which is uncommon there are some

00:44:54.519 --> 00:44:54.529
towers which is uncommon there are some
 

00:44:54.529 --> 00:44:56.079
towers which is uncommon there are some
other tower defense games I think one of

00:44:56.079 --> 00:44:56.089
other tower defense games I think one of
 

00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:58.779
other tower defense games I think one of
the other ones towers and trolls I think

00:44:58.779 --> 00:44:58.789
the other ones towers and trolls I think
 

00:44:58.789 --> 00:45:00.839
the other ones towers and trolls I think
they will attack your your towers yes

00:45:00.839 --> 00:45:00.849
they will attack your your towers yes
 

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:03.369
they will attack your your towers yes
and I'm a little I have mixed feelings

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:03.379
and I'm a little I have mixed feelings
 

00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:05.559
and I'm a little I have mixed feelings
on that because especially for towers

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:05.569
on that because especially for towers
 

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:09.339
on that because especially for towers
and trolls I that felt a little gimmicky

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:09.349
and trolls I that felt a little gimmicky
 

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:11.169
and trolls I that felt a little gimmicky
that that felt like just okay well every

00:45:11.169 --> 00:45:11.179
that that felt like just okay well every
 

00:45:11.179 --> 00:45:12.819
that that felt like just okay well every
now and then I I look in my towers

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:12.829
now and then I I look in my towers
 

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:14.499
now and then I I look in my towers
health is down and I need to go fix it

00:45:14.499 --> 00:45:14.509
health is down and I need to go fix it
 

00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:16.299
health is down and I need to go fix it
with some yeah some money and that's

00:45:16.299 --> 00:45:16.309
with some yeah some money and that's
 

00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:17.919
with some yeah some money and that's
annoying whereas this it's like well

00:45:17.919 --> 00:45:17.929
annoying whereas this it's like well
 

00:45:17.929 --> 00:45:19.899
annoying whereas this it's like well
they're attacking my tower so and

00:45:19.899 --> 00:45:19.909
they're attacking my tower so and
 

00:45:19.909 --> 00:45:22.839
they're attacking my tower so and
they're stopping to attack yes so the

00:45:22.839 --> 00:45:22.849
they're stopping to attack yes so the
 

00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:24.669
they're stopping to attack yes so the
fact that they're attacking my tower has

00:45:24.669 --> 00:45:24.679
fact that they're attacking my tower has
 

00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:28.029
fact that they're attacking my tower has
some significant impact on the way the

00:45:28.029 --> 00:45:28.039
some significant impact on the way the
 

00:45:28.039 --> 00:45:30.699
some significant impact on the way the
the defense is going to go absolutely

00:45:30.699 --> 00:45:30.709
the defense is going to go absolutely
 

00:45:30.709 --> 00:45:32.349
the defense is going to go absolutely
and the goal is usually here to survive

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359
and the goal is usually here to survive
 

00:45:32.359 --> 00:45:33.849
and the goal is usually here to survive
for a period of time usually you're

00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:33.859
for a period of time usually you're
 

00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:35.409
for a period of time usually you're
waiting for reinforcements or something

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:35.419
waiting for reinforcements or something
 

00:45:35.419 --> 00:45:38.919
waiting for reinforcements or something
like that and and so you may not

00:45:38.919 --> 00:45:38.929
like that and and so you may not
 

00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:40.629
like that and and so you may not
necessarily defeat these enemies and

00:45:40.629 --> 00:45:40.639
necessarily defeat these enemies and
 

00:45:40.639 --> 00:45:42.159
necessarily defeat these enemies and
your main space station also has a

00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:42.169
your main space station also has a
 

00:45:42.169 --> 00:45:43.929
your main space station also has a
certain amount of health so it's it's

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:43.939
certain amount of health so it's it's
 

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:45.609
certain amount of health so it's it's
it's not it's holding off you know

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:45.619
it's not it's holding off you know
 

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:47.649
it's not it's holding off you know
various things for a long enough period

00:45:47.649 --> 00:45:47.659
various things for a long enough period
 

00:45:47.659 --> 00:45:49.689
various things for a long enough period
of time let's build one more of these

00:45:49.689 --> 00:45:49.699
of time let's build one more of these
 

00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:52.329
of time let's build one more of these
guys I'm it's it's sending an enormous

00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:52.339
guys I'm it's it's sending an enormous
 

00:45:52.339 --> 00:45:55.169
guys I'm it's it's sending an enormous
quantity of enemies at me right now so

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:55.179
quantity of enemies at me right now so
 

00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:57.879
quantity of enemies at me right now so
but yeah I think you know it terms of

00:45:57.879 --> 00:45:57.889
but yeah I think you know it terms of
 

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:00.399
but yeah I think you know it terms of
smoothness it's a pretty smooth game the

00:46:00.399 --> 00:46:00.409
smoothness it's a pretty smooth game the
 

00:46:00.409 --> 00:46:02.499
smoothness it's a pretty smooth game the
graphics are pretty good I think they

00:46:02.499 --> 00:46:02.509
graphics are pretty good I think they
 

00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:04.539
graphics are pretty good I think they
could be a little bit higher resolution

00:46:04.539 --> 00:46:04.549
could be a little bit higher resolution
 

00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:06.639
could be a little bit higher resolution
and even HD it always bums me out a

00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:06.649
and even HD it always bums me out a
 

00:46:06.649 --> 00:46:08.949
and even HD it always bums me out a
little bit when games allow you to zoom

00:46:08.949 --> 00:46:08.959
little bit when games allow you to zoom
 

00:46:08.959 --> 00:46:11.199
little bit when games allow you to zoom
in maybe one or two steps further than

00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:11.209
in maybe one or two steps further than
 

00:46:11.209 --> 00:46:13.509
in maybe one or two steps further than
they should yeah essentially you know as

00:46:13.509 --> 00:46:13.519
they should yeah essentially you know as
 

00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:17.109
they should yeah essentially you know as
soon as a pixel in your art covers more

00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119
soon as a pixel in your art covers more
 

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.999
soon as a pixel in your art covers more
than a pixel on the screen that's

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:19.009
than a pixel on the screen that's
 

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.739
than a pixel on the screen that's
probably where you ought to stop yeah I

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:20.749
probably where you ought to stop yeah I
 

00:46:20.749 --> 00:46:22.059

know again this is a game that could

00:50:06.289 --> 00:50:06.299
know again this is a game that could
 

00:50:06.299 --> 00:50:09.829
know again this is a game that could
have been done as a 2-d game but doing

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839
have been done as a 2-d game but doing
 

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:13.309
have been done as a 2-d game but doing
it in three just allows okay obviously I

00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319
it in three just allows okay obviously I
 

00:50:13.319 --> 00:50:15.199
it in three just allows okay obviously I
just I would I just start from

00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:15.209
just I would I just start from
 

00:50:15.209 --> 00:50:18.199
just I would I just start from
checkpoint yes doing it in 3d just

00:50:18.199 --> 00:50:18.209
checkpoint yes doing it in 3d just
 

00:50:18.209 --> 00:50:20.269
checkpoint yes doing it in 3d just
allows for that much more awesomeness

00:50:20.269 --> 00:50:20.279
allows for that much more awesomeness
 

00:50:20.279 --> 00:50:22.519
allows for that much more awesomeness
and in this case you can you can see all

and in this case you can you can see all
 

00:50:22.529 --> 00:50:24.739
and in this case you can you can see all
these details are enabled through 3d so

00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:24.749
these details are enabled through 3d so
 

00:50:24.749 --> 00:50:26.120
these details are enabled through 3d so
you could drop the repair like down

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.130
you could drop the repair like down
 

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:29.959
