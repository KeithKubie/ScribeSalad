00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
 . 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.470
 I think we have reviewed the quadratic formula well 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.550
 But if you do not remember her yet, let me 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.760
 Write it down again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.770
 Let's assume that we have a quadratic equation 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.180
 In the form of ax ^ 2 + bx + c = 0 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.670
 Quadratic formula, which we have shown in the last presentation 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.010
 The solution to this equation is x = 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.390
 -b + or - square root of b ^ 2 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 - 4ac, all divided by 2a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.080
 Now in this view, instead of giving you a set of 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.770
 Examples of compensation in a, b, and c 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.240
 I want to talk about this part of 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.110
 Quadratic formula, this part is there 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.390
 Ie b ^ 2-4ac 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.150
 We have seen it in a range of issues that we have resolved 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 As examples, as it is considered determinants 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 Of the form in which the solution appears 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.610
 For example, if b ^ 2 - 4ac is greater than 0 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.950
 We'll get two solutions, will not we? 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 The square root of a positive number is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.600
 Non-zero, the image will be positive and negative 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.190
 Of it - we will always get b / 2a or 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.540
 -b / 2a - then you will get -b + 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560
 Positive square root, and -b- 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.330
 The square root is positive, all divided by 2a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.970
 If the differentiation is greater than 0, therefore 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.670
 We will have two solutions 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.350
 I now use the word, a differentiation 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.170
 All this goes back to this part of 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.596
 Quadratic formula 

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:56.980
 This - let me do this in another color - this 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.040
 Is the differentiation of the quadratic equation 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.290
 Here 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.556
 Differentiation 

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.030
 And you have to remember, it's the part that falls under 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 The root symbol of the quadratic formula 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.960
 That's why we care about it, because if it's bigger 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.120
 From 0, we get a positive square root, and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 We get his positive and negative image, will 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860
 You get two solutions 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.820
 Now, what happens if b ^ 2 - 4ac = 0? 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.930
 If this equals 0 - if you take b ^ 2 - 4, × 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.170
 a × c, this equals 0 - this tells us that this 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.040
 The portion of the quadratic formula will be 0, and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.970
 The square root of 0 is 0 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
 Then the only solution would be x 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.970
 = -b / 2a 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.480
 Or another way is that 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.090
 You have only one solution 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.530
 If the differentiation is 0 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.756
 You only have one solution 

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:01.300
 You have only one solution 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.320
 So the solution would be the head, or 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.510
 X coordinate for the head, because it will get 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.860
 A parabola touches the x-axis so, just touches it 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.640
 Here, or so touching him, touches him in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.490
 One point, when b ^ 2 - 4ac = 0 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.130
 Hence the latter case is if b ^ 2-4ac 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.380
 Less than 0 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.370
 b ^ 2 - 4ac less than 0 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.880
 Then here, you will get a negative number under 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.870
 Root 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.770
 We have seen an example of this in the last presentation 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.570
 If we are dealing with real numbers, we can not take 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.960
 A square root for a negative number, that is to say 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.310
 There are no real solutions 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.990
 In the future, we will see that we will get complex solutions 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.300
 But if we are dealing with real numbers 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.110
 We will not have a real solution 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.340
 Because this is illogical 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.760
 The square root of a negative number, at least this is not 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.830
 Logical for real numbers 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.030
 Then there's a lot to think about 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.340
 If we have positive differentiation, ie if b ^ 2 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.350
 - 4ac positive, we can think about whether 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.460
 Solutions are relative or not 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.160
 If this is 2, then we will get a squared root for 2 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.120
 In the answer, the answer will be non-relative, or 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.079
 The answers will be relatively irrelevant 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.590
 If b ^ 2 - 4ac = 16, we know that this square is full 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.010
 We take the square root of the whole square 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.950
 We get a relative answer 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.570
 However, with all this, let's solve some examples 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.500
 Because I think that's what it will all make 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.700
 These ideas are concrete 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.510
 Suppose I have the equation xx ^ 2 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.670
 + 3x - 6 = 0 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.830
 All I want to do is to know a little 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 The type of solutions you own 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.630
 I do not want to find the value of x 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.430
 If I encounter such a situation, I can only see it 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.100
 Differentiation 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.320
 I can see b ^ 2-4ac 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:06.620
 What is the difference here? b ^ 2 = 9-4 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.140
 × a -i -1-- × c, ie -6 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.870
 How much is this? 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.220
 This negative sign and negative sign are deleted, however 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.420
 We still have that negative signal there, if it equals 9 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.450
 - 4, x 6 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.640
 This is equal to 9 - 24, ie less than 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.190
 If we get a smaller number of 0 under 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.070
 Root 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.970
 If we do not get a real solution 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.210
 This is intended 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.970
 So this chart will be going down, because 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.940
 He has a negative signal there, so it seems 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.520
 So 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.870
 If this axis is x, the graph will be curved down 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.270
 His head will be down the x-axis and open down, so 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.080
 It will never intersect with the X axis 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.680
 We have no real solutions 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.660
 Let us solve another example 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.425
 Let's say I have - I'll solve it with pink - let's say 

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:07.280
 I have the equation, 5x ^ 2 = 6x 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.530
 Well, let's put it in the picture we used to 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.550
 So let's subtract 6x from both ends, and get 5x ^ 2 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.860
 - 6x = 0 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.560
 Let's count the differentiation 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.320
 Want to get b ^ 2 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.730
 b ^ 2 = -6 ^ 2 - 4 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.070
 × a × c 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.380
 Well, where is c here? 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.240
 There is no c here 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.580
 There is + 0 and I have not written it here 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.780
 No c 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.470
 In this case, c = 0 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.670
 There is no c in this equation 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.500
 If x 0 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.930
 So delete all of it 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.990
 6 ^ 2 = positive 36 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.800
 The differentiation is positive 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.300
 We have a value of 36 under the root code here, if 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.110
 It is not only positive, but also a whole square 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.250
 This shows that I will get two solutions 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.390
 I will get two real solutions 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.610
 They will not only be real, but I also know 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.100
 They will be relative, because I have 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.160
 Square root of 36 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.270
 The square root for 36 is + or - 6 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.680
 I will not end up with a disproportionate number here 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.055
 Two real solutions are also relative 

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:22.540
 They are also relative 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.160
 This is the case we have here 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.440
 You can also get a non-relative solution here 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.160
 and this is 

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.080
 + Non-proportional solution 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.530
 Let us solve it further, so that we can understand the idea 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:41.160
 Let's assume that I have 41x ^ 2 - 31x 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.820
 - 52 = 0 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.420
 Again, I want to think about the type 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.240
 The solution I will probably deal with 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.330
 b ^ 2 - 4ac 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.540
 b ^ 2 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:01.350
 -31 ^ 2 - 4, × a, × x 41, × 

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.560
 c - x x - 52 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.480
 What do I have here? 

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.260
 This is equal to 31 ^ 2 positive 

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.690
 Negative × negative 

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.510
 = Positive 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.920
 I'll get a positive, will not I? 

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.050
 This is equivalent to 31 ^ 2, + - this 

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.220
 Positive number here, I mean, we can calculate it 

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.290
 But it is 4 × 41 × 52 

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.240
 All I will care for is positive differentiation 

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.550
 It's bigger than 0, so that means that 

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.980
 I have two real solutions 

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.039
 We can think about whether this will be 

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:35.700
 A complete plague 

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.850
 I do not know 

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.990
 I will not do this here 

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.909
 Because it will require a large account space 

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.780
 We know that they are real, and we do not know if they are relative solutions 

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.810
 Or non-relative 

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.180
 Let us solve another example 

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:58.370
 Let's assume that I have x ^ 2 - 8x 

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.050
 + 1 = 0 

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.620
 Again, let's look at the differentiation 

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.460
 b ^ 2, so-8 ^ 2 - 4, × a 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.350
 Ie 1, x c, ie 16 

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.300
 This equals 64 - 64, equal to 0 

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:27.070
 If we have only one solution, according to the definition will 

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.000
 Be relatively 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.600
 I mean, we can look at him here 

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.360
 He (x - 4) (x - 4) = 0 

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.615
 The only solution is x = 4 

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:43.610
 And when I say according to the definition of the square formula 

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.390
 Look here, if this is 0, all that will remain is 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.230
 -b / 2a, which is no doubt will be 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.110
 Relative, assuming you have a, b, and c, of course 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.480
 Are relative numbers 

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.410
 Anyway, I hope you found this useful 

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.550
 It's a quick way 

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.470
 It does not require you to find a solution 

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.080
 But you just have to say what types of solutions or how much 

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.910
 Number of solutions, how many real solutions, or predict whether 

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.120
 Are real or relative solutions 

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.320
 Differentiation can be a useful shortcut 

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.640
 Well I think it made you appreciate the importance of parts 

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.590
 The quadratic formula is better 

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.866
 .
