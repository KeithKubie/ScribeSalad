00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.323
Think about being in a room at night with a lamp on your desk. You drop your

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:06.550
pencil under the desk. The only reason you can see the pencil is that light

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.516
from your desk lamp bounces off the walls, ceilings, and other surfaces. Some

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:14.093
of this light makes it to beneath your desk and then gets to your eye. One

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:16.676
reason we don't use lights that drop off at the square of the distance is that

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:19.300
light doesn't bounce around in our scenes, but only effects what it directly

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.759
hits. Since there's no light bouncing around it dies off very quickly within

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.382
our simplified system. We compensate for this lack of reflected light, called

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:32.975
indirect illumination, by adding a fudge factor called ambient lighting. In 3JS

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:36.730
we set this light by giving it a color. The light color is multiplied by the

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.767
material's ambient color to give a solid amount of fill color. Remember that

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:45.180
the ambient color on the material is actually a separate color in 3JS. If you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.742
don't set it, the color is white and the ambient light will simply add some

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:51.836
grey to the object as a whole. Grey's okay but it's better if you set the

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:55.520
ambient color to match the diffuse color. You can then use the ambient light's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.519
intensity to change the feel of the scene as a whole.
