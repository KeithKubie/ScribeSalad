00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.540
So, let's look at these three characteristics one by

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.660
one. Scalability for software architecture is its ability to handle

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.320
the growth of the software system. For example, for a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.610
web based system, scalability could be the ability to handle

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.620
a larger workload by adding new servers to the system.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.508
Scalability is therefore an important characteristic of a software architecture,

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.938
especially for the kinds of systems that can grow over

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.990
time. So, we're going to mark it as an ideal characteristic.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.901
Cohesion is a measure of how strongly related are

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.920
the elements of a module. Clearly, we should shoot

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.760
for high and not low cohesion when developing a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.100
system. We want to develop modules whose elements cooperate to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.480
provide the specific piece of functionality rather than modules

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.410
consisting of a bunch of elements that provide different

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.040
unrelated pieces of functionality. Therefor, low cohesion is definitely

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.980
not something that we want. We want high cohesion instead.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.040
As for coupling, coupling is a concept related to cohesion

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.070
and is also a measure. In this case though, it

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.130
is a measure of how strongly related are the different

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.830
modules in a system. Low coupling, which is often correlated with

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.570
high cohesion, is an important and ideal characteristic of a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.660
software architecture as it indicates that the different modules in

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.220
the system are independent from one another. Each module provides

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.300
a specific piece of functionality and it can provide it without

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.530
relying too much on other modules.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.960
Basically, systems characterized by low coupling

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.330
and high cohesion, are systems that are easier to understand, and to maintain.
