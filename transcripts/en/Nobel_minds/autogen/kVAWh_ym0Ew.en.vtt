the phosphorus phosphorus alkenes and
 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.940
the phosphorus phosphorus alkenes and
showed how phosphor alkynes could be

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
showed how phosphor alkynes could be
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.969
showed how phosphor alkynes could be
made and we did that to using

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
made and we did that to using
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770
made and we did that to using
spectroscopic technique so a lot of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

of the 20th century we discovered the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
of the 20th century we discovered the
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.350
of the 20th century we discovered the
third form of carbon a molecule been

around all since time immemorial so that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
around all since time immemorial so that
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.100
around all since time immemorial so that
was very satisfying of course then maybe

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
was very satisfying of course then maybe
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.760
was very satisfying of course then maybe
it would win the Nobel Prize that was

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
it would win the Nobel Prize that was
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040
it would win the Nobel Prize that was
seemed a possibility and of course it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
seemed a possibility and of course it's
 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.330
seemed a possibility and of course it's
it's this very nice to win that award

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
it's this very nice to win that award
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.020
it's this very nice to win that award
and that is satisfying to it's a bit odd

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
and that is satisfying to it's a bit odd
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.200
and that is satisfying to it's a bit odd
because I didn't go into science to win

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210
because I didn't go into science to win
 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.470
because I didn't go into science to win
any prizes it was for me a job and my

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
any prizes it was for me a job and my

and design so in a sense I would like to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
and design so in a sense I would like to
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.010
and design so in a sense I would like to
do more of that but the Nobel Prize has

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
do more of that but the Nobel Prize has
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.080
do more of that but the Nobel Prize has
launched you in me into other areas

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
launched you in me into other areas
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.130

where spending time I'll sue these
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.620
where spending time I'll sue these
questions and I do a lot of that and I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
questions and I do a lot of that and I
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.320
questions and I do a lot of that and I
get questions from people or every day

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330
get questions from people or every day
 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.530
get questions from people or every day
and from young people which I respond to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
and from young people which I respond to
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.380
and from young people which I respond to
from one or two people who and I do

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
from one or two people who and I do
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.510
from one or two people who and I do
respond to and sometimes get a bit

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
respond to and sometimes get a bit
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.260
respond to and sometimes get a bit
irritable because they ask make somewhat

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270
irritable because they ask make somewhat
 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.500
irritable because they ask make somewhat
silly comments but maybe I shouldn't

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
silly comments but maybe I shouldn't
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.530
silly comments but maybe I shouldn't
answer them but I think if I do have

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540
answer them but I think if I do have
 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.510
answer them but I think if I do have
something I wanted ambition it i would

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
something I wanted ambition it i would
