00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.970
RICK: When I was younger guy, I
couldn't stand ro see a

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.400
a car go to the junkyard.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.530
You know, I would rescue it--

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.770
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.770
RICK: --and put it away
somewhere, so someday, maybe

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.370
that I could do
something with it.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.730
MIKE WOLFE: Stash it.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.870
FRANK FRITZ: This guy has saved
everything from concept cars

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.130
to hot rods.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.270
I mean, he has an
amazing collection.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.370
RICK: I got something in
here I think you'd like.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.130
It's something from the '30s.
MIKE WOLFE: OK.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.970
RICK: It's a-- it's
an old carnival ride.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.900
We've got to move
a lot of stuff.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200
It's like a '36 Packard.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.370
It's way back in that
corner, in there.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.100
MIKE WOLFE: All righty.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.930
So I crawl over a pile.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.270
[grunting] And I look down.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.970
And I can just see the fender.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.630
I mean, this thing is buried.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.330
[interposing voices]

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.230
I see-- I can see the--

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.330
RICK: Way back in there.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.570
MIKE WOLFE: I can see
the steering wheel.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.800
RICK: Yeah, way back in there.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah,
that is way back.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
For what I can see,
this thing is sexy.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.370
So it's a carnival piece.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.670
This doesn't have any
pedal drive train in it.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.500
A lot of these older
pedal cars are longer.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.470
They're wider.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.570
They're heavier.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.330
They're overbuilt. And
a lot of these cars

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.030
ended up as carnival rides.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.930
That's not unusual.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.370
I mean, for me to
even mess around

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.330
with trying to get
this thing out,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.530
I mean, what are
you thinking on it?

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.670
I'm looking $500 out of it.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
It's got be worth that.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.770
That'd be a neat piece.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.070
MIKE WOLFE: 500 sounds
like it's doable.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.570
So I start going for it,
start digging this thing out.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
There's all this, like,
exercise equipment on top of it.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170
[sighing] All right.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.100
You getting it?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.830
MIKE WOLFE: So as soon
as I get it chest height,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.500
I want to twist and
maneuver it over to Frank

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.870
and let him take some of
the weight of this thing.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.270
[chuckling] Let me turn it over.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.200
You're working, dude.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.500
And I'm not complaining, man.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.100
I mean, this is what
it's all about--

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.230
finding something
like this, pulling

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.200
it out, working hard for it,
and then reaping the benefits.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.430
All right, let's see
what's going on here.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800
FRANK FRITZ: Grill's
pretty good shape.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.230
MIKE WOLFE: From the front
grille to the back end

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.900
of the car, it's streamlined.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.030
It's airflow.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.330
It's beautiful.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.530
FRANK FRITZ: Looks like you
need, like, a little piece

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.470
to hold it up, there.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.630
MIKE WOLFE: It
shows its history.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.900
It shows its age.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.700
But it also shows this
thing was a carnival ride.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.700
You know, it's got a heavy pan
welded to the bottom of it.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.500
The drive-train is gone.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.930
It's beat to hell.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.100
It's still cool.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.300
Where did you find it?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.800
RICK: I got it in a
garage in Detroit.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.430
I think the wheels
turned on it, too.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.500
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah.
RICK: I think they do.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.530
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah, they turned.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.830
They got a swivel on them.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.230
Whoa.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.630
[laughter]

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.670
RICK: Well, you could just
back it in the garage,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.530
that way you wouldn't see it.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
It's cool, man.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.430
The more you look at it,
the more character it's got.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.370
I mean, look at the
weld back here, man.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.170
It's really cool.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.570
[banging metal]

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.770
There you go.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.600
RICK: You just-- you just
raised the price on it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.430
FRANK FRITZ: He's just like
you, Rick, doing body work.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.630
There, look at that.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.030
Looks pretty good.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.730
MIKE WOLFE: That's better
than it was, right?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.300
The gauge of the metal is really
made to stand the test of time.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.570
I mean, who knows?

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.470
Maybe it was made from the
steel the actual car was.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.670
That's what it feels like.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.300
RICK: What do you think?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.730
500.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.470
Let's do it.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.670
We're doing it.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.000
That'll give us some room
on the back end of it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.130
I think it's cool, man.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.270
It's definitely from
the right time period.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.530
It's got the look.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.500
A lot of these older
pedal cars, when

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.900
you see them on the ground, they
don't look like a child's toy.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.530
They look like a miniature
of the car itself.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.630
It's rough, but it's so cool.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.100
We put a little
bit of a scratch--

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.130
On your collection.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.470
--in the situation, but--

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.400
That's OK.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.330
--you know,
that's how it goes.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.270
- That's OK.
- You got the back?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.970
Let me straighten
the wheels out.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.270
Yeah, I got the back.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.030
MIKE WOLFE: Frank and I have
come across a lot of cars,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.870
but not cars like we saw today.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.270
Rick saw the importance,
the significance

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.730
of these bubble top cars.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.300
He was a visionary,
and he saw all of that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.930
before anyone else did.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.370
So cool.
We did it.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.530
FRANK FRITZ: Rick, those are
some amazing cars you got.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.470
I wish I had the
crystal ball you had.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.370
- Yeah?
- That stuff is awesome.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.430
RICK: I'd love to
have the guys back.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.600
I enjoyed the day with them.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.800
Been a lot of fun.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.900
You ever bust it out
and show it, let us know.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.830
We might be in the area.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.970
Come take a look at it.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.470
We come by and
may take a cruise.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.230
- OK, I will--
- No doubt.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.530
Hey, I will do.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.470
I have plenty of projects.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.370
I just finished my last car that
I was building for a customer.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.370
And now, it's time
for me to take

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.230
and do something for myself.
[honking]

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.300
Roll on, Rick!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.430
Yeah, catch you later!

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.330
See you later!

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.970
[honking]
