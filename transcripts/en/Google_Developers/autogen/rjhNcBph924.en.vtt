 Hello everyone, everything good

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.880
 fleece for bruno 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.699
 the phantom of the opera and our dani 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 designer then power up is a service 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 that the academies can offer their 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.199
 students to better motivate them and keep 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 their attention in the gym is a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 very difficult for academies to believe 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.590
 nowadays face what it is to keep 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.020
 students engaged and motivated within 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.110
 from that space then power the clamp to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.930
 exactly close everything cute 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 What we do is a service that the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 teachers can create 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680
 students directly at Claudia and the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.719
 students through their cell phones 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.129
 use of service directly in the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 gym equipment 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 it's like he's arriving with a cell phone and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.210
 without the appliance. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.339
 bringing within it is of that package 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.710
 all 1 of all the elements of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.070
 identification necessary to motivate 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.439
 the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.509
 that is we have challenges book borges is 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.810
 actively and many other elements that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.250
 help this student to maintain 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.130
 motivated full time 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.400
 imagine that the student arrives at the academy and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.000
 drug in an exercise such as leg press 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.100
 he will be challenged to show that the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.049
 His friend is picking up a little bit bigger 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 and he will, I'll try finally 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.270
 Next week, next week, keep coming. 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 Who only thinks he went all these days? 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 but in the following month he earns 50 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 discount 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 this is the poet but at the same time the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 academies has an entire system of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.320
 statistics on the use of that space 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 for me to make better decisions and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.100
 many other systems to help them 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.870
 to organize your space better take the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.360
 better decisions 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 keep their students always engaged and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 You can only wait.
