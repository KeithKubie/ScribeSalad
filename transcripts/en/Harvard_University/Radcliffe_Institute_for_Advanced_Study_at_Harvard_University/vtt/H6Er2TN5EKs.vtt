00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:04.311
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:07.670
- Hi.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.180
Welcome everybody to our
second installation of Next

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.500
In Science.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.760
The idea here is
to bring together

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.390
early career scientists
who are working

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
in somewhat allied, but not
too closely allied fields,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.080
to present their work.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.820
The idea being that a lot of
times the most exciting science

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.350
is being done by early
career scientists, who

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.740
are in a sense-- I wouldn't
say putting their chips

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.790
on the roulette wheel, but
finding interesting new fields

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.960
that look like they're
going to be promising.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.020
And so as a result,
you get treated

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.010
to things that are
more interdisciplinary,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.520
and you can expect them
to grow in the future.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.700
So it's very much a frontier
set of talks that we have today.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.990
My name's John Huth, and
I'm a Physics professor

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.510
in the university here, and I'm
also a Venture Faculty member

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.370
with the Radcliffe
Institute-- which means

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.580
that I get to do programming.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.670
I'm hosting a science
symposium on October 28th,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.190
which some of you may be
interested in attending.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.760
It's on oceans--
we're going to talk

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.460
about life in the very early
oceans here on the planet,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.950
then talk about the
role of the ocean

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.320
in driving climate and the
feedbacks between climate

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.200
and the ocean, and then
finally, marine life

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.700
in the ocean with a particular
emphasis on and New England.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.080
Prior to that, on
October 24th, we

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.560
have a talk by Kerry Emanuel who
is a climate researcher at MIT.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.060
And his particular
field of interest

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.900
is extreme climate events,
in particular, driven

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.730
by rising sea temperatures.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.760
And he is the author
of a paper describing

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.270
the emergence of something
called a hypercane, which is

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.690
a super hurricane that forms.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.320
So the idea of being
with rising sea

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.760
surface temperatures, we'll
have fewer hurricanes,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.490
but the ones we do are
more severe, as a result.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.150
So you may want to
tune in for that.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.930
All of these are
open to the public.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.240
So today's Next
In Science, we're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.510
bringing together
four scientists

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.730
who are going to talk about
their work broadly based

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.390
in astrophysics and astronomy.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.980
And I've chosen speakers
in part because they

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.930
will talk about astrophysics and
astronomy on different scales.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.470
And so we're going to start
with the largest scale--

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.290
the universe as
a whole, and work

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
our way into smaller territory.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.330
I always bring a little bit
of my own interests into this.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.750
I'm interested in
astrophysics, because I'm

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.610
a particle physicist I do work
at CERN at the Large Hadron

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.770
Collider.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.540
And one of the
intersections there

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.510
is, we're looking for forms
of matter that might explain

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.200
the structure of the
universe, and in particular,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.690
some of the work
that Cora is doing

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.670
informs us on what kind of
particles may be out there.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.240
So that's one reason
that I'm interested,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.740
but I have a more immediate and
somewhat parochial interest.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.550
I'm teaching a freshman
seminar and we're

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.620
talking about early
models of the universe

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.440
and then we'll get
into modern cosmology

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.240
at the end of the seminar.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.640
And one of the things that
we're reading in two weeks

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.260
is the Divine Comedy
by Dante Alighieri.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.530
And one thing that struck
me in the Divine Comedy

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.100
was that hell is a lot more
interesting than paradise.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.501
If you read it, you know
there's all these details

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.250
and you can really get
your teeth into it,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.720
but then you get paradise and
it's all this ethereal kind

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.366
of floaty stuff
that says, oh you

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:37.740
can't understand it because
there are mysteries out here,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.300
and you know about 25
cantos of mysteries

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.840
that you can't understand.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.570
It's a little tedious, right?

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.650
So I thought about it a bit.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.450
And wondered, why was this?

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.540
Why was this?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.480
And when we had
this panel together,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.770
I suddenly realized
that in Dante's era,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.100
he knew a lot about geography.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.670
He walks all around Tuscany
and sees all the waterfalls

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.980
and all sorts of things, but
the knowledge of paradise

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.850
is very limited.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.840
You just have this
Aristotelian model

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.790
and these ideas which are
kind of vague and ill-formed.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.230
But seven centuries later, we
have these amazing instruments

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.760
that allow us to give us
windows deep into the universe

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.860
and back in time.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.332
And you can put flesh
on the bones now.

00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:23.040
I mean, you can imagine
a trip to Jupiter

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.810
or you can imagine
a trip to Mars

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.860
or you can imagine what it's
like in the very early universe

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.440
and even the sound of the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.310
So you could almost imagine
that if Dante was born now,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.540
and he went to write
the Divine Comedy,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.470
Paradiso would be this
amazingly-detailed

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.880
and would be every bit
as good as the inferno.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.070
So this is one of
the lessons that I

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.330
hope to impart to my
freshman in my seminar.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.690
So having said that, let me
introduce our first speaker

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.002
Cora Dvorkin.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.460
She is-- let's see
if I can do this

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.570
without looking at my notes--
she is from Argentina.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.570
She got her doctorate at the
University of Chicago in 2011.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.700
And she recently joined the
faculty in the Harvard Physics

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.880
Department last year.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.980
Prior to that, she
was a Hubble Fellow

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.480
in the Institute for
Theory and Computation

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.450
at the Center for Astrophysics.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.476
Did I get it?

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:19.368
- Yes.

00:05:19.368 --> 00:05:20.260
- Great.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.664
So Cora's work is in the
universe, the structure

00:05:23.664 --> 00:05:25.080
of the universe,
at large, drawing

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.730
on a number of different
data sets and windows.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.940
And it's proving to be
a remarkable picture

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.120
we're able to understand a lot
of details of the structure

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.090
and how this reflects on the
matter content of the universe.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.190
So without further ado,
let me introduce-- well,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.280
I am introducing her.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.710
Oh, she's also the Shutzer
Assistant Professor

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.440
at Radcliffe.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.460
Sorry about that.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.790
And the title over talk is
Deciphering the Early Universe,

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.860
Connecting Theory
with Observations.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.550
Let me also tell you that
talks are back-to-back--

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.877
Cora and then Salvatore And
then at the end of those

00:06:01.877 --> 00:06:03.710
to two talks, we'll
take questions up front.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.735
So keep your questions.

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:08.094
Write them down, hold them,
and then we'll take them

00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:09.260
and then we'll have a break.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.137
OK?

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:15.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.000
- Thank you very much
for the introduction

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.920
and thank you very much
for the invitation.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.110
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.040
So today, As John
said, I will try

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.150
to make heaven more interesting.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.560
I completely agree with your
opinion of the Divine Comedy.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.900
So hopefully we can
make it all better.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.340
So I will talk about deciphering
the early universe-- connecting

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.600
theory with observations.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.610
So for this talk I chose
one sort of direction

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.660
in which my research has
been going, which is,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.870
trying to understand
the physics that

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.790
seeded the first structures
in the universe-- trying

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.000
to understand what gave
rise to the structures

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.570
that we can observe today.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.220
And for this, I will be
talking today about how

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.230
we can probe the physics
of the very early universe

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.840
by using observations
of something

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.800
known as the cosmic
microwave background.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.860
And I will go in detail
into what this is,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.420
and the large scale
structure of the universe.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:28.770
So let me start by
showing this picture here.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.360
This picture here represents a
very thin-- this line of time

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.830
represent 13.8 billion
years of the universe.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.520
So the universe began as
a hot, condensed plasma

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.940
of particles in
thermal equilibrium

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.970
at very high energies.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.960
The universe expanded and cooled
and many physical processes

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.510
happened along the way.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.110
Some physical processes
we know very well.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.680
Some of them we
don't know what's

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.450
the physics that gave rise to
this process and some of us

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.470
are interested in trying to
shed light on these physics.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.650
So interesting processes
that happened along the way

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:19.206
are recombination-- about 0.4
mega years after the Big Bang.

00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:23.470
Protons and electrons combine
into hydrogen. These periods

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.670
known as recombination.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.350
And since then, the universe
became mainly transparent

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.940
to cosmic micro
background or CMB photons.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:39.610
So since then, photons--
mainly freestream toward us,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.860
until the time in which the
radiation from the first stars

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.630
and quasars reionizes the
universe-- about 500 megayears

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.020
after the Big Bang.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.940
And about 6% these
photons we scatter-- 6%

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.900
comes from the latest data
set coming from the Planck

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.650
satellite.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.530
OK?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.030
So mainly they
freestream toward us,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.460
until this period in which a
very small fraction of them

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.840
rescattered.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.790
And so today, we
observe these photons

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.630
at microwave frequencies, and
at a temperature of about 2.7

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.570
Kelvin.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.140
So I thought they would
give to the general audience

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.660
a little history, just
this slide of history

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.850
of how the cosmic microwave
background was actually found.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:37.830
So in 1964, two astronomers--
Arnold Penzias Bob Wilson--

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.410
they were radio
astronomers looking

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.496
for sources of radio
waves, and they

00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:51.620
were looking at radio waves with
their antenna in New Jersey.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.050
And they were finding an
excess isotropic noise

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.340
in this antenna built at Bell
Labs if this story they meet

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.530
says actually this
is true because I've

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.340
heard Bob Wilson telling the
same story that they even

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.390
thought he was dropping from
germs in their telescope

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.690
Klein the telescope that
cleaned the telescope

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.700
and the excess noise
would not go away.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.660
At the same time, in parallel,
Peebles, who was here yesterday

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.844
giving historical lecture at
the CFA, Jim Peebles, Dicke,

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:33.180
Wilkinson, the and
Roll, they were

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.620
doing theoretical
calculations and they

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.920
predicted that there should be
a signal of about 3 Kelvin being

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.000
coming from the Big Bang.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.140
There were two
disconnected groups.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.870
One of them had no idea
about the CMB expectations.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:57.260
And an astrophysicist
from MIT, Burke,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.890
talked to Penzias and Wilson.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.530
Penzias and Wilson
repeatedly were

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.640
trying to find
people to tell them

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.670
about their source of noise
that couldn't go away.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.100
They talked to him.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.180
They talked to Burke.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.600
Burke told them about their
work from Peebles, et al.,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.860
and they told them that
they were very likely

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.160
finding something very
big-- something that

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.960
was very sought for.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.830
And so the story ended
with them announcing

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.426
the discovery of the cosmic
microwave background.

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:38.070
And years later, they won
the Nobel Prize for this.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.500
So this is a neat story
of a discovery that

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.670
came accidentally,
in some sense,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.990
because they were not
looking exactly for it OK,

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:59.640
so in 1992, fluctuations around
the temperature of the CMB

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.740
were found.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.890
So in 1992, a satellite known
as COBE, the Cosmic Background

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.820
Explorer, found
that the CMB mainly

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.780
follows a blackbody
distribution,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.570
with a temperature of about
2.7 Kelvin and fluctuations

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.110
around these temperature
of 1 part in 10 to the 5.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.880
And this is a map of how
COBE sees these temperature

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.130
fluctuations.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.260
This part over
here is the galaxy

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.480
that has to be masked because
it's so bright that if we don't

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.900
mask it, we would not be
able to see these temperature

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.080
fluctuations.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.320
And because of this
discovery, this team

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.220
also won the Nobel Prize.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.810
OK, so this is a
more current picture

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.560
coming from data taken
by the Planck satellite.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.580
The Planck satellite
was launched in 2009.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.680
It took data until
very recently.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.500
Papers are still coming out
from the analysis of these data.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.180
This is a snapshot of
the very early universe.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.470
And in this talk, I will
explain why I make this claim.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.830
So what is observed here is that
temperature fluctuations have

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.230
different positions in the sky.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.150
And the idea is
that by measuring

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.980
the statistical properties of
these temperature fluctuations

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.600
we can infer the physics
from the very early universe.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.390
These temperature
fluctuations have

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.070
been measured to have a
[INAUDIBLE] temperature

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.020
of about 100 microKelvin
and their distribution

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.690
is Gaussian at first order.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:41.500
So the CMB power spectrum,
these temperature fluctuations,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.400
when I say power spectrum,
I mean the square amplitude

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.350
of these temperature
fluctuations.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.470
The CMB power spectrum has
been predicted, as I already

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.800
told you, and measured
with great precision

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.140
over the last few decades.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.900
And I'm showing you hear a
plot of the temperature power

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.520
spectrum of the
CMB as a function

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.380
of angular scale in the sky.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.450
So scales here correspond
to smaller angular scales

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.430
and scales here correspond
to larger angular scales.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.130
OK?

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.000
In red, I'm showing you
the data that has been

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.330
taken by the Planck satellite.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.060
Notice the arrow bars
in these data sets.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.060
This is a really
remarkable measurement.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.110
In green and shining is the
best fit model for these data.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.540
This best fit model
works very well.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.080
I will be talking about,
in the next slides,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.430
about the standard model that
we have in cosmology today.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.900
And this structure of
these acoustic peaks

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.590
carry a lot of physics inside.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.580
The structure of
these acoustic peaks

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.130
carry the information
of acoustic oscillations

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.090
in the photon-baryon plasma
at the time of recombination.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.590
OK?

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.360
So the photons were strongly
scattering with the electrons,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.620
via Thomson scattering.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.340
The electrons were
interacting with the protons,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.850
via Coulomb scattering.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.090
And all of this was
going together--

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.310
baryons were trying to fall
into gravitational potentials,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.070
coming from the dark matter.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.610
And they were going out due to
the pressure of the photons.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.290
So they were oscillating
inside and outside

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.890
this potential wells, and this
is why we see acoustic peaks.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.465
The first peek is the baryons
and the photons going in

00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:40.570
with gravitation potential.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.990
The second peak actually
corresponds to a trough,

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.535
but because I'm
squaring it, it's

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:49.250
seen as a peak-- corresponds
to the photons going out.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.000
And this is what we observe.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200
That's why we see the peaks
in the temperature power

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.750
spectrum of the CMB.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.830
OK so here is where we
stand in cosmology today.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:07.230
We have a standard model of
cosmology known as Lamda-CDM.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.370
We have a homogeneous
background,

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.110
and we measure the parameters
of this background very well.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.290
We know by CMB and large
constructual observations

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.850
that we have approximately
5% of baryonic matter.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.320
When I say baryonic
matter I mean the matter

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.340
that we can observe-- you,
me, the stars the planets,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.410
this building-- the
matter that we are used to

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.600
and that is visible to us.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.020
We have 27% of
color earth matter,

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.840
and it's matter that only
interacts gravitationally

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.770
but it's not visible.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.730
And we have approximately--
we know from observations

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.180
that we have approximately
68% of dark energy, which

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.280
is a source of energy
that we attribute

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.100
to-- that we attribute the
expansion, the accelerated

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.830
expansion of the universe that
is observed in recent times.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.740
On top of this
homogeneous background,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.130
we have perturbations
that are seeded

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.329
in their very early universe.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.849
We measure these perturbations
to be nearly scale-invariant.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:19.950
They almost do not depend on
the scales see considered.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.170
And as I said before, they
are approximately Gaussian.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.970
So we made a lot of
progress in measuring

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.550
all of these parameters
with very high precision.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.700
However, big questions remain.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.980
What is the Lamda of our
Lamda-CDM standard model

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.690
of cosmology?

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.020
What is dark energy?

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.950
We don't know.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.800
What if the CDM of our
Lamda-CDM-- standard model

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.970
of cosmology-- what is this cold
dark matter that is observed?

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:54.050
And what gave rise to the first
structures in the universe?

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:59.710
So I do researching in
these different lines,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.880
but today, I thought, given
that I have 30 minutes,

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.400
I will focus my talk on some
questions we are currently

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.490
trying to answer as
a community related

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.490
to the physics that seeded
the first structures

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.170
in the universe.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.250
So this is what I will
base my talk today

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.290
in this question-- what
is the physics that

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.700
seeded the first
structures in the universe?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:28.670
OK So inflation was a theory
for the very early universe

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.520
proposed by Alan Guth
and others In 1981.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.360
Alan Guth is a professor at MIT.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.530
And this theory, that goes
under the name by inflation,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.570
is the main paradigm
that explains

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.830
the observed inhomogeneities
in the universe today.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.970
Inflation is a period and
of accelerated expansion

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.190
in the first fraction of the
second after the Big Bang.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.920
And it explains why the universe
is approximately homogeneous

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.410
and spatially flat.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.360
We had several problems
before the theory of Inflation

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.670
was proposed.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.180
The problems were related
to why the universe is

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:14.910
observed to be so flat, why the
universe is observed to be so

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.760
homogeneous at very
different scales

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.030
so this theory came into place.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.180
It was proposed as a
solution for these problems.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.350
So in the simplest
model of inflation,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.750
there is a single scaler
field-- and by scaler field

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.660
I mean a field that
takes different values

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.560
in different positions-- and
more common-- and more common

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.240
scaler field that we are
very used to it this,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.781
for example, the temperature.

00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:46.280
OK?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.280
That's a scalar field.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.200
So the field takes different
values at different positions.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.020
So in that simplest
models of inflation,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:20:00.120
there is single scaler field
slowly rolling down a potential

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.010
This scaler field is known
as the inflect on field.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.360
So while it rolls
down the potential--

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:13.490
while it rolls of down the
potential-- different modes,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.580
different perturbations
in this field

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.210
stop being in constant contact.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.950
When they stop being
in constant contact,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.630
and by this I mean that they
cannot exchange information

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:31.150
with each other--
a perturbation--

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.910
an initial seed is frozen.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:34.590
OK?

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.140
And this initial seed is
what then gives rise to CMB

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.670
fluctuations that
we observe today.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.730
OK so the square amplitude
of this initial seed,

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:51.960
I will call it the primordial
power spectrum-- which

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.160
is the square amplitude of this
initial seed that gives rise

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.650
to the observed CMB fluctuations
and the observed large-scale

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.820
structure of the universe.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.970
So the idea is that the
field during inflation

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.770
takes different values, and
these different values are

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.650
associated with the
CMB fluctuations

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.220
at different angular
scales in the sky.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.370
So the idea is that by
looking at different angular

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.950
scales in this guy
the CMB power spectrum

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:35.020
may be able to different regions
of inflationary potential

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.940
during inflation.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.920
So this is the link--
this is an inverse problem

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.080
that we have here.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.280
We have the observations
of the CMB power

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.450
spectrum, either
temperature polarization.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.490
And we want to
understand the physics

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.790
of the very early universe
a fraction of a second

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.760
after the Big Bang.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.090
So our goal as a community,
and my goal in one

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.930
of my line of research,
is to shed light

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.630
on the physics of inflation
by using CMB observations.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.340
This is just an
example of work that I

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.390
have been doing
on reconstruction

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.890
on this inverse
problem, on taking

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.330
data measured by
the Planck satellite

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:25.640
of the temperature of the photos
that come from the Big Bang.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.560
These temperature data has been
measured by Planck satellite.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.010
I'm trying to reconstruct this
primordial power spectrum that

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.760
is this seed for
these fluctuations

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.290
that we observe today.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.620
So this is a reconstruction
that wed did using--

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.270
with Vinıcius Miranda and
Wayne Hu using temperature

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.930
fluctuations and an ongoing
work with a graduate student

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:52.110
at Harvard, [INAUDIBLE], is
to make a full reconstruction

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.460
of the primordial power
spectrum by using not only that

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.710
temperature fluctuations
of these photons,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.470
but another property
of these photons known

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.850
as the polarization.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.780
And I will talk about
these in a few slides.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:11.570
We can also infer the shape
of the inflationary potential.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.120
And here, I'm
showing you here-- we

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.310
can put constrains using
data from the Planck

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.310
satellite or the WMAP satellite
or many other telescopes that

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:27.110
are all over the world, we
can try to put constraints

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.450
on the shape of the
inflationary potential

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.950
to see how all these
[? inflect ?] on field

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.750
is moving along the potential--
if it's moving slowly,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.010
if it has abrupt in the way.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.250
So this is another example.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.530
And we can make predictions.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.613
I talked to you about the
temperature fluctuations

00:23:45.613 --> 00:23:50.420
of the CMB photons, but the
CMB photons are also polarized.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:56.730
They oscillate in
particular directions--

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.800
this is what is the polarization
of the CMB fluctuations.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.040
And so with temperature
measurements of the temperature

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.620
fluctuations.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.770
We can make predictions as
to what we should observe

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.120
for the CMB polarization.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.940
And we can learn about
the physics of inflation

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.540
looking at these predictions.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.120
Now another question
that we can ask

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.880
is-- I talked to you about
one field or a particle,

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.950
if you want, during
inflation-- can

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.030
we probe other primordial
particles during inflation?

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.670
Can we probe physical
properties of these particles?

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:39.130
And so I am just showing
you this slide just for you

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.170
to get an idea of
what you can do

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.130
with the large-scale
structure of the universe.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.900
Primordial particles affect
the large-scale structure

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.730
of the universe in
very distinctive ways.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.900
So for example, work
that I have been

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.440
doing over the past
few years is related

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.520
to probing primordial
particles spin 2.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.160
When I say "spin," I mean a
quantum mechanical inherent

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.220
angular momentum
of the particle.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.970
So we can program primordial
particles of spin 2

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.040
by looking at the statistics
of the ellipticities

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.200
of the galaxies-- and this
is another talk per se,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.000
but I just want to give
you a feeling of some work

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.950
that I have been doing and
it's being done in this field.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.520
You can also look at the
galaxy velocity field

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.470
and try to probe primordial
particles with spin 1--

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.090
this is a work in progress
with my post-doc Azadeh

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.830
Moradinezhad.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.530
And in principle,
higher spin particles

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:50.770
which are studied-- which have
been studied for a long time

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.975
by string theories
and predicted,

00:25:52.975 --> 00:25:55.780
in principle, they should
also leave an imprint

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.690
on the large construction
of the universe.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:02.740
And this is more subtle and
it's part of work in progress.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.910
OK let me tell you in my last 10
minutes about the polarization

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.250
that I already
mentioned of the CMB

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.040
and how you can hope to
learn about the energy

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.960
scale at which
inflation happen using

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.590
the polarization of
the CMB fluctuations.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:25.970
So the CMB polarization
is linearly polarized.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.540
And by this, I mean
that it oscillates

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.980
in distinctive planes.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.310
OK?

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:37.730
The polarization is generated
by a process known as Thomson

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.800
scattering-- scattering of
photons off free electrons.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.570
So the photons scatter
off free electrons,

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.560
and each electron,
along the line of sight,

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:54.800
sees a local temperature
quadruple-- a local temperature

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.970
distribution-- that is the
source of the polarization

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.360
that we observe today.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.740
We can decompose the
CMB polarization.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.610
When you show the composition--
this is just the basics--

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.818
but when you show the
composition is to decomposition

00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:14.310
to E and B modes in the
same way electromagnetism

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.350
is decomposing to E and B modes.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.950
Here, just to give
you a picture of how

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.260
the E and B modes of the
CMB polarization look like.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.800
So that E-modes have their
direction either radially--

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.360
they are oriented
radially around cold spots

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.630
or tangentially
around hot spots.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.820
And the B-mode has the same
orientation as the E-modes,

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.380
rotated by 45
degrees OK so that's

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.591
how that how we decompose
the polarization of the CMB.

00:27:48.591 --> 00:27:51.520
So different processes give
rise to different types

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.810
of polarization.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.210
Density and velocity
fluctuations

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.660
plus linear evolution--
just nothing

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.870
happened to these photons--
this gets rise to E-modes.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.650
Now in order to
have B-modes, you

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.790
can either have B-modes
by a process known

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.300
as gravitational lensing.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.200
Gravitational
lensing is the bend--

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.980
it's how the photons bend their
path when they are traveling

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.030
toward Earth because of massive
structures in the universe.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.380
Massive structures
in the universe

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.440
curve the space
time and the photons

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.450
bend their back
toward us, and this

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.100
is known as
gravitational lensing

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.370
and this affect gives
rise to B-modes.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.870
And another source
of B-modes comes

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.570
from primordial
gravitational waves.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.460
I believe Salvatore will talk
about gravitational waves,

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.340
but perhaps not primordial
gravitational waves.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.140
So bear in mind that
these will be two

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.840
types of gravitational waves.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.690
So gravitational waves
arise from inflation,

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.880
because we expect to
have quantum fluctuations

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.970
in the space-time fabric
of the universe that

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:13.420
get expand in this accelerated--
in this period of accelerated

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.840
expansion-- a fraction of a
second after the Big Bang.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.520
OK?

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.180
Those are the
gravitational waves.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.060
And that's why they're exciting,
because a measure-- well,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.150
that's one part of
why they're exciting,

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.370
but a measurement of
these gravitational waves

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:33.940
would provide us with
information about the quantum

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.240
properties of the metric.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.340
So it will tell us something
about quantum gravity.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.740
So gravitational waves--
also, so as I told you,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.830
the stored space time.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.950
And this creates a quadruple
that each electron sees as

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.200
well, along the line of sight.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.980
And this source is polarization.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.690
And they leave an imprint into
their B-mode polarization.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.690
Here I'm showing
you just so that you

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.270
have a picture of
what these B-modes

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.080
look like as a function.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.720
When I say multiple moment, I
mean angular scale in the sky.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.880
So remember that these
are large angular scales

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.490
and these are small
angular scales.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.890
This is the B-mode
on power spectrum.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.620
In black, I'm showing
the B-mode power spectrum

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.880
coming from
gravitational lensing,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.800
from the way the
photos bend their path

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.830
due to massive structure
in the universe

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.280
when they're coming toward us.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.450
And in blue, I'm
showing you a signature

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.160
of gravitational waves
for a certain amplitude.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.760
I just picked an
arbitrary amplitude here.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.660
These two peaks correspond
to scattering of photos

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.830
off free electrons happening
either at the period

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.450
of reionization at
these very large scales,

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.510
or at the period
of recombination

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.650
at these much shorter scales--
smaller scales, sorry.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:06.920
And the goal here of
this line of research

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.990
is to try to find out if these
gravitational waves are present

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.990
or not.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.570
And so this line of
research puts limits

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:22.900
into the possible amplitude that
these gradation waves can have.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.680
So they're
interesting because we

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.940
can learn this amplitude of
these gravitational waves,

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.444
we will be able, or we
could, potentially-- we

00:31:36.444 --> 00:31:38.110
don't know if we will
ever measure them,

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.532
but hopefully we will.

00:31:39.532 --> 00:31:46.550
We could potentially learn about
the energy scale of inflation.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:51.420
So a measurement of
gravitational waves

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.800
would not only provide a direct
measurement of the expansion

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.070
rate of the universe
during inflation,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.100
during the extent of the minus
35 seconds after the Big Bang,

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.990
but also, it would provide
a measurement of the energy

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.530
scale of inflation.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.030
OK?

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:11.310
So this quantity r
over here is a measure

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.300
of the amplitude of the
gravitational waves.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:20.900
So is this quantity is greater
than 0.1 this would imply--

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.010
or if it's the
order of 0.1, this

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.490
would imply that the energy
scale of the inflation

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.930
is about 10 to the 16GV.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:37.030
Think that the LHC goes
up to perhaps 14 TV

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.840
so this is a TV's 10 to the 3GV.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.740
This is orders of
magnitude larger

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:51.080
than what any possible
accelerator ever

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.580
built-- not only now, but ever
built in Earth can ever reach.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.570
So this is a window
to the highest energy

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.055
scales in the universe.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.200
These energy scales
are way larger

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.310
than any energy scale
that could be probed

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.970
that was proven-- that
was probed in the past

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:18.490
and that could be ever probed
in earth by an accelerator.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:23.890
These are current limits on
primordial gravitational waves.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.270
The take out message
from this plot

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:31.440
is that we are making
progress in putting limits

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.910
on these amplitude of the
primordial irritation waves,

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.970
but they have not
been detected yet.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:41.160
This is work that I did on
collaboration with the BICEP

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.240
team and their Planck satellite
in which we combined their data

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.230
with other data sets coming
from the Planck satellite that

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.670
could be a source of confusion
with their data sets.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:59.110
And these sorts of confusion
comes from something

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.680
that we cosmologies call
foregrounds-- because they

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.370
are a source of noise for us.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.800
Some other people study
these-- they're not

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.199
foregrounds for other
people, but for us, they

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.730
are foregrounds.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.469
These other sources
of confusion come

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:17.830
from emissions from
polarized dust particles

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:23.300
in the galaxy that
could be confused

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.250
with primordial B-modes.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.386
So the quotes for primordial
gravitational waves

00:34:29.386 --> 00:34:32.680
is continuing and will continue.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.880
I'm showing you here an
approximate raw sensitivity

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.239
as a plot that's a
function of years.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:47.000
WMAP was the satellite
in the early 2000s.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.550
Planck, I talked about Planck,
it was launched in 2009,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.620
and it was another satellite.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.929
And now as a community,
as a big community effort,

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:01.460
we have recently
proposed an experiment

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.570
that we call CMB Stage 4.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:09.800
Its stage-- the different
stages really grow from Stage 1

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:14.090
to Stage 2, 3, and
4, they grow in order

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.250
of magnitude of the number
of detectors that we need.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.420
The CMB Stage 4
experiment proposes

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.540
building different
telescopes all over the world

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.820
to map the sky and to be
able to map these temperature

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.280
and polarization
fluctuations of the CMB.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.010
This is my final slide.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:38.690
This is what we
expect to have as

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.960
a constraint on
these quantity r that

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.610
was measuring the amplitude of
these primordial gravitational

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.130
waves.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:51.490
So here, we around
this number-- 0.3.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:58.130
With CMB Stage 4 in the
fourth year of CMB Stage 4,

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.650
this is just a projection
that we made as a community,

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:06.710
we expect to reduce
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:12.540
by about a factor
between 10 to 100.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.520
This came out very
recently, actually.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.560
This came out this week in a
science paper that we wrote.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.010
And in this book, we not only
talk about possible science

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.350
that you can do with
the CMB Stage 4 proposed

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.810
experiment to learn about
the physics of the very

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.590
early universe,
but for example, I

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:36.050
was leading a dark matter
chapter in which we

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.420
also proposed different
physics that you

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.050
will be able to learn
with the CMB Stage 4

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.670
experiment about dark matter.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.780
There were other--
you can also learn

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.730
about neutrinos, dark energy,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.380
OK so I will end here
with my conclusions.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.500
So I show you that we
can probe the shape

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:58.710
of the inflationary potential
by using CMB observations,

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.280
so by mapping observations
that we make today

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:08.290
with the very, very early
period of the universe.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.820
We talked about how large-scale
structure of the universe

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.550
offers a unique way of
probing physical properties

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:19.090
of other possible
primordial particles.

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.250
And I showed you
the current state

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.120
of the art for constraints,
at that moment.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.520
We are constraining, we
didn't measure anything,

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.170
at the moment.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.580
But here are the constraints on
gravitational wave amplitudes.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.030
And you should
really stay tuned,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:37.030
because in the next
decade, we will expect

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.160
to tighten these limits
and on the amplitude

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.030
of primordial gravitational
waves by a lot,

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.230
and perhaps, even measure.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:49.270
There are many experiments
that are built.

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.660
That are currently
proposed, that are currently

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:56.810
taking data-- such as BICEP3
and Keck, different frequencies,

00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:02.180
EBEX, POLARBEAR, SPIDER,
Advanced ActPol, SPTP3G,

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.616
Simons Observatory, CMB-S4,
LiteBIRD, PIXIE, CORE, et

00:38:06.616 --> 00:38:07.880
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.890
In blue, I just put
the ones that I been

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.990
involved in writing proposals.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.140
But these are lots
of experiments

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.090
that are being proposed and
this is really a golden era,

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:26.115
hopefully, that will come for
primordial gravitational waves.

00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:27.250
OK, thank you.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:32.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.000
No questions, right?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.916
- Yeah, we're going to
hold our own questions.

00:38:34.916 --> 00:38:39.020
So Salvatore is
originally from Italy.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.260
He did his undergraduate work
at the University of Bologna.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:48.420
And he did his doctoral work
at the Pierre and Marie Curie

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.000
University in Paris, got
his doctorate in 2012.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.790
And then he joined MIT
as a postdoctoral fellow

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.120
and then became a
research scientist.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.500
And he is now just about to
become a member of the faculty

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.130
at MIT.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.630
- Yeah.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:06.800
- And he has been working
on gravitational waves,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.040
direct observation of
gravitational waves--

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.240
not produced primordially,
as Cora was talking about,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.880
but produced in very violent
collisions in the universe,

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.380
at large.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.172
And in fact, most
of you, many of you,

00:39:20.172 --> 00:39:23.360
probably saw the
news of the discovery

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.032
of gravitational waves.

00:39:25.032 --> 00:39:25.861
- No spoilers.

00:39:25.861 --> 00:39:26.360
- What?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:26.943
- No spoilers.

00:39:26.943 --> 00:39:29.850
- No spoilers.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.140
OK, sorry about that.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.260
Even hear the sound of it?

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.968
Are you going to play
us the sound of it?

00:39:35.968 --> 00:39:37.430
- No, I can make the sound but--

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.130
- Well, that would
be even better.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.770
OK, so the talk
is, everything you

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.540
want to know about
gravitational waves

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.110
but were afraid to ask,
by Salvatore Vitale.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:46.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.142
- Thank you.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.850
And I hope you can hear me well.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.090
And so the way
this talk is made,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.300
it basically
anticipates the Q&amp;A.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.850
And it's a long
series of Q&amp;A. I've

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.990
been asked to talk about
what I do for a living

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.330
and this is gravitational
waves, basically.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.690
You can see here two black
holes rotating and emitting

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.800
gravitational waves.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.440
Well, you cannot see them,
they're black, but OK.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.960
OK, if you have questions,
we have the Q&amp;A later

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.360
or I have coffee break.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.800
So let me with the very
first basic question

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.240
that you may ask if you
don't spend your whole day

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.360
thinking about this thing is,
what are gravitational waves?

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.310
If you open a physics
textbook-- a good one--

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.460
you'll find typical
sentences like this.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.000
They say the
gravitational waves are

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.710
ripples in the space-time
continuum, emitted

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.570
by any system with a
non-constant quadrupole moment.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.360
OK which is not
particularly enlightening.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.335
You can look at the
Einstein equation, OK.

00:40:45.335 --> 00:40:47.460
And that is [INAUDIBLE]
you start from the Einstein

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.460
equation, you put
[? out your ?] your metric,

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.000
crank the machinery, and you
obtain gravitational waves.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.130
Now, I could spend the next
25 minutes talking about this,

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.430
but I care about you, so
I'd rather use images, OK?

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.280
So this will give the idea,
well, at the direct order,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.720
if you take a small
stone and you throw it

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.400
out in a pond which is at rest,
you will create a perturbation

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.090
at the center where
something happened

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:16.670
and this perturbation
will propagate outward.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.600
OK?

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.245
So in this example,
the waves are just

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:25.650
a perturbation on the water
and the continuum is the pond.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:29.070
In our case, the continuum
is just the space-time,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.080
and is a very stiff material.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.350
It's very hard to [? de-form ?]
this is why our stones needs

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.390
to be much, much bigger.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.450
And in particular,
in what I do, I

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.470
focus on compact objects,
which is a fancy way of calling

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.810
neutron stars and black holes.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.190
If you take two of
these objects and you

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.990
make them spiraling
around each other,

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.180
they lose energy and this energy
goes into gravitational waves.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.800
And the image is very similar
to what you've seen before.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.380
OK, so you may
think, oh, this is

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.890
pretty similar to
electromagnetic waves.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.890
You have charges that move and
they make electromagnetic wave.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:10.250
And there are points in
common, there are similarities.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.280
There are also
important differences.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:18.360
The one that I like to think
about is that in Cora's talk

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.305
you have seen that the electron
and all the photon interact

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.590
and they interact
with everything.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.770
The gravitational field
this very different.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.900
It's much more shy.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.430
It doesn't interact with
anything, basically, OK?

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:34.520
This means that while light that
you receive from star pulsars,

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.130
quasars, whatever-- can be
easily absorbed, obscured,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:42.300
bent, deflected, reflected
whatever-- gravitational waves

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.770
do not have this issue.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.720
They basically can
go from one side

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:49.010
to the other of the
universe without being

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.294
disturbed by anyone.

00:42:50.294 --> 00:42:52.460
And I hope some of you at
least will have recognized

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.870
my quote from Neil Young.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.710
But if not, it's OK.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.340
And I should have
used Bob Dillon,

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.940
but I didn't have time
to change the slides.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.924
OK so how do we detect
these gravitational waves?

00:43:04.924 --> 00:43:06.590
To answer this question,
we should first

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.860
look at what they do when
they go through something.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.450
And what they do is that they--
well, they basically change

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.680
this space-time itself.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.240
And the way it is it gets
manifest is in the fact

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.680
that if you have an observer,
a free-floating observer which

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.820
means, [INAUDIBLE] for
example, the distance

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.090
between these objects
will change with time.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.280
So that if you
start, for example,

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.570
with 4 particles
within a ring, four

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.160
masses, and the
gravitational wave passes by,

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.910
the ring will become an ellipse.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.560
So the space-- the distance
will increase in one direction

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.090
and decrease in the other, and
so on and so forth. [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.900
So you may think, OK, it's easy.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.720
The only thing I
need to do to check

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.886
if there are gravitational
waves is put a few things

00:43:50.886 --> 00:43:52.820
around, monitor their distance.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.590
If I see that the
distances is varying

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.500
with a characteristic
pattern-- there

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.620
you go-- gravitational waves.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.770
It's not that easy, though.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:03.490
So don't believe the smiley face
because if you do the numbers,

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:07.540
you will find out that the
typical gravitation wave will

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.750
introduce a relative
distance which

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:13.390
is a variation, which we
constrain of roughly one

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.660
part on 10 to the 21.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.520
And this is a very,
very large number.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.549
So you have to be able to
measure very small variation.

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:23.340
When we give talk around
with my colleague,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.425
we typically use the
example of an atom.

00:44:26.425 --> 00:44:28.030
This is a hydrogen atom.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.117
You go inside the nucleus
which is a proton and go

00:44:30.117 --> 00:44:32.450
on [? inside, ?] [? inside, ?]
[? inside. ?] And this is

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.366
the proton and the
[? radiational ?] way to be

00:44:34.366 --> 00:44:38.300
able to measure is the
one you would see here.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.090
It's pretty small.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.630
Now not many of us have
seen protons on their life,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.865
so I found another
image, which I like best.

00:44:45.865 --> 00:44:47.850
It's not about length,
it's more visual.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.060
If you go to the seaside
and count the grain of sand,

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.020
you'll get a very large number.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.500
If you do the same as
the size everywhere

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.000
in the coastline of the
whole planet, if you believe

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.820
the questionable web
page I found where

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.640
they do this
calculation, they found

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.490
there is a few 10 to the 21.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.290
So the measurement
we need to do,

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:09.690
it's comparable to being able
to remove one grain of sand

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.100
from the whole planet and
see the difference, OK?

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.010
This is what we are doing.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.420
And for us, desperate and crazy
as it may be, luckily for us,

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.840
there were people
in the past who

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.610
were not scared by this task.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.763
In particular, I have a
picture of Ray Vice who

00:45:23.763 --> 00:45:28.590
was a professor here at MIT who
in the 70s, got pen and paper

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:32.190
and showed that you can
actually build an apparatus that

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:36.880
can measure this kind
of variation in length.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.050
And this original
idea was developed.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.000
And several or tens
of years later,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.076
it became what we
call LIGO, which

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.450
stands for a Laser
Interferometer

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.740
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.940
Now we are not going through
the math or the data,

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.350
but I want to give you
an idea about the works.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.300
LIGO is basically-- you can two
pictures, there two of them.

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.100
It's an interferometer,
for those of you

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.014
who know what I mean, of
arms four kilometers along.

00:46:04.014 --> 00:46:05.430
The way it works
is the following.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.390
You have laser
light-- like this one

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.700
just a bit better-- entering
an apparatus, hits a mirror.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.230
Half of the light goes up,
half of the lights continue.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.190
And there are
mirrors at the ends,

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.290
so the light bounces back.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.820
Now this is not a
typical interferometer,

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.680
the light bounces back and
forth a few hundred times.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.120
Then it goes out and
is recombined here.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.670
Now light has a nice property
that if you combine it

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.650
in the right way, it can
interfere in a way that

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:34.860
cancels out, basically.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.619
So you have darkness.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:38.160
And this is the
condition in which we

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.430
keep our instruments normally.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.994
Now if a gravitational
wave passes through,

00:46:42.994 --> 00:46:44.410
because of what I
told you before,

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.590
this length will
change in a way,

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.360
and this direction will
change in another way.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.380
So the interference condition
at the end is not met anymore

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.110
and we see some
light coming out.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.530
And so this is the
basic idea of how

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:03.600
we use laser interferometry to
measure a very tiny variation

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.960
in distance.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.480
We have two of these
instruments in the US.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.480
One is in Louisiana, the
other is in Washington state.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.520
And there are a few
others which are either

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.490
being built or planned
around the world,

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.380
and all together they
work as a network, OK,

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.820
to increase our sensitivity.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.880
So what I do for
a living is more

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.440
about learning something
about the sources

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.120
of these gravitational waves.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.731
So what can we learn?

00:47:31.731 --> 00:47:32.230
Well.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.110
If we go back to our pond,
you can imagine pretty easily,

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.020
I think, that if you
are sitting on the side,

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.500
you don't see what has
been thrown to the pond,

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.000
you only receive these
waves coming to you.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.830
If you're very good at
physics or mathematics,

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.670
you can think of using
the shape and maybe

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.300
the relative distance
between this wave front

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.360
and so on and so forth
to learn something

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.480
about what happened
in the middle that

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.100
caused this perturbation
to start with.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.150
And this is exactly what
we-- what I do, at least.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:06.610
And so my objects of interest,
as I mentioned before,

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.120
are compact objects.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.940
And these are leftovers
of very massive stars

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.740
after they end
their nuclear fuel

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.786
and they supernovae and explode.

00:48:16.786 --> 00:48:18.410
What is left in the
middle, it's either

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.620
a neutron star which is
somewhere in this [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.550
nebula or a black hole
which you're seeing here,

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.420
hitting its companion.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.850
Now both of these categories of
objects come with pretty many

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.787
open questions, and they're
very interesting objects,

00:48:34.787 --> 00:48:36.120
otherwise , we wouldn't be here.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.790
So the first one-- neutron star.

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.660
And neutron star-- you
probably know these.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.640
We're talking of the objects
which are roughly 1.5 times

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.150
the mass of our own
star, but packed together

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.300
in a radius of 10 kilometers.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:54.110
Now these conditions are
so extreme that, in fact,

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:58.450
pretty much like in
Cora's CMB example,

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:01.830
we can only produce this
condition in the lab so to be

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.440
frank, we have no idea
how matter behaves in this

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.520
condition, because we
cannot make them at earth.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.000
So one of the
things I want to do

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.190
is study these neutron
stars is learn something

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:15.350
about their composition and
their [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.310
Another interesting
thing is verify

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:20.580
whether are many
astronomers seem to think,

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.390
neutron stars mashing
one and the other

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:26.040
are responsible for what we call
a GRBs, which are very bright

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.120
and energetic flashes of
light that we sometimes see,

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.980
or if they produce most of
the metal in the universe.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.930
"Metal" means everything--
[INAUDIBLE] an idiom,

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.080
in this case.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.340
And another related question
is, what is the maximum mass

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.480
of neutron star?

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.790
We don't really know and
[? there are ?] consequences

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:45.770
nuclear physics.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.180
Things get even weirder when
you move to a black hole

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.830
because you have even more
mass, and even more compact.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:54.810
And now these objects--
and then we'll

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.330
come back to this in
a minute-- produce

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.510
extreme gravitational field.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:05.840
Now a priori, there is no reason
why Einstein General relativity

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.240
should work for those skies.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.100
So this is the first probably
question comes to mind,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.840
Einstein, inventor,
discovered GR

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.800
to explain what was happening
in the solar system, which

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.860
is a very quiet place, as
compared to black holes.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.256
It's several order
magnitude extrapolation.

00:50:23.256 --> 00:50:24.630
Of course, Einstein
was Einstein,

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.260
so it seems to be working,
which is very annoying.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.540
Come back to this later.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.850
Anyway, so there are several
other questions which

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.920
we want to answer, like how
fast can this black hole

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.200
rotate around their axis?

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:36.810
We don't know.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.990
There are conjectures,
for example,

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.990
by Hawking, that
says that there is

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.730
a limit on how fast these
black holes can spin.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.810
But we would like to verify
whether that's the case.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.090
We don't know how
big they can get,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.810
or rather, we know that they can
be either a few times our sun

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.770
or millions of times as massive.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.550
We don't know if they can
have any value in the middle.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:01.060
And we don't know
when they first

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.100
formed is of the universe.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.160
Some people may
even think, suggest

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.580
that may be dark
matter, or whatever.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.190
For us crazy-- something nice
about physics, and for us

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:12.606
crazy, as crazy
as your theory is,

00:51:12.606 --> 00:51:14.700
there is someone who's
already thought about it.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.770
OK, to tell you what I mean
by extreme with any image,

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:22.466
Let me use Saturn,
which I think all of you

00:51:22.466 --> 00:51:23.840
have seen once in
your life here.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.200
It has this beautiful ring,
and so on and so forth.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.700
Now if Saturn were
a black hole, you

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.420
would see something
like this which

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.130
you know, if you're
seen Interstellar,

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:33.430
the movie Interstellar.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.349
This is a black
hole with a ring.

00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:37.640
But you see a pretty striking
difference between Saturn

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.420
and the black hole is that
the ring in the black hole

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.730
also goes up and down,
which seems very weird.

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:48.150
What is going on is not that
the ring is going up and down,

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.640
it's that the black holes are
pretty aggressive objects.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.500
So if my eye here on
the right and looking

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.950
at the black hole
this way, what happens

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:01.124
is that the photons emitted
by the side of the disk, which

00:52:01.124 --> 00:52:03.290
normally I should not be
able to see it because it's

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.350
on the other side,
try to escape--

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.920
for example, vertically or
with some angle but they get

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.400
attracted by the black hole,
by the gravitational pull

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.130
of the black hole, so they are
deformed and they go this way.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.280
Which means that I
can see basically,

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.380
facing the black hole, I can
see the rare of the ring--

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.410
both the upper side
and the other side.

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.680
So this is something
which is pretty far

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.420
from what we typically
think and imagine

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.290
or experience in our life.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.980
OK so this is about the sources.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.010
How do the waves look like?

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.510
And for my work, I
focus, as I said,

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:44.060
on binary compact objects, so
I have two objects like two

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.570
black holes in this cartoon.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.795
They started life what?

00:52:48.795 --> 00:52:53.290
The part of their lives
which interesting for me,

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.260
around each other.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.760
They are orbiting
faster and faster,

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.340
emitting gravitational waves.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.010
When they are thought
about, we talk

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.090
of this spiral and these
gravitational waves

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:02.970
that they emit.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:06.500
So these are the variation
on the space-time, basically.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.605
And it's not the
same [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:08.605 --> 00:53:13.720
it just gets slightly
louder and louder

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.370
and the frequency gets higher.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.130
Then the two black holes,
or the two neutron stars

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:19.430
start touching each other.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.250
We talk of merger, they merge.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:25.850
And then what is left
is a single black hole,

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.070
because you have to measure
two of them together.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.130
Since it was born in a violent
way, it's not spherical.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:32.130
It's out of equilibrium.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:35.670
So it has to release
the excess of energy

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.470
and we talk of
ringdown in this phase.

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:40.615
And this is the very last
bit of the wave from it.

00:53:40.615 --> 00:53:42.230
So here's right
after the merger,

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.040
when the mess is happening.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.190
And then basically
it goes down to zero,

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:50.100
because it's releasing all
the gravitational waves energy

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.140
left over.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.950
I guess you're all
asking this question.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.180
And now, this is all very
nice, but does it work?

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.950
We have these [? multi-denses ?]
and black holes are very weird

00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:59.450
objects.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.450
Maybe you made it all up.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.220
Yes, it does.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.730
And unless you have been
living in a different planet,

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:09.180
you have heard that
in the last year,

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.660
LIGO and Virgo
collaboration detected

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.772
two such binary black holes.

00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:15.230
So the gravitational
wave is coming

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.330
from two of these mergers.

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:20.480
And it was nice, it was
everywhere [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.310
And here you can find-- we
actually added a third objects

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.840
which we cannot claim with
certainty that it was a black

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.390
hole-- I'm a personal
believer, OK,

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.640
so we claimed detection
of two of them.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.570
And you can also see
these are the waveforms.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.940
They look a lot like the
one I just showed you.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.010
Now I should also say that
pretty much in the same way

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.830
if a Cora looks at
the CMB spectrum

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:45.560
from each of the feature-- like
the peak, [? the throat, ?]

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.820
whatever, she can learn
something about the universe--

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.060
if I look at one
of these waveform,

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.835
from each of these features like
their duration or the amplitude

00:54:53.835 --> 00:54:58.090
or whatever, I can say
something about the source.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.190
OK so this was
everywhere in the news.

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:04.240
We got the congratulation
from Obama, which is nice.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.950
I put this because two things
are particularly funny to me.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.515
The first one is that in the
Washington Post, although we

00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:12.890
were pretty high
in importance, we

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:17.173
we're still below Meryl Streep,
Beyonce, Bloody Mess, whatever

00:55:17.173 --> 00:55:19.920
that is, and Trumpism.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.800
And the other thing
which I like is

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.240
that the Economist, given its
orientation, took our merger

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.730
and put us in the Merger
and Acquisition section

00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:34.810
of their paper, which
I think is hilarious.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:36.167
OK, moving forward.

00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:37.000
So what do we learn?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.040
We got these two
objects, I promise you

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.900
we would learn something
about black holes.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.790
Did we?

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.970
Yes.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.676
So we learned a few things.

00:55:44.676 --> 00:55:46.550
First of all, we learned
that black holes can

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:51.210
be significantly more massive
than what was previously

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.880
found and discovered with
electromagnetic [? emission. ?]

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.600
So in this plot in this
cartoon, you see on the x-axis

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.690
the total mass of
the black hole.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:04.154
This is 20, 40, 60, if you're
going to read it from there.

00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.820
Now the blue objects
are the black holes

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.560
that they were previously
known through electromagnetic

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.660
observations, OK?

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.300
And you can see they all
live somewhere in between 5

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.840
and 20 star masses, maybe.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.830
The red points
where there are bars

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:20.130
are the two and maybe
three black holes

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.790
that we discover with LIGO.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:24.900
And you can see like in
some cases, like this guy

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.920
here, they are
significantly more massive

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:32.330
and scary than
what's found before.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:35.899
You know, these are 35, and
these are 60 star masses.

00:56:35.899 --> 00:56:37.440
Now in the next few
years, it's going

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.854
to be funny to discover
why we see this.

00:56:40.854 --> 00:56:42.520
Are we targeting a
different population?

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.300
Or do the electromagnetic
metals have some selection bias

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.840
or a combination of both?

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.590
We don't know yet.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.170
It's going to be interesting.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:55.140
We also learned
something about the stars

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.320
that this black hole came from.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.050
The fact that they
could get so massive

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:04.080
has implications on metallicity
of their progenital star,

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.230
in particular, it
puts an upper limit.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.940
And we can talk about this if
you want at the coffee break.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.870
But basically, if you
have too much metal,

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:13.770
you cool early so you
cannot become that big.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:17.310
We also discovered, and got
to show that black holes can,

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.160
indeed, spin around their axis.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:24.470
Now so for one of them, we could
say with pretty eye certainty

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:27.450
that it was spinning.

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:30.230
And for all of them, we
could say, basically,

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.630
that they are not
maximally spinning.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.400
So they are far from
this theoretical limit

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.490
that some people think--
that most people think

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:40.810
should be there.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.535
Now this may seem pretty vague.

00:57:42.535 --> 00:57:43.910
I'm not telling
you that the spin

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.350
was 0.3 plus minus something.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:48.760
However, the important
thing is that these

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.060
are the first direct measurement
of spins of black hole ever

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.730
made by humankind.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.790
And let me tell you
what I mean here.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:01.080
We already measured masses
and spins of black holes, OK?

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.100
But the way we have done it,
it's indirect measurement.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.400
So first of all, what
you need is a black hold

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.740
in a binary system.

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.486
We call it x-ray binary.

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.110
So if you want to
measure, for example,

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.884
the spin of black hole in this
way, what you're measuring

00:58:14.884 --> 00:58:16.300
is not the spin
of the black hole.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.420
You're measuring properties
of the disk of gas

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.580
around the black hole.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.080
OK?

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.210
I show above just to
impress you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.650
So you are measuring
something about the disk,

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.785
and from that you
infer the spin.

00:58:28.785 --> 00:58:30.214
The same thing about the mass.

00:58:30.214 --> 00:58:31.630
When you're
measuring, if you want

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.088
to know the mass
of the black hole,

00:58:33.088 --> 00:58:35.900
is the mass of this
guy and his velocity.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.640
So it's this different.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.380
What we're seeing
instead here is

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.890
the direct imprint
of black hole mass

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.500
and spin on the space-time.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:47.330
So it's a much
cleaner measurement.

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:51.120
OK, moving forward,
you may have read this.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.830
And thank you for
the congratulation.

00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:56.390
However, I showed this before.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:57.390
This is wrong, OK?

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:59.730
We have not shown that
Einstein was right.

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:03.040
If I were the editor
of CNN, this CNN,

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.140
I would have titled this--
"It's not as sketchy,

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.160
but Einstein was not wrong."

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.470
That's what we have shown.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:13.360
And actually, even better,
the gravitational waves signal

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.300
invented by lab are
compatible with what predicted

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.950
by Einstein, and by the way,
you cannot prove the theory is

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:20.690
right, only that it's wrong.

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.530
OK?

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.295
You can see also I have
a future in journalism

00:59:24.295 --> 00:59:27.080
if physics doesn't work.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.120
So I'll give you one example
of what I mean with this.

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:30.620
There we go.

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.430
I'll give you one
example of something

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:33.740
called massive graviton.

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:38.410
Now if you believe
in Einstein and GR,

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:41.520
the gravitational wave force--
forced [? and hence, ?]

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.340
gravitational waves, are carried
by-- well, the speed of light,

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:47.610
first of all.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:52.876
So if you like to think in
a quantum point of view,

00:59:52.876 --> 00:59:54.250
this means that
they are mediated

00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:57.920
by a particle called
graviton which is massless,

00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.240
like the photon.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.500
And now if general
relativity is wrong,

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.780
you may think that the graviton
may have non-zero mass-- very

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.230
small but non-zero.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:12.860
So one of the things we have
done with our discoveries

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.030
is trying to put an upper limit
on the mass of this graviton.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.600
Now don't look at the
plot, we can focus just

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.980
on the question here.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.690
We put an upper
limit on the mass

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:25.590
of this hypothetical graviton to
be something incredibly small.

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:29.380
It's 1.2 10 ti minus 22
in the span units which

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.270
is electron volt over c square.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:33.570
Now John, you are--
a particle physicist

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:36.420
will tell you that
the neutranoids much,

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.610
much, much, much bigger.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.590
And so it's a very small
number, but it's non-zero.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:41.550
This is the point.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.240
If we had decided
that this was zero,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.850
we could have maybe said that
Einstein was right, it's zero.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.390
By putting an upper
limit, we said

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.620
that 0 is compatible with
what we found-- which

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.020
is a very different thing, OK?

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.600
So what I mean here is that in
the next few months and years,

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.890
we can either prove
that GR is wrong,

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.640
if we find a violation
of it, or we can just

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.350
say that it keeps being
confirmed by the data.

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:10.500
Now in the next few
minutes, actually, I'm

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.920
early, which is good
for a coffee break,

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.390
I want to say something
about what happens next.

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.510
Let me start with what
I do, in particular,

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:22.800
which is, as I said, the
neutron star, black holes.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.990
Now LIGO will restart
collecting data later in October

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.730
for another six months.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:32.840
And then just a
small pause and we

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.707
continue for the
next three years.

01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:36.290
Anyway, so in the
next month and years

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:39.970
we expect to detect way more
of this binary black holes.

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:43.150
And hopefully, since we
know they are out there,

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.650
we should also start detecting
binary neutron stars.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.560
So part of my job in
the next few years

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.900
is going to be to
try to characterize

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:56.830
these objects-- the underlying
population, its properties.

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:01.440
And also, keep performing tests
of general [? activity. ?]

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.430
And the nice thing
about most of what we do

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.260
is that we can start
stack detection.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.540
So from 10 we learn
more than what

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.790
we learned with the first one.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.560
So our tests will get
better and better with time

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.190
And now although my talk only
focused on compact binaries,

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:20.950
there are other
potential sources

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:24.180
of gravitational waves, for
example supernovae explosions,

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.100
OK?

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.480
And so hopefully
soon we'll start

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.410
to detect some of these
other interesting objects,

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.030
or what I personally
would prefer,

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.916
see something which we
have no idea why it is.

01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:38.040
In science, typically it
is the most exciting thing

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.210
that can happen.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.060
And something that
I also involve

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.210
with people that
are on my team, it's

01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.940
thinking about
what happens next.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.215
Now if you remember the first
or second slide of Cora's talk,

01:02:50.215 --> 01:02:52.030
she had this 1.3
billion on the history

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:55.870
of the universe in one slide.

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.940
And now we with
LIGO are targeting

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.220
sources and black holes
which are in our backyard.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.040
They are a redshift
of 0.5 maybe.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.920
So they are pretty nearby.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.890
And most-- well, a lot
of interesting stuff

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:12.720
happens earlier--
or farther away,

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.230
depends how you want to
think about distance.

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:17.470
So we are with
people we're working

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.150
on conceiving and thinking
about the next generation

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:23.570
of ground-based gravitational
wave observatories.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:24.490
We even have names.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:27.820
We have names before we
have money, which is nice,

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:28.810
personally.

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.330
And these guys, once
they get online--

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:37.170
we're talking 15 years to
be optimistic-- they would

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.930
be sensitive to black
holes, basically,

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:41.300
as far as you have
stars in the universe.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.270
So a redshift of 6 of 10,
and actually even more.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:46.170
We can see black holes
up to redshifts of 20

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:48.320
with these objects.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.670
OK in the last one
or two minutes,

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:56.460
I would like to even expand
a bit more the horizon here

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.620
and stress the
fact that there are

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.640
several astrophysical phenomena
which are-- will be producing

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.980
detectable gravitational waves.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.810
Now in my talk, I focused here
on terrestrial interferometers

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:14.520
and using the LIGO observatory
in Washington state.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.140
Now as I said, this kind of
detector target supernovae,

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.480
compact binary, and
something like this.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.000
And they are sensitive
to frequencies

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.140
on the order under their
[INAUDIBLE] to [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.000
This is not all of it, OK?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.540
C mentioned, BICEP, and
the other experiments,

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.680
which on the other
side of the spectrum,

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.870
very early on in the
age of the universe

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:40.770
is zero-- whatever
that means-- and they

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:45.650
are targeting gravitational
waves from the very Big Bang.

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:50.530
Which we know will happen as
she said, in the next few years.

01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:54.640
In the middle there is a lot
of other things happening.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.460
For example, we are
already now taking data,

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.290
something called the
Pulsar Timing Array.

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:03.370
They target they call a
gravitational waves emitted

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:05.490
by supermassive black
holes, like the one

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:07.950
in the centers of the galaxies.

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:11.410
And the way it works
is pretty nice.

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:14.070
So around us, there
are all these pulsars

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:18.790
which emit flashes of light
in a very stable periodic way.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.330
So you can use them
as clocks, basically.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:25.180
So if a gravitational wave, a
train, passes in the universe,

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.030
it will change by a tiny amount
of the distance between us

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.090
and each of these pulsars,
in a different way.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.520
So by timing it very
precisely, the arrival

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.310
time of these pulses, we can
measure gravitational waves.

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:39.145
And hopefully,they
will get something,

01:05:39.145 --> 01:05:41.390
a positive results soon.

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:45.490
Something as that will happen
in the next five to 10 years

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:48.060
awfully it's
something called LISA.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.610
LISA is basically
another interferometer.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:53.330
So it is kind of like
LIGO, but it's in space.

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:54.210
OK?

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:56.754
So it's arms, instead
of being four kilometers

01:05:56.754 --> 01:05:58.670
will be a few millions
or billions or billions

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:00.086
kilometers-- I
don't remember now.

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:03.290
And so because they're
not on the ground,

01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:05.150
they're not limited
by seismic noise--

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.600
so by the earth shaking.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.560
So they can go to lower
frequencies-- fraction

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.420
of the earth's [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.120
And if you are sensing to
these frequencies, what

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.205
you can look for,
it's again, well, A,

01:06:19.205 --> 01:06:22.810
they are compact binaries, and
also extreme [? mass ?] ratios.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:26.170
This is a very big black
hole with a very small one

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.850
going around it.

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.950
Or again, a
supermassive black hole

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:32.200
in the center of the galaxy.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.940
So I think we can say
that in the next 10 years

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.660
or so, we'll have
a pretty good idea

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.640
and we'll have detected
gravitational waves

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.860
from everywhere in the spectrum.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.580
So this is my last slide.

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:50.300
I updated my slides at the
end, in the spirit of Dante,

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.510
and I put this quote from
the Divine Comedy which

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.120
is "E quindi uscimmo a riveder
le stelle," which means,

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.470
"And then we went out
to see the stars again."

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:04.584
Now my stars are dead
and black-- thank you.

01:07:04.584 --> 01:07:07.925
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:16.710
- So I was curious-- what
is, can you explain to me,

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:19.800
and perhaps the audience,
what the Hawking limit is,

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.810
how it arises for a
spinning black hole?

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:25.920
- Yeah, OK, so the
idea is the following.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.960
As you may have
heard, black holes

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.760
are singularities in the
fabric of space-time, OK?

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.350
Now I think it was Hawking came
out with something which is

01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:40.970
called the cosmic
censorship conjecture,

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:44.110
which says that you cannot
have naked singularities

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:46.800
in the space-time.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.840
There are a few reasons-- if
the black hole is spinning,

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.190
you can violate causality
and other funny things.

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:57.135
So the way we protect ourselves
from this weird things

01:07:57.135 --> 01:07:59.510
happening is that we put the
singularity around the black

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:02.000
hole-- where lights cannot
come out, as you know.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.520
Well, [? direct ?] order.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.780
So even if something very
weird happens inside,

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.420
we cannot see it, it's all OK.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.100
Now it turns out that if
the spin of the black hole

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:15.840
is larger than some value,
the horizons disappear.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.330
So you would be left with
a free, visible, naked

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:20.700
singularity.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.970
And again, so this
is a conjecture--

01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:25.170
if you don't want
naked singularity,

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:29.229
you need to have horizon
then the spin as a limit.

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:30.160
OK?

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.431
We want to prove that.

01:08:33.431 --> 01:08:33.930
- OK.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:34.630
First question.

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:38.620
- You said that the upper
limit of black holes as a mess

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.904
remains to be defined, what
about the lower limit of mass

01:08:42.904 --> 01:08:47.060
of black hole in order for
it to have gravitational--

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.180
observable gravitational affect.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:54.359
And secondly, how abundant
are the binary black holes as

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:56.659
opposed to single black holes?

01:08:56.659 --> 01:08:58.200
- Can you repeat
the second question?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.370
- How abundant are
binary black holes?

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:00.979
- Oh I see.

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.680
- --as opposed to
single back holes?

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.779
- So the first question is--
if I was on the high side

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:10.300
of the mass of black holes,
what about the low side?

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.010
Which is a great question.

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:16.590
right now, there
seem to be a gap

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:18.630
between the mass
of neutron stars

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:20.029
and the mass of black holes.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.859
I said that neutron stars have
masses which are around 1.4,

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.529
1.5 solar masses.

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:31.557
Black holes, instead, seem to
start from 5 or 6 solar masses.

01:09:31.557 --> 01:09:33.890
And the priori-- there is no
reason why it should be so.

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:37.149
OK, you may spectacles
are 2, 3, 4-- whatever.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.990
Now this may be due
to observational bias,

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:41.590
or just we have been unlucky.

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.450
OK, it happens.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:45.180
The samples of black
holes I show is 20, maybe.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.340
We don't know that
many black holes yet.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.520
And so that is one
of the things we

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.850
want to verify, in the
next few months and years--

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.800
whether we will detect
black holes which

01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:02.760
are in the gap, basically, which
are masses lower than a 6 or 5.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.300
And the second question is--
how many more binary black holes

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.520
there are as opposed to
individual black holes?

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.980
Now, if you had asked me
this question a year ago,

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.610
a year and a and
a couple of months

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:19.750
ago, I would tell you
maybe 0, because one

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.670
of the nice thing
about our discovery

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:26.010
is that it showed that you
can have binary black holes.

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.134
Because there were astrophysical
models which said--

01:10:29.134 --> 01:10:31.800
not very many of them, but there
were astrophysical models which

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.966
said you cannot form a
binary black hole, basically.

01:10:33.966 --> 01:10:34.660
OK?

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.450
And now we found one,
so they are out there.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:44.380
More frequent-- well, I guess we
need some more time to decide.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.462
We know that a lot of the stars
in the universe-- and actually,

01:10:47.462 --> 01:10:49.795
my colleague astronomers maybe
there is a number which I

01:10:49.795 --> 01:10:53.100
don't-- maybe 60%,
70% are in binaries?

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.850
OK, a lot of stars in the
universe are in binaries, OK?

01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:59.160
So since our black holes
were stars to start with,

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.290
you can think that there is a
significant fraction of them.

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.590
The problem is that
to become black hole,

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:08.050
you need to become a
supernova, and supernova

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.620
is a pretty extreme
and violent phenomenon.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.970
So some people think that when
both objects-- one at a time--

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:18.370
go supernova, they can
destroy the binary system.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.750
They can basically
shoot the two objects

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:23.070
in different directions.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.640
So all of these are things
that if you invite me to stay,

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.560
I will-- no, I don't know.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.910
We'll see.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:33.830
We have calculated already
a rate of how often this

01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:35.960
happens in the universe.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:40.010
And the rate is such that
in with our detectors,

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:44.720
we should see on the order
of already now, a few

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.121
of these objects per month.

01:11:46.121 --> 01:11:46.620
OK?

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.070
So they're pretty common.

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:51.170
And if you talk with
me at the coffee break,

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.660
I'd remember the number, I
can tell you how many of these

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.240
you have-- each
megaparsecs cube each year,

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.340
which is what astronomers
like to quote.

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.740
And remember, it's
like 30 or 40.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.000
So they're not so uncommon.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:04.660
Thank you.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.365
- OK.

01:12:05.365 --> 01:12:07.690
are there some other questions?

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.340
I have-- oh, over here.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.055
OK.

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:14.480
I have one for Cora.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.070
- I just wonder-- I get the
impression that by a microwave

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:21.880
background and by pulsar
arrays and by LIGO,

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.040
almost simultaneously
gravitational wave

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.370
or the effects of gravitational
wave seem to come into reach

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:32.000
of measurement.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.760
And I wonder whether this
is a chance incidence,

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.740
or is it an intrinsic
reason since we're

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.580
talking about really, really
different orders of magnitude?

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.800
And you could imagine that
one effect is detectable

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.510
and the other is many,
many orders of magnitude

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:50.348
far from being measured.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.690
- Do you want to?

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.340
- Please.

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:59.030
[INAUDIBLE]

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:03.220
- So your question, is
why we can measure--

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.610
let me rephrase your question.

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:09.970
Your question is, why we
seem to be able to measure?

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:12.370
- We detect gravitational
waves simultaneously

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:16.171
on very different
orders of magnitude.

01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:16.670
- Yes.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:20.050
So well, so first of all,
the gravitational waves

01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:26.460
that, for example, we would be
able to measure with the CMB

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.500
come from a different
source, right?

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.310
So they come from the
quantum fluctuations

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:36.530
of the metric that get stretched
out in the period of 10

01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:40.180
to the minus 35 seconds
or so after the Big Bang.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.360
So these are primordial
gravitational waves.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.785
Now the gravitational waves
that he was talking about,

01:13:46.785 --> 01:13:48.160
that Salvatore
was talking about,

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.420
come from a different source.

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:56.890
These are coming from
emerging black holes.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:14:02.010
So different effects--
different physical effects

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:05.430
produce gravitational
waves at different scales.

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:09.390
That's why we are looking
at different scales.

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:12.390
- No, I think the question--
and let me see if I can rephrase

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:17.970
it, is you find it surprising
that we have sensitivity across

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:22.510
different scales now-- of the
instrumentation seems to be

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.590
giving us all at the same
time the sensitivity.

01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:29.170
And why is the
instrumentation at this level?

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:34.210
- So I think physicists tend
to be optimistic in general.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:38.260
So we may not-- the fact that
I'm-- we're putting limits

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.650
and they're putting limits--
I don't know if these--

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:45.630
I think it's-- well, they
already have a detection.

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:48.030
we don't have a detection yet.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:51.180
I think this is
completely coincidental

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:55.350
that we're still looking
for gravitational waves.

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:56.150
- Maybe I can add.

01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:58.340
We don't-- shh-- there is
no [INAUDIBLE] in common

01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:58.890
or anything.

01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:00.430
There has not been
a breakthrough

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.410
that worked for both of
us or for the pulsar.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:03.790
It's just accident.

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:07.240
- I think I can offer maybe
one thought, but I don't know.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.540
- Please.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.120
One issue is that
quantum mechanics was

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.380
sort of a playground
to understand physics

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.160
for a long time, but
now, quantum mechanics

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.040
is being applied to
devices and instrumentation

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.630
and it's starting to blossom.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:23.700
And so you're starting
to see very sensitive

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.300
low-temperature
technologies that

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.470
are being brought to bear
that give us these windows.

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.880
So I mean, I can't go
into too much more detail,

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.890
but if you look at the
detectors for CMB polarization,

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:37.790
they've been evolving
over quite some time,

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:41.590
and the detector technologies
for LIGO, as well.

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:44.260
And they rely on an
understanding of quantum

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.180
mechanics and kind of
engineering of quantum

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:47.590
mechanics, if you like.

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.640
And I think that
what that has done

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.200
is it's gotten to a certain
level of maturity that gives us

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:52.740
new windows.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.610
Now that doesn't
explain why you're

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:58.260
able to get gravitational
waves sensitives in both cases,

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.890
but it is the advent of these
super sensitive measurement

01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:05.000
techniques that have
been evolving out

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.950
of quantum mechanical
technology, I guess.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:08.420
Does that work for you?

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:08.920
- Yeah.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.220
Let me add something.

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.270
So the limits-- I
talked about the limits

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:18.940
put by BICEP, because of things
that we know-- because BICEP

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.460
became very visible.

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.760
But the limits on gravitational,
on primordial gravitational

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.110
waves were there way before.

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:31.090
So BICEP maybe made an order
of magnitude improvement,

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:36.430
but they have been there
for years and years before.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:43.330
So nothing is particular
special, I would say,

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:44.380
this period.

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.800
We are making progress,
but this progress

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:52.801
has been in a continuous
going on for years and years.

01:16:52.801 --> 01:16:53.300
- Salvatore?

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:57.380
- I just want to add
that Einstein came out

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:01.920
with GR in 1916 and we made
this discovery in 2016.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.324
We just waited for it.

01:17:04.324 --> 01:17:04.990
Now, I'm joking.

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.820
It was accidental.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.333
It was very nice,
but accidental.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.020
- OK, other question?

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.490
- So my question is, one of
the things Salvatore touched on

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:16.420
is the way in which
science is reported,

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.030
and you know, I'm very
interested in the sort

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:22.940
of popular conception
of how things are

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:25.710
and the occasional
headlines that you read.

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:29.620
So a couple of headlines
I've seen very recently,

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:33.620
were one of them was-- "Cosmic
radiation may feed forms

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:38.220
of life they were we're
discovering"-- that in fact,

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.750
you don't need the sort
of standard formula that

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.150
we're using now to create life.

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:46.140
And the other one was just
over the last day or so

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.384
that there maybe something
like 10 times more galaxies

01:17:50.384 --> 01:17:53.640
that some of the things
that have been coming back

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.820
from Hubble are
you know indicating

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.910
that we're under shooting
by an order of magnitude.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:04.990
So I'm interested in
hearing a little bit more

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:10.190
about how you feel
science is reported,

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:13.440
and what you would like to
see in science reporting

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.500
that maybe you're not getting?

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.430
- Do you want to go first?

01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:22.450
- OK, yeah, I think I
already expressed my opinion.

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.970
I understand that
if you had written,

01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:29.000
"Einstein was not wrong," you
would not have sold the copies.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.130
But I suggest you always
try to read the source.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:37.170
Most often, if you read CNN,
the New York Times, or whatever,

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.280
they love their flashy
title, but then there's

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.080
also a link to the actual
article-- scientific article--

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.650
where things are discussed.

01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:48.760
So I always try to go
this extra step even

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.990
for information which is not
pertinent to my own field.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:59.550
And , yeah, I guess
that's my take.

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:03.500
- OK Yeah I saw I have
two things to say.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:11.550
The first one is that
in general, in the news

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:16.030
we read things that are very
showy-- there is a tendency

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:22.710
to make a big title and
to put lots of lights

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:32.090
into certain breakthroughs
or to put those headlines.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:37.120
But really, it is the
continuous progress

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.830
that is being done in
science, that should be per se

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.130
something really exciting.

01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:47.945
And so I think that that
tendency to say-- in his case,

01:19:47.945 --> 01:19:51.600
"Einstein was right,"
or well, in the case

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.210
of gravitational waves--
it's a different story.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:59.680
But we all know
the story of BICEP.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:05.130
People are willing to see some
breakthrough, some big titles,

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:08.280
and really the
excitement-- of course,

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.940
that is very excitement,
but sometimes the excitement

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:16.280
doesn't have to be like in
a Hollywood movie in which

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.740
everything is so dramatic.

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:24.870
The excitement is actually to
make these steps of progress

01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:27.310
that we are continuously making.

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:30.500
And the second thing
is something curious

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.660
that happened after-- I don't
know if it's so much related

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:38.740
to your question, but I just
wanted to share my opinion.

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.960
Something curious that happened
after the BICEP announcement

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.740
was that-- well
the paper came out

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.220
the same day of
the announcement,

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:54.600
and because the announcement
in the newspapers was so big,

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.390
the community served as
sort of a peer review.

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:03.300
So the peer review
done by different parts

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.410
of the community was
happening at the same time

01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:09.860
that these news were
appearing in the newspaper.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:13.653
So I think sometimes it should
happen in the opposite way,

01:21:13.653 --> 01:21:19.850
right It should appear in the
news after the peer review.

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:23.040
So this was a
little bit of chaos

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.630
that happened then was due to
everything coming out together

01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:32.500
because there was such an urge
for showing such a big title,

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.230
when it was really impressive
what happened in any case,

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:38.550
they made that improvement--
the BICEP team made

01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:41.400
an improvement of an
order of magnitude,

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.760
compared to the constraints
that existed before.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.250
And that's already
for us, who work

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:51.160
in the field, something
incredible and worth

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.560
a title in the newspaper.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.590
- And I can just
very quickly mention

01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.780
that obviously I agree with
Cora and I can share maybe

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.750
the experience from our side.

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:06.350
What happened is that the press
conference and release was

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:09.920
after the paper had
been accepted by PRL,

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.500
so it had already been peer
reviewed by-- I cannot remember

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.370
or name our reviewers-- a lot.

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.185
And indeed, the reason
why was that the field

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:23.205
of gravitational waves
has a bumpy past.

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:26.967
There have been claims
in the 70s, maybe?

01:22:26.967 --> 01:22:27.800
Something like this?

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:27.985
- 60s.

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:28.540
- 60s.

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:34.290
Of detection and they
have not being replicated,

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:36.270
so they're probably not true.

01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:40.230
And obviously there's been
you know-- the BICEP papers.

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:43.660
So we wanted to be
extremely careful.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:47.430
And you know, so over the
last-- we made the discovery

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.940
in September, and
we announced it

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.060
in February, which means
that for five months,

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.900
we have become
very good at lying

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.865
to people like family friends.

01:22:56.865 --> 01:22:58.640
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.670
- Like a CIA agent
who comes home.

01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:04.210
OK, so why don't
we take a break.

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.470
We'll resume at 3:00.

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.020
[APPLAUSE]
