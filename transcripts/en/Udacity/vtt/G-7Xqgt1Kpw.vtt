00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.670
David, what do you think?

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; So the second goal is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.880
We're using the same proposition, but

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.020
here we're operating on the Ladder
instead of on the Ceiling.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.990
And then for

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.890
the goal state we're just going to link
the two together with a conjunction, so

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.080
we're saying that our goal state is
Painted(Ceiling) and Painted(Ladder).

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.680
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.540
Let's move on then.
