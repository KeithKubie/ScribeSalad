00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.290
&gt;&gt;Presenter: All right.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.830
Well, we're very pleased to have Dr. Oliver
Sacks with us today.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.309
Dr. Sacks is a physician and a professor of
neurology and psychology at the Columbia University

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.920
Center.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
He's also the author of more than ten books,
some of which I have here.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.070
So for example, we have The Man Who Mistook
His Wife for a Hat.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.070
Awakenings.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.070
Musicophilia.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.070
Seeing Voices.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.400
And the most recent one today that we're going
to talk about is The Mind's Eye.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.870
So please join me in welcoming Dr. Sacks.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.370
[Applause]

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.280
&gt;&gt; Presenter: What I wanted to do is to ask
you questions about one of the last chapters.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.940
It's 'persistence of vision' where you talk
about, you document your declining vision

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
in the right eye.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.351
And as some background, at one point you make
reference to Edwin Abbott's Flatland, where

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.329
you say that you experienced -- you mention
that you experience your own overwhelming

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.580
flatness and that you lost your fear of heights.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.780
So for those of you not familiar with Flatland,
can you describe what this life is like in

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.330
this fictional world and what resonated with
you about that?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: And this was a book which was
written in the 1880s.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:37.891
And the inhabits of Flatland live seemingly
happily on a surface but there have been some

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:46.619
strange phenomena occurring in which objects
or people seem to emerge and get larger and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.500
then disappear.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.860
And then theoreticians say there must be another
dimension.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.690
And although this seems very counterintuitive
to the people on Flatland.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.780
But I think you probably have to read the
book.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.639
I'm more conscious of my own Flatland than
that.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:18.049
By the way, I need to make an apology to all
of you because I'm not only blind in my right

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:27.480
eye, but as happens with people who are blind
in one eye, there is sort of a hemineglect.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.439
I have to remember that you are there.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:39.529
This hemineglect has caused many bizarre situations.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:45.209
So not only do I not see people -- say, get
into an elevator to my right, it doesn't occur

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.099
to me that anything would happen on my right.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.290
[laughter]

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.709
&gt;&gt; Presenter:So with respect to your losing
your fear of heights, there's an image.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.079
So immediately, I thought of this guy.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.579
Man on wire.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.290
And then the New York skyscraper scene.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.290
That one.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.969
And, for me, when I see that, I can't help
but feel queasy even though I know I'm not

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:12.969
sitting there.

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.269
It's two dimensional.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.590
And so, I have a couple of questions.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.359
One -- is it possible that people who can
perform under these conditions lack a sense

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.430
of depth.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I doubt it, because lacking
a sense of depth is somewhat disabling especially

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:43.879
in situations like this, I would think, would
be fatal.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:52.140
[laughter] But this lack of a sense of depth
is actually dangerous even for me, because

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.019
I am â€“ I can't see the depth of steps and
I can't see the depth of the podium.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.149
And I'm glad we are well on to it.

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.879
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So I don't have an explanation
for why I can't do that.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.049
But in any case, I'll just live with that.

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.459
I'll never go there.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I didn't like to look down at
all.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.950
And I mention you are surprised at the absence
of autonomic reaction -- of fear.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.360
But it seems to be so.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.851
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So you mentioned you can be in
Topanga Canyon where you look down, you would

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:34.590
feel, you had that fear at that time, right.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.930
When you would look down in the canyon but
now --

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Fear and thrill.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.390
And now that particular fear and thrill is
gone.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.000
I have other ones.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.590
&gt;&gt; Presenter: [chuckles] I'm just curious
also why it is that I would feel queasy looking

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.590
at this?

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.870
What's happening there?

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.820
Any ideas.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.250
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I'm not sure.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.630
I suspect that something to do with your semicircular
canals, but maybe it's just, you know, your

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.630
bringing up

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.690
&gt;&gt; Presenter:My what?

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.330
&gt;&gt;Dr. Sacks: Maybe it's just your upbringing.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.770
&gt;&gt; Presenter:Anybody else feel that?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.440
Or am I the only one?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.270
You're all safe.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.100
[chuckles] All right.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.410
So when you point out in your book that seeing
nothing on the right side which you've just

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.281
described now, you mention Federico the 15th
century Duke of Urbino, one of them, so I

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.630
thought of this guy who's about to appear.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.130
Turns out that's him isn't it?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.390
And so, I'm curious.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.680
Do you guys?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.199
Explain what this guy did.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, he lost one eye.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.800
And half -- nearly half of his visual field.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.840
And he felt this made him very vulnerable
to attack on the blind side.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:07.270
And so, he had his nose removed so that at
least something over here could be taken in

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.020
by the left eye.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.960
&gt;&gt; Presenter:And it worked.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: He wasn't, I think assassinated.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.690
[laughter]

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.160
&gt;&gt; Presenter:Okay, I guess that's evidence.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160
All right.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.880
That answers that question.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.470
Okay.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.320
So you mention that the only time you see
in stereo now is when you're dreaming.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.250
And you mention the Grand Canyon.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.520
And I find that when I stand on the rim of
the Grand Canyon, it looks flat to me.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.040
Do we have a Grand Canyon?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.600
And in fact, it feels like I'm in the museum
of natural history.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: One doesn't have stereo beyond
about 200 feet or so.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
&gt;&gt; Presenter:Okay.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Although you can get stereo
beyond 200 feet, if you use a hyper stereoscope.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.620
If you get a long cardboard tube and put in
oblique mirrors and then basically your eyes

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.930
are out here.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.960
And then you can expand the Grand Canyon.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.450
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So that's what I have to do next
time I go to the Grand Canyon.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.690
We have another real picture.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.700
There we go.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.040
All right.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.050
Moving right along.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.700
The last chapter, the Mind's Eye chapter,
where these are people you discuss -- you

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.730
describe people who become blind.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.200
And they range from people who can visualize
very well.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.440
And people who don't visualize.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.190
On the one hand, John Hull, who, I guess,
doesn't visualize whereas the other fellow,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.560
Zoltan Torey, can fix the roof on his house.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:55.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, this was a surprise to
me because I had seen a book by John Hull

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:02.430
as a book he dictated as he became blind in
his 40s.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:10.340
And he laments that after awhile, he can no
longer visualize or imagine the faces of his

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.580
wife or children.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.670
Even says he can't visualize a 3.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:24.270
He has to make it in the air and use a sort
of performance memory instead of iconic memory.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.770
And when I wrote about him, I assumed this
was true of all blind people.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.810
But I got many, sometimes outraged, letters
from blind people saying that they on the

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:43.169
contrary, despite having lost their sight
20 years earlier, still lived in a very visual

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.550
world and sometimes in a hyper visual world.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:54.020
And there is this paradoxical species of the
visual blind.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.360
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So there's no way of knowing
if Hull, for example, prior to becoming blind,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.510
was very good at visualizing or not to know
that then.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.110
Torey, wasn't he quite--.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.129
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: The other man was a very good
visualizer.

00:09:09.129 --> 00:09:17.540
His father was a film director and he would
always ask his son to visualize scenes.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:24.119
I am not sure about Torey's vision before.

00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:29.079
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Or Hull or Torey.

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:33.839
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I'm sorry, I mean Hull.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.839
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah.

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:44.069
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: And I don't know what determines
the sort of thing when Torey was -- as a young

00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:49.079
Hungarian who went to went to Australia and
was working in a chemical factory.

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:53.440
A vat of acid exploded in his face.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.410
And he couldn't speak for awhile.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.369
But he was then told forget vision.

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:03.810
Pay attention to your other senses.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.740
And he determined that he wouldn't but that
he would try to make a virtual reality of

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.740
sight.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.499
And he seems to have done so very successfully.

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:16.230
&gt;&gt; Presenter: And he really fixed his own
roof.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.690
&gt;&gt;Dr. Sacks: And he fixed his own roof one
night.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.139
And the neighbors were appalled.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:26.139
[laughter]

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:30.459
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: But he's fine at night.

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:33.790
Whereas other people are not.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.109
I'm going to add something.

00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:38.439
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Okay.

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:40.439
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Tantalizingly.

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:47.410
Beside the blind who lose imagery and the
blind who have very good imagery, there is

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.499
a third group.

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:53.080
And these are the blind who hallucinate.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.249
And something like 15 percent of people who
are blind have very vivid hallucinations.

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:05.069
These were described in the 18th century.

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:10.069
But however, that is the opening story of
my next book.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:13.180
&gt;&gt; Presenter:I was told not to ask about that.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.899
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Oh, I was wondering following along

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:19.279
on the vision part.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:24.829
Could you talk -- or do you know much about
those who are blindsided?

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:29.230
People whose visual processing isn't entirely
there but their eyes--

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.399
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks:Did you say blindsided or blind-sighted?

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.399
&gt;&gt; Male #1: S-I-G-H-T.

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.399
Blind sighted.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:41.009
I read about them previously and I also had
some questions

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:50.759
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Yeah, this is a fascinating
phenomenon when people who have no conscious

00:11:50.759 --> 00:12:00.050
vision may make correct guesses as to what's
happening around them.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.290
And this can be quite highly developed.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:12.180
And blind people with blind sight can be able
to weave their way through a series of obstructions.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:22.600
They seem to be equivalence to this with other
senses.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:30.209
Although deaf hearing doesn't have scan like
blind sight.

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:37.259
[laughter] But there's no reason why blind
sight should be limited to the blind.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:44.189
And we probably make use of all sorts of cues
and sub-cortical cues ourselves.

00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:48.529
&gt;&gt; Presenter: But you talk about an interesting
case.

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:52.119
Ben who used echo location to get around.

00:12:52.119 --> 00:12:54.009
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Oh yeah.

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:59.999
The blind people sometimes talk about facial
vision.

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:08.730
Although this is a misnomer, but this is judging
the distance and the size and shape of objects

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:19.339
through partly from face but partly from echoing
the -- interpreting the echoes of one's foot

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:21.809
falls or one's stick.

00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:29.930
But this boy, Ben, emitted a clicking sound
like a dolphin and became extraordinarily

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:30.930
expert.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.019
So much so that some people at school didn't
believe he was blind.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:42.629
He could jump onto a narrow pole and he would
even play chess.

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:43.689
And that is very amazing.

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:44.769
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Shoot baskets.

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:45.839
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Sorry.

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:46.919
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Shoot baskets.

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:47.999
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Yeah.

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:53.899
There is a YouTube of him.

00:13:53.899 --> 00:14:00.110
Sadly he died when he was 15 or 16 from the
same malignant tumor he was born with.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:08.149
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Following up do you know if those
who are blind-sighted are able to react very

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:09.149
quickly.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:12.440
So if you tossed a ball to them, would they
be able to catch it.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.579
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I can't give you a clear answer.

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.670
I think it might be something there.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:28.489
The limit of ability is -- but perhaps I can
-- I'm full of irrelevancies may take off

00:14:28.489 --> 00:14:29.489
in directions.

00:14:29.489 --> 00:14:30.889
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's okay.

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:36.880
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: But there's another sort of
blind person who can catch a ball.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:48.839
And this is someone who is -- in whom the
input from a video camera will go to a 10

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:53.319
by 10 grid of electrodes on the tongue.

00:14:53.319 --> 00:15:02.939
And the tongue seems to be the most sensitive
for this . And so first one then has sort

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:05.019
of tongue vision.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:09.300
Or you can tongue space an object around you.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.029
And this then becomes as if visual.

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:19.820
And purely visual things like zooming and
looming and turning and perspective.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:27.499
And one could probably do a good deal better
with anatomically there's no reason why one

00:15:27.499 --> 00:15:30.420
should have 1,000 electrodes on the tongue.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.910
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Go ahead.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.799
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So one common thread through a
lot of your writing is the really amazing

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:46.379
ability of people to adapt to disabilities.

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:53.230
I was just wondering in your experience are
there particular traits -- or characteristics

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:59.050
of people that make them better or worse able
to adapt to these sorts of things.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:06.589
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, there's adaptation at
every level.

00:16:06.589 --> 00:16:11.089
And all sorts of adaptations are quite automatic.

00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:19.509
I mean, to give you a non-neurological example.

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:28.559
At one time it would be found that if elderly
people might have a rather slow pulse.

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:32.509
And you would give them thyroid to make the
pulse quicker.

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:36.230
But that would drive them to heart failure
or worse.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:48.310
One realizes the slow pulse is an adaptation
to being old and having less cardiac reserve.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:54.470
The adaptation.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:01.610
The people who survived concentration camps,
to go to the other extreme, tended to have

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:07.400
firm but quiet faith like Quakers.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:20.180
But in general, I think it may just depend
on one's openness as an individual.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.950
And also trying to do things.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.530
For example, I was a stereo buff.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:31.700
An ardent member of the New York Stereoscopic
Society before this happened.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:39.270
Like many people there I think I depended
excessively and sometimes almost exclusively

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.030
on binocular cues.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.440
And now I've lost that.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:49.710
I have to learn to do better with monocular
cuings.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.010
I'm not doing as well as I should.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.410
That's partly because I'm old.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:01.940
But in fact adaptation and learning continue
till the moment of death.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.620
You may never know -- I'm sorry I'm going
to jump ahead.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:13.430
Yeah, I'll mention the tongue again.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:21.250
One of the people I describe in the book is
a novelist; a very good crime novelist who

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:27.020
came down to breakfast one morning then went
out to get the paper, the Toronto Globe and

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.400
Star, and found that unintelligible.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:38.010
It seemed to be written in some peculiar language
which he compared to Korean and to Serb or

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.010
Croat.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.130
To something.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.770
This was devastating for him.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.920
He was able to write.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:53.530
People who have this sort of Alexia can write
freely, but they can't read what they've written.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:19:01.160
But after a month or so, he found he could
very slowly read handwriting.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.820
In fact handwriting rather better than printing.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:10.440
And he thought he was getting better, but
when he was tested, there was zero neurological

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.640
recovery.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:20.150
But what was going on, what started with the
finger, he was involuntarily unconsciously

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:26.810
copying the shape of letters with his tongue
on the back of his teeth or the roof of his

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.810
mouth.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.710
So he was reading by tongue writing.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.870
So the tongue is useful.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.870
[laughter]

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: There are a lot of stories about
the tongue.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:45.050
When I wrote a visual book, I didn't expect
the tongue to come in twice both as a sensory

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.560
organ and as a modal organ.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:54.610
I don't know if you've seen maps of how the
human body is represented in the brain.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:20:01.140
But there's a thing called the sensory homunculus
which has an enormous tongue in hand.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.660
The motor homunculus; the similar.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.660
I'm sorry.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.440
I'm getting away completely.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.380
&gt;&gt; Presenter: No, this is what this is about.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.440
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Still on the topic of vision and
adaptation.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Yeah.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.560
&gt;&gt; Male #3: I remember one of the patients
from an Anthropologist on Mars, where somebody

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.630
who had lost their vision at a very, very
young age.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.950
And then it was repaired.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.960
I wonder if the person was an adult.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:36.110
And I think they were having trouble redeveloping
the part of the mind that processes vision.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:41.630
So I was wondering, what do we know about
our ability to learn things that we would

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.310
have learned normally at a very young age.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:49.600
Is the adult brain generally able to recover
some of those functions?

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.610
Or adapt in a totally different way to get
same functionality or how does that work.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:00.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, sort of notions of an
optimal age and a critical age and a small

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480
window.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:07.380
I've lost a little bit of their strength.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:18.770
Now in fact someone who you know, there are
a number of language-less, deaf people who

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:23.620
have never been exposed to formal sign language.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:29.360
And who just develop a repertoire of few gestures
or home sign.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:38.290
A friend and colleague of mine, and now of
yours, wrote me some years ago about a 27-year-old

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.880
man and his acquisition of language.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:52.250
And it was all very puzzling and sort of Noam
Chomsky-like, but the notion of this is being

00:21:52.250 --> 00:22:02.020
extended.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:12.840
With the particular man you refer to, sight
was probably poorish when he was born.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.110
And nonexistent after a few months.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:29.720
And when he was given sight at the age of
50, he couldn't make anything of it.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:40.910
When they sort of took the bandages off and
he seemed to be staring vacantly.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:50.620
And it wasn't until the surgeons said, "well",
then he slowly homed in because he knew that

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.580
voices come from faces.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:23:06.600
But in that time, all he could see were variously
pink surfaces and some movement.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.650
He thought "is this seeing?"

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.680
He hadn't learned to see.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.730
He hadn't learned to recognize.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:22.120
Normally one does in the first weeks and months
of one's life.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.860
Sight is correlated with other senses.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:31.490
In fact, he did very badly.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:42.360
And it was a relief to him -- although regarded
as a tragedy by others--, when he then lost

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.630
his sight again.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:52.179
But others can adapt pretty well.

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:58.410
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So there are other cases of people
who've successfully relearned to see when

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:03.900
the physical repair occurred do you know.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:11.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: There are now some better cases
and things don't look as hopeless as they

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.450
did.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:18.680
Although all sorts of other things.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.320
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Inspired by a father in one
of your books who said of his daughter -- autistic

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.380
daughter I believe -- she loves us as much
as she can.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.780
Would you define quote unquote 'human' by
more intellectual characteristics or emotional

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.780
ones?

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.820
Which aspect do we more tightly identify with?

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.270
This is not my question.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.790
This is a Googler question.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:51.610
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Oh, I see.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:56.090
Emotion is certainly crucial for bonding.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:03.220
And bonding is crucial for becoming human.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:13.830
The people who have children with Down's syndrome
find no difficultly; can adore their children

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.470
and be adored by them.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:22.150
There's an emotional fullness even though
there is fairly severe intellectual limitations.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:34.020
With this young autistic girl, it was the
other way around.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:48.450
But [pause] There is no one on the planet
-- there's no human being on the planet at

00:25:48.450 --> 00:26:00.550
the moment who hasn't -- yeah, the human beings
who are furthest from the criteria of being

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:10.380
human are feral children who've been put out
in the forest that have somehow survived whether

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.550
they're nurtured by wolves like Mowgli or
whatever.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.550
I don't know.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:21.200
But people like this have no language.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:29.500
Apparently no capacity for getting language.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.190
And severe intellectual limitations.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:39.330
And I think they are -- there's a clumsy way
of saying that a huge amount of being human

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.170
depends on culture.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:52.580
You can't have a human being without culture
whereas I think you can have a cat without

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.640
culture.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.000
[laughter] And maybe an ape.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.780
Although there is obviously some degree of
culture and training occurs.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:09.030
I think I would define human beings in terms
of self-consciousness.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:14.530
Consciousness of themselves as a distinct
person.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:22.350
And of having a life and of looking back on
the life and anticipating death.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.019
I don't know whether other animals anticipate
death.

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:29.870
&gt;&gt; Presenter:There's something -- you just
made me think of this, so now I'm going to

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:30.870
read this.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:36.680
The very end of the book, you write the following
"language, that most human invention can enable

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.920
what, in principle, should not be possible.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:45.150
It can allow all of us, even congenitally
blind, see with another person's eyes."

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.600
So somehow I thought of that as you were speaking.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.900
That it's -- you don't exist in isolation,
but you're actually experiencing -- you can

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.550
experience through others.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Yeah.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:03.370
Well certainly Helen Keller's autobiography
is full of vivid as if visual and auditory

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.370
descriptions.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.370
And.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:14.140
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Is 
this another thing that kind of makes us human?

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.940
It's the cultural but it's the language.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:26.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Oh, absolutely.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.530
And also gesture.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:35.580
The apes gesture a little, but only very little.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:43.410
And gesture and music and language are almost
exclusively human.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.210
&gt;&gt; Presenter:That's interesting because one
of the first things Ildefonso, who was Susan

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:53.050
Schaller's subject, 27-year-old who was deaf
and didn't learn until she worked extensively

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.850
with him to help him get the concept of naming.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:01.800
I guess the word cat was the first word he
learned that he was naming something.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.120
That he immediately started pointing, gesturing.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.080
Which struck me as something like you said
apes don't do.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.810
But even almost just at the cusp of linguistic
behavior.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.590
He was pointing.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:26.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: The Merlin Donald who was a
remarkable psychologist -- there was a whole

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:35.740
cognitive cultural stage which he calls Mimetic.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:42.510
And we still have this although we've now
gone onto -- he speaks of ape culture as episodic

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:47.060
and then mimetic and then our culture as partly
theoretic.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.860
But it's highly mimetic as well.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:58.330
And one of the stories I tell in here is an
intelligent woman who became severely aphasic

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:04.490
and lost the use of expressive language and
wasn't very good at understanding language.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:13.120
But she became a sort of genius of gesture,
both of understanding people's gestures and

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.250
expressions and her own.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:21.960
Assisted by a wordless, she couldn't get a
sentence but she could get various words.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:33.340
But it's incredible how much and also can
be conveyed by mimesis.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:39.390
But also how little you can't make a proposition.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:45.400
It's difficult to say the cat is on the mat
or let alone anything more complex.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.360
&gt;&gt; Male #4:Yeah, I'm curious.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.440
Given what you've learned and potentially
what you would like to learn, what could we

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.240
do to make Google more useful to you.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:17.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, I love receiving letters
from people telling me of their situations.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:24.500
This sometimes becomes overwhelming and my
assistant Haylie, and Kate who is with me,

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.700
sort of have to sort these out.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:39.860
But -- is that -- but can you -- I'm sorry
can you clarify for me the sort of help you

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.450
have in mind.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:47.520
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Actually, sort of imagine that
you are in charge of Google engineering, what

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.420
would you have us build?

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.080
What would you have us change?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.940
If you were in charge.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:32:00.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, I'm afraid I don't know
very much about Google engineering.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:09.290
[laughter] You know, I'm a creature who still
uses a fountain pen and a two finger typewriter.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:16.710
I'm not -- although you're the search engine,
aren't you.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:21.210
&gt;&gt; Male #4: We do a bit of that [laughter]
.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:27.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: You would have to tell me more
about Google that I might be able to answer

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.630
your question.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.390
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Another time.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.390
Thank you.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Okay.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.070
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Sorry.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.140
This question is about adaptations again.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.270
So there's ones that are taught, like the
tongue electrode example.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.270
Then there's ones.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.200
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Sorry, a bit slower.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.340
&gt;&gt; Female #2: So there are adaptations that
are taught like the tongue electrode example

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.340
with the mapping.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.150
And then, there are ones that people come
up with automatically.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:59.620
So between those two in your experience does
one work better than the other usually?

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.430
And are there ones universal enough that we
can learn something from that to guide the

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.690
neuroplasticity -- basically teach them better.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: yeah.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:26.000
Well, certainly the automatic ones are the
first two to alter the brain either by activating

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:38.990
latent or dormant connections and perhaps
later by major changes.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:44.310
But all learning alters the brain, whether
it's automatic or not.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.560
I may have missed part of your question, I'm
sorry.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.710
&gt;&gt; Female #2: No, I was just wondering if
there's something that's universal about the

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:57.770
automatic adaptations that people do that
we could learn something from that to teach

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.450
it better.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:09.320
&gt;&gt;Presenter: To teach it better -- to teach
it better.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:20.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I'm not quite sure how -- I
mean, let me be specific.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:27.190
If you reduce to monocularity, you will start
to deal with monocular clues like perspective

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:33.400
and occlusion better.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.760
But this also needs to be taught to some extent.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.980
And I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure how to deal
with the question.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.169
I'm probably averting it.

00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:47.970
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Thank you.

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:55.069
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Some years ago there was a fellow
who put together a belt made out of pagers.

00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:56.349
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: What.

00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:59.920
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Pagers -- you know those little
things that buzz when you get a phone call.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Yeah, I've heard of them.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920
[laughter]

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.470
&gt;&gt; Male #5: And the one that was facing north
would buzz.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.440
And he said after awhile he gave himself an
inherent compass.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.160
The sense of north and south.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.670
That when he took it off, he became disoriented
and so forth.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:23.020
A lot of what you talked about -- the majority
of what you talked about is how to cope with

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.570
some form of pathology.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:31.800
But, you know, we've seen that in some ways
it's possible to -- that these systems of

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.660
adaptations also work in healthy people.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.900
That you can in a way manufacture new senses.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.440
Do you see this as being useful.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:47.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Although I don't mention it
in the book it happens that Stereo-Sue whose

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:56.090
husband was an astronaut and who herself lacks
any sense of direction.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:06.010
But she is much helped by a magnetic hat,
which her husband designed which emits a beep

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.450
when she is facing north.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:15.270
And this is -- when she wears this, she gets
a feeling of a magnetic field.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:27.370
She feels she's almost as good as an insect
or a bird with magnetite globules in the brain.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:33.500
But when she takes the hat off, I don't think
there's any residue.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.279
&gt;&gt; Presenter: There's a great video on YouTube
where she described -- she puts a hat.

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:38.279
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Oh, really?

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.279
I didn't know that.

00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:44.140
She's getting around [laughter] I will speak
to her about that.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.790
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It's that hat [laughter]

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:57.260
&gt;&gt;Dr. Sacks: I had an experience which startled
me some years ago when I -- I'm very fond

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.000
of the powerful rare earth magnets.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.110
And I had a whole pocket full of them.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:09.070
And as you know they tend to align themselves
with the earth's magnetic field.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.400
And I was walking.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.280
And as I turned around the corner, I felt
a shifting in my pocket.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.080
You know, as if it was an animal there.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:25.930
And I then wondered about perhaps putting
things on the rim of one's glasses or one's

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.950
ears.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:35.000
New senses.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.810
Would you like some new senses?

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:37.810
[laughter] .

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.100
&gt;&gt;Male #6: It couldn't hurt.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, that's the question.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.860
[laughter]

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:56.120
Now, with a friend and colleague of mine who
was congenitally totally color blind, but

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:03.540
intrigued by the -- by what color seemed to
mean for the rest of us.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:10.060
I once asked him -- in fact, several times,
I said, "if it were possible -- if we could

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.260
give you color -- would you like it?"

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.160
And he said, "no."

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:25.240
He said because he has constructed -- his
brain had constructed -- a complete world

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:32.619
in terms of luminosity and outline and texture
and movement and depth.

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:34.369
And color would have no meaning.

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:35.921
And it would confuse him.

00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:39.390
And then, I asked my question again.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.800
And he turned on me and he said, "would you
like x-ray vision?"

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:50.940
And I thought and shuddered a bit and said,
"no, I'm okay as I am."

00:38:50.940 --> 00:39:04.070
And he said, "so am I." [laughter] But nonetheless,
if I could optionally have some senses.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:13.831
A friend of mine who was born with cataracts
and had them operated on fairly young, but

00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:15.550
he doesn't have implanted lenses.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.350
He has these old fashioned very thick glasses.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:23.980
He once told me he could see a little way
into the ultraviolet.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:30.450
And in particular he could see the honey guides
on flowers which bees use.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:35.950
And I said, "what's ultra violet like?"

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.010
Salivating.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:43.830
And he said he could no more tell me than
I could tell him what stereoscopy was like

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.280
which he doesn't have.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.850
This by way of saying there's an infinite
gulf between experience and description.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.430
But what senses would you like?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:00.270
I mean, maybe Google could help.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.180
[laughter] .

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:07.100
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So do we have time for one more
question?

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.240
One more question?

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.460
Okay, apologies to.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.490
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Given the nature of your work.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.800
You've dealt with people who have senses then
lost them or-them then gained them think in

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.859
different ways adapt and cope.

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:26.589
How has that affected the way you view your
humanity, your senses, your capabilities.

00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:28.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Sorry.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.960
&gt;&gt; Male #7: How was your experience with dealing
with these people who have different capabilities

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.000
affected how you personally look at your own
capabilities.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.160
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: I'm still missing things.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.490
Are you saying how is my coping compared to
theirs.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:50.130
&gt;&gt; Male #7: How do you view yourself differently.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:55.930
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Given your experience with these
other people -- am I saying that.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:07.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Well, I think often I would
hope that if what has happened to them, then

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.820
happened to me, I would do as well as they.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:19.530
I've -- I mean, one of the reasons I've given
my own case history in the book as well as

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:23.570
others was partly to compare things.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:36.100
But I think what I want to say is that coping
strategies should be shared and broadcast.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:45.430
For example, one of my stories is about face
blindness or difficulty recognizing faces.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.530
Which I have fairly severely.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.210
Some people have overwhelmingly.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:55.990
Others may have it quite severely but not
even know it because they have so automatically

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:04.240
used other cues of voice and dress and posture
and context.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.550
But strategies for dealing with face blindness
should be widely known.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.560
And is that?

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.930
That's not the sort of thing Google does.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:15.930
No.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:16.930
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Actually.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:29.750
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Dr. Sacks: and so, I -- you know, all culture

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.730
and civilization depends on bottling and learning
and sharing.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:37.990
And I think this needs to be so far adaptations.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:43.050
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Well, on that note, thank you
very much for coming to Google.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.050
[Applause].

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.055
&gt;&gt; Dr. Sacks: Thank you
[applause]
