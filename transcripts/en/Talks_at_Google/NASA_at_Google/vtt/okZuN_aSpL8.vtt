CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.270
My name is Chris DiBona.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.710
I look after stuff here
at Google sometimes.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.090
And one of things I look
after is open source, and also

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.450
a little bit of our
relationship with NASA,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.040
specifically over at Ames.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.330
And when this talk
was proposed--

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.940
and I was just
saying this to Jay--

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.640
it's almost like it's a dog
whistle that is like, OK, so

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.700
open source mission
control for Chrome.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.520
So space, open source, Google.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.290
So this is a really
well-suited talk.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.623
I was wondering if he could
work Android into it somehow

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:37.040
or something like Kubernetes.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.780
But anyway, the
long and short of it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.876
is, Jay is here from Ames
to talk about his project.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.130
JAY TRIMBLE: So, I like
to be very interactive.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.260
If you guys have questions,
please just go ahead and ask.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.730
If you look at that topic list--
open source, mission control,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.790
Chrome-- any one of those
could probably be its own talk.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.620
So I try to get enough in there
to at least seed the questions,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.069
and we'll go from there.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.319
I like to start with this,
because I think when people

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.693
think of NASA,
they usually think

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:08.325
of Cape Canaveral or maybe
Mission Control Houston.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:09.950
You guys are down
the street from Ames,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.410
so you know about us.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.890
And of course, there's JPL.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.200
But there's really a lot of
NASA all over the country,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.116
so I like to start with
this, just give people

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:20.300
a little bit of perspective
of what the centers are

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.640
and what the
geography looks like.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.880
So the mission control,
obviously, is for missions.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.650
And what are we doing
with these missions?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.470
We have a lot of discussions
about human missions.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.220
We used to call it
manned space flight,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.450
but we don't do that anymore.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.020
We call it human space flight
versus robotic space flight.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.130
And how do we experience this?

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.810
I just want as
background for this talk

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.185
to think a little
bit about that.

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.540
What is the mission experience?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.610
If a person flies in
space and it's not you,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580
does that really enhance
your experience of it?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.163
Maybe it does.

00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:56.450
Maybe you can
vicariously enjoy that.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.486
Versus a robot, which I think
is a little bit less personal.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.110
On the other hand, the pictures
don't really look any different

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.290
whether they are from
a robot or a human.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.539
And of course, robots we
can get much further out

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.840
that we can get people,
at much lower costs.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.340
So I think there's
going to continue

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.880
to be a balance between
these mission types.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.030
As far as mission
control goes, I just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.310
wanted to get across the
idea of one-way light time

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.650
and round-trip light time,
because it completely

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.460
bounds and affects
how we operate.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.722
So if you look at the
moon, round-trip light time

00:02:29.722 --> 00:02:31.680
from the moon, that's
only a couple of seconds.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.580
But you add the latency in for
the communications overhead,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.660
and you're probably looking
at six seconds, maybe

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.280
10 seconds, maybe 25 seconds.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.892
It's not long.

00:02:41.892 --> 00:02:44.100
But if you're trying to
joystick a rover on the moon,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.240
for example, that can
actually be a very long time.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.130
If you're out at
Mars where you're

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.130
looking at 20 minute, 48
minute round-trip light time,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.450
the idea of any kind of real
time command and control

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.960
just goes out the window.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.260
So all the films you may have
seen of Apollo and the ground

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.380
control interactions
with the crew,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.460
that all goes away at Mars.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.280
By the time you get to Saturn
and further out, forget it.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920
I worked Voyager Neptune.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.160
I think we had a four
hour one-way light time.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.940
So by the time we
send a command,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.660
it was eight hours before
we knew what happened.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.510
So that really
impacts, obviously,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.640
the design of how we do
missions and what we do where.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.600
So for crude missions,
we really have never

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.460
gone past the moon in most
of you guys' lifetime.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.870
And from the time
I was a little kid,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.380
we haven't been out
of low Earth orbit.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.210
So you really do have real
time communication there,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.790
and you can decide how
to allocate the jobs.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.494
So what would you think?

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:42.910
Do you want to do
it all in orbit?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.240
That would be the
airplane model, right?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.823
You look at the space shuttle,
and you think about an airplane

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:50.269
cockpit, and you're
doing everything onboard.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.810
But if you look at
the space station,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.393
a lot of the space
station is actually

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:56.510
flown from the ground, which
may be counter-intuitive.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.170
But we get into
questions like, what

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.580
is the value of astronaut time?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.390
What can we do most
effectively where?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.140
I see somebody looking
puzzled back there.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.962
So anyway, feel
free to interrupt me

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:06.920
if you have a question.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.240
The basic things we do
in mission control--

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.731
and you guys-- have you
seen mission control on TV?

00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:13.230
When I say "mission
control," do you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.750
have an image in your mind
of what one of these rooms

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.410
looks like, maybe a
sense of what we do?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.240
So a lot of it is system
health and status.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.230
You can think of plumbers,
electricians, life support,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.105
all the people who just
have to be the eyes

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.230
and ears of the crew,
because you've got more data,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.420
you've got bigger screens.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.545
Think of the space station.

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.654
I think it has
160,000 parameters.

00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:37.320
Pretty hard for a
couple of crew members

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.440
to monitor 160,000
parameters, or even

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.840
a bunch of people on the ground.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.770
Planning-- what are
you going to do?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.930
You've got this incredibly
high-value time.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.640
You've either got a crew or
you've got a robotic asset.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.160
What am I doing with that time?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.460
Trajectory, which is where am
I, or where am I on the surface?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.720
And authority-- who's in charge?

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.140
Listen to a tape of
the moon landing,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.150
and listen to
those interchanges.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.810
And the ground could
have called an abort.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.310
You wonder.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.530
And then read what
the astronauts

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.029
said about what
they would have done

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.430
in some of these instances,
and it gets very interesting.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.720
But I think one of the
things with authority

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.830
comes down to how
much you can see.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.360
And we simply can see
more on the ground

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.980
than a crew can see, obviously--
bigger displays, more

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.530
data, more eyes and ears.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.500
OK.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.811
And conceptually, this is
how we do it for robots.

00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:27.310
So my first thought
was, well, I was

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.685
going to put all
from the ground,

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.090
but then there is this
sense of autonomy.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.930
We tend to be, I think,
stingy and conservative

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.990
when it comes to autonomy,
probably with good reason.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.086
Because when you get an asset
up on Mars, for example,

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:42.210
you're just going to be
very conservative about how

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.700
you operate it,
at least at first.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.850
So really, everything--
obviously, all the authority,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.960
command, and control is
done from the ground.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.850
There is no crew when you're
talking about a robot.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.840
So this is-- did you
guys recognize this?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080
This is the iconic mission
control from Apollo.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.910
I'm going to talk a little bit
about what those consoles do

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.620
versus how we do it
now in a later slide.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.450
That's the newer version
of the same control center.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.960
That's after Mars Science lab.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.320
Now, why is everybody
jumping up and down here,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.130
and nobody's jumping
up and down here?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.060
Now, I've read
things in the media

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.150
that would lead you
to believe that it's

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.020
just because these guys over
here are boring, and staid,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.387
and old school, and these guys
over here are modern and cool,

00:06:25.387 --> 00:06:27.720
and they're going to celebrate,
and they're much looser,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.162
and they're wearing polo
shirts, whereas these guys are

00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:31.120
wearing suits and ties.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.480
This is where I
started, by the way.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.480
So I've been one of those
guys once upon a time,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.694
wearing that coat and tie.

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:37.610
I don't actually think
that's the main reason.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.080
I think it gets back to
my earlier slide, which

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.800
is one-way light time.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.880
So here, you've got real
time command and control.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.930
You are watching things.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.140
What you do has an
immediate impact.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.359
Here, anything
you do, you're not

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:53.150
going to know what
happened for 20 minutes.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.040
You've got a little bit
more room for celebration.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.520
And part of it
could be cultural.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.978
I'm just saying,
technically, there

00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:01.630
are reasons why you will see
people acting differently

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.770
in different contexts like that.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.720
This is a science room.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.180
I took this picture.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.690
I think it was 2004, just before
the first Mars Exploration

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.390
Rover landing.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.690
Incredibly exciting.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.830
That's the engineering side for
the Mars Exploration rovers.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.890
That's the science side.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.530
I wanted to throw in one
from down the street.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.527
That was for [? Laddie. ?] And
when we say "mission control--"

00:07:23.527 --> 00:07:25.610
though I'm going to talk
a lot about this version,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.130
because I've worked
more in there

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.600
than I have in the
others-- mission control

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.905
takes a lot of different
forms, and has been evolving,

00:07:31.905 --> 00:07:35.010
and is going to continue
evolve how we do it.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.170
So I wanted to have
a little bit of fun.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.820
Because when I was a kid in
a summer intern in mission

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.020
control for the first
time, all of a sudden,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.310
I watched a "Star Trek"
episode, and in my mind,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.870
I started mapping who the
characters were to the mission

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.670
control positions.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.515
So I won't tell
you which version

00:07:53.515 --> 00:07:55.390
of "Star Trek" that was,
but I'll tell you it

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.780
wasn't any of the newer ones.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.660
That was a while ago.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.680
So we have a flight
director, call sign flight.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.680
And that clearly is the captain.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.070
And then we have
systems positions

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.400
who are responsible for
all the engineering.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.719
That would be Mr. Scott if
you're in the old "Star Trek."

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:15.760
In the newer ones, I'm
going to lose my way here.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.850
I think it was Geordi in
"The Next Generation."

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.020
I don't remember who it was for
"Voyager" or "Deep Space Nine."

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.160
You guys can help
me out with that.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.320
And the navigation, that
was Chekov, where are we?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.510
We have trajectory.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.960
It's called Fido,
Flight Dynamics.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.280
And then payloads-- and a POCC
is Payload Operations Control

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.080
Center.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.120
That tends to be
where the science is.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.881
We've got a lot of scientists
in back rooms doing science,

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.630
interfacing with the
flight control teams.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.990
So that would be Spock.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.680
That would be the
front room position.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.580
And then InCO for the shuttle
was Integrated Communications

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.442
Officer, and that
would be Uhura.

00:08:53.442 --> 00:08:54.900
And you guys can
help me out if you

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.270
want to get to some of
the newer "Star Treks."

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.010
I'm dating myself
here, I admit it.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.630
So I want to just go through
a couple of calls from mission

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.250
control so you get a
better sense of how

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.814
all these positions
operate together.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:09.480

00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:26.644
JAY TRIMBLE: Does anybody
recognize any of those voices?

00:09:26.644 --> 00:09:27.890
Any space historians in here?

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.170
The flight director
was Gene Kranz.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.577
Anybody who's seen Apollo
13 probably-- yeah.

00:09:35.577 --> 00:09:37.160
And then the Cap Com
was Charlie Duke.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.451
And of course, that was Buzz
Aldrin in the lunar module

00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:40.945
while Neil Armstrong was flying.

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:42.320
The point I want
to make here is,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.960
that was simply a nominal
set of status calls.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.690
You have these pre-defined
points where the flight

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.460
director is going
to give a go, no go,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.870
and then all positions
respond, hopefully, go.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.800
And they're very high adrenaline
and very exciting, real time.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.300
And you can only
do that when you're

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.829
close enough to Earth for
that to be meaningful.

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:02.870
And by the time you get
to Mars, a call like that

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.600
will be very different.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.640
So that was a nominal.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.740
Let's look at an anomaly.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.960

[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.040
JAY TRIMBLE: To me
personally, this

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.500
is probably my favorite call
in mission control history.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.804
I think they were
about 10,000 feet

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:26.970
off the surface of the moon.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.160
I could be wrong.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.060
And there were a series of
computer program alarms,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.770
meaning the commuter
was just overloaded.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.390
It was getting
information faster

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.770
than they could handle it.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.680
But picture Neil Armstrong
flying this thing.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.940
We've never landed
on the moon before.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.664
10,000 feet.

00:10:42.664 --> 00:10:43.830
I hope I'm right about that.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.050
It could have been higher.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.200
And these alarms are coming in.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.740
And mission control
is looking at them,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.281
and you're going to give a go,
no go call to land on the moon

00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:53.340
or not for the first time ever.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.280
You hear a go, and that's
from the front room position.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.520
I believe that was Steve Bales,
probably DPS, data processing,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.770
and probably three folks in
the back room backing him up.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.920
So these guys in the
front room you see,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.470
they have more eyes and
ears than the back room.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.790
I believe they had trained
to some of this, thank god,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.831
so they were able to make
that call very quickly.

00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:16.140
To me, what a position to be in.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.150
As a flight controller,
I'd have given anything

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.554
to be in a position to
make a call like that.

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:21.970
And of course,
those opportunities

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.750
just don't come
along very often.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.730
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.460
-OK, Houston, we've
had a problem here.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.227
-Flight guidance.

00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:31.810
-Go, guidance.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.070
-We've had a hardware restart.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.920
I don't know what it was.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.788
-Houston, we've had a problem.

00:11:36.788 --> 00:11:39.123
We've had a main B bus interval.

00:11:39.123 --> 00:11:41.620
-You see an AC bus
undervolt there, guidance?

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.630
Or Ecom?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.400
-Negative, flight.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.620
-I believe the crew reported it.

-We've got a main B undervolt.

00:11:47.927 --> 00:11:49.760
-We may have had an
instrumentation problem,

[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:52.600
JAY TRIMBLE: So in
a case like that,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.090
you are getting-- you are
on these little monochrome

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.760
displays-- and I'm going to
show you an example of what

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.510
these things look like-- and
you have a set of numbers,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.510
and you know what they're
supposed to look like,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.114
and they are going crazy
all over the place.

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:07.780
And the flight
controllers on the ground

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.200
have to put this puzzle together
and figure out what's going on.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.220
It is not like
"Star Trek," where

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.120
Mr. Spock looks into his little
sensor and the light shines out

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.500
and he says, this is exactly
what's going on, Captain.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.640
It is not like that.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.810
And you're dealing with
engineering schematics

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.230
and sensors and trying to
piece all this puzzle together

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.710
to figure out what that means.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.180
And on Apollo 13, that was a--

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.000

[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:42.132 --> 00:12:44.340
JAY TRIMBLE: So a little
background on that, and then

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.950
I'm going to-- this is
the last tape I have.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.886
Space shuttle asset, Challenger,
ATO is Abort To Orbit.

00:12:51.886 --> 00:12:53.680
A main engine had shut down.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.940
So three main engines, one
of them has just shut down.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.410
Why has it shut down?

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.060
That's question number one.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.060
What do you do about it?

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.840
So you heard the call.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.298
Fido in there--
and I had mentioned

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:04.600
Fido-- that's flight dynamics.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.900
So where are we?

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.870
What's our speed?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:07.790
Where can we go?

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.600
So they had an Abort
To Orbit option

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.740
on two engines, which they took.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.130
Turned out the
engine had shut down

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.460
because of a sensor problem.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.970
There was actually nothing
wrong with the engine.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.260
There was also a sensor
problem in another engine.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.760
And if they had
lost two engines,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.320
it would have been real trouble.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.630
So Booster-- and I think
that was Jenny Howard-- made

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.080
what I think was a very
gutsy and exciting call

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.940
to inhibit those sensors,
meaning if something really

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.170
went wrong, you wouldn't have
had the benefit of the sensors

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.260
to shut that engine down.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.300
So there's risk
involved in that.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.200
She made that call.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.860
The flight director says, main
engine, limits to inhibit,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.120
tells the crew to do
an abort to orbit.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.490
And they get into a lower,
but still functional, orbit,

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.210
and had a successful mission.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.750
So those are
examples of the kinds

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.280
of things you can do in
real time mission control.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.490
And it can be very cool stuff.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.850
And those are highlight films.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.620
Every day is not
a highlight film.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.620
Sometimes, it's just the
regular day-to-day stuff.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.380
But there are exciting moments.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.700
So the consoles-- and you guys
are all into technology, right?

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.700
So I thought you might
find a little interesting

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.860
what all these things do.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.100
If you ever watched
and old Apollo tape,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.550
these lights are
always flashing.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.832
I was this little kid
wondering what in the world

00:14:17.832 --> 00:14:19.790
those lights were doing,
what the flashing was.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.930
I know most of you
guys weren't born,

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.970
but I was a little
kid at the time.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.550
OK.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.770
So this is the old mission
control, the iconic mission

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.950
control.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.660
Monochrome displays
talking to IBM mainframes.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.520
No such thing as a
personal computer.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.600
It wasn't even a glint
in anybody's eye.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.890
These are for communications,
as in you hear people talking.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.900
And by these buttons, you can
configure who you listen to

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.360
and who you talk to.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.670
So the yellow lights,
which are dimmer,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.030
are who you're listening to.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.555
The flashing white light
is who you can talk to.

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:56.930
And then there are blue lights,
which could be either or.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.810
These are hard key sets,
tactile feel-- pretty cool.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.900
Audible click when you
hit one of those buttons.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.990
And when I was a college
student at Houston,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.900
these were the consoles we used.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.800
From Apollo to the shuttle,
they hadn't upgraded yet.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.030
So this was the
stuff I trained on.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.570
Though I will say I
did not train on that,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.026
and I have no idea
what those are.

00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:20.900
And I've asked several
colleagues at Houston,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.410
and nobody knows what those are.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:27.110
So if any of you
guys know, tell me.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.660
I'm going to do a closeup and
get into these displays later,

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.250
so I won't get into
that in detail.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.250
Up here are what we call
the digital display drivers

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.530
or event lights.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.630
Think of a plastic overlay
put in, and a bunch of lights

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.060
behind, and you
program these lights.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.550
And they're just binary.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.200
They're either on
or off, and you just

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.550
program them with
discrete values.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.380
Very simple, yet they worked.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.190
So I remember my first set of
displays in mission control.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.940
Once you did these things,
you couldn't change them.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.040
And I got very
clear instructions

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.900
the first time I did
this from my lead.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.060
He said, I'm not going to watch
over you while you do this.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.540
They have to be right.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.870
If anything's wrong, after they
hang me, I'm going to kill you.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.990
And that was the only-- so
anyway-- and the result of that

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.744
is, you put an
astronomical amount of time

00:16:20.744 --> 00:16:22.410
into making sure these
things are right,

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.740
because you can't change them.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.820
So my displays had no problems.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.810
Everything worked fine.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.910
But of all my status
lights, one of them-- one

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.590
I got my binaries
reversed, and I

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.461
had to spend this entire mission
staring at this light that

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.960
was on when it
should have been off.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.290
And it drove me nuts.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.710
But anyway, just
a personal story.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.620
These are pneumatic tubes,
literally little P tubes.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.850
You can put a piece of
paper or something in there

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.570
and send it from one
console to another.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.070
And you're sitting
there on console,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.030
and you hear this whoosh
and bang and the thud,

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.230
and these P tubes arrived.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.950
And you open the door, and
you get your message out

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.320
of the P tube.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.730
Those are used for
hard-copied information.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.349
Hard copied-- can you
guys imagine that?

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.230
I will say that other things--
unofficial things, sometimes--

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.420
went through those P tubes.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.150
But I won't say what.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.579
Some of that may be online.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.170
So if you pop up to
the newer consoles,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.849
they don't look
that much different.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.890
OK, so you're running
X Windows here,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.880
and you got a lot more display
and application options.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.150
You are running plasma touch
screens for your voice loops

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.700
instead of the
tactile hard clicks.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.810
And to me, these were much
more flexible and easier

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.650
on your life between
flights, because you

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.470
didn't have to decide
exactly how to do

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.120
the hard coding before.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.680
But these were much more
fun and easy to push and use

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.380
during flight.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.090
So that was a trade off.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:55.230
But the basic operations
mode hasn't changed much.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.270
It's just that the
technology has been upgraded.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.680
So just quickly-- people usually
ask what I do at the end,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.200
so I throw it in here.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.520
I was a summer intern here.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.820
I was a college kid
on those consoles.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.760
And that was just a
hell of a lot of fun.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.244
So that was a couple weeks
after the first space shuttle.

00:18:13.244 --> 00:18:14.660
First space shuttle,
imagine that.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.400
That was incredible.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.441
AUDIENCE: You look like
the guy from "War Games."

00:18:17.441 --> 00:18:19.910
JAY TRIMBLE: Oh my god.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.470
OK, I never thought of that.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.040
And here-- this was at
Johnson Space Center-- here,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.790
I moved to the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.780
but I was Lead Ops Director for
an earth remote sensing radar

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.430
that we flew on the shuttle,
about the size of a bus.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.320
And all I can say is, it
was a fantastic experience.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.657
We designed our Payload
Ops Control Center.

00:18:37.657 --> 00:18:38.490
We did the hardware.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.360
We did the software.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.330
The radar was built at JPL.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:47.250
We flew it twice on Endeavour,
and it was just a lot of fun.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.900
So going back in
time here, because I

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.480
want to talk about display
technology and applications

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.177
and how we package
this stuff for users.

00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:56.760
I want to give you
a little background

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.300
so you can understand the
mental model that we're

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.440
dealing with here.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.840
And I understand this is
a little bit hard to read,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.940
and I apologize for that.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.820
I need a better scan.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.240
This is how you
specify the display.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.740
So this was Solar Max Repair,
the first satellite repair

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.510
mission.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.590
We had George Nelson
flying out literally

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.160
in a Buck Rogers-style
backpack to rendezvous

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.440
with the satellite, bring that
satellite back to the shuttle,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.155
put it in the payload bay.

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:24.490
And I'm this college kid
building displays for this,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.140
so I thought this was
the coolest thing ever.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.670
And we built the same
displays on the ground

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.340
as we built for the
crew, which we thought

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.190
was a great leap
forward at the time.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.975
Nobody would think
twice about it then.

00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:42.669
In fact, we had a meeting
with the crew-- Bob Crippen,

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:44.710
he was pilot from the
first shuttle, like I said,

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.480
George Nelson, who was flying
this manned maneuvering unit.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.719
And I'm this college
student, and we're

00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:51.260
meeting with the
crew, and I actually

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.330
decided I was going
to voice an opinion.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.660
And I just I couldn't
quite get it out.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.490
I remember all these
astronauts leaning in closer

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.270
to try and hear
what I was saying.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.600
Anyway, I'm not so shy now.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.780
But that was an awful
lot of fun at the time.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:11.370
So on this grid, by hand I
would put in what I wanted--

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.500
the labels and the x's.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.930
And I'm going to show you
what this display looked like.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.670
And then I had another sheet
that would link a measurement

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.400
identification number to
a spot on the display.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.140
Can you imagine?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.230
This is called a
scratch pad line.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.740
So the crew had this
keyboard, and we on the ground

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.460
could watch whatever they were
entering into the keyboard.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.337
So we could see
what they were doing

00:20:34.337 --> 00:20:35.420
if it was in the software.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.890
If it was hard-coded
switch, we had

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.000
to view it through
telemetry and talk-backs.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.690
But I just want to give you
guys an idea of how primitive

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.870
this was.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.210
And it's the same type of
technology we flew to the moon

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:46.709
with.

00:20:46.709 --> 00:20:47.930
And I have to say, it worked.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.540
It worked, right?

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.331
We got to the moon.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.580
We flew the space shuttle.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.280
That is what that
display actually

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.220
looked like in hard copy.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.200
And we had a little
button in mission control.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.350
And if we wanted to take
a record of something,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.600
we had a hard copy button.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.070
And I think this thing
came through the P tube.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.050
I'm trying to remember that.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.950
Times zones, GMT, and
then mission elapsed time.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.170
So think about it--
you're going to train

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.750
for a series of mission
events, but if you do those

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.310
to an absolute time
and you launch late,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.130
the whole thing
goes out the window.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.530
So mission elapsed time
starts at engine ignition

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.650
and goes from there.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.390
It's a relative time.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.210
And this is a display for the
Flight Support System, which

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.080
is when the satellite
was brought back in,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.090
it was put in the Flight
Support System to be repaired.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.860
Now, I know you guys are used
all these little touchscreens

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.120
from "Star Trek" and stuff.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.100
And by the way,
according to what

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.058
I've read-- I wasn't
there-- those touchscreens

00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:47.720
we're done because of
budget limitations.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.220
Touchscreens seem to be
the direction we're headed.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.720
There's a panel
from the shuttle.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.286
Simple toggle displays
with mechanical talk-backs.

00:21:58.286 --> 00:22:00.290
But it all worked.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.179
Can we read this?

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:03.220
You guys can't read that.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.000
Sorry about that.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.540
I was trying to give you an
idea of how we did timelines.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.290
Mission elapsed time,
key event, and then roles

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.110
for different-- mission control,
Payload Ops Control Center.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.350
That was in Washington, DC.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.800
They controlled the
satellite, and we

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.280
were responsible
for the shuttle.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.780
So that's the old
mission control.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.230
I want to talk a little
bit about evolution.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.710
And a lot of folks say,
well, why change it all?

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.090
Because the current model works.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.980
And I think that's a
legitimate question.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.740
It does get hard to just keep
technology standing still,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.266
though.

00:22:36.266 --> 00:22:38.140
So maybe you guys will
have some perspectives

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.710
on that you can share with me
as we get towards the end here.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.060
I will say that when you
get a group of people

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.800
who want to create change, you
will get a certain friction

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.980
from those who resist it.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.170
I don't find that to
be unique to NASA.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.170
And occasionally, I find
myself having more sympathy

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.580
for that group as I get an
upgrade to a piece of software

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.230
I use that I think
changes everything around

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.740
for no perceivable benefit.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.530
So maybe I'm just getting
crotchety as we go.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.550
I don't know.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.300
Like I said, share a
perspective with me

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.550
on that when we get to
the Q&amp;A part, or anytime.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.450
I do think that software
built as applications

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.620
creates a set of walls.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:24.370
So if I'm using Photoshop
or Painter, or any

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.690
of these other tools-- and
they're all good tools--

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.780
and I can't mix
and match my tools.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.250
I really have to take
the whole package.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.920
And we have the same issue
with our software or a word

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.480
processor.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.050
I could be using
Google's stuff, or I

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.060
could be using Apple's
stuff, or Microsoft.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.130
There's all kinds of choices
here, and they're all a package

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.330
set.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.750
Duplication-- a few years ago,
I counted the drawing tools

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.550
on one of my older computers.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.920
10 sets of drawing tools that
did pretty much the same thing.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.060
And then, of course,
you get software bloat.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.156
You just keep adding features.

00:23:58.156 --> 00:23:59.780
In the commercial
world, it's very hard

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.738
to take a feature away.

00:24:00.738 --> 00:24:03.460
Because any feature someone
has gotten used to-- you

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.490
can take some
obscure feature away,

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.840
and somebody somewhere is
going to have an absolute fit.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.950
And it's the same thing here.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.560
Who successfully
takes features away?

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.730
Apple does it, and
people make noise.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:15.620
And they do it.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.490
So it's very hard for us
to do that internally.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.880
So open source-- I'm going to
come back to open source later.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.532
Also, we've had a couple of
efforts here-- a desktop effort

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:29.240
called Mission Control
Technologies which

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.970
is on GitHub.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.780
And I put the URL in there.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.530
And it looks like in
blue against black,

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.470
you can't read it.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.390
But if you search for NASA
MCT GitHub, you would find it.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.950
And that's been
our first effort,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.060
and it was done in Java.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.700
And we are moving to a set
of web-based tools now called

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.304
Warp, and that's in the
queue to be open source.

00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:52.970
And I hope that's out
there in the world

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.890
in a couple of months.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.160
And I do believe that is
the direction we're headed.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.740
I'll show the URLs
again at the end.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.960
And of course, I would
love people's feedback.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.880
So why do we open source stuff?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.860
Because open source
does take some effort.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.937
You have to go through
the legal approval

00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:10.770
if you're going to have
any sort of success.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.186
You have to support
the community.

00:25:12.186 --> 00:25:15.570
You guys have more experience
with this than we do.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.420
So why do it?

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.730
Well, there's a couple ideas.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.830
One, for collaboration.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.350
We used to go to somebody--
even internally, but certainly

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.180
externally-- with our
software, and say, hey, we've

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.080
got this cool software.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.955
Why don't you use it?

00:25:26.955 --> 00:25:28.830
And they'd say, OK,
can we download it?

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.300
And I would say, sure.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.510
Let me get a legal agreement
together, our lawyers,

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.200
your lawyers.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.700
And maybe in a couple of months,
you could try the software.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.510
How do you think
that worked out?

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.330
You guessed it-- it didn't.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.380
So open source, that
conversation is great.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.430
Go to GitHub, you can
have it right now.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.670
So it's the immediate
enabler for collaboration.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.170
I think with ground system
technology-- this is just me--

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:50.400
we should share that.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.710
Really, the focus
of space flight

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.389
is on the flight systems.

00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:56.430
And we should be getting
these ground systems out

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.870
there so anybody can use them.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.670
Just my opinion.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.300
I would love to think that we
can build a community of people

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.679
open sourcing ground systems so
that's it's not novel anymore.

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:08.970
And there's always this chance.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.190
Maybe we can put it out there,
innovation out to the outside,

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.460
and we will get something
that we had never thought of.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.550
OK.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.620
So think about what I
was showing you earlier.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.320
There was no concept of
an application, a widget.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.891
We were simply
looking at displays.

00:26:25.891 --> 00:26:27.640
I don't think we cared
about the software.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.530
I don't think we
thought about it.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.210
We've evolved to applications.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.240
I want to move us to
objects and compositions,

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.985
and I don't think people
will understand that.

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:38.110
And I'll show you some
pictures of what that means.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.982
But anyway, depending
on-- everybody

00:26:39.982 --> 00:26:41.190
has a different mental model.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.602
To a flight controller, you're
just looking at displays.

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:46.810
And what are you doing when
you're doing Google Apps?

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.030
Are you looking at apps?

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.540
Are you looking at
objects within apps?

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.610
It really depends.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.632
It depends on your mental model.

00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:56.590
So if you get a software-ish
flight controller,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.714
you can talk this language.

00:26:57.714 --> 00:26:59.760
Otherwise, they're
not that interested.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.750
Also, I think more and more--
we get into these sandboxes.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.446
So in a mission,
I just want people

00:27:09.446 --> 00:27:11.070
to be able to get to
their information.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.850
That's what you want to do.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.920
And as an analog, you
don't want to be there

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.860
on the mission saying,
wow, is it in Dropbox?

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.160
Is it in Google Drive?

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.160
Maybe it's in iCloud.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.990
All these sandboxes
we're creating--

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.340
and there's reasons for
creating those sandboxes.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.330
Some of it is security.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.912
But I just find constantly
I'm having to scratch my head

00:27:31.912 --> 00:27:34.120
and saying, wow, did I put
that in my encrypted image

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.530
on Google Drive?

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.300
Is it local on my desktop?

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.300
Imagine putting something
local on your desktop.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.540
But people still do it.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.370
So anyway, how we chunk
this stuff, how we get at

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.260
it is all a set of issues.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.132
So let's see if I
can make this-- man,

00:27:49.132 --> 00:27:50.340
you can't read that too well.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.840
Let's try and make this
moderately comprehensible.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.820
Here's the old stuff
that I show you.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.020
And the mental
model is displays.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.470
And those displays
are on channels.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.130
So I have a DTE guide.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.340
It was called a Digital
Television Equipment guide.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.440
I think it had 73 channels.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.180
And I have to look
at that, and I'm

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.070
going to go to this
little channel selector,

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.760
and I'm going to
move my little dials,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.240
and I'm going to
select a channel.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.710
I've got three monitors.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.190
I hit a button, I get a
hard click, and it appears.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.960
Now, otherwise, next
model, applications--

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.090
do you notice anything
amidst these applications?

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.360
Do they look somewhat
heterogeneous?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.880
I think they do.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.860
Lack of consistency-- now,
that happens in industry, too,

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.600
right?

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.030
I know at Google a few
years ago versus now,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:41.250
there's been a big drive
to create design unity,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.250
bring things together, material
design, all this stuff.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.040
And as a user, I'll
tell you that shows.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.230
I can tell.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.270
Things seem much
more unified now.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.960
But when you're here, which
we were a few years ago,

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.200
that's an issue.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.520
So the idea here
is to where we can

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.020
move into an objects and
composition model that does not

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.220
force you to think
about applications,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.650
and allows you to think more
about what you are doing.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.280
And of course, that's an ideal.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.275
And it will work
in some instances,

00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:13.300
and in other
instances, it won't.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.320
But it is one direction
in which we're headed.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.490
And I hope that makes sense.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.220
OK.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.440
History lesson for you guys.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.470
So how many people have
heard of Xerox Star?

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.480
Wow, just a couple
of you guys, huh?

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.440
How about Open
Doc, Apple and IMB?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.410
I know you guys
in the-- you know.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:31.910
OK.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.460
Interesting.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:32.960
All right.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.440
So if you go back to the history
of where all this stuff came

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.410
from, the Xerox Star was one
of the first commercial GUIs

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.560
I know you guys all know about
Xerox Park and the famous demos

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.760
and how the GUI came about.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.840
But if you look
back to this, there

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.840
wasn't so much this
idea of applications.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.590
There was this idea of objects--
inbox, outbox, documents,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.040
printers.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.266
Instead of applications, you
were interacting with objects.

00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:00.640
You didn't have
this sense that I

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.450
was going to go to Google Drive
or Google Docs or Google Sheets

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.075
you were just
interacting with objects.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.780
OpenDoc, the idea here
is you have a container,

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.190
and you put parts
into that container,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.430
and each of those
parts has editors.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.550
So instead of a word processor,
I have a word processing part

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.960
or a spreadsheet part,
and I can mix and match

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.350
and create various compositions.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.220
I don't know that these things
failed for technical reasons,

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.050
and I'm not going to
try and analyze that.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.383
That would be outside the
scope of what I'm saying here.

00:30:34.383 --> 00:30:36.700
But there's some very
interesting ideas

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.650
that got left in the
cutting room floor

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.810
as we moved to the
application model

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.910
that we're all
pretty familiar with.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.540
So in dealing with
information, we have models,

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.640
and we have views.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.670
And we have different ways
of looking at the same thing.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.740
So our idea, which
I'm going to show you,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.472
is to provide a
unified environment.

00:30:56.472 --> 00:30:57.930
But to do that,
I'm just giving you

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:04.330
an example of my calendar,
my ever-so exciting calendar.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.760
That is on my Mac.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.600
Desktop application, Apple's
Calendar application.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.840
Does that look familiar?

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.130
That's Google.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.290
It's the same info, but
it looks very different.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:20.040
Also the same info on my iPhone.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.470
Also on my iPhone, but
a different application.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.290
And my point is, I'm basically
doing Model View Controller,

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.650
MVC, by using different
applications to connect

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.710
to my model.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.780
And I want to see these
things in different ways.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.510
And I'm literally
using a different app

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.947
to get my different views.

00:31:37.947 --> 00:31:39.530
And I'm not saying
that's a bad thing.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:43.210
It's one way to do it
in a commercial market.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.860
Does that look
familiar to you guys?

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.430
So here, at least for me,
when I'm in Google Drive,

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.150
I feel like I'm going
to find my stuff.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.440
I'm going to find my document,
or my spreadsheet, or my image.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.760
I'm not thinking applications.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.970
I'm really thinking
of what I want to do.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.610
Whereas here, this is
Google Docs on the iPad.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.200
There, I'm only going to see
one view of my documents,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.792
and I'm really starting
with the application first.

00:32:13.792 --> 00:32:14.500
So where do I go?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.560
Do I go to the application,
or do I go to the data?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.470
And the answer is, we're
going to be able to do both.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.050
There's no one right
answer to this, of course.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:28.970
So our approach-- and
some of this stuff

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.600
may look-- you can see where
we got some of this inspiration

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.930
from.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.850
It might look
moderately familiar.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:39.840
But we just put all our
objects in one environment.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.580
And this is new.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.955
This is the stuff that's going
to be open source shortly.

00:32:42.955 --> 00:32:46.720
It's our web-based version
of mission control, just

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.630
the visualization.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.350
I don't mean to imply it's
all of mission control.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.180
It's a slice of it.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.670
We had a lot of discussion
about which browser to use,

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.390
and our answer to that is that
we will develop and test it

00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.710
in Chrome.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.770
We are not doing
anything to preclude

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.550
it running in
other browsers yet.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.410
There's discussion as to whether
to use Chrome specific things.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:13.065
But so far, we do all our
testing and all our development

00:33:13.065 --> 00:33:14.297
in Chrome.

00:33:14.297 --> 00:33:15.380
And I'll leave it at that.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.020
So all your stuff is in here.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.220
There's no sense of
different applications.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.531
I find something, I look
at it, and I look at it

00:33:22.531 --> 00:33:23.530
through different views.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.040
That's my model view controller.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.390
So this is just simply apply.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.170
But the point I want
to get across here

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.400
is everything is in one place.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.040
So these are the
ideas-- no applications.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.610
You've got objects
and compositions.

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.280
I can look at the same thing
in many different ways,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.901
in many different places.

00:33:40.901 --> 00:33:42.900
And in a second, I'm going
to tell you about one

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.480
of the reasons why
I want to do that.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.710
So that is the same information.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.820
You're just looking at
it in different views.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.972
You've just got a
little pull-down here,

00:33:51.972 --> 00:33:54.180
and I could look at the same
thing in different ways.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.229
So why do I give a hoot?

00:33:55.229 --> 00:33:56.270
Here's a mission example.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.640
This is for scientists.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.790
And I'm sorry.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.400
When I took these
pictures, I really

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.694
never intended these
to be closeups.

00:34:06.694 --> 00:34:08.360
These are actually
pictures from a room,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.359
and I just grabbed them.

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.469
But the point is,
that's a PowerPoint

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.420
representation of a timeline.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.570
That's actually a
sequential set of events,

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.721
as is that, for
scientists, for engineers.

00:34:19.721 --> 00:34:21.179
But the point is,
I want to see all

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:22.889
these things in different ways.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:26.050
And what you get in a mission
standpoint potentially

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.940
is disconnect.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.070
I've been in rooms
where I've heard, say,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.110
a power number or
a power constraint,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.592
and actually people had
given different numbers

00:34:33.592 --> 00:34:34.550
in two different rooms.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.179
We don't want that.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.630
We want everything
to be a display

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.260
of the same underlying data.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.889
Examples here.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:43.770
Once again, I
don't know how much

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.645
you guys want to get
into software or mission

00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:48.069
control or open source.

00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:51.520
I don't mind you guys steering
me in one direction or another.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.690
This, when you demo it live,
is actually pretty cool.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.000
So that's a notebook.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.690
Unremarkable.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.670
I'm sitting at a console,
and I'm saying, OK,

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.280
at mission elapse,
time such and such,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.488
the following thing happened.

00:35:02.488 --> 00:35:05.030
And I'm writing my notes,
or I'm typing my notes.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.330
So what this does for you is
it time stamps it for you.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.620
You put your notes in.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.070
And even more cool, I
can embed the live data

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.420
into the notebook, because
I've got this composition

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.060
model instead of an
application model.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.660
I just take my data and I
embed it in the notebook.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.300
And that is a huge
advantage instead

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.880
of referencing something
or hyperlinking something.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.510
I've just got the
actual data there.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.327
Even more cool, I can take
this notebook and say,

00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:28.910
you know what?

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.490
I want to see my notebook
at a timeline view.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:33.170
And there's my timeline view.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.930
And then I'm going to put
my plotted data next to it.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.460
Now I can start doing
all kinds of cool things,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.179
just because I have models,
views, and compositions.

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:43.720
And I will admit
this is not software

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.270
I would give to my mother.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:50.680
But for what we do,
it's good stuff.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.350
OK.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.725
And here, I'm just trying to
show more of the data types.

00:35:53.725 --> 00:35:55.320
There's the timeline
you saw earlier,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.510
another timeline, orbits,
plotted telemetry-- my point

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.400
being that we can put
all this stuff together.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.870
It's very hard to design
this stuff ahead of time

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.300
and get it right.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.080
What we find is, we
sit down and we say,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.120
here's what we think we need.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.090
And we build it, and
we start simulations,

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.910
and those simulations
typically start about a year

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.530
before launch.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.904
And it's in
simulations where you

00:36:15.904 --> 00:36:17.472
learn what you
really want to do.

00:36:17.472 --> 00:36:18.430
What would you guys do?

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:20.221
You might do a "Wizard
of Ox" walk-through,

00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:21.640
or you might do a
paper prototype.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.160
And there's a number
of things you can do.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.920
But in this domain,
it's very hard

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.100
until we start doing simulations
to realize what we really want.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.203
So this kind of flexibility
in design is quite helpful.

00:36:33.203 --> 00:36:35.578
AUDIENCE: Is there a timeline
[INAUDIBLE] you're showing,

00:36:35.578 --> 00:36:37.314
or that's just driven
off of the notebook

00:36:37.314 --> 00:36:39.844
that you've created after
the fact or in real time?

00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:41.760
JAY TRIMBLE: Create the
notebook in real time.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.592
AUDIENCE: And then
do you ever-- do

00:36:43.592 --> 00:36:47.034
you have timeline views
that you create beforehand?

00:36:47.034 --> 00:36:48.200
JAY TRIMBLE: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.730
Yeah.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.500
Now, the ideal-- and we
haven't done this yet,

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.420
but we're working towards
it in the web version-- is

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.700
to be able to compare the
predicted to the actuals

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.660
and overlay all this stuff.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.767
We're not there yet,
but that's the hope.

00:36:58.767 --> 00:36:59.266
Yes.

00:36:59.266 --> 00:37:01.641
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] towards
the direction where you can

00:37:01.641 --> 00:37:04.310
[INAUDIBLE] during the mission?

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.830
JAY TRIMBLE: So, very
interesting question.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.140
Technically, yes, that
would be easy to do.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.850
Operationally, you would
need a set of constraints

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.200
to keep that under control.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.900
Because you are training
to a particular layout

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.120
and a particular composition.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.310
And I would be very careful
about how I allow changes

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.590
during a mission.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:27.520
I don't think from a
mission ops perspective--

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.870
me personally creating
a new composition, fine.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.900
Changing an existing composition
that I had worked to,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.630
I would be a little
bit concerned about.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.320
Think about flying
in an airplane.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.700
You wouldn't want the
pilots rearranging things.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.390
I wouldn't.

00:37:51.174 --> 00:37:52.840
So quickly, I'm going
to use an example.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.930
This is a mission in
the early design phase.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.170
It's called Resource Prospector.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.830
Got that nice short,
one-way light time.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.230
Lunar Rover to explore for
volatiles at the poles.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.500
And this the vision of
how to put this together.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.720
I drew this out
about a week ago.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.110
And I said, my god,
it looks like iGoogle.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.240
Are we just doing widgets here?

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.460
And you guys stopped iGoogle.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.570
And then I started
asking myself,

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:23.650
what's the difference between
this and a set of widgets?

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.050
Well, interesting question.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.990
To me, in my mind,
these are not widgets.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:29.370
This is the actual procedure
viewer and the procedure

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.952
editor, and those
are the timelines.

00:38:31.952 --> 00:38:33.910
But when you put them
together and compose them

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:37.110
into an integrated display, they
do look somewhat like widgets.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.400
So I'll put that out there.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.875
And this is the first demo-able
prototype of that display.

00:38:44.875 --> 00:38:46.000
It doesn't have everything.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.500
Some of it's real,
some of it's not.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.200
That's just a picture.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.390
That's from another piece
of software called XGDS.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:57.280
But this is all in our software
called WARP-- Web Applications

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.860
for Resource Prospector, so
named by our lead developer,

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.180
Victor Wolfgen, who's sitting
in the back of the room.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.280
So of course, we are going
to have to drive the Rover.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.960
And each one of
these components is

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.620
called WARP-- WARP
Viewer, WARP Image.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.660
So of course we will
have WARP Drive.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.600
I think we named it WARP
before we figured out

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.720
we were going to
have WARP drive.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.320
But this shows the
basic concepts.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.730
I've got a timeline.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.520
I've got all these
mixed data types.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.040
And I can view the same
data in different ways.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.920
And I can put that all
together into a composition.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.974
And so we had done that
on the desktop in Java,

00:39:31.974 --> 00:39:33.390
and now we're doing
it on the web,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.200
and we're pretty
excited about that.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.570
And of course, we will try to
take that to the tablet next,

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.300
and then to the phone.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.894
So here's a little bit of
a closeup of the timeline.

00:39:44.894 --> 00:39:46.310
You can see what
we're doing here.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.140
We're using this for design.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.920
So we're mapping out the
traverses we want to do,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.670
and then we just
map power and data.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.210
And then we go back
and say, OK, we

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:57.220
have a certain allocation
for power and data.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.910
Can we do it within
what we have?

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.990
Do we try and push the design of
the system to have more power?

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.340
And we can answer questions
like, for a certain size

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.966
battery on the Rover,
what kind of a mission

00:40:07.966 --> 00:40:08.840
can we get out of it?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.225
So we're using that timeline
for design at this point.

00:40:11.225 --> 00:40:14.300
And you can see up here,
you've got the pull-downs.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.020
We've got an Edit mode here.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.530
And everything is over
here on that Create button.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.530
You guys know this
story, because you've

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.320
got similar stuff.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.840
Plots, I think I've
already shown that,

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.615
so I'm not going to
spend much time there

00:40:27.615 --> 00:40:30.980
as I'm getting towards my
40-minute time limit here.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.040
This is the notebook, the same
idea as the notebook you saw,

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.400
except web based.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.420
I get timestamps.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.400
I get my notes.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.770
And I get to embed
information in this.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.820
So just a couple
more slides here.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.610
So as I said--

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:50.050
AUDIENCE: Do you have a raw
[INAUDIBLE] number view?

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.640
JAY TRIMBLE: Well,
in this software--

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.970
you mean raw as in pulse
code modulation counts,

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.910
for example, the
straight data value?

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:58.620
Do we have that?

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.270
Victor is nodding his head
yes so I guess we have that.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.810
Most people-- so here, what
people want to see varies.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.730
If you have a long program,
you have flight controllers

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.380
who are really
thinking operationally

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.940
versus the guys who
built it who want

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.860
to see maybe things
in more detail.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.440
OK.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.270
So this, as I
said, is on GitHub.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.440
I hope you guys can read that.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.340
That's the Java desktop version.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.840
I wish I could sit
here and tell you

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.339
that the web version
is open source.

00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:28.400
I think it's very close, but
it's not quite there yet.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.430
I believe that's all I have.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.619
This is our info site.

00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:38.160
If you check back
in a couple months,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.070
you might find the web version.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.720
AUDIENCE: Since
it's browser based,

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.920
any openness to
potentially allowing

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.080
people to create their own
composition on view-only data

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.900
to follow a Mars
mission from the public?

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.530
JAY TRIMBLE: I would love it
if stuff like that happened.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.020
And our goal is to get
this stuff out there.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.950
It's on GitHub.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.260
And say, you can do
anything you want with this.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.220
The key to that would
be that we would

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.120
have to make some of
that data available,

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.560
which is something we
will definitely explore.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.900
And then to take it
back-- so anybody

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.940
can put anything on GitHub
once we've got it out there.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.140
So that would be
completely unrestricted.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.050
My hope is also that there
will be brilliant ideas, things

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.620
we had never thought of that
we can take back and actually

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.060
use for missions.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.560
And I see little
inklings of that.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.890
We've had contributors
for our Java version.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.480
Some of them have just
been our own folks

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.040
that have left
and kept using it.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.940
But then a guy pops up from
France, and all of a sudden,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.400
he's writing code.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.030
If we're going to use it
in a NASA distribution,

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.680
we have to do the paperwork
and get permission

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.550
from the developer to do that.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.690
But folks can put anything
they want out on GitHub.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.080
And yeah, I'm hoping that
we get a web version out

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.560
there that it stimulates a bit
of an open source community

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.949
and people become interested.

00:42:57.949 --> 00:42:59.990
AUDIENCE: You said that
you run these simulations

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.864
six months ahead of time.

00:43:01.864 --> 00:43:03.280
JAY TRIMBLE: Usually
about a year.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.252
AUDIENCE: So you have
some idea of what

00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:07.210
the process of the mission
is going to be like,

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.790
and what the data coming
in from your sensors

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.800
is going to be like at
different stages of the mission.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.030
And you're watching
that, and then you're

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.446
making decisions
based on when you

00:43:13.446 --> 00:43:15.600
see the data get to a
certain point, right?

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:15.930
JAY TRIMBLE: Correct.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.320
AUDIENCE: You're like, I'm
deciding at this moment,

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.310
I'm going to turn something on.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.190
Is there a temptation
to automate that?

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.470
Like, when I see the
sensors in this state,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.280
I want to automatically
make this decision

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.239
that I've pre-verified?

00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:27.946
JAY TRIMBLE: I will
give you one example,

00:43:27.946 --> 00:43:29.350
because it came up recently.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.250
For the Moon Rover,
the question was asked,

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.670
do we want to be able to
automate the prospecting

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.850
decisions?

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.390
So we are driving, we are
with the spectrometers

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.890
looking for water.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.660
Depending on that
data, do we want

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.160
to be able to
automate the decision?

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.250
And my answer to this is--
which validated with the science

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:52.130
team-- we won't know in the
short duration of our mission

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.654
how to interpret that data
well enough to automate it.

00:43:54.654 --> 00:43:56.070
If we had a mission
that was going

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.324
to go for six months or a
year, I would say absolutely.

00:44:00.324 --> 00:44:02.490
AUDIENCE: So once you verify
what your decisions are

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.116
on the expected
pathway, it seems

00:44:04.116 --> 00:44:05.490
like you've already
automated it.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.640
But you're just
waiting on a human

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.806
to actually push the button?

00:44:07.806 --> 00:44:08.570
JAY TRIMBLE: Yeah.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.360
We haven't done much on it now.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.900
I can't speak for all of NASA.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.000
I can only speak for the
little slice that I know.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.580
I haven't seen a
lot of automation.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.910
I have heard some discussion.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.270
I think with system values,
that might be an easier thing

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.690
to do than with science
data interpretation,

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:26.370
and what I was talking about
was science data interpretation.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.310
You have certain
limits for a subsystem,

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.110
and you know how
that's going to behave.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:34.340
But think of the example I
gave you earlier for that Abort

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.870
To Orbit for the space shuttle.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.165
I just don't think
anybody would have--

00:44:38.165 --> 00:44:40.860
I don't think we're there yet
for automating something that

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.750
complicated where
human life is at risk.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:48.326
And the answer is, these
conversations will be ongoing.

00:44:48.326 --> 00:44:50.200
AUDIENCE: Could you
maybe speak to the limits

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.850
of some of these
values coming in

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:54.100
and how it displays to the
screen and the operator's

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.000
views?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.420
JAY TRIMBLE: So
I'm going to start

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.380
with those old
monochrome displays.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.430
You had a little arrow, and it
was called out of limits high,

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.010
out of limits low.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.910
And then you had another
indication for off scale,

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.300
meaning it was out of
the scale of the sensor.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.180
And we used to use
that in the office.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.350
If somebody was nuts, we'd
say they're off scale.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.610
But now with all the
flexibility we have,

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:22.900
you can design green,
yellow, red, really any kind

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.660
of indication that
you want as long

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.150
as you know what that means.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.780
But you have for
any subsystem an

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.710
acceptable-- like
for your computer,

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:32.240
you have an
operational temperature

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.450
range for your computer.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.280
You have a storage
temperature range.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.630
It's the same idea.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.590
And it's just a matter
of how to indicate that

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:43.310
on a display and some sense of
what you will do that you've

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.060
discussed ahead of
time if something's not

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.700
what you expect.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.880
AUDIENCE: So this is mission
control, not flight drivers,

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.450
obviously.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:54.650
But I imagine there's still
some sort of risk involved

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:58.390
in opening this
up to open source.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:01.704
If something is bad--
we've all had experiences,

00:46:01.704 --> 00:46:03.120
I think, with open
source software

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.250
where something was not
done well or correctly,

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.370
and this can
potentially be a risk.

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.860
So I wonder what kind
of further process

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.080
there is to mitigate that risk.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.100
JAY TRIMBLE: I've been asked
that question internally a lot.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.010
And the answer is, right now,
it's been mostly one way.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.070
It's been us putting
stuff out into the world.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.500
There's been very
little input path back.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.750
Most of the input
path back has been

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:30.470
from people who've left us and
kept working on that software.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.437
So it's been a very
tightly bounded problem.

00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:35.270
Then we've had just a
couple of other people

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.055
who've made inputs, but we
haven't incorporated that.

00:46:38.055 --> 00:46:39.680
So I think the answer
is, so far, we've

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.860
been able to duck that question.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.030
If this were to
actually take off,

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:47.060
then we'd have to have a process
for not only what you said,

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.960
but deciding which design
we like, how much of this

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.850
can we take.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:55.010
And I hope we are in
the position of having

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.850
to deal with that, but
we really haven't yet.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.280
I'll probably be calling
Chris and asking him

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.744
how to handle that
when the time comes.

00:47:02.744 --> 00:47:04.410
And I thank you for
volunteering, Chris,

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:05.820
to help with that.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.635
CHRIS DIBONA: That's
what I'm here for.

00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:09.260
AUDIENCE: The open
source part of this,

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.290
is it just the front end UI, or
is there a back-end component

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.790
to this?

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:16.300
JAY TRIMBLE: So far, it
is the front-end stuff.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.466
And open sourcing these
things just takes a while.

00:47:18.466 --> 00:47:20.090
We will get more out
there, and my hope

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.370
is to get everything out there.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:26.910
But right now, it's all the
front-end visualization stuff.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.550
When you mention
open source, there's

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:31.057
a lot of teams who would like
to open source their stuff.

00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:34.260
AUDIENCE: What feeds
it right now currently?

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.220
Where's the bridge?

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.380
JAY TRIMBLE: Where are
we getting our data?

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.284
AUDIENCE: If you were to pick
this up as an open source,

00:47:40.284 --> 00:47:41.200
how would you feed it?

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.700
JAY TRIMBLE: I'm going to
let Victor handle that one,

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.741
since it's why he's here.

00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:45.800
And he wrote some of
these data adapters.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.258
VICTOR WOLFGEN:
Generally speaking,

00:47:47.258 --> 00:47:51.370
the front end is plug-in based.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.165
So a category of plug-in you
can introduce to the front end,

00:47:54.165 --> 00:47:56.500
and that's the code
that runs on the browser

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.040
is a connector to
a data back-end.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.720
So the expectation would just
be that whatever the data source

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.920
it has, or whatever data
source you're integrating with,

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.760
you either have or create
some kind of web service

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.140
to expose that data, and then
present that data internally

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:21.000
in the format that the
application understands.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
AUDIENCE: So the move to
a purely web-based thing,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.680
you gain a lot of
flexibility, but you

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.960
lose some of the
tactile physical stuff.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.790
When you're talking about
pressing the buttons for who

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.512
to talk to, I can imagine
sometimes on a web interface,

00:48:36.512 --> 00:48:38.220
if you're using a
mouse or a touchscreen,

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.050
you might mis-click
on something.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.130
And it's a lot easier
to click on something

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.760
incorrectly than to
press a button that

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.820
has some resistance incorrectly.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.000
So do you worry
about or do you have

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.940
plans for breaking
some of the stuff

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.480
into more physical,
tactile feedback?

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.800
Is that an issue
that you encounter?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.840
JAY TRIMBLE: At the moment, we
have a whole separate system

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.480
for the voice loops.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.080
So going to a
web-based system, we're

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.190
really taking things that have
moved to desktop applications

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.720
already and just putting them
into web-based applications.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.410
We're not doing things
like the voice loops.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.100
And we lost that tactile
feedback years ago we

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.890
moved from those
hard click displays

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.720
to the touch screen displays.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.570
So I think people
are used to that.

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.160
But the voice loops are a
separate system right now.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.080
AUDIENCE: You talked
about the heritage

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.570
coming from mission control.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:36.130
I'm wondering if there
are other domains where

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.470
you think the open source
project might be useful,

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.480
and if you've drawn
inspiration from other domains

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:47.720
into this-- so Bloomberg
terminals or logs, analyses,

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.860
interfaces, other kinds
of real time things.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.380
Or do you think that this
is going to always live

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.821
in a world of mission control,
and maybe the ESA wants it?

00:49:55.821 --> 00:49:57.320
JAY TRIMBLE: Oh, I
think the more we

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.410
can interact with the
world and draw inspirations

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.750
like what you're talking
about, the better off we are.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:04.220
So do we look at these things?

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.991
Yes.

00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:06.740
Do we look at them as
much as I'd like to?

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:07.500
Probably not.

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.670
But we definitely look
at financial plotting

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.257
applications, for
example, to compare them

00:50:13.257 --> 00:50:14.090
to what we're doing.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.570
I think the data
rates-- and I don't

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.611
know much about financial
plotting applications--

00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:20.020
but especially
during launch prep,

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.620
we're blasting pretty
high data rates.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.161
And I don't know
that financials need

00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:25.650
to be updated multiple
times a second,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.000
but we certainly do
look at those things.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.120
And it is my hope that
through open source,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.540
we can start to get some of
that two-way conversation.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.374
I hope that people will find our
things useful in other domains

00:50:36.374 --> 00:50:38.540
and that we will cross
pollinate with other domains.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.670
That's part of the goal.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.302
We're just in the very, very
early stages of it right now.

00:50:43.302 --> 00:50:45.760
So the question was, is there
a command interface for this.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.301
And the answer is
not yet, because it

00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:49.780
is the single most
sensitive thing that we do.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.554
If people are so sensitive
about their commanding,

00:50:52.554 --> 00:50:53.970
I think the idea
in open source is

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:55.800
we would let them
build their own.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.520
We may, for some of
our own missions,

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.050
build a command interface, or
we may use an existing one.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.840
But it will be the
last thing we do,

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.949
because of the
sensitivity of it.

00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:06.990
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, thank
you so much for coming.

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.780
It's really great to have you.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.230
[APPLAUSE]
