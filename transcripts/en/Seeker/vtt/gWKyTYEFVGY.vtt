00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.090
Imagine you have traveled everywhere on Earth.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.500
There is nothing new to see.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.790
You’ve witnessed the Aurora Borealis from
the North Pole.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.420
You’ve climbed to the top of Mount Everest.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.670
You’ve swam with sharks, safaried around
the savannah and ran with the bulls.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.230
The only place left to go is outer space.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.570
And if you’re lucky enough to have some
deep pockets, space tourism looks like it’s

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.929
just around the corner.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.429
The idea of space tourism would have seemed
like a joke a few decades ago.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.089
During the 1960s, space exploration was almost
completely under the purview of government-run

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.089
agencies.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.739
Well, two governments to be exact: The U.S.
and the Soviet Union.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.060
The two superpowers competed in the 1960’s
and 70’s in what is known as the “Space

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.060
Race.”

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.920
It was a test of each nation’s strength
and intelligence, like much of the posturing

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
that occurred during the Cold War.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
But over time, a different kind of superpower
discovered space might be within their reach;

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.800
the big dreamin’ businessman.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.830
Dennis Tito, the first space tourist, was
just that: , an American business man with

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.680
no previous space travel experience who was
the first to pay to go into space.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.400
He apparently dropped $20 million to hop on
board a Russian spacecraft, landing on the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.680
ISS in April of 2001.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.970
Experts often agree that this was the moment
when the commercial space race began.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.450
Tito inspired a generation of billionaires
and CEOs to strive to reach the last frontier.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
And in 2004, the U.S. government made this
easier to accomplish, when it officially legalized

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.829
private space travel.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.460
Before this, some laws had made it easier
for companies to build spacecrafts and launching

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060
pads mostly as they related to telecommunications
and satellites.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.420
But this bill made it possible for human space
travel to become completely private.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.859
And just six months before George W. Bush
officially signed the 2004 bill into law,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.649
the first privately-funded spacecraft left
Earth’s orbit, partly financed by Microsoft

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.030
co-founder Paul G. Allen.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.799
But the first real major opening for private
companies to make their mark in space travel

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.840
came in 2011, when NASA officially ended its
space shuttle program after 30 years of operation.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.189
The Obama administration decided to axe the
program choosing to direct more funding to

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.310
private companies looking to build new spaceships.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.979
The move was intended to usher in an era of
public-private partnerships between NASA and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.270
private space companies.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.829
The idea being that NASA would contract these
companies to perform the duties its own astronauts

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.119
and engineers used to do, saving the agency
money and providing a chance for the free

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.600
market to establish a sense of competition
in getting to space.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.120
And there were plenty who were willing to
take on that challenge.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.870
In the U.S., the industry is thriving.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.470
In 2012, SpaceX sent the first commercially-built
vehicle to carry cargo to the ISS, a task

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.920
which only government-run agencies had ever
done before.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.340
SpaceX has successfully launched and landed
multiple rockets since and have even promised

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.670
to send two “space tourists” out to orbit
the moon by 2018.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.590
But not all missions have been successful.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.890
Virgin Galactic had a major setback after
a pilot died during a failed test flight of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.070
one of its spaceships, causing concern that
the tragedy might put their goal of creating

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.800
a vibrant space tourism industry in doubt.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.820
Yet, less than two years later, things were
back on track for the company that dubs itself

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.610
“the world’s first commercial spaceline.”

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.660
Over 500 people, including many famous celebrities,
have already paid $250,000 for a future flight

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.610
into space that only promises a few minutes
of actual time up there before the vehicle

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.730
reenters Earth’s atmosphere.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.840
Virgin Galactic and Space X aren’t the only
game in town, either.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.380
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said that his space
travel company, Blue Origin, could send tourists

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.720
to space as early as 2018.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.880
There are still a lot of questions and concerns
that need to be addressed before the private

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.900
space industry can fully...take off.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.850
Virgin Galactic’s 2014 crash highlighted
just how risky and difficult it can be to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.890
build safe and successful space vehicles.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.860
The risky nature of such endeavors, not to
mention the lack of international laws and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.010
treaties governing space, makes the prospect
of running a viable space travel business

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.470
much more difficult.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.380
Whether or not leaving space exploration up
to a generation of big-dreaming entrepreneurs

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.850
is a good idea, it’s happening.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.120
And it’s happening fast.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.510
So now I guess all you thrill-seeking adventurers
need to start asking yourselves, is the price

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.510
tag worth it?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.260
How far will the industry have to advance
for you to sign up?
