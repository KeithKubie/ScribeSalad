00:00:01.356 --> 00:00:03.076
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: They're
connecting, they're learning

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:08.016
They're constantly engaged in it.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.296
They're thinking about what they're
doing and why they're doing it

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:13.046
and how it impacts a bigger picture.

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:22.876
&gt;&gt;For us, place-based learning is
using the environment as the tool,

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:25.006
using our place as our
tool for learning.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:25.826
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: Here we go.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:26.946
Everybody's ready.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.396
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: When you
use your place everything

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.546
that the kids are doing
becomes relevant and real.

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:35.206
They see it, they can
put their hands on it.

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:37.936
It doesn't matter if you
have stream or woods.

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.146
It can be in the middle of the city.

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.106
Just ask the kids, ask the
parents, they'll tell you

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.366
where all the cool little nooks and
crannies are in the neighborhood

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:44.976
that you could be utilizing.

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:47.866
&gt;&gt;Wetland.

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:48.816
&gt;&gt;Students: Wetland.

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:50.716
&gt;&gt;Hemlock forest.

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:52.936
&gt;&gt;Students: Hemlock forest.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:55.146
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: What's in your backyard?

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:56.816
What's in the environmental
laboratory that's out there?

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:58.886
Let's talk about habitat,
let's talk about animals,

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:01.836
let's talk about what your backyard
looks like through the seasons,

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:03.986
or how's the meadow different
from a forest?

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:05.806
How's that different from a stream?

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:09.196
&gt;&gt;We need to think about all
the places in our backyard

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:11.526
that we could set up
some scent stations.

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:15.776
Get your best sniffer on, line
up in front of Mrs. McCauley.

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:18.976
&gt;&gt;So the first one you're
gonna smell is fox urine.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:20.376
&gt;&gt;Students: Ew!

00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:21.976
&gt;&gt;Are you ready?

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:27.356
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: Our scent stations
were designed to attract animals

00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:33.956
and they have molasses, skunk, fox,
and beaver, and they all have had lots

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:39.856
of sniffs and they decide what
scent would be best where.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:46.036
&gt;&gt;A trail camera captures images
each time it senses motion

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:46.976
at the scent station.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.256
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: So if we put the camera
here where would we put the scent?

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:52.493
&gt;&gt;Student: Oo, right here.

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:52.686
 

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:55.876
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: We get a
popsicle stick and a cotton ball

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:56.976
and we put the scent on it.

00:01:58.146 --> 00:01:58.836
&gt;&gt;Student: Ew, it looks like pee.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:01.536
&gt;&gt;Okay, now you need to
stick it down in there.

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:01.796
 

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:03.936
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: We hang up the camera--

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.466
&gt;&gt;Now turn it on, all the way up.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:10.876
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: And then wait.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:11.476
&gt;&gt;All right,

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:12.376
&gt;&gt;What do you think,

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:12.976
Is everybody happy with it?

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:13.836
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:20.306
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: And usually in a couple
days to a week we come back and we look

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.276
at the pictures that we got.

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:21.976
&gt;&gt;What do you think we're gonna see?

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:22.476
&gt;&gt;Student: Cute!

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:23.816
&gt;&gt;Another deer!

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.866
&gt;&gt;Wow!

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.906
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Let's
see what else we find.

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:31.396
 

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:32.206
&gt;&gt;It looks like a mole.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:32.886
&gt;&gt;It looks like a raccoon.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:33.796
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Maybe a raccoon.

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:35.156
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: Now we're going
into winter, what are some animals

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:38.336
that we saw in the fall that we're
not gonna see and where are they?

00:02:38.336 --> 00:02:39.966
Did they hibernate or migrate?

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:41.976
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's,
like, eating something.

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.206
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: That's
the magic of learning

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:47.656
when they don't even realize all
that they're learning and all

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:52.576
that they're experiencing
because they're just having fun.

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:54.256
&gt;&gt;Jayden: So if we're
doing something science

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:58.746
or social studies we won't only
get out a book and read about it,

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:05.086
but we'll try doing experiments and
going down to the stream and we do a lot

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:09.096
of taking care of things,
especially our trout.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.936
&gt;&gt;Let's see how the fish are doing.

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:17.686
&gt;&gt;Hannah: Well, we are studying
how they grow up and what they eat.

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:19.636
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Doing
trout in the classroom fit

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.536
in perfectly with our place.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:27.776
We have the stream, our kids love to
fish, there's curriculum free on the

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:29.216
"Trout in the Classroom" website.

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:34.346
We talked to Trout Unlimited
and they said, "Absolutely,

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:38.356
we'll help you out any way we can," and
so we said, "Okay, we need a lot of help

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.456
because we've never done this before.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:41.736
Where do we get these eggs, you know?”

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:42.056
 

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:45.316
&gt;&gt;Emillie: They came here as eggs,
but some of them were already hatched.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:50.676
We put them in the fish tank
and then three days later

00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:53.396
after that we started
feeding them fish food.

00:03:55.496 --> 00:03:58.566
&gt;&gt;Hannah: We make sure that
their water temperature is right

00:03:58.566 --> 00:03:59.926
and their water's healthy
enough for them to live in.

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:03.426
&gt;&gt;Jayden: Looks like it's 7.4.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:04.306
&gt;&gt;Hannah: Yeah, that's good.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:06.586
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Every day
they're collecting the data.

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:07.556
 

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:08.726
 

00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:12.286
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: So you've
done the chemical study,

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:14.046
now you can do the biological study.

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:17.786
&gt;&gt;There are parts of the
stream ecosystem that make

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:20.166
that a good habitat for the fish.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:24.146
What are some of the things that we're
gonna find down there, hopefully,

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:26.246
that we've had to mimic up here?

00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:29.496
&gt;&gt;Hannah: They eat micro-invertebrates
when they're in the stream

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:31.786
and get oxygen from the rocks,

00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:35.316
It's kinda like the bubbler
in the classroom tank.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.616
&gt;&gt;Jayden: I love it because we
get to release them afterwards.

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.116
&gt;&gt;We make sure that the stream
is definitely healthy so that

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:43.556
when we release our trout that we
know they're in a healthy place.

00:04:44.496 --> 00:04:46.746
&gt;&gt;Students: Whoa!

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:49.886
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: That stream
runs through their backyards.

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:52.206
Every day when they're
down there at the stream

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:54.936
and they see one they're gonna
wonder, "Is that the one I released?"

00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:55.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Nice job.

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.856
&gt;&gt;Susan Friend: That
makes learning real.

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:01.076
It validates it, it helps
them make those connections.

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:02.376
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's a deer.

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:04.056
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Because I think

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:08.656
when you can help kids see the impact
they can have in their own little corner

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:12.876
of the world then they can make changes
in a much more global arena later on.

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:18.436
&gt;&gt;Jayden: What I want to grow
up to do is clean up pollution

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:20.636
or anything that's damaged the world.
