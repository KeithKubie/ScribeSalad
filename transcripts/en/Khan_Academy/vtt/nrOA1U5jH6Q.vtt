00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:01.990
- [Voiceover] Compare

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.823
98,989

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:05.630
and 98,899.

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.886
So we want to compare these two numbers

00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:12.015
and to do that, let's first
think about what these

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:12.957
digits mean.

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:16.291
What do these numbers actually mean?

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.112
Looking first at our number on the left,

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.406
we have a 9 all the way to the right,

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.304
or in the ones place value,

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:23.650
which means just that.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.233
It means nine ones.

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:30.989
Beside that, we have an
8 in the 10s place value,

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.156
so that's eight 10s or 80.

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:39.481
This number, these two right here, 89

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.981
is the same as an 80 plus a 9.

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:47.529
Beside the 8, we have a 9
in the 100s place value,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.362
so again, we can look at that, 989

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:54.829
is the same as a 900 plus an 80 plus a 9

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.143
and let's keep going and
fill in these last two.

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:00.893
We have an 8 in the 1,000s place,

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:05.429
and finally, a 9 in the 10,000s place,

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.346
which means nine 10,000s or 90,000,

00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:12.421
so 98,989 is the same as

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:17.667
90,000 plus 8,000 plus 900 plus 80 plus 9.

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:22.745
Which of these place values
now seems like the most

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:27.132
important one if we're
deciding how big a number is?

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:29.856
Which one of these has the
biggest impact on the size

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.023
of our number?

00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:34.928
And the answer is the one
all the way to the left,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.927
whatever place value
is farthest to the left

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:39.846
is the greatest place value,

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:43.646
so it is the most important
in deciding how big

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.757
or how small a number is.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:48.719
So when we compare these
numbers, we're going to start

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.263
by comparing the largest place value that

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:53.281
either of them has.

00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:57.352
In this case, 10,000s is
the largest place value

00:01:57.352 --> 00:01:59.574
both of them has,

00:01:59.574 --> 00:02:01.549
and in both cases, it's a 9,

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.549
so both of these numbers

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:06.184
start with 90,000

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:08.154
which is equal,

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:10.084
we can't tell yet which one is greater,

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:13.106
so we're going to move to
the next biggest place value.

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:16.753
The next largest place value is the 1,000s

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.575
and again, we can see in both cases,

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:21.408
we have an 8 or 8,000,

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.198
so looking at what we've
compared so far, these numbers

00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:26.376
are identical,

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:28.987
neither is larger than the other,

00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:31.130
so we're going to keep going
and again, we're going to pick

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.547
the next largest place value,

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:35.912
which is the 100s

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:40.238
and our first number on the
left, we have nine 100s,

00:02:40.238 --> 00:02:41.372
nine 100s,

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:44.123
but on the right, we have

00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:45.040
eight 100s,

00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:49.730
so eight 100s is less than nine 100s,

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:53.689
so this number on the right is less

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:55.577
than our first number,

00:02:55.577 --> 00:02:57.495
the number on the left,

00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:01.680
or we could say, the
900 is greater than 800

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
so the number on the left is greater

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:08.543
and this is our greater
than symbol because we want

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:12.802
the open side to be
facing the larger number.

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:17.243
We want the open side
facing the larger number.

00:03:17.243 --> 00:03:18.590
So we'd read this as

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.007
98,989 is greater

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.041
than 98,899.

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:28.902
And you might be thinking,
but wait, we didn't look

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:31.134
at the 10s and look at the 10s.

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:32.876
Here, we have eight 10s,

00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:35.246
but on the right we have nine 10s.

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:38.830
Well, nine 10s is definitely
greater than eight 10s

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.497
but it doesn't make up
for having less 100s.

00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:45.938
100s are far bigger, 10 times bigger,

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:48.850
than 10s, so they matter more,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.401
they had a bigger impact
on which of these numbers

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.963
was larger.

00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:57.216
So, we compare until we find
the greatest place value

00:03:57.216 --> 00:03:59.199
that's different

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.902
and then whichever of those
has the greater number

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:05.294
in that place value is the greater number.

00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:06.877
Let's try one more.

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:11.621
So here we're comparing 53,000

00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:12.621
and 350,000.

00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:16.073
At a quick glance, you might be thinking,

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:19.593
okay, first number 5, first number 3.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.568
The highest place value is bigger here,

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:22.994
it's a 5.

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:24.272
But that's not quite enough.

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:26.095
We still have to be
sure we're comparing the

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:27.595
same place values.

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:31.268
This largest place value here,

00:04:31.268 --> 00:04:32.611
this 5,

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:34.611
is in the 10,000s place.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:38.252
But the largest place
value over here, the 3,

00:04:38.252 --> 00:04:41.096
is in the 100,000s place.

00:04:41.096 --> 00:04:44.096
So we are actually comparing 300,000

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:46.882
to 50,000.

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:50.956
Those are two different place values.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:54.614
We want to compare 100,000s to 100,000s,

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:55.974
so looking over here,

00:04:55.974 --> 00:04:59.525
how many 100,000s did this number have?

00:04:59.525 --> 00:05:02.177
And the answer is a great, big zero.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.679
It has zero 100,000s,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.929
so we can say zero 100,000s

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.549
and when we compare that to 300,000,

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:12.869
that's far less.

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.628
No 100,000s is much less
than three 100,000s,

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:20.128
so actually, this second number is larger,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.741
so be careful not just to
compare the first number

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.074
but the largest place value,

00:05:28.064 --> 00:05:30.489
and if there's no digit
in that place value,

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:34.495
we can fill in a zero and then compare.

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:37.357
So to read this, we'll say 53,000

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:38.190
is less,

00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:40.361
less,

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:42.667
than 350,000,

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:47.985
and this symbol is less
than because the larger side

00:05:47.985 --> 00:05:50.069
is open to the bigger number

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.840
and the bigger number
is the second number,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.423
so 53,000 is less than 350,000.
