00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.510
The other kind of exercise in our
courses is programming exercises.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.750
Here's a simple programming
exercise from AI for Robotics.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.820
In these exercises you'll have an IDE
available right in the web browser.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.830
You'll be given some initial code
to work from like we see here.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.630
So after you've worked on the exercise
you can click Test Run at the bottom.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.890
The output of your code
will be displayed below.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.530
Then, when you're satisfied with your
code, you can click Submit on the right

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.890
and you will see your
evaluation on the right.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.720
&gt;&gt; We have some courses that
actually use this code window for

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.050
project submission.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.340
You'll develop the project
on your local machine, but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.280
you can use this window to test and make
sure that your code actually runs, and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.340
maybe see some preliminary output.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.590
For those courses,
when the TAs go to grade your project,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.540
they'll pull the last thing that
you submitted before the due date.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.960
So make sure your last submission
is the one you want to turn in.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.220
But you don't need to worry
about that too much right now.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.510
That will be explained in more detail
when you get to those actual classes.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.400
Now over here on the right, you've
probably noticed that every screen

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.040
suggests that you take up
this conversation on Piazza.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.550
Piazza is the forum tool that we use
right now in the OMS program, so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.600
let's talk about that next.
