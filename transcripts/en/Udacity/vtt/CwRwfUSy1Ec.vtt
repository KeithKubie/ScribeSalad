00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.110
This pie chart here, shows whether you and

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.430
many of your fellow classmates think you look like

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.050
your mom, your dad, both parents or you're not

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.310
sure. In my mind, I would imagine that there

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.510
would be roughly equal number of students who

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.330
think they look like either their mom of their

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.750
dad. But based on that and looking at the

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.000
results here Do these results surprise you at all?
