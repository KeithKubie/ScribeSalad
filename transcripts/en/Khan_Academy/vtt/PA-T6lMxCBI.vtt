00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:02.420
- Let say that I have two different gases

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.593
at two different temperatures

00:00:03.593 --> 00:00:06.252
that just got in contact with each other.

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.922
So, this is my magenta gas.

00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:11.290
Right over here, let me draw a bunch of

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.390
the molecules of my

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.757
magenta gas right over here.

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.754
And it's just, this system over here,

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.217
I guess, whatever you want to call it,

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:24.474
has just come in contact with this blue gas.

00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.874
This blue gas, right over here.

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:31.921
And lets say that right where when we're starting

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:33.953
our simulation, our experiment,

00:00:33.953 --> 00:00:37.837
that this magenta gas has a higher temperature.

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:41.134
Higher temperature.

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.770
And our blue gas has a lower temperature.

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:46.939
Lower temperature.

00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:50.114
So lets just remind ourselves what temperature is.

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:52.517
Specially if we think about it on a molecular scale.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.990
So higher temperature, lower temperature.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.193
Temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.316
So these molecules, they're gonna be vibrating around,

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:03.849
they're gonna be bumping around.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:04.661
They're gonna have,

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.356
each of them are gonna have kinetic energy

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:07.320
and if you average them,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.549
that's gonna be proportional to temperature.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.219
So let me depict each of this individual

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.659
molecule's kinetic energy.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.087
Maybe this one is doing that.

00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:16.922
Maybe this one is doing that.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:18.617
Maybe this one is going in this direction.

00:01:18.617 --> 00:01:20.288
Maybe that one is going that direction.

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.617
That one is going in that direction.

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.570
This is going in that direction.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.221
That is going in that direction.

00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.203
So,

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:29.623
notice, they all have different directions.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:32.421
And the magnitude of their velocity can be different.

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.273
They all have different speeds.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.501
They all might have different speeds.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:39.886
So they have different speeds right over here.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:42.359
And they're all bumping into each other.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.857
Transferring their kinetic energy,

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:45.157
transferring their momentum

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:47.328
to from one particle to another.

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:48.408
But when we talk about temperature

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.987
we talk about the average kinetic energy

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:51.055
or what's proportional to the

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:52.837
average kinetic energy of the system.

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.654
Well this one, each of these molecules

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:57.025
are also gonna have some kinetic energy.

00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:59.193
But on average it's gonna be lower.

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:01.156
Maybe this one is doing something like this.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.222
This one is doing something like this.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.161
This is doing something like this.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:07.431
This is doing something like this.

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:08.957
So they're different,

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.111
but on average they're gonna be lower.

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:12.046
So,

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.019
hopefully you see that this magenta arrows

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.491
are bigger than these blue arrows

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.739
that I'm doing.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:20.080
And they don't all have to be,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.322
for example this one

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:22.622
might have a lot of kinetic energy.

00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:23.760
But when you average it out,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.309
the average here is gonna be lower than the average here.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.863
So, just like that.

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:30.761
Now, if this is our initial state,

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.629
what do we think is going to start happening?

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.717
Well, before our different groups of gases

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:39.724
were colliding with itself

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.454
or the magenta was colliding with the magenta.

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:42.684
The blue is colliding with the blue.

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.821
But now they're gonna start colliding with each other.

00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:46.423
And so you can imagine when

00:02:46.423 --> 00:02:48.524
this molecule right over here,

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:50.092
collides with this molecule,

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.390
it's gonna transfer some kinetic energy to it.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.256
So after the collision, this one might be going.

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:58.469
After the collision.

00:02:58.555 --> 00:03:00.088
So lets just say they just bounced in to.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:01.353
So this is right before,

00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:03.670
and lets say they just finished bouncing into each other.

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:06.520
So right after they finish bouncing into each other,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.476
this one might ricochet off.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:11.634
So this one is going to go this way.

00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:13.074
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:16.214
So it might hit this one, bounce off,

00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:18.048
and then transfer some of its kinetic energy

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:20.521
and then it bounces off in this direction.

00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:23.586
While this one, after the collision,

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:27.099
after the collision is going to

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.357
is maybe going to move

00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:31.853
much faster in this direction.

00:03:31.853 --> 00:03:34.082
And so notice, you have a transfer of energy.

00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:35.823
Just with that one collision you had

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:37.251
a transfer of kinetic energy

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:39.457
from this molecule to that molecule.

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:41.791
And this is going to happen throughout the system.

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.624
That the faster molecules, the ones with more kinetic energy

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:48.118
as they collide you're gonna have transfer of energy.

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:49.953
So you're gonna have a

00:03:49.953 --> 00:03:52.217
transfer of energy from the higher temperature

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:53.639
to the lower temperature.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.096
Transfer, transfer of energy.

00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:01.121
And this transfer of energy.

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.525
And you can consider this transfer of thermal energy,

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:04.918
we're talking about temperature here.

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:07.716
So, the things that are related to temperature,

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:08.726
we would say thermal.

00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:11.971
So these, this is transfer of thermal energy.

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:14.426
Transfer of thermal energy.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:15.959
The amount, so you're gonna have,

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.954
if you're gonna start with higher energy here.

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.382
You have higher average kinetic energy.

00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:22.356
You have lower average kinetic energy here.

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.421
But this is going to transfer energy

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.790
from the magenta to the blue.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.183
It's gonna go from higher temperature

00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:30.692
to the lower temperature.

00:04:30.692 --> 00:04:33.153
And that energy that's being transferred,

00:04:33.153 --> 00:04:35.324
that energy that's being transferred,

00:04:35.324 --> 00:04:37.124
we call that, and this is a word that you

00:04:37.124 --> 00:04:39.585
have probably heard many times in your life,

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:41.861
we call that energy that's being transferred,

00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:43.609
we call that heat.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.992
That literally this hotter gas over here

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:48.351
is heating up.

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:51.358
Is heating up this cooler gas.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.552
And the way that this transfer of

00:04:53.552 --> 00:04:55.154
thermal energy is happening

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:57.627
where it's through the collision of the particles,

00:04:57.627 --> 00:05:01.354
the transfer of kinetic energy to the collision of particles

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:02.724
that's transferred momentum,

00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:04.541
we call this conduction.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.728
We call this thermal conduction,

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:09.406
or I'll just call it conduction.

00:05:09.852 --> 00:05:11.972
Let me write thermal conduction.

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:13.736
I'll do it in a new color.

00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:19.240
So this that is being described is thermal conduction.

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.056
Which is a way that many times

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:24.121
you have experienced heat being transferred.

00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:26.014
For example, you probably have had

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:28.057
the experience of,

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:30.483
if you take a, I don't know,

00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:34.205
you take a pot.

00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:36.933
Lets say you take a pot like this.

00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:39.179
Lets say it's a cold pot at first.

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.687
So its particles, the particles in the pot

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:44.004
have a lower kinetic energy.

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:45.536
So I'm not gonna be able to do all of them.

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:48.061
And then you put it over a fire.

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:49.971
You put it over a fire.

00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:51.573
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:54.337
You put it over a fire.

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:58.220
So this is the fire, this is the fire.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.793
And we're talking about really

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:00.124
just heating up the metal of the pot,

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:02.515
I'm not even concerned about what's in the pot right now.

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:04.791
So this fire is going to heat up,

00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.473
it's gonna heat up the bottom of this pot first.

00:06:07.473 --> 00:06:09.818
And it's actually gonna do it primarily

00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:11.258
through thermal conduction,

00:06:11.258 --> 00:06:14.590
because fire is nothing but super hot air particles

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.983
and those super hot air particles

00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:19.083
are gonna bump in to the metal particles of your pot.

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:21.428
So these metal particles of this pot,

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:25.085
they're kinetic energy is going to start going up.

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.361
So this part of the pot is going to start heating up.

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:30.995
And right when you turn your stove on,

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:33.351
the top of the pot might still be cool,

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.523
but the bottom is going to get hot very fast.

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:37.183
But if you just wait a few minutes,

00:06:37.183 --> 00:06:40.283
these metal particles are gonna keep bouncing

00:06:40.283 --> 00:06:41.850
and vibrating into each other.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.323
And so eventually, the top over here

00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:48.259
is going to get quite hot.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.038
Is going to get quite hot.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:54.621
And the way that the top of this metal got hot

00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.920
it was through thermal conduction

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.160
that the metal of the bottom got hot first,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.786
and then they bounced into their neighbors,

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:02.284
or vibrated into their neighbors

00:07:02.284 --> 00:07:04.060
and transferred some of that kinetic energy.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.451
And so once again you see this transfer of heat

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:10.608
from a higher temperature region,

00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:14.074
to a cooler temperature or lower temperature region.
