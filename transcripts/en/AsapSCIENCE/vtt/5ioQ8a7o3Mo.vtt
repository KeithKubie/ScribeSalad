00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Despite being an O-mazing and near universal phenomenon

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.960
There's still a lot of speculation around the orgasms function and value

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.360
But what are the differences between male and female orgasm that we know of and who has it better

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.480
To start the length of a woman's orgasm is longer than men lasting around 20 seconds or more

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.320
While most men tend to last around 3 to 10 seconds

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.720
but men have more orgasms

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.840
In a national australian survey of heterosexual sex, researchers found that men had an orgasm 95% of encounters

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.720
Wile women did only 69% of the time

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.720
However orgasm might have less to do with gender and more to do with the types of sex you're having

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.500
For example, a study of single americans aged 21 to 26 found that while straight and gay men's  rate of orgams is simiar

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.400
The rate of orgasms rate for women vary very significantly by sexual orientation

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.560
Lebians have around 12% more orgasm than straigh women during sex

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.360
With 25&amp; of gay women saying they climax with every sexual expirience and almost half saying they climax over 75% of the time

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.420
This may be related to the duration of sexual encounters

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.200
As lesbian couples reported an average length of 30 to 45 minutes

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.780
In comparison to the average of 15 to 30 minutes by straight women

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.000
Other explanation point to genetics

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.320
Studies of 4.000 females twins found that genetics predict the thrids of the probabilities that a woman orgasm during sex

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.020
But what about the way an orgasm feels?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.520
Studies of college students asked men and women to describe their expiriences of an orgasm

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.440
and then later took out the words related to specific genitals

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.840
And it turns out that there was very little distinguishable difference between sexes

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.320
Regardless of your gender the brain stimulates blood flow to the genitals and your hearthbeat and breathing increase

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.100
While ... scans show significant differences in activation patterns during sexual arousal

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.380
Brain activity during and orgasm itself , it's the same between men and women

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.360
The lateral orbital frontal cortex which controls self-evaluation, reason and  control shuts down in all genders

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.700
Which makes sense as you often lose control during an orgasm

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.680
And the similarities don't stop there

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.280
Both genders get drowsy after orgasm due to the surge in the sleeping hormone prolactine

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.340
Interestingly 4 times as much prolactin is realeased after intercourse compared to orgasm achieve via masturbation

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.380
Meaning you don't get sleepy after a solo session

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.440
And what we once thought was spontaneous orgams  during sleep otherwise known as wet dreams were only for men

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.100
One study reports that 37% of women have had nocturnal orgasms

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440
30% had had one in the past year

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.020
Even muliple orgasm. A phenomeon thought to be exclusively for  women

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.740
as they lack of refractory period

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.520
has been seen in men as well

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.040
Though men orgasms generally happens simultaneously with ejaculation

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.560
Research has documented that men are capable of non ejaculatory orgasm

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.780
That can occur prior to as well as afer ejaculation

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.660
This shared experience of the orgasm makes sense from a evulationary perspective

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.760
Just like when you see someone cry and feel sad for them because you understand it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.940
Observing or being part of a partner's orgams can enhanse the desire and experience of your own

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.660
If we had completely different orgasms the same connection wouldn't be there

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.240
At the end of the day, while sexual arousal may be different for men and women

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.040
Major difference in orgasm experiences likely come down to the individual level

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.340
Differences in physiology, anatomy and our psychology play huge role

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.500
So get to know your own body to optimize your sexual experiences

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.760
