00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.837
I get a knock at the door,

00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:04.120
and here are two guys in a suit.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.500
"I'm from the FBI."

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.820
The first thing I have to say is,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.200
"What took you guys so long?"

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.158
I told them the truth.

00:00:09.158 --> 00:00:10.974
I was gonna make my own IED,

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:13.100
and I was gonna set it
across the Islamic Center

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.050
over in a bank's parking lot,
and I was gonna dial it in.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.453
And just watch the show.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.010
Growing up, I saw a
movie, and it was "Rambo".

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.843
[Clip]: (gunfire)

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:28.315
Rambo was tough, respected.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.390
[Clip]: "Come on! Move it!"

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.293
He had intestinal fortitude.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.870
I said, "That's what I want to do."

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.820
I went off and joined the Marine Corps.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.750
I wanted the action.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.350
The first time I got shot at,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.810
I remember looking at my watch

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.980
and I says, "Man, this time last year,"

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.650
"I was in English class."

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.570
But I fought several
times in the Middle East,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.750
Desert Shield, Desert Storm,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.130
South America, Philippines, Somalia.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.080
I think the worst things that
I have seen is dead children.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.383
I had to suck it up. I had
to be there for my guys.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.342
Each one of those tear drops

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:04.950
stands for a confirmed kill.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.103
I stopped adding after 26.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.140
What I was taught in the Marine Corps,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.330
"Just own it, and then let it go."

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.060
But there comes a time when
there's too much of that,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.780
and you can't turn it off anymore.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.790
[Interviewer] I want you to
give me a window into your state

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.313
of mind at that time.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.290
One time, my wife and I went to a DSW,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.610
and I saw, in the
distance, these two women

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.593
in black burkas. In my store.

00:01:40.643 --> 00:01:45.643
I cried as I prayed for
enough strength to go over

00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:47.593
there and break both their necks.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.480
I was just angry, I was just full of hate

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.860
and it just fed off itself.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.790
At that point, I was
drinking a half gallon

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.253
of vodka every two days.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.500
I had devised a plan: create
my own IED, homemade bomb,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.280
and I was gonna set it off right outside

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.703
the Muncie Islamic Center.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.113
200-plus killed or
injured, that was the plan.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.550
I saw an opportunity to do one last thing

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.140
for my country. This was my rationale.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.040
I knew I would end up in a federal prison

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.420
with a needle in my arm, I didn't care.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.300
My hatred of Islam, it was the only thing

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.600
that was keeping me alive.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.360
So one day my daughter comes home,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.500
second grade maybe, she was telling me

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.940
about this little boy
who sat across from her.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.200
His mom came to get him.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.870
She said she had scarves on her

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.340
and she had a dress all
the way down to her feet,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.070
and you couldn't see
nothing but her eyeballs.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.480
At that point, I snapped.
Started spewing things

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150
out of my mouth that should never be said

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.890
in front of children or anything.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180
She didn't say anything, it
was the look on her face.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.880
I remember my daughter
looking at me like I was

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.970
absolutely the craziest person
on the face of the earth.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.270
She was my little buddy, she
used to say we were road dogs.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.390
I know, I saw it in her eyes, I made

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.720
her question that love, and that's when

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.650
a light bulb came on.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.540
I decided to give the people

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.933
of this community one more chance.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.300
So I went to the Islamic
Center, see a gentleman

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.890
in a shoe room taking off his shoes,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.510
he looks at me and he smiles.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.940
He said, "Can I help you?"

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.250
And I said, "Yeah, I want
you to teach me about Islam."

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.890
So he went and he gave me a Qur'an.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.660
"Read this, come back
when you have questions."

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.370
So I did, and I would
see things in the book,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.050
I'd be like, "There it is,
I got him right there."

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.080
"Explain that to me."

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.913
And they would.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.110
This was a kind of awakening.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.250
Long story short, eight weeks after

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.050
that first day I stepped
into the Islamic Center,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.487
I became a Muslim.

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:09.181
I am a Muslim, a veteran,
and a proud American.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.660
I had learned that I was completely wrong

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.856
about everything that I felt.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.750
You know, Judaism had a message,
Christianity had a message,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.940
Islam had a message.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.080
Funny thing is, though,
it was the same message.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.330
It was about peace, and it was about love.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.311
[Clip]: "Please join me in
welcoming Mr. McKinney."

00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:29.760
[Clip]: (applause)

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.140
My big thing is, now, to stop the hate.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.910
[Clip]: "Nothing good has
ever come down to hatred."

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.365
I've done too many things.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.433
I've hurt a lot of people.
I have to live with that.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.770
But if I can stop
somebody else on the path

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.937
of non-forgiveness, I won.
