00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.690
Why we Sing Auld Lang Syne on New Year’s
Eve

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.879
This tradition is mostly thanks to Guy Lombardo
and the Royal Canadian Band.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.430
While their work is largely unknown to those
born in the last few decades, the band has

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.510
sold over 300 million records to date.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.510
Guy Lombardo himself has three stars on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he was once the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.210
“Dick Clark” of New Years before Clark
and his “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve,”

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.590
attempting to appeal to younger audiences,
started supplanting “Mr. New Year’s Eve,”

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.590
Guy Lombardo.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.820
It was in 1929 that Guy Lombardo and his band
took the stage at the Roosevelt Hotel in New

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.710
York City on New Year’s Eve.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.059
Their performance that night was being broadcast
on the radio, before midnight Eastern-time

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.920
on CBS, then after on NBC radio.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.350
At midnight, as a transition between the broadcasts,
the song they chose to play was an old Scottish

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.910
folk song Lombardo had first heard from Scottish
immigrants in Ontario.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.530
The song was Auld Lang Syne.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.420
Previous to this, there are several documented
instances of others singing this song on New

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.220
Year’s Eve, going all the way back to the
mid-nineteenth century, but it wasn’t anywhere

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.800
close to the staple it would soon be after
Lombardo’s performance.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.750
The next year, and every year thereafter,
all the way to 1976, with Lombardo dying at

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.230
the age of 75 in 1977, they played it at midnight
on New Year’s Eve at first broadcast out

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.440
on the radio and later on TV.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:45.409
Thanks to “Mr. New Year’s Eve” and his
band, it’s still tradition 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.200
to this day.
