00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.422
What does the French Revolution

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:14.460
have to do with the time NASA accidentally
crashed a $200 million orbiter

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.452
into the surface of Mars?

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:19.781
Actually, everything.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.622
That crash happened due to an error

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.657
in converting between 
two measurement systems,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.163
U.S. customary units

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:29.324
and their S.I, or metric, equivalence.

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:31.936
So what's the connection to
the French Revolution?

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:33.453
Let's explain.

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:35.672
For the majority of recorded 
human history,

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:40.493
units like the weight of a grain
or the length of a hand weren't exact

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:42.693
and varied from place to place.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:45.682
And different regions didn't just use
varying measurements.

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:49.173
They had completely different 
number systems as well.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:52.304
By the late Middle Ages,
the Hindu-Arabic decimal system

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:56.773
mostly replaced Roman numerals 
and fractions in Europe,

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:01.592
but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins
to promote standard decimal-based measures

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:03.383
were less successful.

00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:06.683
With a quarter million different units
in France alone,

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:11.256
any widespread change would require
massive disruption.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:14.837
And in 1789, that disruption came.

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:19.264
The leaders of the French Revolution
didn't just overthrow the monarchy.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.223
They sought to completely 
transform society

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.703
according to the rational principles
of the Enlightenment.

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:27.343
When the new government took power,

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:32.574
the Academy of Sciences convened
to reform the system of measurements.

00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:37.095
Old standards based on arbitrary authority
or local traditions

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:41.343
were replaced with mathematical
and natural relationships.

00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:44.695
For example, the meter,
from the Greek word for measure,

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:49.853
was defined as 1/10,000,000
between the Equator and North Pole.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:53.955
And the new metric system was,
in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet,

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:57.846
"For all people, for all time."

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.664
Standardizing measurements
had political advantages

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.045
for the Revolutionaries as well.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:08.285
Nobles could no longer manipulate local
units to extract more rent from commoners,

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.046
while the government could collect
taxes more efficiently.

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:15.617
And switching to a new Republican Calendar
with ten-day weeks

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:20.065
reduced church power 
by eliminating Sundays.

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:22.805
Adoption of this new system wasn't easy.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:25.125
In fact, it was a bit of a mess.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:29.016
At first, people used new units
alongside old ones,

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.718
and the Republican Calendar 
was eventually abandoned.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.487
When Napoléon Bonaparte took power,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:38.016
he allowed small businesses 
to use traditional measurements

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.256
redefined in metric terms.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:43.686
But the metric system remained standard
for formal use,

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:48.085
and it spread across the continent,
along with France's borders.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.806
While Napoléon's empire 
lasted eight years,

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:53.777
its legacy endured far longer.

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:58.276
Some European countries reverted
to old measurements upon independence.

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:01.069
Others realized the value 
of standardization

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.837
in an age of international trade.

00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:08.037
After Portugal and the Netherlands
switched to metric voluntarily,

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:09.955
other nations followed,

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.328
with colonial empires spreading the system
around the world.

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:15.818
As France's main rival,

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:21.299
Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas
and retained its traditional units.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.598
But over the next two centuries,
the British Empire slowly transitioned,

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:28.869
first approving the metric system
as an optional alternative

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.428
before gradually making it offical.

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:35.638
However, this switch came too late
for thirteen former colonies

00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:38.288
that had already gained independence.

00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:42.947
The United States of America stuck with
the English units of its colonial past

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:45.728
and today remains one 
of only three countries

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:48.677
which haven't fully embraced 
the metric system.

00:03:48.677 --> 00:03:51.539
Despite constant initiatives 
for metrication,

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:56.509
many Americans consider units like feet
and pounds more intuitive.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.328
And ironically, some regard the once
revolutionary metric system

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:03.509
as a symbol of global conformity.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:09.650
Nevertheless, the metric system is almost
universally used in science and medicine,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.850
and it continues to evolve according
to its original principles.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.948
For a long time,

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:19.509
standard units were actually defined by 
carefully maintained physical prototypes.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.608
But thanks to improving technology
and precision,

00:04:22.608 --> 00:04:26.899
these objects with limited access
and unreliable longevity

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.429
are now being replaced with standards
based on universal constants,

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.914
like the speed of light.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:37.520
Consistent measurements are such
an integral part of our daily lives

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.940
that it's hard to appreciate what a major
accomplishment for humanity they've been.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.879
And just as it arose 
from a political revolution,

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.231
the metric system remains crucial
for the scientific revolutions to come.
