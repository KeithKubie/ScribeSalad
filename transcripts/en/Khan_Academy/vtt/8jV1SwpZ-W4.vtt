00:00:00.828 --> 00:00:02.332
Voiceover: Where we left off in the

00:00:02.332 --> 00:00:05.259
last video, Benjamin Franklin was born.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.013
He was the tenth son to a
Puritan father in Boston.

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:11.805
He eventually ends up
working for his brother

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:15.837
as an apprentice at age 12
but then runs away at 17.

00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:17.164
Voiceover: Right, he runs away.

00:00:17.164 --> 00:00:19.549
He had written the Silence Dogood Essays.

00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:21.709
His brother had caught him writing

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.512
these essays under the
pseudonym Silence Dogood

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:27.005
and Franklin didn't want
to remain an apprentice,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.054
even though he was bound to do so.

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:31.132
So he runs away in the nighttime.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:36.574
He gets on a boat in
Boston, sails, originally

00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:40.738
to New York and, after a few
days, decides to continue

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:45.246
on to Philadelphia, going
up the Philadelphia Bay,

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:47.918
the Delaware Bay, and then into the river

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:51.680
and onto the Market Street
Wharf of Philadelphia.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.849
There's a famous scene of him arriving.

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:56.744
Voiceover: 17 years old, 19, 22.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:57.762
Voiceover: 17 years old.

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:02.912
Bedraggled, wet, he has only
a few coins in his pocket.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:05.504
When he arrives at the wharf, he gives

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:07.871
one of the coins to the boatman as a tip.

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:10.831
When you're really poor, you
don't want people to know

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:14.240
you're poor so you pretend
to be a little bit richer.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.511
There it is, Franklin already caring

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.777
about his public
relations and caring about

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:21.985
sort of being a typical American.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.597
Sort of saying, "I
don't want to look poor.

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:25.855
"I'm going to be a generous guy."

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:31.169
In marching up Market Street,
he buys three puffy rolls

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:33.487
and he's all wet and bedraggled.

00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:37.633
He passes a doorway,
there's a 15 year old girl

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:42.450
named Deborah Reed and
she sort of laughs at him,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.955
thinks he makes a
ridiculous looking figure.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:49.281
We know this because,
years later, when he was

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:52.562
65 years old, he writes
his autobiography and

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:56.113
there's this scene in it of
him arriving in Philadelphia.

00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:58.947
I think it's the best and,
certainly the most famous,

00:01:58.947 --> 00:02:01.283
scene in autobiographical literature,

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:04.444
which is Ben Franklin's
arrival in Philadelphia.

00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:07.873
You see him discussing his arrival and,

00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:10.881
as you look at the manuscript
of the autobiography,

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:15.538
he writes in the fact that his wife,
who must have told him this later,

00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:17.236
"Hey, I was laughing at you and thought

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.611
"you made a ridiculous figure."

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:22.099
Later on, Franklin writes in
the third draft that he's doing

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.755
of the autobiography,
"As I certainly did."

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:29.172
He's being sort of self aware
and self deprecating but also

00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:32.759
very proud, because here
he's saying rags to riches.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.836
I was in rags, I was bedraggled.

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:38.452
Even the person I ended up
marrying was laughing at me,

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:40.773
and then I became a great success.

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:42.853
Voiceover: And pretty
immediately he wants to marry her

00:02:42.853 --> 00:02:43.782
but it doesn't work that way.

00:02:43.782 --> 00:02:46.740
Voiceover: Right, he decides
to propose marriage to her

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.085
Her father was a tradesman, a pretty
successful merchant in Philadelphia

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:56.678
But Benjamin Franklin, first of all
he's 17, and he was truly a 17 year old

00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.525
Meaning, he may have been very
wise and could write very well

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.375
but he had a lot of
adventures, let us say.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:06.903
And at one point he has to go to
England to get the printing material.

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:11.750
The typesets, the printing presses,
that he needs to become a printer.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.519
Voiceover: He wants to become a printer

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.365
but he obviously needs equipment.

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:14.535
Voiceover: Right, he didn't have equipment

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:17.302
he was working for somebody
else who was a printer

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:20.406
and he wanted to start
up a rival print shop

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:21.799
and somebody said "I'll stake you,

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.122
I'll give you money, you go
to London, you buy the press".

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:28.070
But the guy that was going to
stake him ends up pulling out

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.586
Doesn't really stake him. Franklin
arrives in London with no money.

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:35.576
So, he works for almost two years
in London to make enough money

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:37.416
to buy the printing equipment.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:40.632
While he's over there, first
of all he's having a good time.

00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:44.666
He has many girlfriends and maybe
writing a letter every now and then

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.777
to his young friend Deborah
back in Philadelphia.

00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:52.776
But she ends up getting getting
married, she doesn't wait for him.

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.432
And it's a real mess
because she gets married,

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.944
Franklin comes back from London

00:03:57.944 --> 00:04:00.665
and then her husband disappears.

00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:04.329
So, she's not really
divorced, but she's not

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.793
really single, and she's
not really married.

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:12.745
And so they eventually enter
into a Common-law marriage

00:04:12.745 --> 00:04:13.770
because they couldn't get married

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.265
in the church because she was technically

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:20.281
still married. And he,
as I said, was having fun

00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:23.929
as a young 20 year old and he had his own

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:27.544
illegitimate child, a son named William.

00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:30.298
But unlike a lot of people of that period

00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:31.978
who had illegitimate children,

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:34.250
he immediately took responsibility.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.043
He decides he's going to
raise William himself.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.467
And so, Deborah is not
only willing to enter

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:41.003
into the Common-law marriage,

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:43.579
but also help raise his
son, William Franklin.

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.459
Voiceover: So this pretty,
especially for that period

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.300
in time, on both sides. She was

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.839
officially married in
the eyes of the church.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.636
That's why they had to get
a purely legal marriage.

00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:59.196
And he has an illegitimate child,

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:04.939
returns. This is in 1730, so he's still a

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:06.605
fairly young man and she's even younger.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.717
He's 24 and she's 22 at this point.

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:12.618
Voiceover: Right, right. It was a somewhat

00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:14.285
unconventional type of family.

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.877
Throughout his life he had that.

00:05:16.877 --> 00:05:18.848
It's hard to know what to make of the

00:05:18.848 --> 00:05:21.324
relationship between Deborah Reed,

00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:23.323
who never, as far as we can tell,

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.541
and I've researched this a lot,

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.477
never left Philadelphia.

00:05:26.477 --> 00:05:28.318
Probably never spent the night more than

00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:30.255
four blocks from Market Street.

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:32.493
Where as you'll see from Franklin's life

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:35.677
he's in London, he's in
Paris, he's in Boston,

00:05:35.677 --> 00:05:37.566
he goes up and down the coast of America

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:40.254
during the postal
system. And yet they have

00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:45.696
a very friendly, even
loving, relationship.

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.918
But not what we would call a normal,

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:49.119
conventional marriage.

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.022
Voiceover: Fascinating.

00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:53.903
He's starting to establish himself now.

00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:57.102
He comes back, he's got
some money saved up.

00:05:57.102 --> 00:05:58.735
He's got the equipment, and this is when

00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:00.558
he really starts to establish himself as

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:03.326
the Benjamin Franklin
most people remember.

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:05.600
Voiceover: Well he
becomes one of our first

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.784
successful small business owners.

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.304
Soon it becomes a big business.

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:12.479
He has a print shop in Philadelphia.

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.712
If you have a print
shop, you end up needing

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:17.087
some content to print in order to be good.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:18.976
So he starts a newspaper, which

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:20.654
was the 'Pennsylvania Gazette'.

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:22.353
Unlike the other newspapers, there are

00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:24.240
a lot of other newspapers
in this small town,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.128
maybe nine or ten of them.

00:06:26.128 --> 00:06:28.625
But one of them is affiliated
with the Anglicans.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.305
Another is affiliated with the Quakers.

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.367
Another with the Proprietors,
they were called.

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:35.857
The Penn Family, who
owned most of the land.

00:06:35.857 --> 00:06:39.377
Franklin decides to start
an independent newspaper

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:43.971
with a spunky independent,
very freedom-loving

00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.232
American voice and he writes it with a lot

00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:50.194
of pseudonyms again, in his newspaper.

00:06:50.194 --> 00:06:53.235
Writes stories under
different people's names,

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:56.097
including Polly Baker, a woman he invents

00:06:56.097 --> 00:06:58.821
who tells a story of how she had

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.924
illegitimate children but raised them all.

00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:04.019
So he gets into the politics of..

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:05.201
Voiceover: I love the social justice here

00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:06.914
Voiceover: Social justice a bit,

00:07:06.914 --> 00:07:08.979
but done with a real sense of humor

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.204
as Polly Baker is standing in front

00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:13.010
of the court, saying "Hey, I'm doing

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.882
"good for this colony. And by the way,"

00:07:14.882 --> 00:07:16.306
"some of you in the corner are the reason"

00:07:16.306 --> 00:07:17.538
I have these illegitimate children."

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:18.642
(laughs)

00:07:18.642 --> 00:07:20.804
So it's a very funny fictional piece,

00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:24.115
it has a little social
justice undercurrent.

00:07:24.115 --> 00:07:26.131
The other thing he does, because he

00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:27.124
wants a successful print shop, is he

00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:31.300
needs books to print. And he realizes

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.387
printing the Bible is
not really a smart idea.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.027
People buy the Bible
just once in their life,

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:40.564
maybe twice. He should print an almanack.

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:43.413
Because people buy an almanack every year.

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:46.085
So in 1733 he starts what's called

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.957
'Poor Richard's Almanack'.

00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:49.685
Voiceover: Just to take a step back here.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.644
I remember almanacks and I'm assuming

00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:54.646
they are still printed. But, I would

00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:55.892
guess some of the younger listeners

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.805
to this will have no
idea what an almanack is.

00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:00.854
Voiceover: Imagine the World Wide Web

00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:02.262
but in a pocketbook form.

00:08:02.262 --> 00:08:03.894
It came out every year, it told you the

00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:05.334
population of every city.

00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:06.597
It predicted the weather. It told

00:08:06.597 --> 00:08:09.078
you what the weather was
like the year before.

00:08:09.078 --> 00:08:11.991
It gave you the horoscopes and the way

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:14.901
the moon phases and
the sun rises would be.

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.110
But it also had wonderful little lessons.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.430
It told you how to remove
stains from fabrics.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.182
When Tim Berners-Lee
invents the World Wide Web

00:08:24.182 --> 00:08:26.887
He says it's because he
remembered an almanack

00:08:26.887 --> 00:08:29.175
an almanack of the same
period as Ben Franklin's

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.238
Poor Richard's Almanack that was called

00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:33.718
Inquire Within Upon Everything.

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:35.975
So the first name for the web was Inquire.

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:37.959
It was a system written to be an almanack

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.367
but do it electronically.

00:08:39.367 --> 00:08:43.241
Voiceover: Why is it not called
'Ben Franklin's Almanack'?

00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.557
Voiceover: Ben Franklin
very often, as I've said,

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:47.255
wrote under a pseudonym. Sometimes he

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.977
did it to disguise and be anonymous,

00:08:49.977 --> 00:08:52.295
just like we invent pseudonyms when we are

00:08:52.295 --> 00:08:54.088
on Twitter or something.

00:08:54.088 --> 00:08:56.856
On the other hand, everybody knew who

00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:59.594
Poor Richard was. It was sold at Ben

00:08:59.594 --> 00:09:00.871
Franklin's print shop.

00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:03.225
Everybody knew he was
Poor Richard Saunders.

00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:08.056
But it gave him a way to
poke fun, be humorous.

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.264
Poor Richard Saunders
even pokes fun at his

00:09:10.264 --> 00:09:12.729
printer, meaning poke fun at Ben Franklin.

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:15.372
Saying he has all these rattling traps and

00:09:15.372 --> 00:09:17.514
needs to make money out
of them, so he's using

00:09:17.514 --> 00:09:19.818
me to make money, that sort of thing.

00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:22.905
And we even get some of
the famous old maxims

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.049
because Franklin liked
to put in the margin

00:09:25.049 --> 00:09:28.250
of his almanack 'Poor Richard's Sayings'.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.537
And you may remember some of them.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.403
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

00:09:33.403 --> 00:09:37.257
"Early to bed and early to rise makes
a man healthy, wealthy and wise."

00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:41.131
And there were about 150 of these over the

00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:43.685
years that become quite
famous, some of which

00:09:43.685 --> 00:09:45.946
he adopted from other people's writings.

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:50.267
But, he just knew how to
make them clever and pithy.

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:52.747
And becomes the most successful almanack

00:09:52.747 --> 00:09:54.170
ever printed in America.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.100
Thousands and thousands of copies, so he

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.524
ends up franchising other
people in other cities

00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:03.371
to create print shops, to
do Poor Richard's Almanack.

00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:06.827
One of the coolest things
he does, as a media guy

00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:10.572
he has printing press, he has the content,

00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:12.909
he decides he needs a distribution system.

00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:16.541
So he helps create the
American Colonial Postal System

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:19.101
to tie together all of his print shops

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:21.693
and send the newspapers back and forth.

00:10:21.693 --> 00:10:24.364
And to help the printing
businesses of all of

00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:26.830
his friends and apprentices and relatives

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.428
up and down the coast of the colonies

00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:29.919
be tied together.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:31.053
Voiceover: This is no small thing.

00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:33.213
You're saying he's
constructing the postal system.

00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:36.541
Voiceover: The US
Colonial Postal System is

00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:40.925
primarily brought together
by Benjamin Franklin

00:10:40.925 --> 00:10:43.614
as a printer in Philadelphia in order to

00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:47.022
tie together the various printing shops

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:49.199
in the colonies that
were usually run by his

00:10:49.199 --> 00:10:51.855
friends and relatives, and to distribute

00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:53.646
the content, like Poor Richard's Almanack.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:54.968
Voiceover: Fascinating.
