00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.303
I had a family come backstage
one time

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.374
with their grandmother,
this older woman.

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.311
They were all very nice
and there was a pause

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.147
and she said, "So, how long
have you been in vaudeville?"

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:21.755
I was like,
"Wow, I guess since 1910.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.857
I don't know how to answer
that question."

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:34.902
Seems like having kids is a
good way to make good decisions,

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.637
to force yourself
into good decisions.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:37.871
Did you find that?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.774
Like it really got you
to straighten up?

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.211
Yeah. I mean, as soon as I knew
our son was gonna be born,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.616
that's when I got life insurance
and all that sort of thing

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.718
because it's not
about you anymore.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.720
It's like there's this
other human being

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:58.058
who demands that I be
a better person than I am prior

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.760
to knowing
that I have a child coming.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.595
It forces you to step up
to the plate.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.263
You know, you meet people
out on the road

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:07.601
and especially right after
your first child is born

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.369
and they go, "I've got
a little one at home too."

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.471
Then they show you
a picture of their dog,

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.609
and it's always a little awkward
when you go,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.545
"Are we really talking
about the same thing?"

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.414
Or your baby is very ugly.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.320
Right. But you go,
and you're trying to be polite,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.889
"Oh, wow.
So, we're sharing in this thing.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.959
Yeah. You got a dog
and I have a human.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.661
I have a little baby human."

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.631
Yeah, the whole dog
as babies things.

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:41.134
I mean, my dogs definitely gave
me a new sort of responsibility

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.036
that I didn't feel prior
to having dogs

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.106
but I would never put them
on the same level as that.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.674
Even, I will go as far to say,

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.610
when I talk about having dogs
and then someone comes up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.313
and shows me a picture
of their dog, I don't care.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.850
I don't know that
I've ever seen a dog

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.618
that I've really
been like, "Wow."

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.221
Sorry Noa.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.589
I realize there's people
in the room

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.424
that will show me their dogs.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:07.127
And I know you don't care
about my dog and I still,

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.729
even when I'm showing
the picture,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.165
I do know there's
no way you care.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.035
It's hard to be taken aback
at a photo of a dog,

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.004
where you go, "Oh my God!"

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.406
I know.
Unless they're doing something-

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.942
I think it'd be easier for me
with the dog than the baby.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.610
Like if a stranger showing you
their baby, it's like,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.178
"Yeah, that's just another
stranger you're showing me.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:26.380
I don't care."

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.614
Yeah, like it's a new-

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.183
Which is weird as well.
I get that.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.185
Like I remember looking
at pictures of babies

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.621
before I had one and I go,
"Why are you showing me ..."

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.323
What am I supposed to say?

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:40.293
It's a day old, it's got
a hat on, and a blanket.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.896
I just see this
squished up face.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.231
What do you want me to say?

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:45.465
What do you say?

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.034
Looking good. Killing it.
Your baby's killing it.

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:48.268
Your baby's so-

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:51.238
Wow, look at that baby with the
little nose and everything.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.241
Yeah, what is the best ...

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.210
'Cause I always
hit that scenario

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.346
when someone's showing me
a newborn baby and I go,

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.881
"You haven't
prepared for this."

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.750
You know this is coming,
let's think of some lines.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.386
Like what are the best ...?
"Looks fresh.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.024
Oh my God,
that baby looks so young."

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.225
That thing looks new.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.195
That's a compliment, right?
To say you look young.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.697
Yeah, that is good.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.498
They don't look like a parent,
so you can't be like,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.600
"Oh, she looks silly."

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.835
She looks rested.
Rested.

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:23.804
Maybe something like that.

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:26.339
But then you go to the other
extreme where,

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.009
when it is your kid,
it's a whole different thing.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.479
I remember looking
at the sonogram pictures

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.181
of my son and going,

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.316
"I think he kinda
looks like me."

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:42.155
He's not even out here yet
and I already see a resemblance.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.392
Yeah, I sometimes just go,

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.595
"I can only imagine
what this means to you."

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.731
I acknowledge
that this is something

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.101
that I can't possibly understand

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.069
how much you love showing me
this picture right now,

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.005
but I'm so happy for you
that you're feeling that,

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.707
you new dad.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.111
'Cause you can't get there
'cause it's just ...

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:06.379
And everyone was a baby.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.717
Every single person has been
a baby and had people go,

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.255
"Awawa." Like everyone.
I always think about that.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.725
I did a standup bit about it
but like every baby

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.660
is just gonna be some guy.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.028
I know, isn't that weird.

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.363
When you look
at a little baby and go,

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:26.700
"One day, that thing might
be holding an attache case."

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:33.540
That little baby's gonna have
a three-piece suit on

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.910
and going to work.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.546
That baby's gonna be in line
at TJ Max some day

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.916
debating over
that weird popcorn they have.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.818
That's gonna be
that baby's future.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.154
"Should I get it.
Does anybody want this?"

00:04:47.154 --> 00:04:48.421
Is it stale.
Yeah, it looks stale.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.656
Why are they selling it?

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.658
You can looking at a baby
and think,

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.161
"At some point
in that baby's life,

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:56.163
he's gonna be saying
'Get off my lawn!'"

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.268
Or like any little girl ...
Whenever I see a little girl

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.303
that's just full of wonder
and adorable,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.472
I'm just like, "She, one day,
is gonna be like,

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.174
'Why isn't he texting me back?'"

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.076
I want to just grab little girls
and be like,

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:13.446
"It's gonna be okay. You're
gonna go through so much."

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.981
And I know boys
go through heartbreak too,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.551
but for some reason
little girls, I'm just like,

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.252
"You're gonna get screwed
over so much,"

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.887
and I want to warn them
and that's just never-

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.923
Wait, we're supposed
to text people back?

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.760
If you don't know who Brian
Regan is,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.296
what is wrong with you?
Right Chad Zumock?

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.898
I think every young comic
or every comic has

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.133
Googled Brian Regan.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.670
We've all watched you
just learning how we stink.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.271
Well, no. No, no, Brian Regan

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.507
is someone that you should not
watch as a new comic

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.943
because it will depress
you so much

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.845
because you will compare
yourself and you'll say,

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.315
"I will never be that."
He's one of those people

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.585
that everyone becomes obsessed
with so early on

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:52.852
because he is the best.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.488
Then you get,
even now as a comic

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.958
who's been doing it 16 years,
I watch him and I get depressed.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.727
So, you got to pick and choose
because I'm just like,

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.863
"I will never be that."
That is how great Brian Regan
is.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.633
I'm sorry to just keep going
and make you sit here awkwardly.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.335
No, it's very, very, very nice.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.304
But it's true.
I just love you

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.106
and I'm so excited
that you're here right now.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.541
Thank you.
That is very, very kind.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.810
I'm that no matter
what I say next,

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.713
people at home are gonna go,
"That didn't sound very funny."

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.514
Yep, that's always what happens.

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.819
I mean, how often
does that happen to you?

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:28.788
No, that's incredibly
kind words.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.323
-Well, it's true.
-Thank you very much.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:31.558
And you deserve it.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.293
You know Ron Bennington?

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.561
The great Ron Bennington.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.830
The great Ron Bennington,
he thought it would be funny

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.032
one time
to bring me up with an intro

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.734
that no one
could possibly follow.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.838
This was in a comedy club,
he goes,

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.706
"Ladies and gentlemen,
this next comedian,

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.041
I don't know how to say this,

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:51.811
but I'm telling you right now,
within 10 seconds,

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.813
you will literally
fall off your chairs.

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.182
You will be on your back

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.285
laughing at the top
of your lungs.

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:02.222
I guarantee you within
10 seconds you're gonna go,

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.057
'This is the absolute
funniest guy

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.426
I've ever seen in my life.'"

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:09.529
So, I went on stage and,
of course, bombed after that.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:10.797
I could possibly
follow that?

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:11.998
10 seconds.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:15.702
10 second rule. You get
your money back if you don't-

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:16.970
I love that.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.204
He was just being playful.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:19.472
That's so funny.
But it was fun.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.174
One of the worst intros
I ever heard,

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.209
and I'll never forget it
because as soon as I heard it

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.111
I was like,
"Remember this forever,"

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.746
was in Mason City, Illinois,

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.281
the smallest comedy club
I've ever been to.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.516
Yes, Mason City Limits.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:30.784
You've been there?
Yeah.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.152
Mason City Limits.
It was like an old ...

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:33.353
It's not around anymore.

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:34.621
Yeah, it was like a restaurant.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:35.889
I mean, this town was literally

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.891
a couple hundred people
in this town in Illinois.

00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.994
The guy brought up a guest spot,
and he goes,

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:44.197
"And this next guy just sent off
a tape to Letterman

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.733
and we wish him a lot
of luck with that. Keep going."

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:49.969
And this guys ...
Sent off the tape

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:55.575
and we wish him
a lot of luck with that.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:56.843
That's so good.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:01.614
One of the ones I heard
was an emcee asked a comedian,

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:02.882
"What should I say about you?"

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.819
And the guy said,
"Tell him that I'm ..."

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.021
This was back when
Star Search was on.

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.690
"Tell him that
I might be auditioning

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.727
for Star Search
in six months.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:21.568
Wow, this guy,
he might be auditioning

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:24.070
for Star Search
in six months.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:27.874
He hasn't made up his mind
but it might happen.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:31.945
It might happen that he might
audition for Star Search.

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.547
I got one the other day
where this guy was like,

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:35.782
"Alright, your
next comic ...

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.917
I've actually never
heard of this guy.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:39.819
Let's give it up for Tom.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.456
I've never heard of this guy
but I've heard he's good."

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.826
You couldn't have just ...
It's so good.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:50.497
Richie Minervini, very funny
comedian from Long Island.

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.265
When I first went out
on the road, he had told me,

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.466
"Hey, if ..."

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.235
'Cause he ran a club
in Long Island.

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.103
He said, "If you're ever
in town, give me a call."

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:00.040
So, I decided to go out
and try to get into comedy clubs

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.474
and I gave him a call

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.109
and there was a bunch
of comedians on the show

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.345
and he gets on stage
and his intro of me was,

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.113
"You know how like sometimes
you come somebody,

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:08.348
you meet them, and you say,

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:11.751
'Hey man, if you're ever
in town, give me a call,'

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:14.921
and you expect that's
kind of the end of that.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:20.593
Well, this next guy, he called.
So, please welcome Brian Regan."

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:28.835
I actually love that story
because that's true.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.270
It was so funny.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.106
Most of the time when you say,
"Hey, if you ..."

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.642
'Cause I do that a lot to comics
I meet on the road

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.744
and emcees I work with.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.179
And I go,
"If you ever want a guest set

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.147
or if I'm ever in a town
where you happen to be,

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.983
you got one. Just follow up."
I really do mean it,

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.920
but so few people
actually are the squeaky wheel

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.322
and ask for things
when there's opportunities.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.792
And when people
do ask me for things,

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.462
I always at least
give them one shot.

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.663
I'll go, "Yeah."

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:59.365
Even if I've never heard of you,
for a guest set, if I can give,

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:03.636
I will give it because
I like people who ask for things

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:07.307
and believe in themselves.
Were you like that coming up?

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:10.677
It sounds like if there was
an opportunity, you called,

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.946
you would drive out of your way
to go do gigs, I mean.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.614
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna date myself

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:20.186
but when I first went out
to try to get into comedy clubs,

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:25.525
you had to go to the club.
This was pre-VHS tape.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.528
I remember when VHS tapes
came around

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:30.663
and people were going,
"Now you can just send a tape."

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.065
And I'm like,
"You got to be kidding me."

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:35.602
I literally would take Greyhound
buses to every comedy club

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:36.903
I could get to and go on

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:39.606
and just do a guest set
and see if they would book me.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:44.444
But it was thrilling. That was
part of what was thrilling.

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:45.678
It was fun.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.081
I'm this young guy
and I'm taking buses

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.983
to these little obscure towns
and going on

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.719
at the Chuckle House
in some goofy little city

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.989
and seeing if they'd book me.
That's how I had to do it.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:11:00.260
I agree. I think I look back
so often on those bus trips

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.961
and staying in comedy condos

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.664
and showing up at clubs
and not knowing who to talk to.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.865
Way to describe my career.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.034
I mean, yeah,
your current career.

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:13.439
But you look back and you go,
"It didn't seem bad back then."

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.876
People can kind of,
"Oh, struggling on the road,"

00:11:16.876 --> 00:11:18.378
but it never felt like work.

00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:21.080
Now doing that,
I would never do those things

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.982
because my time is worth more.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:28.154
But back then, it was exciting,
it was fun,

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:29.589
and it was what we loved to do.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:32.592
You're right.
'Cause it's adventurous.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.228
I remember being on
an overnight Greyhound bus

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.397
and you're just sitting there
and your brain

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.566
is going off in a million
different directions

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:41.167
and I could hear the woman
behind me

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.468
talking to the guy next to her,

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.237
it was like three
in the morning.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:47.974
She said, "I know my brother
killed somebody."

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:53.846
And I'm like, "I don't want
to be hearing this."

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:57.917
Am I supposed to get up
and go to the bus driver and go,

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.620
"Hey, call the police,"
or do I just let this go?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.955
And I let it go.

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:03.890
So there's an unsolved murder
out there

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:09.696
and I think I'm the one that
could have put that guy away.

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:15.668
God, yeah. The people
you encounter, the weirdos.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.337
Some of the conversations
you have.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.806
'Cause yeah, I was just thinking
of you in those buses back then.

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.375
I mean, yesterday
I went to the airport

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.811
and I had a full day of travel
with a connection.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.014
My flight was at 7:30
leaving LA,

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.750
got into New York
at 7:00 at night.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.754
Right before I checked my bags,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.489
I wanted to add some stuff
to my luggage.

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:39.459
So, I take it out and I put it
all in and I check my luggage

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.995
and I'm going through security
and I'm like,

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.163
"Oh, where's my phone?
Oh no, oh no."

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:46.799
I just knew that
it was in my luggage

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.001
that's checked
and I'm like,

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.504
"I have to go this whole day
without my phone."

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:56.275
Thankfully, I didn't know this,
you can go back to the desk

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.978
and they go rummage through
your luggage for you

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:00.346
if you tell them
what to look for.

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.648
Oh, that's a good tip.

00:13:01.648 --> 00:13:02.882
I thought it was long gone.

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.817
I was like, "Well, I'm just
gonna go throughout my day

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:08.254
without it and hopefully connect
on the plane,"

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.590
like be able to get
my Bluetooth somehow.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.858
Just scream at Alexa
or Siri.

00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:13.092
That would be a miracle.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:14.794
I would rather lose a family
member than my phone.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.262
I'm being honest with you.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:19.399
It feels that devastating but I
was kind of accepting like,

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.800
"I'm just gonna go
through my day

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.570
without podcasts
or my white-noise machine.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.674
Everything that's on phone,"
but that used to be the way.

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:30.877
I mean, you were just alone
with your thoughts.

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.246
Yeah, and listening to people.

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:34.947
And listening to people, yeah.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:39.385
I remember being on one of those
long Greyhound rides.

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.088
I'm saying some of these bus
rides were-

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.356
You got status with Greyhound.

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:44.691
Longer than 24 ...
I know, you got points.

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:45.958
First class.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.328
I would buy 30-day Ameripasses.
You could go anywhere

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.197
Greyhound would go
for 30 days for one price.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.465
Oh, that's cool.

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:57.804
And I remember one time, just
exhausted, sitting in the ...

00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:00.106
And the chair,
they're not super comfortable,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.742
thinking to myself if ...

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:07.346
Like anytime I wouldn't be able
to sleep in the future in a bed,

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.115
that I would remember
that moment

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:12.752
because, at the time,
all I wanted to do was lie down.

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:16.055
And I go, "I get to lie down
every other day of my life

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:17.990
and I don't realize
what a luxury it is.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.526
So, I'm gonna use this moment
to realize what a luxury

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.762
that is in the future."
And I do that from time to time,

00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:25.298
where I go,
"I'm not on a Greyhound bus."

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:28.134
That is such a good ...
I love that.

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:31.337
I thought
that same thing yesterday.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.705
I had a long day of travel

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.107
where you just sit
on your ass all day

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.175
so you go,
"Why am I exhausted from this."

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.745
You kind of like don't
let yourself be exhausted.

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:41.114
But I got home and I was laying
in bed and I was like,

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:45.418
"Laying down is amazing!"
I didn't get to do that all day

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:47.019
and that's why I deserve
this right now

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.355
because I had to be upright.
That is so funny.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.457
I think that's important

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.659
when you're
in an uncomfortable situation

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.796
that you don't want to be in,
mark it in your head as like,

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:59.766
"When I don't have to be in this
situation, really enjoy it."

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.234
That's how you can get
through those.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:02.935
I do that with being sick,
for sure.

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:04.537
When you just can't breath right
and you're like,

00:15:04.537 --> 00:15:06.405
"Aw, the other day
I was breathing good

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:09.242
and I didn't even care.
I didn't enjoy it at all."

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.978
Well, how about when you're
young and your older brother

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:14.147
holds you under water
and you're like,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.382
"All I want to do is breath."

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:19.519
Could you imagine
if every breath,

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.354
when you did come up,
for the rest of your life,

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:24.824
you just celebrated
with the most ecstatic joy.

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:28.828
"Oh, that's fantastic!
Oh my God!

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.966
Oh man, the breathing
is wonderful!"

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.234
But it is wonderful.

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:36.536
We should be like
that all the time.

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:38.304
We should be doing that.
It is wonderful.

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:39.639
Brian, I just came up with a-

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.340
If only we could learn
to appreciate it.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.542
I just came up with an idea.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:44.343
I'm gonna pitch it
to you right now.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.914
New Netflix, I know you have one
coming out, executive produced

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:51.050
by Jerry Seinfeld: Brain Regan,
Back to Basics.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.520
You go back to the comedy condo,
you go back to the Greyhounds,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.823
you open up and emcee
shows at the Funny Bones,

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.324
document it,
it sounds awesome, right?

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.525
Gee, thanks.

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.627
I feel like the Tampa Funny Bone
came up with this idea.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:02.962
That sounds terrible.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.697
Thanks for the suggestion.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:08.801
Chad just wants someone else
living his life as an adult man.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.503
You're gonna get $200 a week.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:14.874
I get the feeling we're gonna
switch places in this pitch.
