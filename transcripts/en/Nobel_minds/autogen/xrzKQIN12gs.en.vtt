patience just now you are the hardcore
still here um we have just exactly half

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
still here um we have just exactly half
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.970
still here um we have just exactly half
an hour for this panel because SVT the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
an hour for this panel because SVT the
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130
an hour for this panel because SVT the
television take us off the air in half

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
television take us off the air in half
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.370
television take us off the air in half
an hour and before we start I just

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
an hour and before we start I just
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.810
an hour and before we start I just
thought it'd be nice to give a round of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
thought it'd be nice to give a round of
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630
thought it'd be nice to give a round of
applause to the crew here who have

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
applause to the crew here who have
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970
applause to the crew here who have
magically transformed this room from one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
magically transformed this room from one
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.930
magically transformed this room from one
to three and back to one

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.120
so this is the concluding panel we've

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130
so this is the concluding panel we've
 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.670
so this is the concluding panel we've
called it emergent conclusions and with

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680
called it emergent conclusions and with
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.290
called it emergent conclusions and with
so much that's happened today there

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300
so much that's happened today there
 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.540
so much that's happened today there
isn't a chance of summarizing what we've

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550
isn't a chance of summarizing what we've
 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.920
isn't a chance of summarizing what we've
been through but the audience members

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930
been through but the audience members
 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.049
been through but the audience members
and the panelists have only had a chance

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059
and the panelists have only had a chance
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.820
and the panelists have only had a chance
to listen to one-third of what's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830
to listen to one-third of what's
 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.650
to listen to one-third of what's
happened this afternoon you've missed

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660
happened this afternoon you've missed
 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.930
happened this afternoon you've missed
two thirds of it and so what I'm hoping

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940
two thirds of it and so what I'm hoping
 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.070
two thirds of it and so what I'm hoping
to do is to use this opportunity just to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
to do is to use this opportunity just to
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.930
to do is to use this opportunity just to
bring to the fore some thoughts that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940
bring to the fore some thoughts that
 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.810
bring to the fore some thoughts that
came out of some of the discussions and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820
came out of some of the discussions and
 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.749
came out of some of the discussions and
so I'm going to go through the panels

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
so I'm going to go through the panels
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.639
so I'm going to go through the panels
one by one and ask my panelists here on

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649
one by one and ask my panelists here on
 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.210
one by one and ask my panelists here on
stage to give their thoughts on what was

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220
stage to give their thoughts on what was
 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340
stage to give their thoughts on what was
said and I don't at all ask them to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350
said and I don't at all ask them to
 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.170
said and I don't at all ask them to
summarize everything I just want them to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180
summarize everything I just want them to
 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.430
summarize everything I just want them to
pick some things that they thought were

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440
pick some things that they thought were
 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.800
pick some things that they thought were
interesting and then I've also got

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
interesting and then I've also got
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.740
interesting and then I've also got
microphones out in the audience and i'm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750
microphones out in the audience and i'm
 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.590
microphones out in the audience and i'm
going to call upon the panelists and if

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600
going to call upon the panelists and if
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.080
going to call upon the panelists and if
they like the moderators who were on the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090
they like the moderators who were on the
 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.940
they like the moderators who were on the
other panels or on the powers that we're

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950
other panels or on the powers that we're
 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.219
other panels or on the powers that we're
going through to make comments as well

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
going through to make comments as well
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.020
going through to make comments as well
same idea anything that they thought was

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030
same idea anything that they thought was
 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.940
same idea anything that they thought was
interesting just worth sharing with the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950
interesting just worth sharing with the
 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.380
interesting just worth sharing with the
audience especially the audience who

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
audience especially the audience who
 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.870
audience especially the audience who
hadn't been in the room so let's go

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
hadn't been in the room so let's go
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.100
hadn't been in the room so let's go
numerically so start with panel 1 a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110
numerically so start with panel 1 a
 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.109
numerically so start with panel 1 a
which was on the promised land of

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119
which was on the promised land of
 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.850
which was on the promised land of
genomic medicine where can the science

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860
genomic medicine where can the science
 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.780
genomic medicine where can the science
take us Eric and Joe were both on that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
take us Eric and Joe were both on that
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.850
take us Eric and Joe were both on that
panel so Joe bilstein would you like to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
panel so Joe bilstein would you like to
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160
panel so Joe bilstein would you like to
start by just giving us a thought or two

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
start by just giving us a thought or two
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.819
start by just giving us a thought or two
okay so on the title was the promised

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829
okay so on the title was the promised
 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.750
okay so on the title was the promised
land of genomic medicine and and I wrote

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
land of genomic medicine and and I wrote
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880
land of genomic medicine and and I wrote
three things down that I thought i would

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
three things down that I thought i would
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.350
three things down that I thought i would
tell you about or one we concluded that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
tell you about or one we concluded that
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.130
tell you about or one we concluded that
in order to maximize the power and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
in order to maximize the power and
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.130
in order to maximize the power and
strength of of genomics for medicine it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140
strength of of genomics for medicine it
 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.920
strength of of genomics for medicine it
was very important that the phenotypes

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
was very important that the phenotypes
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.890
was very important that the phenotypes
of patients the clinical manifestations

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
of patients the clinical manifestations
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.140
of patients the clinical manifestations
of different illnesses be characterized

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
of different illnesses be characterized
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.780
of different illnesses be characterized
and split into different groups and that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
and split into different groups and that
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.490
and split into different groups and that
would be the way that one could then

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
would be the way that one could then
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.530
would be the way that one could then
relate that to the to the genome

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
relate that to the to the genome
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420
relate that to the to the genome
information and that would get us to the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
information and that would get us to the
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.309
information and that would get us to the
right mechanism of the disease which is

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319
right mechanism of the disease which is
 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.330
right mechanism of the disease which is
ultimately what the pharmaceutical

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340
ultimately what the pharmaceutical
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.270
ultimately what the pharmaceutical
companies need in order to develop an

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
companies need in order to develop an
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.170
companies need in order to develop an
effective drug if one examines a list of

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180
effective drug if one examines a list of
 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.930
effective drug if one examines a list of
the top 10 selling drugs in the world

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
the top 10 selling drugs in the world
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.490
the top 10 selling drugs in the world
today virtually every one of them have

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500
today virtually every one of them have
 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.720
today virtually every one of them have
depended on 10 to 20 to 30 years of a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
depended on 10 to 20 to 30 years of a
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.640
depended on 10 to 20 to 30 years of a
biochemical and physiological and cell

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650
biochemical and physiological and cell
 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.089

biological studies in order to have

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099
biological studies in order to have
 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.309
biological studies in order to have
arrived at the right target so that's

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319
arrived at the right target so that's
 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.130
arrived at the right target so that's
what I that was one important point that

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140
what I that was one important point that
 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.780
what I that was one important point that
was a discussed today and the second one

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
was a discussed today and the second one
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.330
was a discussed today and the second one
something that I didn't know that came

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
something that I didn't know that came
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.729
something that I didn't know that came
out from a Bert vogelstein or who was on

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739
out from a Bert vogelstein or who was on
 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.680
out from a Bert vogelstein or who was on
our panel and only about five percent of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690
our panel and only about five percent of
 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.710
our panel and only about five percent of
patients with cancer participate in

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720
patients with cancer participate in
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.710
patients with cancer participate in
clinical trials so I think that's a

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720
clinical trials so I think that's a
 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.710
clinical trials so I think that's a
really sobering statistic when one

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720
really sobering statistic when one
 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.420
really sobering statistic when one
thinks about trying to develop new drugs

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430
thinks about trying to develop new drugs
 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.750
thinks about trying to develop new drugs
based on genomics it what has so few

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760
based on genomics it what has so few
 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.300
based on genomics it what has so few
patients that have cancer that actually

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310
patients that have cancer that actually
 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.190
patients that have cancer that actually
participated in the clinical trials and

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200
participated in the clinical trials and
 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.720
participated in the clinical trials and
then the third thing that came up our

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730
then the third thing that came up our
 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.199
then the third thing that came up our
Goran Hansen our panel leader asked each

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209
Goran Hansen our panel leader asked each
 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.360
Goran Hansen our panel leader asked each
of us would we want to have our genome

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370
of us would we want to have our genome
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.099
of us would we want to have our genome
sequence and there was six of us on the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109
sequence and there was six of us on the
 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.789
sequence and there was six of us on the
panel and the answer was unanimous none

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
panel and the answer was unanimous none
 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.710
panel and the answer was unanimous none
of us thought there was any reason to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
of us thought there was any reason to
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.200
of us thought there was any reason to
have one's genome sequenced at the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210
have one's genome sequenced at the
 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.690
have one's genome sequenced at the
present time the only reason would be if

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700
present time the only reason would be if
 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.440
present time the only reason would be if
if we should be so unlucky to get cancer

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450
if we should be so unlucky to get cancer
 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.000
if we should be so unlucky to get cancer
then then it would be important to get

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010
then then it would be important to get
 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.159
then then it would be important to get
the cancer that's removed from the body

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169
the cancer that's removed from the body
 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.020

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.450
when people will say well we let's
 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.700
when people will say well we let's
aggregate the information we can get it

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:11.710
aggregate the information we can get it
 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.320
aggregate the information we can get it
in a cheaper manner and we're willing to

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.330
in a cheaper manner and we're willing to
 

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.430
in a cheaper manner and we're willing to
understand what the risks are and where

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440
understand what the risks are and where
 

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.230
understand what the risks are and where
we are because the cost of not doing it

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240
we are because the cost of not doing it
 

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.750
we are because the cost of not doing it
is even higher for then doing it and so

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:21.760
is even higher for then doing it and so
 

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.630
is even higher for then doing it and so
we do see pharma companies that are

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:24.640
we do see pharma companies that are
 

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.200
we do see pharma companies that are
increasingly offshoring that to to

health care system yeah absolutely i

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:31.600
health care system yeah absolutely i
 

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.750
health care system yeah absolutely i
mean again I think just I think that the

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760
mean again I think just I think that the
 

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.730
mean again I think just I think that the
clinical trials are the bottleneck again

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:35.740
clinical trials are the bottleneck again
 

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.770
clinical trials are the bottleneck again
with all of this great science that's

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:37.780
with all of this great science that's
 

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.170
with all of this great science that's
being done the getting the trials to be

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:40.180
being done the getting the trials to be
 

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.850
being done the getting the trials to be
able to be done is the bottleneck and I

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:41.860
able to be done is the bottleneck and I
 

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.020
able to be done is the bottleneck and I
think we're seeing more openness

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.030
think we're seeing more openness
 

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.690
think we're seeing more openness
especially with rising health care costs

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.700
especially with rising health care costs
 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.950
especially with rising health care costs
if you look at just what China is going

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:46.960
if you look at just what China is going
 

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.079
if you look at just what China is going
to be facing over the next 10 to 15

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:51.970
years it's going to be humongous and so
 

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.760

there's a lot of interest in trying to

andersonville hard was part of that
panel so would you like to give us a

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:45.910
panel so would you like to give us a
 

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.910
panel so would you like to give us a
initial thought we discussed GMOs and

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920
initial thought we discussed GMOs and
 

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.480
initial thought we discussed GMOs and
their use in aquaculture and it was

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:54.490
their use in aquaculture and it was
 

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.420
their use in aquaculture and it was
pointed out that this is just one way of

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.430
pointed out that this is just one way of
 

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:02.190
pointed out that this is just one way of
breeding crops to increase yields and

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200
breeding crops to increase yields and
 

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.020
breeding crops to increase yields and
also to make the food more healthy and

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.030
also to make the food more healthy and
 

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.500
also to make the food more healthy and
allow sustainable agriculture and it's

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:07.510
allow sustainable agriculture and it's
 

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.060
allow sustainable agriculture and it's
not more than that but it's very

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.070
not more than that but it's very
 

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.420
not more than that but it's very
important in because crops which are

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.430
important in because crops which are
 

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.550
important in because crops which are
resistant to diseases do not need

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:17.710
spraying so we can save on pesticides
 

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.330
spraying so we can save on pesticides
and this also would provide a more

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:20.340
and this also would provide a more
 

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.220
and this also would provide a more
healthy working condition for the

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.230
healthy working condition for the
 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.590
healthy working condition for the
farmers as well as also for the

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600
farmers as well as also for the
 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.140
farmers as well as also for the
environment and I think this is one very

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.150
environment and I think this is one very
 

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.180
environment and I think this is one very
important aspect which which we touched

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.190
important aspect which which we touched
 

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:36.030
important aspect which which we touched
upon people were asking whether they

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040
upon people were asking whether they
 

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.210
upon people were asking whether they
have had dangers and I think there have

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:39.220
have had dangers and I think there have
 

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.450
have had dangers and I think there have
been so many studies done now worldwide

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:42.460
been so many studies done now worldwide
 

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.450
been so many studies done now worldwide
that there is actually no reports on any

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.460
that there is actually no reports on any
 

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.710
that there is actually no reports on any
any

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720
any
 

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.980
any
cases where GMOs have been dangerous for

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:49.990
cases where GMOs have been dangerous for
 

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.189
cases where GMOs have been dangerous for
human health and so this is probably not

00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:53.199
human health and so this is probably not
 

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:55.740
human health and so this is probably not
the issue which is important but the

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:55.750
the issue which is important but the
 

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.540
the issue which is important but the
issue is the acceptance by the public

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:57.550
issue is the acceptance by the public
 

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.519
issue is the acceptance by the public
and this is something we were really

00:11:59.519 --> 00:11:59.529
and this is something we were really
 

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:02.400
and this is something we were really
puzzled about because in there are so

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:02.410
puzzled about because in there are so
 

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.340
puzzled about because in there are so
many I'm in countries where these demos

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:05.350
many I'm in countries where these demos
 

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.160
many I'm in countries where these demos
are used and they're very successful and

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.170
are used and they're very successful and
 

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.230
are used and they're very successful and
they are also economy economically used

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240
they are also economy economically used
 

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.939
they are also economy economically used
and this is important I mean it's not

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:11.949
and this is important I mean it's not
 

00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:14.550
and this is important I mean it's not
only that you save pesticides but it's

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560
only that you save pesticides but it's
 

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.369
only that you save pesticides but it's
also that it's also to ensure that the

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:17.379
also that it's also to ensure that the
 

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.240
also that it's also to ensure that the
that the yield is better for the farmers

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.250
that the yield is better for the farmers
 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.280
that the yield is better for the farmers
because that also increases their belt

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.290
because that also increases their belt
 

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.740
because that also increases their belt
and we have learned also in this

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:25.750
and we have learned also in this
 

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.009
and we have learned also in this
morning's sessions that wealth is

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:29.019
morning's sessions that wealth is
 

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.259
morning's sessions that wealth is
related inversely to numbers of children

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:31.269
related inversely to numbers of children
 

00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:33.569
related inversely to numbers of children
and I mean this is now perhaps a bit

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:33.579
and I mean this is now perhaps a bit
 

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:36.300
and I mean this is now perhaps a bit
far-fetched but in in India for example

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.310
far-fetched but in in India for example
 

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.840
far-fetched but in in India for example
the cotton is I think eighty-five

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:39.850
the cotton is I think eighty-five
 

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.550
the cotton is I think eighty-five
percent of the cotton farming is now

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560
percent of the cotton farming is now
 

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.309
percent of the cotton farming is now
with GMO and these are small farmers and

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:44.319
with GMO and these are small farmers and
 

00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:48.780

their their their economical success is

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:48.790
their their their economical success is
 

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.869
their their their economical success is
increasing and this certainly has a big

00:12:51.869 --> 00:12:51.879
increasing and this certainly has a big
 

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:54.480
increasing and this certainly has a big
impact on the country and this is one of

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:54.490
impact on the country and this is one of
 

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.100
impact on the country and this is one of
the benefits which I think are very

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.110
the benefits which I think are very
 

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.679
the benefits which I think are very
important I myself and I may say that

00:12:58.679 --> 00:12:58.689
important I myself and I may say that
 

00:12:58.689 --> 00:13:02.460
important I myself and I may say that
again and I think we should aim for a

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:02.470
again and I think we should aim for a
 

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:06.379
again and I think we should aim for a
sustainable agriculture where we use the

00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:06.389
sustainable agriculture where we use the
 

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.639
sustainable agriculture where we use the
soil which is really good for

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:08.649
soil which is really good for
 

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:10.949
soil which is really good for
agriculture and use it as efficiently as

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959
agriculture and use it as efficiently as
 

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.400
agriculture and use it as efficiently as
we can and try to put back on natural

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.410
we can and try to put back on natural
 

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.379
we can and try to put back on natural
conditions all the soil which we have

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:16.389

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:17.819
conditions all the soil which we have
cultivated but which is not very

00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:17.829
cultivated but which is not very
 

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:20.189

efficiently cultivated now and this is

00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199

but the point around that was also just

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.570
but the point around that was also just
 

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.540
but the point around that was also just
the education and understanding about

what this means back to stevens point
 

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.290
what this means back to stevens point
and we need to do more i think to

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.300
and we need to do more i think to
 

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.480
and we need to do more i think to
explain to people what this is and what

00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.490
explain to people what this is and what
 

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.270
explain to people what this is and what
this isn't and how it can benefit yeah

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.280
this isn't and how it can benefit yeah
 

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.890

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:32.180
we learn from the breeding of dogs and
then towards the end there was a sort of

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:32.190
then towards the end there was a sort of
 

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.909
then towards the end there was a sort of
trance humanistic questioning you know

00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919
trance humanistic questioning you know
 

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.749
trance humanistic questioning you know
if we keep on doing all these things

00:21:37.749 --> 00:21:37.759
if we keep on doing all these things
 

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:41.840
if we keep on doing all these things
will we change human nature as we

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:41.850
will we change human nature as we
 

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.210
will we change human nature as we
understand it now and as we feed we are

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220
understand it now and as we feed we are
 

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.669
understand it now and as we feed we are
human now so that's my very brief

00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679
human now so that's my very brief
 

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:49.480
human now so that's my very brief
summary yes very nice thank you but

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:49.490

melon it was a great session I just want

00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:14.909
melon it was a great session I just want
 

00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:20.090
melon it was a great session I just want
to add that that you know the I think

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100
to add that that you know the I think
 

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.510
to add that that you know the I think
one of the themes was that

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:22.520
one of the themes was that
 

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.340
one of the themes was that
we have the ability now to at least in

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:28.350
we have the ability now to at least in
 

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.760
we have the ability now to at least in
animals to modify germline and there was

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:31.770
animals to modify germline and there was
 

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.890
animals to modify germline and there was
a lot of discussion about that and I I

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900
a lot of discussion about that and I I
 

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.170
a lot of discussion about that and I I
think that you know it was really it was

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:36.180
think that you know it was really it was
 

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.360
think that you know it was really it was
while it's interesting it you know the

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:38.370
while it's interesting it you know the
 

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.580
while it's interesting it you know the
conclusion really was clearly this is

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:40.590
conclusion really was clearly this is
 

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.620
conclusion really was clearly this is
something that's not safe to do it's not

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:42.630
something that's not safe to do it's not
 

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.200
something that's not safe to do it's not
ethical and we really can't do it anyway

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.210
ethical and we really can't do it anyway
 

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.300
ethical and we really can't do it anyway
but it you know nevertheless it was a

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.310
but it you know nevertheless it was a
 

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.910
but it you know nevertheless it was a
really large part of the discussion but

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:49.920
really large part of the discussion but
 

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.080
really large part of the discussion but
another theme but I think more related

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:54.090
another theme but I think more related
 

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.760
another theme but I think more related
to the second half so I'll just say it

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:55.770
to the second half so I'll just say it
 

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.750
to the second half so I'll just say it
now of the stream was how the human

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760
now of the stream was how the human
 

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.820

on funding and science funding tends to
 

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.060
on funding and science funding tends to
be very translational now it's important

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:17.070
be very translational now it's important
 

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.200
be very translational now it's important
to keep in mind that we need to keep

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.210
to keep in mind that we need to keep
 

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.620
to keep in mind that we need to keep
funding basic science because it's the

panel Stephen would you like to say

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:38.850
panel Stephen would you like to say
 

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.970
panel Stephen would you like to say
anything about that well there were the

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980
anything about that well there were the
 

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.770
anything about that well there were the
first question that was posed I thought

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780
first question that was posed I thought
 

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.410
first question that was posed I thought
if it's very interesting was now that we

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:45.420
if it's very interesting was now that we
 

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.780
if it's very interesting was now that we
have this genome what next where are we

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:47.790
have this genome what next where are we
 

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.220
have this genome what next where are we
going and I think many of us felt that

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:51.230
going and I think many of us felt that
 

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.770
going and I think many of us felt that
we know so very little we've learned so

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780
we know so very little we've learned so
 

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.960
we know so very little we've learned so
very much and as we've learned so very

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:56.970
very much and as we've learned so very
 

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.010
very much and as we've learned so very
much it's a cliche I know but it doesn't

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020
much it's a cliche I know but it doesn't
 

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.700
much it's a cliche I know but it doesn't
mean it's not true that there is so much

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:04.710
mean it's not true that there is so much
 

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.850
mean it's not true that there is so much
more that mug the vest and if you look

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860
more that mug the vest and if you look
 

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.950
more that mug the vest and if you look

history how little we knew about major

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.300
history how little we knew about major
 

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.310
history how little we knew about major
discoveries and how important it is it

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320

starts with the genome but we now know

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:19.290
starts with the genome but we now know
 

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.410
starts with the genome but we now know
that that's a small part of it really

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:21.420
that that's a small part of it really
 

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.450
that that's a small part of it really
happens on the whole system and the

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460
happens on the whole system and the
 

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.570
happens on the whole system and the
regulatory system and how it impacts

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:25.580
regulatory system and how it impacts
 

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.850

what the cell what the organism is

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860
what the cell what the organism is
 

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.370
what the cell what the organism is
really doing and so it's just part of

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380
really doing and so it's just part of
 

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.989
really doing and so it's just part of
that yet but we're

00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:32.999
that yet but we're
 

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:34.999

you know perhaps 40 years ago 50 it was

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:35.009
you know perhaps 40 years ago 50 it was
 

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:36.649
you know perhaps 40 years ago 50 it was
the major blueprint you just follow the

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659
the major blueprint you just follow the
 

00:24:36.659 --> 00:24:40.129
the major blueprint you just follow the

instructions saluted and that was it and
 

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:43.069
instructions saluted and that was it and
it's a very different world now okay so

00:24:43.069 --> 00:24:43.079
it's a very different world now okay so

we discussed that collecting all this

00:25:06.619 --> 00:25:06.629
we discussed that collecting all this
 

00:25:06.629 --> 00:25:08.119
we discussed that collecting all this
information which you can do now with

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:08.129
information which you can do now with
 

00:25:08.129 --> 00:25:11.869

the fast genome sequencing is in on the
 

00:25:11.879 --> 00:25:13.939
the fast genome sequencing is in on the
one hand of course a big big challenge

00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:13.949
one hand of course a big big challenge
 

00:25:13.949 --> 00:25:17.509
one hand of course a big big challenge
on the other hand it does require smart

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:17.519
on the other hand it does require smart
 

00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:19.489
on the other hand it does require smart
biologists to look at the data and

00:25:19.489 --> 00:25:19.499
biologists to look at the data and
 

00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:21.679
biologists to look at the data and
without this you will not gain the

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:21.689
without this you will not gain the
 

00:25:21.689 --> 00:25:23.359
without this you will not gain the
knowledge you can get out of these

00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:23.369
knowledge you can get out of these
 

00:25:23.369 --> 00:25:25.489
knowledge you can get out of these
things and I think I've was interesting

00:25:25.489 --> 00:25:25.499
things and I think I've was interesting
 

00:25:25.499 --> 00:25:27.619
things and I think I've was interesting
to me that in the the other pattern

00:25:27.619 --> 00:25:27.629
to me that in the the other pattern
 

00:25:27.629 --> 00:25:29.479
to me that in the the other pattern
which I didn't attend two people were

00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:29.489
which I didn't attend two people were
 

00:25:29.489 --> 00:25:30.889
which I didn't attend two people were
asked whether they want their genome to

00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:30.899
asked whether they want their genome to
 

00:25:30.899 --> 00:25:32.689
asked whether they want their genome to
be sequence and everybody says no I

00:25:32.689 --> 00:25:32.699
be sequence and everybody says no I
 

00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:34.549
be sequence and everybody says no I
don't expect to learn anything about

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559
don't expect to learn anything about
 

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:37.039
don't expect to learn anything about
myself from the genome and i think that

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:37.049
myself from the genome and i think that
 

00:25:37.049 --> 00:25:38.959
myself from the genome and i think that
the correlation between the phenotype

00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:38.969
the correlation between the phenotype
 

00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:40.579
the correlation between the phenotype
and the genotype this is the critical

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:40.589
and the genotype this is the critical
 

00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:43.459
and the genotype this is the critical
issue we cannot really phenotype very

different genetic background is really
really tricky and it's there at this

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:03.569
really tricky and it's there at this

experiments you can get large numbers of

00:26:12.979 --> 00:26:12.989
experiments you can get large numbers of
 

00:26:12.989 --> 00:26:15.379
experiments you can get large numbers of
animals and you can also control their

00:26:15.379 --> 00:26:15.389
animals and you can also control their
 

00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:18.139

changed and then you know about the real
 

00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:26.059
changed and then you know about the real
function of the gene you could also

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:26.069
function of the gene you could also
 

00:26:26.069 --> 00:26:28.849

it's an indirect way to get at the at
 

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.289
it's an indirect way to get at the at
the function of the gene but it's really

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299
the function of the gene but it's really
 

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:41.659
the function of the gene but it's really
very necessary and then we discussed a

00:26:41.659 --> 00:26:41.669
very necessary and then we discussed a
 

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:43.489
very necessary and then we discussed a
little bit about funding of these types

00:26:43.489 --> 00:26:43.499
little bit about funding of these types
