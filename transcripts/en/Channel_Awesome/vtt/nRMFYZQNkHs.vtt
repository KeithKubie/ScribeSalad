00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.360
Y'know...I pick on this guy a lot.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.640
Don't get me wrong. A lot of Adam Sandler films are awful to sit through,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.620
coming across as lazy, unfunny, and even annoying.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.080
But I forget sometimes that this is a mad talented person.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.220
His songs can be great, his unexpected delivery can get a huge laugh;

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.300
even dramatically he can not only be good, he can be really good!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.520
Sometimes, we let the worst of someone's work overshadow the good

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
and Adam Sandler does have a healthy amount of good work he's left behind.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.120
That's why I'm gonna give credit where credit's due
and count down his top 11 best films--

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.780
(sounds of uncertainty from viewers)
Oh, I see. You don't think I can make it to top 11, can ya?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.000
Well, y'know what? I'm gonna show ya!

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.520
They don't have to be masterpieces,
they don't have to be groundbreakers,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.120
they just have to be worth the ticket fee to see them on the big screen.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.100
And y'know what? Not only do I believe there's eleven,
I believe there can be even MORE in the future!

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.720
Please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.140
So, without further ado, I'm paying tribute to a flawed but still talented performer;

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.160
This is the top 11 best Adam Sandler movies!

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.100
(more sounds of uncertainty from audience)
There ARE eleven!

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.260
Hey, like I said, they don't ALL have to be masterpieces!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.520
This is a cute comedy with a lot of character actors
that were soon gonna be big stars,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.620
including Sandler, Brendan Fraser, and Steve Buscemi.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.620
The three of them play band members of a group called "The Lone Rangers";
the name alone is already a beautifully stupid contradiction.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.520
Trying over and over to get their band heard, they end up taking over the local radio station holding it hostage

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.100
only to have their cassette of their music be destroyed before playing it.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.220
So...shit. They're stuck there for no reason not knowing what to do.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.240
But the attention gets a lot of headbanger fans
to surround the building saying fight the establishment,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080
all while they're trying to figure out how the hell to get out of there.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.480
A simple idea with simple jokes, but they're still effective.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.280
The actors all have a dim-witted charm to them,
the commentary is obvious but still clever,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.960
and the laughs, while not knee-slappers, do still get plenty of chuckles.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.180
It's honestly a totally fine movie satirizing fame and media attention,
but this time with the heavy metal world.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.940
It's totally serviceable. Not a glowing endorsement,
but if somebody asked if I'd recommend it, I'd say sure.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.960
Like I said not a glowing endorsement, but a decent flick.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.980
This movie is just the right amount of silly.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.460
From visual jokes to funny actors to a downright bizarre premise,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.500
Sandler plays an Israeli army commando who takes down terrorists,
but is sick of his way of life.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.340
He fakes his own death so he can follow his real dream, which is...

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.780
Hairdresser. Yep, he becomes a stylist in New York,
and is apparently really good at it!

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.160
He even has the skills to take care of critics
who are either too harsh on him or his customers.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.760
"Here comes the double foot."

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.960
"Smell it, smell it, smell it, now take it."

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.200
"That's for you."

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.160
Of course, when the bad guys find out he's still alive,
they try to hunt him down, and obviously, hilarity ensues.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.000
Oh, and I don't mean that sarcastically.
I think this film is legitimately hilarious!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.940
It was written by Judd Apatow
and Robert Smigel, [Triumph] the Insult Comic Dog.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.340
It's totally in bad taste from beginning to end
and doesn't give a shit about it at all.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.720
Mostly because it knows it's a dumb silly comedy,
but has a ton of fun with it.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.840
The humor ranges from weird to really weird.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.120
There is something so zany and over-the-top about this movie
that even when a joke doesn't work,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.500
it's so surreal you can't help but still kind of giggle at it.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.940
"No one can catch Phantom, woo!" *yell*

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.880
...what the hell is going on??

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.080
This is one of those films that got panned by critics,
but in my opinion still brings the laughs.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.640
It's idiotic and won't further anyone's understanding of the world,
but screw it. It's just friggin' funny!

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.320
And that's enough for me.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.120
This is one of those Sandler movies that flew under the radar.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.700
While certainly uneven, most people agree this film
has difficult emotions being tackled

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.600
and a resolution that's not always clear and easy to understand.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.740
Sandler plays Charlie, a man who lost his family in 9/11
and shuts himself off from the world.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.420
His college roommate, played by Don Cheadle, meets him by chance
and sees how far he's slipped from reality.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.600
He tries befriending him to make things better,
discovering that things in his life aren't always that great either.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.820
The more time they spend with one another,
the more they find they're both making things better and worse for the other.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.600
The film got mixed reviews when it came out,
which is not surprising as the movie is kind of a mixed bag.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.280
It does sometimes feel forced and a little off,
but the reviews were still mostly positive

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.440
and I think that's what you can call it: mostly positive.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.680
Even people who didn't like it had to admit there were still
strong moments from both Cheadle and Sandler,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.720
giving an interesting and troubled look at two lives
who are lost for two very different reasons.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.860
I see the problems with it, but I still think
the good stuff is too good to overlook.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.260
For the number of times it plays it safe,
there's just as many times it takes a risk.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.900
If anything else, it's good acting from a good cast,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.200
proving once again Sandler can hold his own
even against cinematic greats like Cheadle.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.280
If you haven't already, take a look. It's worth it in the end.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.620
This Netflix movie came out in 2017 and had quite the cast,
including Sandler, Ben Stiller, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.120
The film centers around the Meyerowitz's dysfunctional family

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.140
and how the extremely eccentric father, played by Hoffman,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.380
affected the lives of his kids, played by Sandler and Stiller.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.980
And that's...really about it.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.940
More of a character study than a plot-driven movie,
but these characters are interesting in how flawed they are.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.480
Stiller is a successful businessman who hates everything his father stands for

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.220
while Sandler is more loving towards his dad,
but is also very lost emotionally and financially.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.100
The two of them butt heads a lot throughout the film,
and they're both phenomenal.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.840
Stiller gives a gut-wrenching speech near the end
and Sandler is so natural and believable,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.700
it doesn't even feel like a performance.
It just feels like you're watching the troubles of a real guy.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.040
The film itself can get a little grating due to Hoffman as the father,
but to be fair, I think that's kind of the point.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.860
And I'd be lying if I said I was totally satisfied to what it all amounts to,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.780
but it's still reasonably well-done and feels very real,
particularly with the performances.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:23.960
In my opinion, I think it might even be Sandler's best acting.
I never once felt like he was lying or acting; it felt 100% real.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.980
It's a unique film with some unique talent giving us some unique characters.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.040
While it does have a lot of groaner moments and awkward jokes,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.880
the comedy, romance, and ideas that DO work in the film
far overpower the ones that don't.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.380
It's just a clever idea that surprisingly leads to some likable chemistry.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.380
Sandler plays a veterinarian who falls in love with a seemingly charming woman played by Drew Barrymore.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.700
The next day, however, she completely forgets who he is. Why?

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.020
Well, she has short-term memory loss, so her recollections only go as far as 24 hours.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.680
So, every time Sandler sees her,
he has to either tell her who he is

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.840
or even more awkwardly, come up with
different ways for them to meet each time.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:25.920
Her family wants him out the picture though as they like not having to
tell her every day about her condition, saving her the emotional stress.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.220
Sandler can't help but still feel something for this person though,
despite the fact that she keeps forgetting who he is.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.260
The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is
adorable, believable, and yes, even funny.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.280
She does a great job selling that she's never seen Sandler
before over and over and over.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.860
This could get old very fast, but she brings both the comedy and the humanity to it.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.360
On top of that, Sandler coming up with new ways to try and explain
or even trick her into going out with him

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.920
not only shows his comedic side,
but also how much he cares about wanting to be with her.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.700
I especially like the ending which, not to give anything away,
but they don't just cure the illness.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.520
They do have to acknowledge the problem for the rest of their lives.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.660
Most comedies like this would have the problem solved by the end,

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.240
but they go that extra mile in trying to be both delicate
and creative in living with the disorder.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.920
It's a crazy romance that surprisingly has just as much heart as farts.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.040
*groan* did I really just make that joke?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.100
So yeah, the 80s are everywhere now.
Everybody references it. It's practically become a cliché!

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.780
But Sandler was one of the earliest people to poke fun at it,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.820
waiting only eight years to understand what made it
stand out compared to modern day.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.540
He plays a wedding singer who's jilted at the altar
and starts turning into an angry, bitter drunk,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.380
but a waitress, played by Drew Barrymore, seems to help turn things around.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.440
The only downside is she's marrying a jerk and yeah,
you know where this is going.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:08.760
It's every 80s romantic comedy that, while following some clichés too close to the letter like having the fiancé be an unfunny jerk,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.900
still manages to work with it okay because,
well, it is a satire of the 80s!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.980
Was that intentional? Probably not.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.860
But it works the same way Demolition Man is perfectly
representing the 90s without even knowing it.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.840
The comedy gets a lot of laughs, I think everybody who
watched this movie has lines they quote from it.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.980
"Things that could have been brought to my attention YESTERDAY!!!"

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.240
"Do you have any experience?"

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.880
"I'm a big fan of money. I like it. I use it. I have a little."

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.660
"[He's] losing his mind..."

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.620
"...and I'm reaping all the benefits..."

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.020
And, once again, the romance is very sweet.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.500
Barrymore and Sandler had great chemistry
and this is where it all started.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.740
Yeah, it's manipulative and contrived, but it's the same way shitty Christmas rom-coms are now;

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.680
you kind of accept how stupid they are and have fun with 'em.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.040
And seeing how this is a throwback to the 80s,
doesn't it kind of make sense?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.740
It's a lot of fun with just enough heart to make it work.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.160
This is a predictable yet enjoyable film that still lasts long after the 80s.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.600
"Woopity-doo!!"

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.920
Look at that suit. That is a nice suit.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.760
A coat that's never been buttoned, a tie that's been tied once
so he can just keep reusing it over and over and over.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.400
Okay, maybe the Nostalgia Critic suit isn't anything special.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.460

Premium rental suits and tuxedos, delivered.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.980
Yeah, it's stupid. Yeah, it's immature.
Yeah, it's every dumb sports movie cliché in the world.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.880
...but it's funny!

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.380
Sandler plays a hockey player named Happy,
who unfortunately sucks at what he does.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.920
But when he discovers he has a great arm for golf,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.940
suddenly he realizes he can make enough money
to save his grandmother's house.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.920
Because of course there's a grandmother's house.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.880
But the nasty mean bully--

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.560
because of course there's a nasty mean bully

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.420
--wants to stop him from stealing the spotlight as well as
his hot girlfriend who's in love with him.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.820
Because of course there's a hot girlfriend who's in love with him.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:27.600
Again, this is not a particularly story-based comedy.
The focus is on Sandler's attitude and the attitude of the people around him.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.200
As phoned-in as these characters are written,
they're played by very funny people.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.480
The angry nurse at the old folks home is played by a hilarious Ben Stiller,

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.840
Apollo Creed himself, Carl Weathers, plays a great bitter coach,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.820
and Christopher McDonald might play one of the
funniest bullies in sports film history.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.780
"Well, moron, good for Happy Gilm- oh my GOD!"

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:56.360
This is such a throwaway role, but he adds a delivery and energy that
makes him a comedic foil who's just as much fun as the comedic leads.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.460
"I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.000
"You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?"

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
"...no!"

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.440
Add on top of that the funniest cameo of Bob Barker ever,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.880
a beautifully long list of completely meaningless deaths,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.420
and enough lines to quote for years to come.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.480
"Why don't you just go home? That's your home!
Are you too good for your home?!"

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.960
Happy Gilmore is just a fun dumb flick.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.200
As the typical Adam Sandler movie formula goes,
this one arguably did it the funniest.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.220
"The price is wrong, bitch."

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.900
Though a big hit with critics, audiences seem to
either love or hate this film.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.920
Personally, I think it's so strange, so mysterious,
and so well-acted that I can't help but love it.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.740
Even though I'll be the first to admit, I have no idea what it means.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.600
Sandler plays a man named Barry, a quiet, awkward, reserved,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.780
yet totally impulsive outcast who's emotionally abused by his sisters
and is being scammed and robbed by a call girl service.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.080
As things get stranger and stranger,
a kind woman named Elizabeth, played by Emily Watson,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.060
enters his life and finally starts to give it purpose.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.340
From there, just weirdness. All sorts of weirdness.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:23.020
This was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson,
the same guy who did Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and There Will Be Blood,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.935
so that gives you an idea of the strange arthouse nature
that lies ahead with this film.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.860
What's the point of it? Why does it exist?
Why is everything in it so odd and unexplainable?

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.760
I don't know, but it draws you in to where you kind of are okay with not knowing.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.080
Between Sandler's brilliant acting, the surreal atmosphere,
and just downright bizarre method of storytelling,

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.120
It truly is a one-of-a-kind film you're either gonna get into or you're not.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.260
Personally, I loved every minute of it

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.620
and a lot of that does come from Sandler
who carries a lot of this film with his performance.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.260
It's a totally-out-there experience,
but still has me fascinated every time I see it.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.040
Yeah, you might as well lump these two together.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:27.540
The Hotel Transylvania movies are beautifully animated, extremely funny,
incredibly charming, hugely creative, and carry a surprising amount of heart.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.800
Every release gets trashed by critics and I still don't understand why.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.700
They're great for kids, great for adults, wonderfully written,
and wonderfully voiced with Sandler almost unrecognizable as Dracula.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:45.300
In a world terrified of monsters, Sandler as Dracula builds a hotel
for all the famous Halloween freaks to come and relax.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.860
His daughter Mavis though is growing restless
and wants to see the world.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:54.640
Dracula is too afraid of what will happen to her though
due to what happened to his wife who was killed by an angry mob.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.520
But when a young traveler visits telling her the world isn't what she thinks it is,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:04.320
a drift builds between the two of them and the monsters
witness the real scares with the horrors of parenting.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.500
These films were directed by Genndy Tartakovsky,
the creator of Samurai Jack,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.040
and they have his stamp all over them.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.420
They're fast, they're energized, they're brilliantly designed,
they throw a ton of various jokes at you,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.340
and they surprisingly can be very moving.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:26.140
Both films are fantastic at portraying very relatable family problems while
also getting tons of laughs based off of these hilarious characters.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:32.140
These movies are becoming new staples of Halloween;
you just look at them and you get excited for the holiday.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.980
Which is strange seeing how the third one is coming out in summer, but

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.860
I guess we can buy it around Halloween...?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.400
Hopefully it's as good as the other two because
these films are incredibly funny as well as heartwarming.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.880
Despite what critics say, this is a series of movies
I predict are going to get more and more popular
with every passing Halloween season

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.280
"Hit it!"

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.240
And the number one best Adam Sandler movie is...

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.880
Hear me out.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.980
Funny People got mixed reviews when it was released
and most audiences left not really enjoying it all that much,

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.720
but under this seemingly pointless story
lies an interesting subtext if you connect it to Sandler's life

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.260
which you could argue the movie was doing already.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.000
Sandler plays a comedic movie star named George Simmons,
but let's be honest, he's playing Adam Sandler.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.360
He used to be a stand-up turned into a movie star

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.320
and his films seemed like quickly-turned-out fluff
that somehow make a lot of money.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.380
He gets a shock though when he discovers he has leukemia.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.980
Thinking his days are numbered, he goes back to stand-up

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.420
where he meets a writer, played by Seth Rogen, who also does stand-up.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.200
The two of them form a friendship despite the fact that
Sandler doesn't always treat him that great,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.120
but he's dying, what can you do.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.640
Well suddenly, halfway through the movie, his leukemia is cured.
Yeah, complete recovery and everything.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.660
So...where does the film go now?

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.340
Well, that's the same question the characters ask.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:07.800
Now that Sandler is better, he feels he can still be a dick
and ignore all the mental pain he was confronting.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.360
But Rogen tells him it isn't and shouldn't be as easy as all that.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.740
The two go back and forth between respecting each other and hating each other,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.620
ultimately resulting in an ending that honestly doesn't resolve that much.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:26.460
If anything, it indicates that much of these actions will be repeated in the future and the changes made, if any, are very minimal.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.020
So...

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.200
This is kind of really friggin' interesting.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.700
The comedy is decent and the acting from everyone
is once again great, but really think about it.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.760
If this character is supposed to be Sandler,
why do half of these choices happen?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.860
We've seen films like Top Five or Lost in Translation or 8 Mile
where we know they're semi-autobiographical around the person playing them.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.520
So why would Sandler have himself be such a jerk?
A jerk who's dying, no less?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:01.600
Sandler is said to be one of the sweetest celebrities in Hollywood,
yet he portrays himself as a lost asshole who rarely learns his lesson.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.400
Why would the film be so similar to his life in other aspects, but not here?

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.940
The short answer is I don't know,
but it's interesting to think about, isn't it.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.540
The same way the Rocky movies kind of reflected Stallone's career,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.180
the underdog becoming a star, turning into a joke,
then balancing out in his old age,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.280
the same way we might see kind of a reflection here.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.760
Sandler's comedies even he acknowledges sometimes have little to no substance.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.920
He even says sometimes they're done just so he can vacation somewhere.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.360
Yet he still makes them that way while also trying more experimental roles.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.000
Could it be this is how he sees himself?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.700
As somebody who is successful in some ways, but lost in others?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.640
Is it an exaggeration of what he thinks he could become, has been, or currently is?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.240
Maybe it's a cautionary tale for not just others, but himself as well.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.820
Like I said, this is speculation. I have nothing to back this up,
but why have the character's career be so eerily similar?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:03.720
Like any intriguing piece of art, I don't always know what the artist's intent is,
but what it reflects is even more fascinating.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:10.260
The film is such a strange blur of fact and fiction that
you can't always pinpoint what's supposed to be real and what isn't.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.800
If Sandler didn't play him in this movie,
the film wouldn't be as relevant, but he does.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.480
Why? Why pick a role so seemingly similar to him and yet,
in many other respects, so seemingly the opposite?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.100
It's a question I don't know if I'll ever fully get the answer to,

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.300
but it's also a question I don't fully need the answer to or even want.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.320
The mystery of it is far more engaging.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.560
It's like a Rorschach test of how much of the actor
and his career you see in the role,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.420
and it can be a surprisingly compelling take given your point of view.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.860
I can't act like I know this was the intention,
but the ideas are planted and they're worth talking about.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:51.540
In a weird way, this Sandler movie more than any other
asks the most questions. It makes you think the most.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.880
And given the actor's background of movies,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.080
the one that makes you think the most
is the one I'm gonna put as number one any day.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.540
Funny People is a fascinating reflection,
we just don't always know of exactly what.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.640
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember so you don't have to.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.000
I GOT TO ELEVEN, HA--

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.720
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out.
And this week, we are doing CEDARS Foster Care.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.480
It is the mission of CEDARS to help children
who have been abused, neglected, and homeless

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.080
achieve safety, stability, and enduring family relationships.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.580
Founded in 1947, CEDARS continues their vision today to

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:45.300
create a place where children can experience a real childhood
and begin planning for the future.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:56.000
That simple act of kindness over 70 years ago has resulted in 
thousands of children building new family lives,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.720
offering young people safe shelter and the skills
to adapt to a quickly changing world.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.460
Today's reality is harsh and not every home today is safe for every child.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:13.280
Poverty, drug use, mental illness, criminal activity,
and neglect place children at extreme risk

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:20.220
CEDARS continues to respond, giving hope to youth in need
and direction to families struggling to stay together.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:28.180
If you look at their site and their YouTube page, you can witness
all the wonderful people they bring together 
and all the positive ways they help.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.080
Check them out and see if you can play a big part in a child's future.
