AMY LARKIN: Thank you.

00:00:02.765 --> 00:00:06.010
It's such a pleasure
to be here.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.990
I'm going to talk today about
the rules of business and the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.730
laws of nature.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.440
They are in direct
collision today.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.220
We all know about the
financial ledger--

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130
profit and loss--

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.250
know that since we're kids.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.620
But there's another piece
of the financial ledger.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.740
And that's cause and effect,
which we never talk about.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.780
Every financial transaction has
an environmental impact.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.030
And the environment is embedded
in every financial

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.270
transaction.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.450
The financial and environmental
crises are

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
connected both in causes
and solutions.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.060
What do I mean by that?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.570
Well, do you remember the floods
in Thailand in 2011?

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.830
Yes?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.020
Everyone?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.030
It was a devastating effect
for Thailand.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.390
And there was a terrible
typhoon.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.070
But the real cause of the
catastrophe was the fact that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.480
15 to 20 years before, in the
late '80s and '90s, there was

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.290
massive deforestation
in Thailand.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.870
And so there was
no ground soil.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.640
The topsoil had fallen down
mountains so that when this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.340
huge typhoon hit, there was no
ground to hold the water.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.740
So that would have
been bad enough.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.040
But in fact, in Thailand
are factories

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.510
for Honda and Toyota.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.450
And therefore factories that
were shut down for four to six

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.880
months did not have the parts
to supply to the other

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.160
factories for Honda and Toyota
in Kentucky, Singapore, and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.830
the Philippines.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.640
So in fact, there was economic
devastation in Kentucky,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.860
Singapore, and the Philippines
from logging that happened 15

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.820
to 20 years earlier.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.220
Toyota lost 3 and 1/2%
of its annual output.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.920
And you and I paid unemployment
insurance for

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.040
workers in Kentucky because of
economic activity from 15 to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.800
20 years earlier.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.530
That's what I mean by the
financial and environmental

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.100
crises are connected.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.540
I'm going to talk today
about three things.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.210
The first is that environmental
damages can

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.580
bankrupt environmental systems,
ecosystems, as well

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.770
as financial systems.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.560
The second is that
multinationals are playing a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.370
truly surprising role
in the world.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.330
I have been a Greenpeacer
for over 30 years.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.020
And in the past 10 years, the
work that I have done with

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.150
multinationals has truly
shocked me off my feet.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.830
I'll be talking a little
bit about that.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.350
And then I'm going to talk about
Google's role in the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.990
energy business.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.200
Energy is not Google's
main business.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.420
But Google is having a huge
impact on the energy business.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.310
And I'm going to talk
about that.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.180
So first thing is, I would like
to state what I think is

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.510
the first rule of business--

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.950
no nature, no business.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.810
There's a growing understanding
of this in all

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.480
businesses.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.080
This is the other change
in the weather.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.180
In multinational boardrooms and
executive suites, I have

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.300
been drinking, dining, and
kvetching with executives over

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.190
problems they have from extreme
weather, from lost

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.020
commodities, from inability to
figure out their profit and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.900
loss statements, to what's
going to happen with new

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.100
regulation.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.830
There is a true growing
understanding that financial

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.670
health is based on environmental
health.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.350
Governments not so much.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.740
The corporations are
surprisingly way ahead of the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.200
governments.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.550
But the governments, for the
most part, are not connecting

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.230
Hurricanes Sandy, Katrina, and
Irene with a lack of good mass

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.279
transit or renewable
energy systems.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.680
This is where the financial and
environmental crises have

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.850
not been connected in the
minds of government.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.100
In many, many businesses,
they have.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.620
In many, many businesses, they
haven't, especially those that

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.230
are in the fossil
fuel industry.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.060
But this is the cause and effect
side of the ledger that

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.550
I was talking about.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.060
But so here's what happens
actually when

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.450
business looks to nature.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.850
Makani Power--

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.830
some of you here
probably know--

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.450
was recently bought by Google
a few weeks ago.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.950
It is the most advanced
wind power technology.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.880
It's in prototype now.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.440
And it functions like a kite.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.220
So it's tethered
to the ground.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.870
And high above the air, the
wind turbines can move.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.310
And high above the air, over
offshore where there are no

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.540
Kennedys to tell you
you cannot build an

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.590
offshore wind plant.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.710
And it eliminates 90% of the
material used in conventional

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.450
wind turbines.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.470
It is also a new technology that
would eliminate one of

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.140
the big problems with wind,
which is the intermittency,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.770
when the wind doesn't blow.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.140
Because, as we all know from
flying, when you're up there,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.920
the wind is always blowing.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.800
So in my mind, this is the
kind of business that can

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.870
actually accrue environmental
credit.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.790
So I guess I should define
environmental debt, the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.580
opposite of environmental
credit.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.490
It's the polluting and damaging
actions that cost

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.200
other people real money like
those foresters, those

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.290
deforestation in Thailand from
20 years ago that cost Toyota

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.010
3 and 1/2% of its
output in 2011.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.950
We cannot separate the
environmental system from the

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.480
financial system any more
than we can separate our

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.970
mind and our body.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.970
They go together.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.470
And that's just that.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.290
And today, in the current
economy, these

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.330
connections are global.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.440
So when the Mayans depleted
their water sources--

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.220
well, if you were in Europe or
China, you really didn't care.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.740
It didn't affect your life.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.440
It didn't affect your
environment.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.010
Although I'm sure there are
some biologists and

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.790
environmentalists who
will tell me it did.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.710
But basically, it was
not a felt problem.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.320
But today, there are floods
in Pakistan, heat waves in

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.560
Ukraine, or droughts in the
Midwest United States.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.390
And you are in business for
cotton, wheat, or corn--

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.880
or anything that uses
those commodities--

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.070
you're in big trouble.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.230
This is, again, how the
financial and environmental

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.400
crises work together.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.080
This extreme weather has meant
that the price of agricultural

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.470
commodities spike.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.100
If you're trying to sell pizza
or pasta or beef, you have

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.110
trouble figuring out your
profit and loss.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.020
If you're a business and you
can't predict reasonably your

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.720
profit and loss, you have
some big problems.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.530
So in our own backyard,
another multinational

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.710
corporation, Bloomberg, summed
up Hurricane Sandy I think

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.960
rather nicely.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.180
And this is, again, another
multinational corporation

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.210
speaking up very clearly.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.000
And the question is, would you
rather invest in a renewable

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.480
grid and mass transit, or spend
$100 billion on recovery

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.660
this year, and probably again
in three years, and probably

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.500
again in seven years-- if not
in New York, in Miami, in

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.800
Atlanta, in San Diego?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.380
These storms will be more
and more frequent.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.260
And this money, it is good money
going after bad unless

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
we spend our money wisely to
prevent this kind of extreme

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.520
weather from being legacy for
not only the next generation--

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.499
which it will be--

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:49.930
but prevent it from stopping one
generation hence, we will

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.810
continue to bankrupt ourselves,
both financially

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.120
and environmentally.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.460
And as I said, I'm going to be
talking about multinationals.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.330
Here's another one, Puma.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.930
Puma's CEO, Jochen Zeitz,
decided he wanted to figure

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.830
out what was the real cost of
Puma's business regarding

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.830
environmental damages.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.700
And so he worked with
PricewaterhouseCoopers and

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.780
Trucost, which is a small
boutique firm, and developed

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.510
what they called an
environmental profit and loss.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.970
So what the hell is an
environmental profit and loss?

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.040
You never heard of it because
it's never been done before.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.620
They measured water use,
greenhouse gas, land use, air

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.380
pollution, waste.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.570
And to their best estimates,
it came to

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.430
$193 million for Puma.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.630
So obviously, that's an
estimate and quite an

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.360
imperfect number.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:59.130
But it represents, in fact,
72% of Puma's 2010 profit.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.500
So what does that mean?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.640
It means that if Puma were to
have spent money to either

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.960
prevent those damages or paid
for those damages, every other

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.760
company in the sportswear
sector would

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.860
have made more money.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.420
The biggest polluter would
make the biggest profit.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.720
But Puma, God bless them, they
didn't just wilt from this.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.950
They doubled down.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.880
And now they're doing another
environmental profit and loss

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.290
trying to quantify the numbers
better, again doing it with

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.730
PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
taking the lesson learned from

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.670
the first one and
doubling down.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.020
The parent company, which owns
Stella McCartney, Gucci, Yves

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.190
Saint Laurent, is going to do
an environmental profit and

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.910
loss across the whole
multinational.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.320
There are other multinationals
embarking on a

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.280
similar kind of metric.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.550
And why are these metrics
important?

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.310
Well, PepsiCo did something
amazing.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.950
They built a factory in Arizona
a few years ago.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:14.220
And in that factory, they
created technical creative

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.020
engineering like almost
no factory has seen.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.860
It was near net zero energy,
waste, and water--

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.960
really spectacular
improvements.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.720
And when the engineer who led
this development was talking

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.060
to me about it, I was suitably
admiring because it was pretty

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.820
extraordinary.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.290
And I said, so now you're going
to deploy these in all

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.290
your factories globally.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.540
And then you're going to share
this technology with others.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.480
He said, well, actually,
I think we'd be

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.330
happy to share this.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:49.090
And we cannot deploy all of it
because if we did, it would be

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.640
very expensive.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.120
And it would jack up our
short-term losses.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.040
Within five years, we would have
short-term gains from it

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.310
and short-term benefits--

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.870
medium term--

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.120
five years is medium term.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.490
We would have medium-term
benefits from it

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.330
on all of our expenses.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.500
But in the short term,
we would have to

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.430
spend too much money.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:16.670
So we are going to pick and
choose what we will deploy.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.990
So the other thing he said is
that when waste costs what it

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.270
should cost, we'll
do everything.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.990
When water costs what it
should cost, we'll do

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.120
everything.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.750
When energy costs what it
should cost, we'll do

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.130
everything.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.300
This is a case of a company
wanting to do fantastic--

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.270
doing fantastic--

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.390
work, and because of the rules
of business, being unable to

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.370
deploy their fantastic
technologies globally.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.060
These rules got to change.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.830
Just a few more metrics.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:57.480
In 2008, KPMG, another huge
financial service firm,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.720
measured the cost of
environmental damage caused by

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.960
the 3,000 largest public
companies--

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.640
$2.15 trillion.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.470
Why is that important
that they did this?

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.640
Well, they had the courage,
number one, to antagonize a

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.960
lot of their clients, just as
Pricewaterhouse developing

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.420
environmental profit and loss
for Puma has clients who are

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.380
going, whoa, not sure we want to
have this out in the world.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.190
You think KPMG's clients are
also happy that they have

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.070
measured the true cost of
environmental damage?

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.590
This is a contributor to a
public conversation on

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.875
changing the rules
of business.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.470
And it is a huge piece of global
economic activity.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.840
China measured the cost of its
environmental damages at 3.5%

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.800
of its GDP.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.100
So that's what they
said it was.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.530
Anyone want to guess
what it really was?

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.970
AUDIENCE: [? 30? ?]

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:03.640
AMY LARKIN: Maybe.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.960
I don't know.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.750
It wasn't 3.5% to be sure.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.830
Pakistan measured it at
6%, Colombia 3.7%.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.300
The World Bank has measured
many countries in Africa.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.590
These damages are real money
paid by real people, real

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.730
businesses, real taxpayers,
real families, real school

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.430
systems, real water systems.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.580
This is real money.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.420
So it just shows that all money
is not created equal.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:43.570
If 3 and 1/2% of your GDP is
from environmental damages,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.090
that's not money you want
to be spending.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.310
It's not good money.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.580
Google and Facebook are actually
working in this

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.710
realm, in the energy realm.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.190
Obviously, Google, as
I said before, is a

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.340
huge player in energy.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.230
I'm sure most of
you know this.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.650
Facebook is now moving
into the field, also.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:13.360
And you have the option to open
coal-fired energy data

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.720
centers everywhere you go.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.610
But I think that your company
has an understanding that

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.460
these short-term profits are not
going to be as valuable as

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.420
the long-term value created by
developing new renewable

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.550
energy systems.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.990
Google, at this point, has over
$1 billion invested in

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.530
renewable energy.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:42.980
So how important is
long-term value?

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.250
Who to say it better but Captain
Kirk and Mr. Spock?

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:52.680
This quote is from the fourth
"Star Trek" movie, the one

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.970
about the whales.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.880
I presume you all saw it a
few times on an airplane.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:04.400
But I think one of the
reasons that we love

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.120
"Star Trek" so much--

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.730
most of us do, at least--

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:13.090
is that within "Star Trek,"
their ambition, which is

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:19.400
extraordinary, is only as strong
as their humility--

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.920
their humility towards the laws
of nature, their humility

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.070
towards biodiversity,
[? they're ?] even like the

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.560
biodiversity of aliens.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:35.260
I think that our work is to
connect the deepest ambition,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.010
the most profound ambition,
Google-size ambition, with

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.370
total humility towards
the laws of nature.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.690
Then we will have a good
cohesion of the laws of nature

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.940
and the rules of business.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:59.180
Sticking with the "Star Trek"
analogy, I have chosen to

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.560
create what I would call the
new prime directives.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.240
So I call it "The Nature Means
Business Framework."

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.626
The first one is pollution
can no longer be free.

00:17:11.626 --> 00:17:15.319
If pollution were no longer be
free, Pepsi's factory would be

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:19.240
deployed by them everywhere
and by everyone else.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.390
The long view must guide
all decision-making and

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.829
accounting.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:29.340
If that were the case, the
people who deforested Thailand

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.500
wouldn't do it because it
would be too expensive.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:38.440
And they would be on the hook
for workers in factories and

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.100
corollary businesses in
Kentucky, Singapore, and

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.350
Philippines, not only
in Thailand.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.560
And the last one is government
plays a vital role in

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.690
catalyzing clean technology
and growth.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:57.860
In the 1970s and '80s in the US,
Japan was clobbering the

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.470
new microchip industry.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.630
And the US government
put together

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.700
something called SEMATECH.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.860
And it was a combination
of money, R&amp;D,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.770
cohesion of the industry.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.750
And this led to Silicon
Valley as we know it.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.300
And honestly, no SEMATECH,
no Google.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:28.410
And I think that this is how
we need to think about what

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.780
government can do.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.440
There are actually moments in
history, perhaps not today,

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:42.210
that government has, in fact,
done extraordinary things.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.580
When the United States went
into World War II, within

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.120
three months, the auto industry

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.690
became the war industry.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.350
I am not recommending doing
that today at all.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.890
But when it is necessary and
there are emergencies, there

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:09.330
are things that government can
do that can change the world.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.800
Our work is also to create the
political will so that our

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.780
government actually imagines
itself able to do what it has

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.820
to do again.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:27.270
So these rules offer a new
compass for what is possible.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.180
And so for Google,
I hope that--

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.200
I know that you are going to
continue your aggressive,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.090
intelligent, expansion into
renewable energy.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.540
Be bold, bold, bold.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:47.900
Google uses 0.013% of total
energy usage in the world.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.390
100 searches use about a 60-watt
bulb for a half hour.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.690
I don't know about you, but
100 searches I could do in

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.120
seven minutes.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.220
So I'm burning a
lot of energy.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:07.350
And here I am at your company,
so how can I

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.040
not give you a challenge?

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.620
I suggest--

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.620
I challenge Google, actually--

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.090
to join with competitors,
collaborators, clients,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:25.360
schools, governments to lead a
surge of energy conservation.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.300
Use your platforms, your apps,
your innovation and inspire

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.880
global citizenship.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.090
We can blow out 10% of our
energy use in two years.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.900
You are possibly the only
company in the world that

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.620
could lead this kind
of effort.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.010
All of us-- you are a verb,
for god's sake--

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.820
we can add to the meaning
of what it

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.420
means to google something.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:56.350
To google something could mean
to conserve energy, not just

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.400
to use energy.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.870
I'm sure that there are
technological whizzes and

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.920
engineers in this room, and
artists that you work with,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.440
and competitors who you probably
don't work with, who

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.410
would want to do something
like this.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.720
And on your platforms, you could
encourage the world to

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.360
eliminate 10% of our use.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.740
I think that this is possible.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.200
And you can do this.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.080
Imagine that you are working
for a company that has the

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.810
power to do this.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.100
That's extraordinary.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.660
So I challenge you to
please do this.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.720
I think that we know that we
have to make a radical

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.520
transformation so that our
environmental debt does not

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.710
become irreconcilable.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:56.410
If the oceans fail, which they
might, this debt becomes

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.660
irreconcilable.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.730
As I hope that I've shown you,
nothing except for nature can

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.140
transform the world as swiftly
as can business, for

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.390
better or for worse.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.020
Business must act audaciously
to cohere the rules of

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.450
business with the
laws of nature.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.960
Thank you.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:26.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:26.744 --> 00:22:27.232
AMY LARKIN: Yes?

00:22:27.232 --> 00:22:28.696
AUDIENCE: What you call
the environmental debt

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.660
[? is what they called ?]
externality in economics.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.740
AMY LARKIN: Yes, it still is.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.121
AUDIENCE: And they've been
talking about taxing pollution

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.087
for all this time.

00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:41.145
And as far as I can tell, it's
not happening except for a

00:22:41.145 --> 00:22:46.360
little bit on the stuff
for acid rain.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.500
Why not?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.446
And why do you think it
could happen now?

00:22:50.446 --> 00:22:52.280
I mean, has Congress
gotten any better?

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.240
AMY LARKIN: No.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.590
I think it can happen now
largely because there is a

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.650
fissure in the business world.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:13.090
Do you remember in 2009 when the
US Congress was debating

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.550
cap and trade?

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:14.870
Yes?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.250
Remember that?

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.880
So the US Chamber of
Commerce acted--

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.670
lobbied very hard against it at
the behest of, largely, the

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.670
fossil fuel companies.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.010
So then what happened?

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.030
Apple quit.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.220
Nike, Johnson &amp; Johnson.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.300
A lot of companies stepped
forward and said, you do not

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.350
speak for us on this.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.660
You do not speak for us.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.770
And that has not happened
before, where business has

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.440
stepped up and said, whoa,
we think there

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.730
should be cap and trade.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:55.070
I have done work with a lot of
multinationals and have been

00:23:55.070 --> 00:24:00.540
part of I can't even say how
many conversations where CEOs

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.410
and senior management and board
members are, how do we

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.500
get this to change?

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.290
How do we get the rules to
change so that we are not at a

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.720
disadvantage if we do
what we want to do?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.680
Some companies, like Google--

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.100
I mean, Google, your company,
is, in fact, investing in

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.100
renewable energy.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.110
You don't need to do that.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.150
I mean, I think you do
need to do that.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.510
But you are one of those
companies that has enough

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.810
money, enough power, enough
market share, you can do it.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.680
But other companies that are
also big, iconic companies do

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.180
not have that freedom.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.920
So I think that the first
reason why I think it's

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:46.320
possible is that there are big
companies ready to step up and

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.690
say, we're ready to pay.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:49.750
We're ready to change.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.830
This cannot continue.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.510
Because we're not going to have
access to water or energy

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.340
as we need.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.970
That's the most optimistic
thing that I have seen.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.480
And in the president's climate
change speech a few weeks ago,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.200
he said, we want to start
measuring the

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.500
social cost of carbon.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:11.060
And I hope that he's not talking
about a 10-year, blue

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.590
ribbon commission because you
don't have to go very far.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.720
Go to Hurricane Sandy
in our backyard.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.070
That's a social cost
of carbon.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.430
So yes, it is the same as
externalities, except

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.740
externalities is a
big old concept.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.530
And environmental debt, I hope,
will become part of

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.980
public conversation
about our debt.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:40.070
I don't want to pay $100 billion
of taxpayer money to

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.340
clean up extreme weather, or
another $100 billion to clean

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.790
up flood insurance and
crop insurance.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.160
The more people understand
how our debt and our very

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.540
fool-hardy environmental actions
are connected, the

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.920
faster and stronger we
have the possibility

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.160
of making this change.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.410
So that's why I'm optimistic.

00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:08.082
AUDIENCE: He's at the
mic, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.010
AUDIENCE: How do you feel about
working with developing

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.980
nations who said, oh sure, you
got develop polluting.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.470
And now it's our turn
to develop and

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.190
you're telling us no.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.560
And that's also often where
the most cost-effective

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.310
interventions are.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:34.140
AMY LARKIN: Well, I think
something very interesting

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.990
happened recently.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.630
I was working for many, many
years with Greenpeace on

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.260
refrigerants.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.570
And HFCs, which are the most
common refrigerants, are also

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:51.220
thousands of times more potent
than CO2 and a growing

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:57.480
terrible wedge in the greenhouse
gas emission

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.990
[? load ?] over the world.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:04.220
And China was always fighting
against the changes to the

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.260
rules regarding those
chemicals.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.720
And about six weeks ago or two
months ago, China and the

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.060
United States agreed for the
first time in climate talks

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.020
that China will join
the US in trying to

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.920
eliminate these chemicals.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.730
So I'm, of course, working with
400 corporations who have

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.600
committed to eliminate
these chemicals.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.670
But as I have said, the
corporations have led, and now

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.490
the governments feel that
it's safe to move in.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:47.530
I think that it is a hugely
difficult situation where if

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.070
everyone in this room never
bought anything again, we'd

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.850
probably be fine.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:58.990
But if people in Brazil or Ghana
or China or India want

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.260
to buy a hair dryer or a house
or a refrigerator for the

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.150
first time, or whatever it might
be, who are we to say,

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.250
well, really, don't?

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.480
It is not appropriate
for us to say.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:21.840
So again, if we create this
connection where things cost

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:28.350
what they should, and where
companies get tax incentives

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.650
for doing the right thing--

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.460
accelerated depreciation for
green energy investments, for

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.620
example; accelerated
depreciation for

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.340
state-of-the-art technology
like that Pepsi plant--

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.540
there are a variety
of ways to alter--

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:52.730
imagine if our foreign aid were
connected with good clean

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.980
technology.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:00.940
I think that the only way to
realistically deal with this

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:07.900
is for those of us who are
wealthy like we are step up

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.800
and say, OK, I get that I've
lived like the king of Egypt

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.010
for a long time for really
cheaply and have caused huge

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.050
problems globally.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.000
I get that I have to pay.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.600
And I think that this is also,
though, where a Google

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.960
platform that shows
we can save--

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.900
because in addition to paying
new costs, I think there are

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.910
savings to be had.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.830
And I think that we don't
think about them yet.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:46.240
And when we do that, the entire
course of what things

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.430
cost is going to change.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:53.070
And that should happen over the
next 10 years, not so that

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:58.020
the world goes into total
cataclysmic economic shock,

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:06.230
but so that the world moves into
an economy where the laws

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.740
of nature and the rules of
business live together.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.775
That's the only way
to solve this.

00:30:14.775 --> 00:30:15.250
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.280
AMY LARKIN: Hi.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.370
AUDIENCE: So love the premise,
love the solutions.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.380
And I think that this is like
a larger systemic issue that

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.070
requires lots of leverage points
into the system, one

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.410
being changing the rules,
changing policy from the

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.250
governmental side and larger
international bodies.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:35.110
But also a lot of this reminds
me of a larger movement in

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.867
triple bottom line
businesses--

00:30:36.867 --> 00:30:41.050
certified B Corporations, green
business for America,

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:41.820
things like that.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.740
And I'm wondering if you could
comment on that and how that

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.610
might play a larger role.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.020
It seems to be something that's
happening for the last

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.570
20 years and only now starting
to get a larger acceleration.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.230
AMY LARKIN: I think that--

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.514
AUDIENCE: Can you start by
defining some of those terms?

00:30:54.514 --> 00:30:54.811
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:54.960
Sorry.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.140
AMY LARKIN: Did you
want to do it?

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.170
Or you want me to?

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.140
AUDIENCE: I'll give
it a quick shot.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.010
So the one that I'm most
familiar with because I'm

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.030
working with B Lab, which
is in Philadelphia--

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.380
they certify businesses just
like you would for a

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.180
fair-trade label or
organic label.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.430
But these businesses hit
certain criteria for

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.610
environmental stewardship,
governance, structure, how

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.110
they treat their employees,
things like that.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.690
And as a result, it's mainly
intended as a market

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.890
identifier to say, hey, this
is not greenwashing.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.070
This is a company that's
actually putting its money and

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.120
actions where its mouth
is, and so consumers

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.670
can react to that.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.180
But they're also looking at
legislation so that instead of

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.430
becoming an LLC or an
incorporation, you can become

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.880
a benefit corporation, which has
in its legal charter, hey,

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.860
we're going to stick to these
environmental and social

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.330
constraints.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.040
AMY LARKIN: And triple bottom
line is the three bottom lines

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.850
are people, planet, profits.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:57.900
And there is a movement similar
to B Corp-- in fact,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.210
probably many of the B Corps
are ascribed to the triple

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.050
bottom line.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.270
I think that this is a movement
like the organic food

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.090
movement, which has now become a
mainstream movement and is a

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.490
large piece--

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.660
it's not a large piece,
but it is a growing

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.330
and significant piece--

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.580
in the world's food supply.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.120
I've had a lot of conversations
like this,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.500
especially with my Greenpeace
colleagues where I'm off

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.690
working with multinationals
and come back to meetings.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:38.380
And you can imagine
the conversations.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.480
So I think that this
is fantastic.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.880
It's a fantastic movement.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.540
And it is the roots of change.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.350
And I think one of the things I
have in my book is a list of

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:54.440
companies that started like
that that are now owned by

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.740
large multinationals.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.440
So Ben &amp; Jerry's is
owned by Unilever.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.220
Naked Juice is owned by Pepsi.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.560
Odwalla is owned by Coca-Cola,
Kashi is by Kellogg's.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.200
I could have gotten some
of those wrong.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.510
I apologize if I did.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:14.440
But it's essentially exactly
those kinds of companies are

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.550
being bought by large
multinationals.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:24.780
So in some cases, I'm sure you
can ascribe motives that are

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.430
very tough to why these
companies bought them.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.200
But on the other hand, my
experience is that, in some

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.900
cases, the knowledge of these
on-the-ground, longtime,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.410
organic, healthy businesses is
actually flowing up into the

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.580
big parent company.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.000
Not all the time, but more
than you would think.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.330
And I think one of the examples
of why this is a--

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.620
I think it's great.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.880
And Walmart has committed to--

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.910
Walmart--

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.500
has got this huge environmental
initiative and

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.480
has committed to buying $1
billion from small- and

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.400
medium-size farming, and is
now the largest seller of

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.820
organic milk and cotton and
other commodities in the US.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.679
Maybe in the world, actually.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:23.130
Walmart has committed $1
billion to these farms.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.389
Now, whatever you want to say
about Walmart, if I'm a small

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:32.090
farmer, I'm really
happy about that.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.489
Because that allows me to invest
in my business in a way

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:44.570
that I couldn't necessarily do
when a small organic brand

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.159
was, in fact, my major
purchaser.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.400
So I think that we
need it all.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.710
I mean, we have so many issues
to address, as you said, from

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.650
every kind of entry point.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.030
I love those companies.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.090
They're all my friends.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.230
And I think that the big
multinationals, which can

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:12.020
alter markets more quickly, need
rules so that they can

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.320
make money the old-fashioned
way, cleanly.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.420
So that's what I would
say about that.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.670
Anyone else?

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.500
OK.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.100
Well, thank you very much.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.300
I really appreciate the
chance to talk to you.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.800
