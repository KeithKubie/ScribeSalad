NARRATOR: You've spent years hearing about
advances in AI, from programs that beat

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:14.280
go and chess grandmasters to smart
assistants--

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
WOMAN: Hey Alexa, play my coding playlist.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.460
NARRATOR: --and facial recognition--

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.955
MAN: I ruff you!

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.860
NARRATOR: AI is changing how we live.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.100
Now you're ready to take the next step and
learn AI yourself. You know where you

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.160
want to go but you don't know where to
start.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800
That's why we built the AI programming
with Python Nanodegree.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.020
In two months or less you'll build your own AI
application using deep neural networks

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.740
from scratch. Learn all the key AI skills
in one place such as Python, linear algebra,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.460
and deep learning with Pytorch.
And get the support you need for success

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.560
with mentorship and project reviews
our AI experts. So what are you waiting for?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.540
