00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.920
In putting this all together, an important point to

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.050
get across is there's no such single, tangible thing as in the architecture.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.940
An architecture is a set of decisions.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.830
You can convey some of the information about those decisions with various views,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.340
whether they're graphical or textual, okay?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.350
And their sum conveys the architecture.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.160
For your purposes as a developer, you need to select the appropriate views

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.530
depending upon the structure of the system, that is the complexity and

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.430
the application domain of the system and the particular people that are going to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.250
be looking at those diagrams or reading that text.
