 Gregory: Three times a week, 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.480
 I wake up very early and start from Paris. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.920
 I kept it secret because others might think 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.240
 that I'm crazy. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.880
 Neither my family knew this. 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 It's like doing a double life. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.800
 We are going to an island where I have a farm. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
 [quiet music] 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.360
 I started with almost nothing. 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.280
 It was really hard to make this production area. 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.360
 You just have to show humility 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.200
 faced with the elements of nature. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
 When I collected my first organic potatoes, 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.480
 I was very happy. 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.240
 I was worried about the world 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.000
 which we will leave to the children. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.360
 If you want to be healthy and grow, 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.640
 must have healthy foods. 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
 And after seven years, 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.960
 we supply more than 500 schools and kindergartens in Paris. 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.680
 This is my contribution, 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 to prepare the next generation to change the world. 

00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:55.186
 Gregory is also the founder and executive director of Xooloo, 

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:57.199
 an app that helps kids learn good digital habits. 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.819
