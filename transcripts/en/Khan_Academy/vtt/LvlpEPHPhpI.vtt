00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.673
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammar pals,

00:00:01.673 --> 00:00:03.137
and welcome to the future,

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:07.119
full of jet packs and
spaceships and shiny jumpsuits,

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:09.286
and also the word "will"!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.330
There's a lot of will in the future,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.357
by which I mean we use this word, "will",

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:20.881
to form the future tense in English.

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.402
So, in the present tense you'd say,

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:25.235
"I eat this cupcake."

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.286
That's the present.

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.519
But in the future, you would say

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.011
"I will eat this cupcake."

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:47.592
Because we use the future

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:52.228
to talk about stuff that's
happening later than now.

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:56.062
Literally, it's in the
future, so it's later,

00:00:56.986 --> 00:00:57.819
as opposed to the present,

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.881
which talks about now, and the past

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.263
which talks about stuff

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:04.354
that has already happened,
happened earlier.

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:07.326
So the most common way to form the future

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.173
is to just make a sentence
in the present tense

00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:14.340
and then before the verb,
just stick "will" in there.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.677
So, "I pet the triceratops."

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.033
Everyone's favorite dinosaur.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.245
Wish I could pet one.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.245
Can't, they're extinct.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:42.112
"I pet the triceratops."

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:47.076
But in the future, maybe
when they clone dinosaurs,

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.576
"I will pet the triceratops."

00:01:54.937 --> 00:01:57.104
And we will be best buds.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.644
So that's the most basic
way of forming the future.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:06.311
You can also use "is going to".

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:11.527
So you could say,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.043
"Lorraine is going to visit Canada."

00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.525
And that's another way to form the future.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.463
But the most common way to do it

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.945
is to just put in "will".

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.829
Just write the sentence as you
would for the present tense,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.211
but then you just gotta pop in "will".

00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:41.923
"I eat this cupcake." is the present,

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:45.254
"I will eat this cupcake." In the future.

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:46.391
That's the future tense.

00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:48.629
You will be able to learn anything.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.594
David, out.
