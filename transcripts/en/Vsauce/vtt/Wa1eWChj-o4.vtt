Vsauce, are you leaning back right now?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.059
Of course you're not. But you will be soon,
because a new episode of Vsauce Leanback

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.500
has just been released and to start it,
click the link at the top of

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.790
this video's description. This week's topic is
really fun. It's a menagerie of awesome

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.920
videos from producers

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.000
all over YouTube with the atmosphere

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.390
of Earth as our rough guide.
We're going to begin way down here,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.910
in this part of the atmosphere, the troposphere,
which is where most weather occurs

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.019
and where we live.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.969
And then we'll move up into the
stratosphere and beyond to the

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.809
mysterious mesosphere

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.829
and then the gigantic thermosphere where
space shuttles roam.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.580
And even though they said it couldn't be done,
we will be discussing the exosphere

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.260
today.
So what are you waiting for? Click the link

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.730
at the top of this video's description to
begin autoplay mode and let

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.110
each video segment start one after the
other. So all you have to do is lean back

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.699
and let the information hit you in the face.
I'll see you soon

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.899
in the lean back.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.779
And as always,

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:02.279
thanks for watching.
