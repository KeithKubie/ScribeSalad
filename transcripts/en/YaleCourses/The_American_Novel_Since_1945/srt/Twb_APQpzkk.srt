1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,700
I just want to recap what
I talked about last time.

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,630
Very briefly,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,110
I made the point in the first lecture
that American literature in the middle of

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,111
the 20th century is
particularly preoccupied with
the relationship between the

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,970
writer and the reader,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
between imagination and lived experience
between fiction and truth between the

7
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,240
reader and the text,

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
that these are very vexed and
contested interfaces at this period.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,550
I also made the argument
that at this moment,

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,060
literary art is struggling with what to
do with the legacy of modernism in the

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,313
early century,

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,460
but there's another strain from the
early century that matters and matters,

13
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:01,230
particularly to Richard Wright.

14
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,880
And that is the American
strain of naturalism.

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,870
A writer's like Theodore Dreiser,
right?

16
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:13,560
His writing very much in
the vein of those writers.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
So even though he's very closely
connected to the legacy of avant garde

18
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,060
modernism,

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,470
he's also connected to
a social realist strain,

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,430
the naturalist strain.
Those are two slightly different things,

21
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,010
which I won't go into right now.
Um,

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,790
he's connected to both those strains
as well as the modernist, uh,

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,643
strain.

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,220
So what I want to do today is look
closely first at the selections from black

25
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,730
boy that I asked you to read.
Uh,

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,880
and to look at those as a text and to ask
ourselves what we can learn about what

27
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:59,010
kind of story it is.
And I said about that problem.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,440
Is it autobiography? Is it
fiction? What's it trying to do?

29
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,670
What kind of reader does it want?
Um,

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,680
I suggested that there was a critical
response to those issues that was somewhat

31
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:14,341
negative.

32
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,270
And I want to sort of remind you of that
just by reading you a little bit from

33
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,680
Web Dubois is review of
black boy when it came out.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,780
Um, I think this sums up nicely what
I was trying to communicate last time.

35
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,243
He says,

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,520
this book tells a harsh and forbidding
story and makes one wonder just exactly

37
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:40,611
what its relation to truth is the
title a record of childhood and youth.

38
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,390
That was the subtitle makes one first
think that the story is autobiographical.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,370
It probably is at least in part,

40
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,550
but mainly it is probably intended to
be fiction or fictionalized biography.

41
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,091
At any rate,

42
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:02,091
the reader must regard it as creative
writing rather than simply a record of

43
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,990
life.
So that's still B e B Dubois.

44
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,290
And I'm going to to take his advice and
now begin to read this book with you as

45
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,720
creative writing. So let's see what it
says to us when we look at it that way.

46
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,290
I want to start, I'm going to read, uh,

47
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,310
passages quite a bit today since some
of you may not have been able to get the

48
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,700
Ras packet in time,
it being shopping period.

49
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,480
So I'm going to read passages and I hope
you'll jump around with me if you have

50
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,710
the texts in your hand. Um, in general,
you should always bring the book to class.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,250
This is on page 267.

52
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,251
This is from that second half of the
book that was not published originally,

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,520
but I want to point to it.
First of all,

54
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,710
in raising the question,
what did we lose

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,240
in understanding this as a literary
object when the second half of the book,

56
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,470
you can come in and sit down if you want.
There's some space down here.

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,293
Um,

58
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,140
what did we lose in our understanding of
it as a literary object when the second

59
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,470
half was not published?
There are some seats here too

60
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,160
on two 67.

61
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,190
This is in one of these parent
thetical passages where the narrator is

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,610
commenting on what he's just,
um,

63
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,370
give an account of in his experience.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,680
Slowly I began to forge
in the depths of my mind.

65
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:40,180
This is the very top of the page,

66
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,690
a mechanism that repressed all the dreams
and desires that the Chicago streets,

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,240
the newspapers,
the movies were evoking in me.

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,780
I was going through a second childhood,

69
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,340
a new sense of the limit of the
possible was being born in me.

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,040
What right?
Gives us.

71
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:05,041
Here is an account of the two parts of
this story that says this is an account

72
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,140
of not one childhood,
but too.

73
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,460
So one thing that readers lost when they
lost the second half of this book is

74
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:24,391
the sense that maturing the process
process of maturing was more than just the

75
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,330
process of leaving the south
that has a typical buildings,

76
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,020
Roman structure,

77
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,410
the structure of a story about a boy
who goes out from his home and sort of

78
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,370
becomes a man through his travels.

79
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,270
If you just have the first half,

80
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,330
you think that that development is
accomplished when Richard decides to leave

81
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,294
the south.

82
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,780
But what he tells us very
early in part two is no,

83
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:03,461
it takes two childhoods for a
black man to make that journey.

84
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,510
So what is that journey then that
required two childhoods to accomplish a

85
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:15,990
childhood in the south and
then a childhood in the north.

86
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,620
So now I want to turn to
the beginning of the book.

87
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
I'm on page seven.

88
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm also gonna do some
summarizing of these scenes. Um,

89
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,830
if for people who haven't read, um, make
yourselves as comfortable as you can.

90
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,590
As I mentioned last time in
the first scene of this book,

91
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,220
the Child Richard Burns down his family's
house playing with matches underneath

92
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,670
the curtains. His mother, uh,

93
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,690
he goes and hides under the house afraid
of the beating his mother will give him

94
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,020
and indeed when his mother
finally finds him, uh,

95
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:59,820
he is beaten unconscious
and he is feverish and sick
for a long time afterward.

96
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,750
And what I want to read to you
is this passage on page seven,

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,720
I was lost in a fog of fear.
A doctor was called,

98
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,550
I was afterwards told and he ordered that
I be kept a bed, that I be kept quiet,

99
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,250
that very,
my very life depended upon it.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My body seemed on fire
and I could not sleep.

101
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,140
Packs of ice were put on my
forehead to keep down the fever,

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,060
whatever I tried to sleep,

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,120
I would see huge wobbley white bags
like the full auditors of cows suspended

104
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:39,540
from the ceiling above me.
Later. As I grew worse,

105
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,800
I could see the bags in the daytime with
my eyes open and I was gripped by the

106
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:48,801
fear that they were going to fall and
drench me with some horrible liquid day

107
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,170
and night. I begged my mother
and father to take the bags away,

108
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,100
pointing to them shaking with terror
because no one saw them but me.

109
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,290
Exhaustion would make me drift towards
sleep and then I would scream until I was

110
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,930
wide awake again.
I was afraid to sleep.

111
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,760
Time finally bore me away from
the dangerous bags and I got well,

112
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,150
but for a long time I was chastened
whenever I remembered that my mother had

113
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:19,170
come close to killing me.
Why start with this scene?

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,730
I said last time that part of the art
of autobiography is choosing what do you

115
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:27,150
choose out of your life? Where
do you begin? Where do you end?

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,890
What do you put next to?
What?

117
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,320
Why does right choose this scene?
It's very dramatic,

118
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,260
so it has that going for it.
It's a hook.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I would suggest that this little passage
I just read to you tells us in part

120
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,503
why.

121
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,690
Yeah,

122
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,690
it's a moment when a child realizes that
the person who gave him life can revoke

123
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,414
it.

124
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,610
His mother who gave him life can
take that life away from him.

125
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,130
It's a profound sense of jeopardy.
Physical,

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,850
mortal,

127
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,850
jeopardy and I want to point to those
huge wobbly white bags like the full

128
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,310
utters of cows.

129
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,540
One of the wonderful things you
can see in the buying of keys,

130
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,430
Richard Wright archives,
is the draft copies of black boy,

131
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,370
right?
Revised this image in those drafts.

132
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,570
It was at one time white faces,

133
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,020
not white bags,
white faces.

134
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,060
This to me is a fascinating revision.
First of all,

135
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:51,061
it suggests of course that he
was giving language to something,

136
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,550
making a specific image out of something
that didn't quite have that specific

137
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,940
content in his experience as a child,

138
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,470
but that revision is also a way from a
sense that this jeopardy is represented

139
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,000
by a racial face,

140
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,950
the symbolic face of black oppression,

141
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,610
the white face that is always cruelly set
against the black boy of this account.

142
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,640
He revises it away from that to the more
generalized fundamental but also very

143
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:41,350
personal figure of the
mother and the maternal.

144
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:45,850
So the white bags, this is an image
of the breast. We have the, um,

145
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,160
this fear of the horrible
white liquid as if milk,

146
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:52,510
we're going to drown him.

147
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,260
So the threat embodied by the mother who
will beat her own son on conscious is

148
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:04,321
embodied in that fevered vision of
the bags like the full utters of cows.

149
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,200
Yeah.

150
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,090
So this novel,

151
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:15,150
this autobiography begins with the
sense that this boy is in danger from

152
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,180
practically the moment
he comes into the world.

153
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,400
The moment he comes into consciousness

154
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,310
that I want to note the transition that
happens at the very bottom of this page

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,630
after he says,
I was chasing,

156
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:35,350
whenever I remembered that my
mother had come close to killing me,

157
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,920
then we move into something
that I call a catalog.

158
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:43,000
There are three of these
in the first half. Um,

159
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,030
it's a list of sensations or perceptions
that don't have a particular narrative

160
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:52,930
structure. Exactly. They're just a sort of

161
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,780
of experience.

162
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Each event spoke with a cryptic tone and
the moments of living slowly revealed

163
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,720
they're coded meanings.
There was the wonder,

164
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:10,721
I felt when I saw of brace like mountain
abrasive mountain likes spotted black

165
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:15,770
and white horses clopping down a dusty
road through clouds of powdered clay.

166
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,810
There was the delight I caught in seeing
long straight rows of red and green

167
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:24,680
vegetables stretching away in
the sun to the bright horizon.

168
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,001
There was the fate,

169
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:30,680
cool kiss of sensuality when
do came to my cheeks and shins.

170
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,910
As I ran down the wet green
garden paths in the early morning,

171
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,400
there was the vague sense of the infinite.

172
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,740
As I looked down upon the yellow dreaming
waters of the Mississippi from the

173
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:46,580
Verdun bluffs of Nachos,
I'm going to stop there.

174
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,830
There's a lot you can
say about these catalogs.

175
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,940
And when I used to teach the whole of
this text over a course of two days, um,

176
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,020
I would spend a lot of time and if you
want to it's worth and it repays the time

177
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:04,010
that you could spend rereading these
and thinking about the exact language.

178
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,010
For instance here at the very top of page
eight when he talks about the dreaming

179
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:11,390
waters of the Mississippi River,

180
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,840
what you have there is a moment when
the perception of the child becomes the

181
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:20,810
perception of the world
imbued with imagination.

182
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:24,830
So the river is not dreaming,
it's Richard Who's dreaming.

183
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,040
So this is in part a catalog that
represents the weakening of sensuality,

184
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,330
the awakening of the body to its
environment, to his environment.

185
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,270
But also there's this sense of imagination
and you get that in the dreaming

186
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,104
waters.

187
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,290
You get that in the sense of travel or
the image of the road that you can see in

188
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:55,160
the green and red vegetables stretching
away in their rose to the bright

189
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:58,880
horizon. There's that sense
of, of space, of expansiveness,

190
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,710
the possibility of travel.

191
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,150
Why put this next to right
after that very dramatic scene?

192
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,960
Why is this the moment to enter
into that meditation? Well,

193
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:19,560
I think it's because it's in bonding,

194
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:24,561
an oscillation that we'll come back in
this text between radical jeopardy and

195
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:32,031
deprivation and the
compensation of sensuality,

196
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,240
emotion and imagination.

197
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,540
These to oscillate back and forth.

198
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,690
So the moment of deprivation is often
then balanced by a moment of imagination.

199
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,303
Yeah,

200
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,740
and so what I'm going to do just now
run through the next two or three scenes

201
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,700
and talk about why they're
set next to each other.

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,880
So the next one we have a just on
page nine is come quite rapidly.

203
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,084
Here

204
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
is the day his mother tells him that
they're going to Memphis on a boat called

205
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:16,430
the Kate Adams. He said, he says,

206
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,510
my eagerness thereafter
made the days seem endless.

207
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,310
Each night I went to bed hoping that
the next morning would be the day of

208
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,690
departure. How big is the boat? I
asked my mother as big as a mountain.

209
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,370
She said, how's it got a whistle?
Yes. Just the whistle blow.

210
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,210
Yes. When? When the
captain wants it to blow.

211
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,780
Why do they call it the Kate Adams?
Because that's the boat's name.

212
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,550
What color is the boat? White.
How long will we be on the boat?

213
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,320
All Day and all night while we sleep
on the boat? Yes. When we get sleep,

214
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,210
he will sleep now hush.
For days,

215
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:57,530
I had dreamed about a huge white boat
floating on a vast body of water.

216
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,610
But when my mother took me down
to the levy on the day of leaving,

217
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,790
I saw a tiny dirty boat that was not
at all like the boat I had imagined.

218
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,010
If in the catalog,
imagination is awakened,

219
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,850
this is what it can then do.
For Richard.

220
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,790
It can endow his daily experience
with a kind of romance.

221
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,530
But of course,

222
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,860
this is a poor black child growing
up in the south and his expectations,

223
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:37,341
what his mind can imagine is always going
to be greater than what the world can

224
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:38,634
deliver.

225
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,690
So if the landscape invites him
to grow as an imaginative person,

226
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,280
the social world, he lives in this
episode signals to us immediately.

227
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,950
We'll never live up to that imagination.

228
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,640
Yeah.

229
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,640
There is a sense of powerlessness that
arises from the repeated oscillation that

230
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:13,850
you start to see even set up in
these first three little vignettes.

231
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,930
And the problem of powerlessness is first
located not centrally in that social

232
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:25,640
world. I don't think we're meant to
understand that the young Richard,

233
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,800
when he discovers that the Kate Adams
is a dirty little boat and not this

234
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,240
romantic vision of a ship,

235
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:37,241
he had hoped for that the young
Richard thinks to himself.

236
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,380
This is because I am a poor black
boy growing up in the south.

237
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,400
It's simply an experience
of disappointment,

238
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,740
the sense of powerlessness,

239
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,770
the most profound sense of powerlessness
suggested already by the first episode

240
00:17:55,141 --> 00:18:00,030
where his mother almost takes back
the life she gave him is rooted in the

241
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:00,864
family.

242
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,630
And we get such a dramatic vision of
that in the next episode that follows the

243
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,010
episode of the kitten.
So for those of you who haven't read,

244
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Richard's Father Works Nights
and sleeps during the day and uh,

245
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,170
during the day the children
therefore have to be very quiet.

246
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There is a cat outside the apartment
building that starts to meow and the boys

247
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:33,270
are interested in it. The
father yells at them, says,

248
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:37,440
make that catch shot up and they can't.
He says,

249
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,400
make it shut up.

250
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:43,401
I don't care half kill it if
you have to kill that cat.

251
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,720
Richard at this point
already hates his father.

252
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,830
His father will abandon the family quite
soon after this episode for Richard.

253
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:00,390
He is mostly this kind of presence,
a Cavaillon,

254
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,170
angry,
abusive presence.

255
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,730
His resentment over his powerlessness
within the family seeds in this moment,

256
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,120
and he thinks of a way to
get back at his father.

257
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,290
I'll take his words,
literally, I will kill the cat.

258
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,630
He thinks that's how he does.

259
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,240
He hangs the cat.

260
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,110
Richard's mother finds out
when his brother tells on him

261
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,230
and the father cannot punish him.

262
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,400
He has taken the father's words literally
when they were not meant literally.

263
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,590
But in doing so, in relying on
his father's words in a sense,

264
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,740
to protect him,
even as he subverts them,

265
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,850
he escapes the punishment that would
otherwise so naturally and habitually

266
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,823
follow.

267
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,750
So Richard's first exertion of agency
in this book is through the Agency of

268
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:18,050
words in this case,

269
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,440
in asserting an interpretation of the
words at odds with their intended meaning.

270
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,660
It's as if Richard takes those
words and he makes them his own,

271
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,170
takes them from his father and gains a
different kind of strength from them,

272
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,260
a strength he can then use
to get back at his father.

273
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,470
This was the first instance in which
Richard will do what he later describes

274
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:48,310
Mankin doing,
using as weapons.

275
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,050
His discovery of Mankin using words as
weapons in a political sense is a very

276
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:01,390
powerful moment for him in his
intellectual development. In this case,

277
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,360
it's a much more visceral
kind of development.

278
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,890
It's the understanding that he can
make things happen in the world.

279
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,640
He can defend himself against his father's
punishment through the use of words,

280
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,070
but I want to note

281
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,760
that his mother takes
a different approach.

282
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,970
If his father resigns himself
to Richard a subterfuge,

283
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,060
his mother does not, and
this is on page 12 he says,

284
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,250
I had had my first triumph over my father.

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,160
I had made him believe that I
had taken his words literally.

286
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,160
He could not punish me now
without risking his authority.

287
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,750
I was happy because I had at last found
a way to throw my criticism of him into

288
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:53,410
his face. I had made him feel that if
he whipped me for killing the kitten,

289
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,320
I would never give serious
weight to his words again.

290
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,070
I had made him know that I felt he was
cruel and I had done it without his

291
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:00,904
punishing me.

292
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,200
But my mother being more imaginative,

293
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,600
retaliated with an assault
upon my sensibilities that
crushed me with the moral

294
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,700
horror involved in taking a life.

295
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,970
And I want to just flip over to 13
about the same place on the page she's

296
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:24,661
confronted him with having knowingly
taken the father's words the wrong way.

297
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,430
Uh, you stop that lying. You knew
what he meant. I didn't eyeballed.

298
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,190
She shoved a tiny spade into my hands.

299
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,440
Go out there and dig a
hole and bury that kitten.

300
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,290
I stumbled out into the Black Knights
sobbing my legs wobbly from fear though I

301
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:45,190
knew that I had killed the kitten.
My mother's words had made it live again.

302
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,020
In my mind, what would that
kitten do to me when I touched it?

303
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,980
Would it caught my eyes as I grew up
toward the dead kid and my mother lingered

304
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,390
behind me, unseen in the dark, her
disembodied voice egging me on.

305
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,260
The mother has her own way
of using words for power

306
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,590
and she does it by making the kitten
live again in his imagination.

307
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,410
It's as if she's writing
fiction there in that scene,

308
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,850
she is representing this kitten that he's
killed so that it comes back to haunt

309
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,770
him.
So once again,

310
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,780
there's that immediate oscillation.

311
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,520
The moment Richard gain some
power from the use of words,

312
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,930
his mother takes it back by
exerting that power herself,

313
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,200
taking that power away from him.

314
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,840
There's a kind of drum beat
of a thematic material.

315
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
As these scenes pile up,

316
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,570
the drum beat is all about language.
Yes,

317
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:00,710
this is a book about the privations
of growing up in the south,

318
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,270
poor and black,

319
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,260
but it is very much very consciously a
book about the development of someone who

320
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:15,050
attends to language.
So in these early scenes,

321
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,310
it's all about power,

322
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,700
but it's actually not even quite so easy
or so simple as these early scenes that

323
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:27,710
I've just discussed
might make out language,

324
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:30,890
has powers that are
entirely unpredictable,

325
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,490
that can't be harnessed in precisely that
deliberate way by making a decision to

326
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:42,791
take someone's words in the wrong way
or by telling a story to make a moral

327
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,660
point as the mother does.

328
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,330
So think about the scene
where Richard gets, uh,

329
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,760
drinks in the saloon as a child.

330
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Patrons pay him and give him drinks to
go up and repeat their words to other

331
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,590
people in the bar. Usually this
happens between men and women.

332
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,830
So a man will give Richard a drink and
pay him a few pennies to go to a woman in

333
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:15,500
the bar and repeat certain things
that he has a trained Richard to say,

334
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,493
okay,

335
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,300
in doing this,
the patrons tit her,

336
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,790
everybody sort of has fun with this.

337
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,970
Richard has no idea what he's saying.

338
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,530
He's simply repeating the sounds
of the words that are given to him

339
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,010
through this process.

340
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,840
He becomes addicted to
alcohol at a very young age.

341
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,640
But at the same time,
he learns something about language.

342
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,190
It has mysterious powers.

343
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,330
It has capacities to make things happen
in the world that he doesn't know how to

344
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,234
control.

345
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,320
Okay.

346
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,320
When he finally emerges from this
time of being a young drunkard,

347
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,370
his mother sort of locks him up in the
house and make sure he can't get out and

348
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:09,420
then take some to work with her and
so on so that he loses that taste for

349
00:26:09,421 --> 00:26:12,210
alcohol in the tax.

350
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:17,211
What you have right next to that is the
beginning of his insatiable questions.

351
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:23,040
He starts just torture his mother with
a thousand questions about everything in

352
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:23,874
the world.

353
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,380
The addiction to alcohol is in a sense
replaced by an addiction to knowledge.

354
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,900
The experience of having language
speak through him and do things that he

355
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:44,070
doesn't understand
makes him want to again,

356
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,260
that agency that he experienced when
he took his father's words. Literally

357
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,793
this

358
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,620
theme comes back in the
scene where his grandmother,

359
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:01,610
his washing him, you remember
the scene, his grandmother,

360
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:06,611
his washing him and his brother in the
tub and she's washing his butt and he

361
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,610
says to her,
when you're finished,

362
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,770
kiss back there and woo,

363
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,730
she's flying off the roof with anger,

364
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,030
chasing him around the house,
trying to whip him with a wet towel.

365
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:20,960
So on and so forth.

366
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,650
Very dramatic scene again of powerlessness
within the family of being the victim

367
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,130
of violence within the family.
But in this case,

368
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,650
it's a response produced
in the negative register,

369
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,650
similar to the responses
produced in the saloon.

370
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:46,100
He says something and he doesn't really
know where those words come from.

371
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,610
He doesn't really know what made his
granny so angry about those words.

372
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,250
He doesn't understand
the words that he's used,

373
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,550
but boy do they produce a response.

374
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,680
So there's this sense in which the story
of a developing writer is the story of

375
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:12,560
someone learning even before they
learn how to control language fully.

376
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,130
That language has these capacities.
Well,

377
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,160
there's another element though to
the kind of language that Richard is

378
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,790
describing learning and that
is the racial element element.

379
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,910
He is learning a racialized language.

380
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,020
And here I want to look
at page. Uh, let's see,

381
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,730
page 79

382
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,650
actually first on 47
just in passing quickly.

383
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,730
You know what I'm looking at my watch,
we don't have time.

384
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:44,990
We'll go straight to 79.

385
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,180
On page 79 we get an account
of a conversation between
Richard and his friends

386
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,690
and it's annotated

387
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,980
with interpretive asides.

388
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,930
So I'm going to start in
the middle of this. Um,

389
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,350
the crowd laughs long and loud.
This in the middle of the page, man.

390
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:19,070
Then white folks ought to catch you and
send you to a zoo and keep you for the

391
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:22,220
next war,
throwing the subject into a wider field.

392
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,040
Then when that fighting starts,

393
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,970
they ought to feed you on buttermilk and
black eyed peas and let you break wind.

394
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,340
The subject is accepted and extended.

395
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,690
You'd win the war with a new kind
of poison gas. I shouted. Climax.

396
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,530
There's high laughter that simmers
down slowly may be poisoned gases,

397
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,470
something good to have. The subject
of white folks is associational.

398
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:47,380
He swept into the orbit of talk.
Yeah.

399
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,660
If they have a race ride around here,

400
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:52,930
I'm going to kill all the white
folks with my poison bit. Her pride,

401
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,760
gleeful laughter.

402
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:59,440
Then silence each waiting for the other
to contribute something than white folks.

403
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:03,550
Sure. Scared of us though. Sober
statement of an old problem.

404
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,210
What we see here is a doubled voice.

405
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,310
This is a moment when the narrative
voice begins to split in a very conscious

406
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,144
way.

407
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,480
So what you have is the account of Richard
and his friends talking in the past

408
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,880
and you have the present narrators
parsing of how this language relates to

409
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:30,070
topics that impinge upon
their very, uh, context,

410
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,530
the racial realities of the south.

411
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,380
So what you see here is a narrator
who has learned to do that,

412
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:41,740
parsing some of these terms that he uses,

413
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,580
our literary climax,
the creation of suspense.

414
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,020
So he's tracking this as if it were
the development of a narrative,

415
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,380
but he's also suggesting how humor is
used to broach topics that are impossible

416
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,950
to talk about in more direct ways or
that feel dangerous to these boys to

417
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:04,210
approach in more direct ways.

418
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,770
So there is a kind of grammar of race
that this boy is learning while he

419
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:16,520
experiences language in
all these other more um,

420
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,940
visceral family oriented ways.

421
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,890
There's the social context
of race relations, who's
grammar he is also learning.

422
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,050
And I would just remind you of the
passage where he starts to ask his mother

423
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,570
about whether his granny is white or not.

424
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,310
There's a long conversation and
she gets very frustrated with him.

425
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,470
She doesn't really want
to answer that question.

426
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:44,190
She is a woman who looks very white but
is categorized as black in that system

427
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,134
of the south.

428
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,850
And so Richard is learning a grammar of
race even while he tries to work out how

429
00:31:57,011 --> 00:32:00,460
to use language as a source
of power in his family.

430
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,530
The split voice,

431
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,790
the development of what you could say
is that racial double consciousness.

432
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,340
The WB Dubois talks about

433
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,990
that double consciousness of the racial
reality is manifested in that split in

434
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:21,310
the narrative,
in the horror and the glory.

435
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,410
The second half of the
book as originally written,

436
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,580
that voice becomes the parent thetical.

437
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,220
It takes another development altogether.

438
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,660
So if you look in certain passages,
um,

439
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,793
let's see,

440
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,140
on two 72 and two 73.

441
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,073
Okay.

442
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,380
Actually I'm going to start to 71.
Um,

443
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,610
this is where Richard is
talking about the waitresses,

444
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:05,060
the white waitresses he works with
and the restaurant in Chicago.

445
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,410
This is what he says about them.
Um,

446
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,910
about three quarters of the way
down the page during my lunch hour,

447
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,940
which I spent on a bench in a nearby park,

448
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,290
the waitresses would come and sit beside
me talking at random, laughing, joking,

449
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:22,280
smoking cigarettes. I learned about their
tawdry dreams. There's simple hopes.

450
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:26,420
Their home lives, their fear of feeling
anything deeply, their sex problems,

451
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,380
their husbands, they were an eager,
restless, talkative, ignorant bunch,

452
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,550
but casually, kind and impersonal for
all that they knew nothing of hate.

453
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:38,330
And fear and strove instinctively
to avoid all passion.

454
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,220
That commentary that you get right in
the scene, not in the parent theoretical.

455
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,580
It's as if the Voice of
Richard remembering the
early parts of his childhood,

456
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,520
the voice that can parse a conversation
is then part of what gets remembered as

457
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:01,910
part of the scene.
When Richard is with those waitresses,

458
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,810
he's reflecting on these
things as he experiences them,

459
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,410
but there's a second kind
of development in this,

460
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:13,820
gets to that second childhood he invokes
that happens to him when he goes to

461
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:14,654
Chicago.

462
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,160
There's a social analysis that
he begins to be able to advance,

463
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,830
partly due to his reading
and Marxism in sociology.

464
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:25,671
Right,

465
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:30,671
was very interested in the sociology of
the 1930s and forties he read a lot in

466
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,574
that vein.

467
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,970
He was very interested in economics and
he wanted to understand how the social

468
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:42,461
structures of capitalism and the economic
structures of capitalism impinged upon

469
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,250
the way personalities were formed and
that's why he's interested in the emotions

470
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:53,381
of these waitresses and in fact the
question of emotion bears directly on his

471
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,290
sense of what books are for.

472
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,470
There's a remarkable moment on page 280
where he talks about his aspiration as a

473
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,054
writer,

474
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,010
and this is remarkable for how different
it is from someone like no back off or

475
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,250
John Barth or many of our
other writers on the syllabus.

476
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,810
If I could fasten the mind of the reader
upon words so firmly that he would

477
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,470
forget words and be conscious
only of his response,

478
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,580
I felt that I would be insight of
knowing how to write narrative.

479
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,770
I strove to master words
to make them disappear,

480
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,320
to make them important,
by making them new,

481
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:41,400
to make them melt into a rising spiral
of emotional stimuli each greater than

482
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:41,851
the other,

483
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:46,260
each feeding and reinforcing the other
and all ending an emotional climax that

484
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,020
would drench the reader
with a sense of a new world.

485
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,910
That was the single aim of my living.

486
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,660
That's remarkable for a writer to say,

487
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,930
I want to write so that
my words disappear.

488
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,580
Yeah.

489
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,240
He doesn't want us to see
the art of his sentences.

490
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,230
He wants us to feel and it is in fact
feeling that he credits two novels

491
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,060
that allows him to imagine that he
himself could have a different life and he

492
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:19,871
talks about this.

493
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:24,871
If you look at the published ending on
four 13 that we find in the notes when

494
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:27,070
this second half wasn't there,

495
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,420
when he asks,

496
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:38,870
how dare I consider my feeling superior
to the gross environment that sought to

497
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:39,704
claim me,

498
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,540
he states the problem of living in
the south as a problem of feeling

499
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,370
that he needed to claim and
consider his own feelings.

500
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,740
He says it had only been
through books at best,

501
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,860
no more than vicarious
cultural transfusions that
I had managed to keep myself

502
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,910
alive in a negatively vital way.

503
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,250
My belief in books had arisen more out
of a sense of desperation than from my

504
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:14,960
abiding conviction of their ultimate
value and I'm just going to skip down.

505
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:15,950
It had all,

506
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,300
it had been my accidental reading of
fiction and literary criticism that had

507
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,870
invoked in me vague glimpses
of life's possibilities.

508
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,260
Reading for him is a way
of accessing feeling.

509
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,310
And that's the kind of
reading that he wants from us,

510
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,650
from the people who read his book.

511
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,110
The kind of feeling that he wants us to
have is sort of stated in that alternate

512
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,284
ending.

513
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:55,410
But the horror and the glory shows how
that kind of feeling enters into a much

514
00:37:56,051 --> 00:38:00,100
larger cultural analysis.
That piece of it,

515
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,540
which is gone when the
second half disappears.

516
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,080
That piece of it is what he tries to
communicate in a very condensed way.

517
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,830
And I want now to show you some of
those letters that I mentioned. Andrew,

518
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:18,820
can you get this screen in the lights?
Um,

519
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,420
I'm switching gears pretty quickly here
because we don't have a lot of time.

520
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,830
As I explained last time,

521
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,000
it was the book of the month club that,
um,

522
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,410
that caused him to make
this change in his account.

523
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,630
And what I have in front of you right now
is the second page of the first letter

524
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:57,631
that Dorothy Canfield Fisher wrote to
right where she first raises the problem

525
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,640
that she sees in, uh, the ending
as he has revised it. Now,

526
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,110
the shame here is that she's talking
about a version of the ending.

527
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,870
You see in that note on
four 13 in our edition,

528
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,840
she's talking about an early draft of
that ending and it's not in the buying of

529
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,310
key. Um, I don't know where it is.

530
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,290
I don't know where the
drafts that accompanied these
correspondences are. Now.

531
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,950
It's just possible that there in that
big archives somewhere and I just haven't

532
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:31,750
found them yet. Um, so if any of you want
to be an archive sleuth and find them,

533
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:36,400
great. I looked and I can't find them.
Sometimes when correspondence is saved,

534
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,950
you run into these kinds of problems.
Um,

535
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,990
so we have to guess a little bit
at what she was looking at. Um,

536
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,490
what are, what, uh,

537
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,830
what I want to point out to you is this,
um,

538
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,120
this part of her letter, the
third paragraph here where
she says, my idea is this,

539
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,690
in the first part of the letter she has,
um,

540
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,410
she's made some sentence level suggestions
for the end of the book and now she

541
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:08,500
embarks very tentatively
on her major suggestion.

542
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,690
My idea is this.
You ask a question,

543
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:19,691
all of your many readers have asked
themselves about you with an eagerness,

544
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:20,840
full of anxious hope.

545
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,160
What was it that always
made me feel that way?

546
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,870
What was it that made me conscious of
possibilities from where had I caught a

547
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:32,300
sense of freedom? And if you've
read the ending in the notes,

548
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:35,900
you'll remember though those
passages where he asks that question,

549
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,340
and his answer in, in that published
version is, uh, is from books.

550
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,400
But this is what she's thinking.
We to ask ourselves that question,

551
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:50,360
we meaning those Americans who following
the example of their parents and

552
00:40:50,361 --> 00:40:54,830
grandparents have done what they could
to lighten this dark stain of racial

553
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,480
discrimination in our nation.

554
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,020
What we have hoped Finkley hoped was that
those efforts of men of goodwill have

555
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:07,130
somewhat availed a little enough so that
those suffering from racial injustice

556
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:12,131
might catch a passing glimpse of the fact
that they are rooted in those American

557
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:13,250
principles.

558
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,170
So mocked and degraded by the practices
of racial discrimination in what else

559
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:23,171
could they be rooted that they exist is
a proof that American ideals are not the

560
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,110
tawdry pretenses.
They are so often accused of being

561
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,360
a, and then I'm going to skip down
to the bottom of the next paragraph.

562
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:37,400
To keep conception in regard
to decent race relations,

563
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:42,401
alive and growing has been the aspiration
of generation after generation in many

564
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:43,640
in American family,

565
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:48,641
judging by my own and by those I know
to receive in the closing pages of your

566
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:52,280
book, one word of recognition
for this aspiration,

567
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,160
if it were possible for you
to give such recognition,

568
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:58,970
honestly would harden all who
believe in American ideals.

569
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,910
This is quite striking.

570
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,620
Imagine that you are Richard Wright and
you've grown up with the life that he

571
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,150
describes in this book.

572
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,180
Now you've read some of it and you're
being asked to suggest in the closing

573
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:16,910
pages of the novel of the autobiography,

574
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,160
which is closing where you did not want
it to close in the middle of your book,

575
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,360
not at the end of your book.

576
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,160
You're being asked to essentially think
the good liberal white people who have

577
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:35,270
been working on behalf of the
end of racial discrimination.

578
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,950
Yeah,

579
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,300
well, right. Finds this
an extremely difficult,

580
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,980
uh, request to respond
to. And you can track it

581
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,520
here in his response.

582
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,620
I'm going to read from here
so I can actually see it.

583
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,290
You more general. He says, okay, I'll
respond to those sentence level things.

584
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,220
You're more general suggestion
was much harder to deal with.

585
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,700
I fully understand the value
of what you're driving at,

586
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:17,380
but frankly the narrative as it now
stands simply will not support a more

587
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,120
general or hopeful conclusion.

588
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:22,870
The Negro who flees the
south is really a refugee.

589
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,040
He is so pinched and straightened in his
environment that is leaving is more and

590
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:29,950
avoidance than an embrace.
For me.

591
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:34,630
It has been my reading of fiction far
removed from political considerations that

592
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:39,130
evoked in me a sense of personal freedom
or the possibilities of escaping the

593
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:39,964
south.

594
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,500
I added a paragraph to the body of the
epilogue expanding this notion and I take

595
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:47,260
that to be the paragraph where he,
uh,

596
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,770
he talks about what fiction
has done for him specifically.

597
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:52,790
Yeah.

598
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,070
Canfield Fisher is not
satisfied with this.

599
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,500
She
comes back at the problem.

600
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,330
This is at the bottom of the letter.

601
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,560
I gather that you cannot bring yourself
to use even once the word American in

602
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:23,730
speaking of the tinge of warmth,
which came from an unseen light,

603
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,190
such a beautiful,
sensitive phrase.

604
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Some of the novels and you read were it
is pop probable laid in your own country

605
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:35,760
of America.

606
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,390
Hence some of the characters in books
through whom you had glimpsed life's

607
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,300
possibilities.
We're fellow Americans of yours.

608
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,340
These unseen lights which shown
through them upon your faith, uh,

609
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,300
upon your faith were reflections of
American efforts to live up to an idea.

610
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,470
Those characters could have been no other
than products of American tradition.

611
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,161
However,

612
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:01,161
dimly that light came through to you
suffering so acutely from the rough denial

613
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,690
of the very existence of American ideal,

614
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,200
part of it must've come through American
delineation of American characters.

615
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,390
Now keep in mind, this is 1944.
This is the summer of 1944.

616
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,700
America is just joining
the war effort in Europe.

617
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,850
This is a fight against fascism.

618
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,350
That's the way that it was presented
to the American public, uh,

619
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,120
fight against Nazi Germany.

620
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,970
And in later letters in this
series between her and Richard. Um,

621
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,010
and also in the review,
the little sort of, um,

622
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,250
summary that she wrote up for the
book of the month club newsletter,

623
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,550
she invokes the Nazis specifically as
a comparison to the kind of oppression

624
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,650
that Richard was trying
to escape in the south.

625
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,160
So this is caught up in a moment of
patriotism where American freedom is being

626
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:58,140
held up very much as the ideal.

627
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,770
That thing that we fight for
when we go to Europe to fight.

628
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,760
And so to have Richard present this
picture of America that doesn't ring the

629
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:18,231
changes of that patriotism comes
to be a problem in her mind.

630
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,530
Now,
when black boy was published,

631
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:26,700
there was a war bond advertisement
on the back cover of the book.

632
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,730
It really was just even as a physical
object all bound up with the politics of

633
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:36,210
its moment.
Richard's response to this,

634
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,740
we just have two seconds. I
want to show it to you. It's um,

635
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,830
I love these, these pieces. Um,

636
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,480
because you can just see
him struggling on the page.

637
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,253
Sorry.

638
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,520
This is his first attempt at writing
back to her. See all the scribbles.

639
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,470
This was hard for him. There are two
other drafts. If you go and look at them,

640
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,700
it's quite interesting.

641
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,560
He's trying extremely
hard to make an answer.

642
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,300
And what he ends up doing is bringing
that knowledge that he built up in

643
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,134
Chicago.

644
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:22,280
The knowledge that he gets from reading
economics and sociology and Marxism.

645
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,580
He gives an analysis of
industrial capitalism.

646
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,730
That's the kind of framework he uses to
try get her to understand what it would

647
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:35,020
mean to be a negro in the south.

648
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,150
How isolated he was culturally,

649
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,840
how impossible it is to see something
like an ideal America of freedom and

650
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:51,910
justice from that subject position.
In the end,

651
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,600
the compromises that he notes.
Um,

652
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:59,980
several writers including
Dreiser and Sherwood Anderson,

653
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,730
and I just want to have you compare the
catalog of writers on four 13 that he

654
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,750
mentions there.
Dreiser Edgar Lee Masters,

655
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,580
HL Mencken Anderson and Lewis.

656
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:17,440
All American writers compare that with
the catalog that he gives of his reading

657
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,950
on to 49 and you'll see
what's being alive. Right.

658
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,653
Okay.

659
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,940
This is the top of two 49.
Um,

660
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,800
so certainly we have Sinclair
Lewis Sherwood Anderson,

661
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:39,270
but then we have Dostoyevsky George
more Gusta flow bear Maupassant Tolstoy,

662
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,590
Frank Harris, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy,
Arnold Bennett, Stephen Crane's doe law,

663
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,910
Norris Gorky,
Bergson Ibsen Belzec.

664
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,990
You get the point.

665
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,100
This is a very cosmopolitan reading list.

666
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,390
What Canfield Fisher asks him to
present is a totally nationalistic one.

667
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,700
My point in some,

668
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:04,701
what I want you to take away from this
is to see how an account of a life is

669
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:11,511
struggling against
forces outside of itself.

670
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:15,270
Publishing forces the forces of politics,
of war,

671
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:17,400
of an editor,

672
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:24,470
how a writer is struggling to make his
account faithful to his own artistic

673
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:27,690
vision,
his own social vision.

674
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,330
Against those forces and how
those forces have an impact.

675
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:38,430
Tries. He might have an impact on what
the text looks like when we hold it in our

676
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:42,740
hands.
Black boy,

677
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:43,521
we're American.

678
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:48,521
Hunger is a dramatic example and
thanks to the buying of key and to the

679
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:53,570
scholarship that's been done on it by the
editor who brought this whole text out

680
00:49:53,571 --> 00:49:57,560
in the 1990s.
Arnold Rampersad thanks to that work.

681
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:01,550
We get to see it up close. We get to
see what that back and forth looks like.

682
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,520
We'll have another version of this one.
We think about Lolita,

683
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,990
which in your edition has a,
uh,

684
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,830
an essay at the end called
on and novel entitled Lolita.

685
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,520
That's only there because someone
tried to censor that book.

686
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,280
It's another example of how the world
comes to impinge on and change our reading

687
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:23,180
experience.

688
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,380
It's something that we will come
back to and explore more in the,

689
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,610
in the next class.
