00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.850
So we've now made some changes
to our envision prototype.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
We've add in the check boxes and
we've changed our home screen.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.160
Now in order to do user research
with it we've put it on a phone and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.000
we'll bring in users to test with it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.870
Johnathan, how do we go about
putting it onto this phone?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.220
&gt;&gt; It's simple Jay, all you need to do
is click on the Sharelink button, and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890
click SMS.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.150
When you click the share link button,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.640
you'll have an option to choose how
you want to share your project.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.520
Simply click the SMS button, and turn
the phone number that you'd like to send

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.870
a text to, and it'll automatically
send the text directly to your phone.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.780
When you open up the text,
it'll have a link

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.540
that'll allow you to download
the prototype directly onto your phone.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.600
&gt;&gt; And now we're going to bring in
Jeremy to start testing our app.
