00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.703
Now that we have gone over these
different types of ideas, I'd like you

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:07.340
to hear about a company and decide which
of these ideas apply to that company.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.675
The first company is called Shyp.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.811
Shyp is a company that allows
users to send mail and

00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.910
packages to anyone in the world.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.153
Users can choose an item,
take a picture of it on their phone, and

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:22.179
then set a destination and
schedule a pickup.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.553
Shyp takes care of the rest by picking
up the item and finding the lowest cost,

00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:30.300
and most reliable way to send
the package, pretty seamless.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.420
So which type of ideas do you
think apply to the company Shyp?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.540
Check all of these idea types that
you think apply to the company.
