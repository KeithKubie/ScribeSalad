00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.736
Okay. Meanwhile,
back here on Earth,

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.605
the New York presidential
primary is next week,

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.673
renewing the debate
over some harsh criticism

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.842
of New York
coming from the right.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.778
You suggested Mr. Trump

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.181
"embodies New York values."

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.017
Could you explain
what you mean by that?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.619
You know, I think
most people know

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.455
exactly what
New York values are.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:24.657
(fake chuckle)

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.928
I think most people know exactly
how slimy and creepy you are.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.596
(cheering and applause)

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.932
(whimpering)
You know what?

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.868
I'll tell you what. I'll tell
you about New York values.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.203
No, wait, guys, it's not fair.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.205
I've only lived here,
like, a year and a half.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.007
You know what,
here's a native New Yorker

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.042
to talk
about real New York values.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:45.545
♪ Welcome to my c-city... ♪

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.514
(cheering and applause)

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:56.556
Thank you!

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:58.591
Thank you!

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.560
(cheering and applause)

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.564
(crowd chanting "Bernie!")

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.735
Thank you!

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.737
And thank you, Larry.
That's right.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.074
It's me,
Bernie Brooklyn-born Sanders.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.410
And guess what, Ted Cruz,

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.679
I have New York values.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.648
(cheering and applause)

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.920
I value a living wage
for all Americans.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:32.125
I value a justice system
that treats everyone fairly.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.862
I value a government
which works for all of us,

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:39.866
not just Wall Street
and powerful special interests.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.068
Those are New York values.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.037
(cheering and applause)

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.042
Right?

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:51.777
And you know what New York is?

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.912
It's a place built

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.848
by the backbreaking work
of immigrants.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.185
Immigrants like your family,
Ted Cruz.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:03.856
And when you say having
New York values is a bad thing,

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.859
you insult my city, my state,

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:09.195
my culture, and my heritage.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.330
I am the son of an immigrant,

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:12.999
and I am proud of it.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.034
(cheering and applause)

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:23.643
You started... you started
this New York values nonsense

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.578
as an attack on Trump,

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.581
and I've got some New York
values for him, too.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.850
(laughter)

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.320
Mr. Trump, you wouldn't know
New York values

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:37.790
if they were written
in 50-foot gold letters

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.393
on the side
of the Empire State Building.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.362
(cheering and applause)

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.802
New York values are
the Statue of Liberty,

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.738
not a wall between us
and Mexico.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.676
In New York, we pride ourselves
on our diversity.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.280
We don't divide people up
based on where they were born.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.217
I was born and raised
in Brooklyn.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.153
BK, stand up! Fight back!

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.755
Don't let anyone tear us down!

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.724
(cheering and applause)

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:21.367
I will never lose the values

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.237
that New York and my family
have given me.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.572
As New Yorkers, we understand

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.975
what New York values
really mean.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.644
We believe in the value
of hard work.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:34.247
We believe in the value
of equality.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.582
We believe in the value
of a society

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.185
where the American dream
works for all,

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.387
not just the one percent.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.389
Those are New York values.

00:03:43.422 --> 00:03:47.727
And the truth is New York values
are American values.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.729
There is no difference.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.064
(cheering and applause)

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:54.734
Oh! Oh!

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.069
Oh, man! Oh!

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.205
Bernie Sanders, everybody!

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.007
We'll be right back
with more Bernie!

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.808
Oh, Bernie, you dropped the mic!

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.777
Oh, my God!
