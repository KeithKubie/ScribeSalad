00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
hardware and you have platform
 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.300
hardware and you have platform
configuration which is mostly details

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310
configuration which is mostly details
 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.880

configuration in the same time you have
 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.010
configuration in the same time you have
the hardware abstraction layer and we

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020
the hardware abstraction layer and we
 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.400
the hardware abstraction layer and we
are trying to provide compatibility with

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410
are trying to provide compatibility with
 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.040
are trying to provide compatibility with
existing Google one where is not

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050
existing Google one where is not
 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.360
existing Google one where is not
possible we are open sourcing the whole

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370
possible we are open sourcing the whole
 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.580
possible we are open sourcing the whole
and our goal is to use as few binaries

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590
and our goal is to use as few binaries
 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.520
and our goal is to use as few binaries
as possible because having binaries can

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530
as possible because having binaries can
 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.850
as possible because having binaries can
limit your innovation so even if you get

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860
limit your innovation so even if you get
 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.810
limit your innovation so even if you get
a hole with less functionality you can

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820
a hole with less functionality you can
 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.810
a hole with less functionality you can
still innovate since you have the code

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820
still innovate since you have the code
 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.960
still innovate since you have the code
but if you get only binaries let's say

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970
but if you get only binaries let's say
 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.659
but if you get only binaries let's say
you cannot do anything and then as I

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669
you cannot do anything and then as I
 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.380
you cannot do anything and then as I
have

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390
have
 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.250
have
promised a long time ago we have looked

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260
promised a long time ago we have looked
 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.700
promised a long time ago we have looked
into one of the most desired parts of

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710
into one of the most desired parts of
 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.790
into one of the most desired parts of
the open source and that is the open

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800
the open source and that is the open
 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.280
the open source and that is the open
source camera solution we are still

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290
source camera solution we are still
 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.150
source camera solution we are still
working on it but as you can see in in

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160
working on it but as you can see in in
 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.100
working on it but as you can see in in
my slide it supports all the platforms

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110
my slide it supports all the platforms
 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.850
my slide it supports all the platforms
in one code it also rewrite everything

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
in one code it also rewrite everything
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.600
in one code it also rewrite everything
clean so that you can reuse it and

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610
clean so that you can reuse it and
 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.170
clean so that you can reuse it and
innovate on it and we will release the

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180
innovate on it and we will release the
 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.270
innovate on it and we will release the
camera binaries which implement our

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280
camera binaries which implement our
 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.890
camera binaries which implement our
sensors I don't have a specific time

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900

frame for it but soon it's all I can say

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.040
frame for it but soon it's all I can say
 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.180
frame for it but soon it's all I can say
in this moment you will have a complete

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190
in this moment you will have a complete
 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.880
in this moment you will have a complete
hardware platform with a complete

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:31.890
hardware platform with a complete
 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.220
hardware platform with a complete
software stack so that you can start

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230
software stack so that you can start
 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.450
software stack so that you can start
innovating on it since we want it to be

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460
innovating on it since we want it to be
 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.880
innovating on it since we want it to be
as transparent as possible this is the

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:40.890
as transparent as possible this is the
 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.760
as transparent as possible this is the
current status and probably this is how

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770
current status and probably this is how
 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.340
current status and probably this is how
it will look on the initial launch

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350
it will look on the initial launch
 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.460
it will look on the initial launch
please note that the camera is developer

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470
please note that the camera is developer
 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.920
please note that the camera is developer
grade it is not matching the sony store

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.930

camera quality and also it has issues

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:57.930
camera quality and also it has issues
 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.130
camera quality and also it has issues
with stability the whole reason for

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.140
with stability the whole reason for
 

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.580
with stability the whole reason for
releasing this camera early is so that

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:04.590
releasing this camera early is so that
 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.030
releasing this camera early is so that
community can start innovating and so

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.040
community can start innovating and so
 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.730
community can start innovating and so
that you can adjust your custom rom

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740
that you can adjust your custom rom
 

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.120
that you can adjust your custom rom
trees to our new solution I know that in

the past a lot of you have hacked the

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:16.230
the past a lot of you have hacked the
 

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.530
the past a lot of you have hacked the
camera with worse results or let's say

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.540
camera with worse results or let's say
 

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.520

fisheye bug and a lot of other problems
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.730
fisheye bug and a lot of other problems
with this camera solution you have the

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740
with this camera solution you have the
 

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.330
with this camera solution you have the
code or most of it and that means that

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:32.340
code or most of it and that means that
 

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.870

how it works and then you have the

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:46.770
how it works and then you have the
 

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.120

after the release you had the guide you

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:12.840
after the release you had the guide you
 

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.260
after the release you had the guide you
had the new binaries so that you can

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.270
had the new binaries so that you can
 

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.590

another custom room maybe you want to

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:45.750
another custom room maybe you want to
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.770

experiment with different operating
 

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.030
experiment with different operating
systems and then you can start looking

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040
systems and then you can start looking
 

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.490
