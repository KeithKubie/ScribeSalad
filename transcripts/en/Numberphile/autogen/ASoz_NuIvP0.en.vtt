00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 align:start position:0%
discovered in 1999 at Andrews I
understand<00:00:38.340><c> there</c><00:00:38.550><c> are</c><00:00:38.640><c> some</c><00:00:38.879><c> numbers</c><00:00:39.090><c> that</c>

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
understand there are some numbers that
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
understand there are some numbers that
you<00:00:40.170><c> will</c><00:00:40.290><c> never</c><00:00:40.530><c> find</c><00:00:40.770><c> one</c><00:00:41.070><c> for</c><00:00:41.280><c> that's</c><00:00:41.790><c> right</c>

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
you will never find one for that's right
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
you will never find one for that's right
so<00:00:42.210><c> if</c><00:00:42.780><c> your</c><00:00:43.230><c> number</c><00:00:43.559><c> if</c><00:00:43.710><c> you</c><00:00:43.800><c> divide</c><00:00:44.040><c> it</c><00:00:44.160><c> by</c><00:00:44.280><c> 9</c>

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 align:start position:0%
so if your number if you divide it by 9
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940 align:start position:0%
so if your number if you divide it by 9
and<00:00:44.789><c> you</c><00:00:45.120><c> get</c><00:00:45.239><c> a</c><00:00:45.270><c> remainder</c><00:00:45.600><c> of</c><00:00:45.809><c> 4</c><00:00:46.140><c> or</c><00:00:46.350><c> 5</c><00:00:46.410><c> then</c>

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
and you get a remainder of 4 or 5 then
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
and you get a remainder of 4 or 5 then
we<00:00:47.070><c> know</c><00:00:47.190><c> you</c><00:00:47.250><c> can't</c><00:00:47.550><c> do</c><00:00:47.670><c> it</c><00:00:47.789><c> so</c><00:00:47.940><c> you</c><00:00:48.210><c> made</c><00:00:48.450><c> a</c>

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
we know you can't do it so you made a
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start position:0%
we know you can't do it so you made a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
by three okay and if we take this a step
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 align:start position:0%
by three okay and if we take this a step
further<00:01:43.619><c> and</c><00:01:44.040><c> divide</c><00:01:44.490><c> them</c><00:01:44.610><c> by</c><00:01:44.759><c> nine</c><00:01:45.000><c> actually</c>

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
further and divide them by nine actually
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
further and divide them by nine actually
this<00:01:45.659><c> is</c><00:01:45.780><c> a</c><00:01:45.810><c> good</c><00:01:45.930><c> plug</c><00:01:46.200><c> for</c><00:01:46.560><c> you're</c><00:01:46.829><c> casting</c>

this is a good plug for you're casting
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.030 align:start position:0%
this is a good plug for you're casting
out<00:01:47.340><c> nines</c><00:01:47.450><c> video</c><00:01:48.450><c> okay</c><00:01:49.049><c> so</c><00:01:49.110><c> this</c><00:01:49.500><c> one</c><00:01:49.740><c> has</c>

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
out nines video okay so this one has
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.710 align:start position:0%
out nines video okay so this one has
remainder<00:01:50.490><c> six</c><00:01:50.759><c> when</c><00:01:51.000><c> you</c><00:01:51.090><c> divide</c><00:01:51.270><c> it</c><00:01:51.390><c> by</c><00:01:51.420><c> nine</c>

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
remainder six when you divide it by nine
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.700 align:start position:0%
remainder six when you divide it by nine
this<00:01:52.710><c> is</c><00:01:52.829><c> another</c><00:01:53.040><c> six</c><00:01:53.540><c> another</c><00:01:54.540><c> six</c><00:01:54.869><c> starting</c>

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 align:start position:0%
this is another six another six starting
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
this is another six another six starting
to<00:01:55.770><c> see</c><00:01:55.920><c> a</c><00:01:55.950><c> pattern</c><00:01:56.130><c> here</c>

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
to see a pattern here
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.010 align:start position:0%
to see a pattern here
it<00:01:57.210><c> breaks</c><00:01:57.360><c> with</c><00:01:57.600><c> this</c><00:01:57.719><c> one</c><00:01:57.869><c> this</c><00:01:57.960><c> is</c>

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
it breaks with this one this is
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.219 align:start position:0%
it breaks with this one this is
remainder<00:01:58.500><c> three</c><00:01:58.850><c> okay</c><00:01:59.850><c> this</c><00:02:00.750><c> is</c><00:02:00.869><c> remainder</c>

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 align:start position:0%
remainder three okay this is remainder
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
remainder three okay this is remainder
three<00:02:01.500><c> this</c><00:02:02.490><c> is</c><00:02:02.640><c> remainder</c><00:02:03.030><c> three</c><00:02:03.329><c> and</c><00:02:04.110><c> so</c><00:02:04.259><c> on</c>

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 align:start position:0%
three this is remainder three and so on
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.569 align:start position:0%
three this is remainder three and so on
and<00:02:04.469><c> so</c><00:02:04.560><c> forth</c><00:02:04.770><c> so</c><00:02:04.860><c> it</c><00:02:04.920><c> turns</c><00:02:05.100><c> out</c><00:02:05.219><c> they</c><00:02:05.399><c> all</c>

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
and so forth so it turns out they all
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.059 align:start position:0%
and so forth so it turns out they all
have<00:02:05.909><c> remainder</c><00:02:06.450><c> three</c><00:02:06.810><c> or</c><00:02:07.140><c> six</c><00:02:07.590><c> when</c><00:02:08.039><c> you</c>

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 align:start position:0%
have remainder three or six when you
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.529 align:start position:0%
have remainder three or six when you

pretty short list at this point so I
 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.710 align:start position:0%
pretty short list at this point so I
started<00:04:54.790><c> to</c><00:04:54.910><c> think</c><00:04:55.120><c> well</c><00:04:55.240><c> maybe</c><00:04:55.420><c> there</c><00:04:55.630><c> are</c>

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
started to think well maybe there are
 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.970 align:start position:0%
started to think well maybe there are

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 align:start position:0%
other approaches that we could look at
 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
other approaches that we could look at

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 align:start position:0%
my approach uses more algebra so what
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.170 align:start position:0%
my approach uses more algebra so what
I'll<00:04:59.680><c> do</c><00:04:59.830><c> is</c><00:04:59.860><c> I'll</c><00:05:00.250><c> take</c><00:05:00.370><c> this</c><00:05:00.520><c> equation</c><00:05:00.670><c> and</c>

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll take this equation and
 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.730 align:start position:0%
I'll do is I'll take this equation and
then<00:05:01.360><c> we'll</c><00:05:01.510><c> move</c><00:05:01.690><c> the</c><00:05:01.900><c> Z</c><00:05:02.050><c> cubed</c><00:05:02.410><c> over</c><00:05:02.560><c> to</c><00:05:02.650><c> the</c>

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 align:start position:0%
then we'll move the Z cubed over to the
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.950 align:start position:0%
then we'll move the Z cubed over to the
other<00:05:02.890><c> side</c><00:05:03.130><c> okay</c><00:05:03.580><c> so</c><00:05:03.790><c> that</c><00:05:04.030><c> gives</c><00:05:04.060><c> us</c><00:05:04.390><c> X</c><00:05:04.570><c> cubed</c>

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
other side okay so that gives us X cubed
 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.550 align:start position:0%

plus<00:05:05.440><c> y</c><00:05:05.650><c> cubed</c><00:05:06.040><c> equals</c><00:05:06.640><c> 33</c><00:05:07.270><c> minus</c><00:05:08.050><c> Z</c><00:05:08.230><c> cubed</c>

plus y cubed equals 33 minus Z cubed
 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
plus y cubed equals 33 minus Z cubed
this<00:05:08.980><c> is</c><00:05:09.220><c> now</c><00:05:09.430><c> X</c><00:05:10.240><c> plus</c><00:05:10.570><c> y</c><00:05:10.780><c> x</c><00:05:11.260><c> squared</c><00:05:11.650><c> minus</c><00:05:12.400><c> XY</c>

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 align:start position:0%
this is now X plus y x squared minus XY
 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is now X plus y x squared minus XY
plus<00:05:13.300><c> y</c><00:05:13.390><c> squared</c><00:05:13.870><c> equals</c><00:05:14.530><c> 33</c><00:05:15.430><c> minus</c><00:05:16.300><c> Z</c><00:05:16.450><c> cubed</c>

okay<00:05:17.260><c> now</c><00:05:17.590><c> why</c><00:05:17.740><c> have</c><00:05:17.860><c> I</c><00:05:17.950><c> done</c><00:05:18.130><c> that</c><00:05:18.280><c> well</c><00:05:18.430><c> we</c>

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 align:start position:0%
okay now why have I done that well we

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 align:start position:0%
now one more step and I promise we're
 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.490 align:start position:0%
now one more step and I promise we're

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
divide both sides by D okay so I'm gonna
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
divide both sides by D okay so I'm gonna

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
you've got two variables to solve for
 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
you've got two variables to solve for
you<00:06:06.040><c> need</c><00:06:06.190><c> two</c><00:06:06.370><c> equations</c><00:06:06.910><c> I've</c><00:06:07.540><c> got</c><00:06:07.750><c> one</c><00:06:07.990><c> here</c>

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 align:start position:0%
you need two equations I've got one here
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
you need two equations I've got one here
but<00:06:08.770><c> there's</c><00:06:08.950><c> another</c><00:06:09.220><c> one</c><00:06:09.460><c> that</c><00:06:09.490><c> I</c><00:06:09.700><c> used</c>

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
but there's another one that I used
 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.370 align:start position:0%
but there's another one that I used
implicit<00:06:10.270><c> leave</c><00:06:10.510><c> it</c><00:06:10.630><c> didn't</c><00:06:10.780><c> write</c><00:06:10.900><c> down</c><00:06:10.930><c> and</c>

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 align:start position:0%
implicit leave it didn't write down and
 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.070 align:start position:0%
implicit leave it didn't write down and
that's<00:06:11.560><c> this</c><00:06:11.710><c> one</c><00:06:11.950><c> so</c><00:06:12.460><c> X</c><00:06:12.790><c> plus</c><00:06:12.940><c> y</c><00:06:13.270><c> is</c><00:06:13.750><c> equal</c><00:06:14.050><c> to</c>

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's this one so X plus y is equal to
 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.570 align:start position:0%
that's this one so X plus y is equal to
D<00:06:14.410><c> all</c><00:06:14.860><c> right</c><00:06:14.920><c> so</c><00:06:15.130><c> now</c><00:06:15.220><c> I've</c><00:06:15.310><c> got</c><00:06:15.460><c> two</c>

and there aren't many of those so once
 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.980 align:start position:0%
and there aren't many of those so once
you've<00:06:50.700><c> worked</c><00:06:51.030><c> out</c><00:06:51.240><c> Z</c><00:06:51.450><c> you</c><00:06:51.570><c> can</c><00:06:51.690><c> work</c><00:06:51.810><c> out</c><00:06:51.960><c> all</c>

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 align:start position:0%
you've worked out Z you can work out all
 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.230 align:start position:0%
you've worked out Z you can work out all
the<00:06:52.440><c> possible</c><00:06:52.800><c> values</c><00:06:52.860><c> for</c><00:06:53.130><c> D</c><00:06:53.430><c> pretty</c><00:06:54.120><c> easily</c>

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
the possible values for D pretty easily
 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
the possible values for D pretty easily
and<00:06:54.480><c> then</c><00:06:54.600><c> just</c><00:06:54.810><c> try</c><00:06:54.930><c> all</c><00:06:54.960><c> of</c><00:06:55.110><c> them</c><00:06:55.350><c> I've</c>

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 align:start position:0%
and then just try all of them I've
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.380 align:start position:0%
and then just try all of them I've
glossed<00:06:55.920><c> over</c><00:06:56.100><c> a</c><00:06:56.250><c> few</c><00:06:56.430><c> things</c><00:06:56.640><c> here</c><00:06:56.910><c> so</c><00:06:56.940><c> in</c>

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 align:start position:0%
glossed over a few things here so in
 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
glossed over a few things here so in
actual<00:06:57.750><c> practice</c><00:06:58.110><c> you</c><00:06:58.440><c> do</c><00:06:58.560><c> it</c><00:06:58.650><c> the</c><00:06:58.710><c> other</c><00:06:58.740><c> way</c>

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 align:start position:0%
actual practice you do it the other way
 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.500 align:start position:0%
actual practice you do it the other way
around<00:06:58.980><c> you</c><00:06:59.370><c> you</c><00:06:59.730><c> go</c><00:06:59.820><c> through</c><00:06:59.850><c> values</c><00:07:00.240><c> of</c><00:07:00.360><c> D</c>

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 align:start position:0%
around you you go through values of D
 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
around you you go through values of D
and<00:07:00.690><c> then</c><00:07:00.780><c> you</c><00:07:00.870><c> work</c><00:07:01.020><c> out</c><00:07:01.200><c> Z</c><00:07:01.410><c> from</c><00:07:02.130><c> there</c><00:07:02.340><c> but</c>

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 align:start position:0%
and then you work out Z from there but
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.980 align:start position:0%
and then you work out Z from there but
yeah<00:07:03.690><c> this</c><00:07:03.870><c> is</c><00:07:04.110><c> the</c><00:07:04.200><c> idea</c><00:07:04.470><c> in</c><00:07:04.530><c> a</c><00:07:04.620><c> nutshell</c><00:07:08.960><c> so</c><00:07:09.960><c> I</c>

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the idea in a nutshell so I
 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.300 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the idea in a nutshell so I
use<00:07:10.200><c> lots</c><00:07:10.320><c> of</c><00:07:10.470><c> computers</c><00:07:10.860><c> actually</c><00:07:11.010><c> there</c><00:07:11.250><c> are</c>

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 align:start position:0%
use lots of computers actually there are
 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
use lots of computers actually there are
a<00:07:11.340><c> few</c><00:07:11.730><c> separate</c><00:07:12.060><c> clusters</c><00:07:12.390><c> and</c><00:07:12.980><c> the</c><00:07:13.980><c> the</c>

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 align:start position:0%
a few separate clusters and the the
 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
a few separate clusters and the the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 align:start position:0%
computation that found the solution was
 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.110 align:start position:0%
computation that found the solution was

Bristol blue crystal phase 3 this
 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.410 align:start position:0%
Bristol blue crystal phase 3 this
happened<00:07:20.490><c> way</c><00:07:20.610><c> faster</c><00:07:21.030><c> than</c><00:07:21.090><c> I</c><00:07:21.210><c> was</c><00:07:21.300><c> expecting</c>

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
happened way faster than I was expecting
 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.530 align:start position:0%
happened way faster than I was expecting
so<00:07:21.990><c> I</c><00:07:22.190><c> started</c><00:07:23.190><c> this</c><00:07:23.310><c> I</c><00:07:23.460><c> thought</c><00:07:24.150><c> I</c><00:07:24.180><c> was</c><00:07:24.360><c> in</c><00:07:24.510><c> for</c>

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 align:start position:0%

man you know 6 months of computation my

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350 align:start position:0%

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.330 align:start position:0%
solve this by just computing more okay
 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.390 align:start position:0%
solve this by just computing more okay
cuz<00:09:01.510><c> there's</c><00:09:01.660><c> always</c><00:09:01.810><c> another</c><00:09:02.140><c> number</c><00:09:02.380><c> for</c><00:09:02.980><c> us</c>

that's<00:09:09.790><c> right</c>

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's right
 

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.010 align:start position:0%
that's right
and<00:09:11.320><c> so</c><00:09:12.250><c> if</c><00:09:12.370><c> we</c><00:09:12.490><c> just</c><00:09:12.670><c> look</c><00:09:12.730><c> at</c><00:09:12.940><c> the</c><00:09:13.060><c> numbers</c><00:09:13.360><c> up</c>

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.020 align:start position:0%
and so if we just look at the numbers up
 

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
and so if we just look at the numbers up
to<00:09:14.200><c> a</c><00:09:14.230><c> hundred</c><00:09:14.470><c> so</c><00:09:14.740><c> let</c><00:09:14.890><c> me</c><00:09:14.980><c> say</c><00:09:15.160><c> K</c><00:09:15.460><c> less</c><00:09:15.970><c> than</c>

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
to a hundred so let me say K less than
 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.050 align:start position:0%
to a hundred so let me say K less than
or<00:09:16.210><c> equal</c><00:09:16.420><c> to</c><00:09:16.510><c> 100</c><00:09:16.990><c> there's</c><00:09:17.560><c> 22</c><00:09:18.070><c> numbers</c><00:09:18.910><c> in</c>

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.060 align:start position:0%

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.150 align:start position:0%

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
that range that give a remainder of four
 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.190 align:start position:0%
that range that give a remainder of four
or<00:09:21.340><c> five</c><00:09:21.550><c> when</c><00:09:22.090><c> you</c><00:09:22.150><c> divide</c><00:09:22.450><c> by</c><00:09:22.480><c> nine</c><00:09:22.810><c> so</c>

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
or five when you divide by nine so
 

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
or five when you divide by nine so
they're<00:09:23.380><c> possible</c><00:09:23.800><c> so</c><00:09:23.980><c> they're</c><00:09:24.160><c> not</c><00:09:24.310><c> possible</c>

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:24.730 align:start position:0%
they're possible so they're not possible
 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.210 align:start position:0%
they're possible so they're not possible
that's<00:09:24.880><c> right</c><00:09:25.120><c> we</c><00:09:26.110><c> know</c><00:09:26.290><c> the</c><00:09:26.770><c> answer</c><00:09:27.010><c> for</c>

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:28.660 align:start position:0%
maybe we shouldn't stop there that's

problem is actually undecidable so it
 

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:02.379 align:start position:0%
problem is actually undecidable so it

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
