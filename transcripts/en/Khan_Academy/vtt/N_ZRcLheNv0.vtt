00:00:00.575 --> 00:00:01.507
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:04.107
So here I'm gonna talk about
the directional derivative

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:05.474
and that's a way to extend the idea

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:07.174
of a partial derivative.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.240
And partial derivatives, if you remember,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.374
have to do with functions

00:00:10.374 --> 00:00:12.375
with some kind of multi-variable input,

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:13.632
and I'll just use two inputs

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:15.112
because that's the easiest to think about,

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:18.341
and it could be some
single variable output.

00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:20.141
It could also deal with
vector variable outputs.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.311
We haven't gotten to that yet.

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:23.044
So, we'll just think
about a single variable,

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:25.074
ordinary real number output that's,

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.307
you know, an expression of x and y,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:28.875
and the partial derivative.

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.700
One of the ways I said
you could think about it

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.174
is to take a look at the input space,

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:34.308
your x and y-plane.

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:35.475
So, this would be the x-axis,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:36.641
This is y.

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.141
And you know, vaguely, in your mind,

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.874
you're thinking that somehow
this outputs to a line.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.141
This outputs to just the real numbers.

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:44.707
And maybe you're thinking
about a transformation

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:46.474
that takes it there, or maybe you're just

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:48.141
thinking, "Okay, this is the input space.

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:49.541
"That's the output."

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:50.908
And when you take the partial derivative,

00:00:50.908 --> 00:00:52.441
at some kind of point...

00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:53.841
So, I'll write it out like

00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:56.874
partial derivative of f with respect to x

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:59.063
at a point like one, two.

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.274
You think about that point.

00:01:01.274 --> 00:01:04.508
You know one, y is equal to two.

00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:06.174
And if you're taking with respect to x,

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:07.713
you think about just
nudging it a little bit

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.471
in that x-direction, and you see

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.216
what the resulting nudge
is in the output space.

00:01:12.216 --> 00:01:13.441
And the ratio between the size

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:15.374
of that resulting nudge, the original one,

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:17.041
the ratio between, you know, partial-f

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:19.774
and partial-x is the value that you want.

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:21.408
And when you did it with respect to y,

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:23.576
you know you were thinking about traveling

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.608
in a different direction,
maybe you nudge it straight up.

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:27.707
And you're wondering, "Okay, how does

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.274
"that influence the output?"

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:31.874
And the question here, with
directional derivatives,

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:34.273
what if you have some vector, v,

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:37.341
I'll give a little
vector hat on top of it,

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.675
that, you know, I don't
know, let's say it's

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:43.881
negative one, two, is the vector.

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:46.076
So you'd be thinking about that as a step

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.775
of negative one in the x-direction,

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:49.740
and then two more in the y-direction.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.408
So, it's gonna be something
that ends up there.

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:54.674
This is your vector, v.

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:56.208
At least, if you're
thinking of v as stemming

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:57.575
from the original point.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:58.941
And you're wondering, "What does a nudge

00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.341
"in that direction do
to the function itself?"

00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.541
And remember, with these
original, you know, nudges

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.208
in the x-direction, nudges in the y,

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.608
you're not really thinking of it as,

00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:07.941
"You know, this is kind of a large step."

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.207
You're really thinking
of it as something as

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:10.607
itty-itty-bitty-bitty.

00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:11.940
You know it's not that,
but it's really something

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.875
very, very small, and
formally you'd be thinking

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.208
about the limit as this gets
really, really. really small

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:17.374
approaching zero.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:19.408
And this gets really, really
small approaching zero,

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:21.308
what does the ration of the two approach?

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.208
And similarly with the
y, you're not thinking

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.478
of it as something,
"This is pretty sizable,"

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.541
but it would be something
really, really small.

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:29.041
And the directional derivative is similar.

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.674
You're not thinking of the actual vector

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:32.495
actually taking a step along that,

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.774
but you'd be thinking
of taking a step along,

00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:38.931
say, h multiplied by that vector,

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.441
and h might represent some
really, really small numbers.

00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:46.155
You know, maybe this here is like 0.001.

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:47.441
And when you're doing this formula,

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:50.171
you'd just be thinking the
limit as h goes to zero.

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:51.808
So, the directional derivative is saying

00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:54.241
when you take a slight
nudge in the direction

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.907
of that vector, what is the
resulting change to the output?

00:02:57.907 --> 00:02:59.341
And one way to think
about this is you say,

00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:01.708
"Well, that slight nudge of the vector..."

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:03.240
If we actually expand things out

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.681
and we look at the definition itself,

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:07.537
it'll be negative h, negative
one times that component,

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:10.017
and then two-h here.

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:14.475
So it's kind of like you
took negative one nudge,

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:17.841
in the x-direction, and then
two nudges in the y-direction.

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.841
You know, so for whatever
your nudge in the v-direction,

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:23.841
there, you take a negative one step by x,

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.941
and then two of them up by y.

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:27.378
So, when we actually write this out...

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:29.337
The notation, by the way, is

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:32.475
you take that same nabla from the gradient

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:34.175
but then you put the vector down here.

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.675
So, this is the directional derivative

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:36.907
in the direction of v.

00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:39.185
And there's a whole bunch
of other notations too.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.908
You know, I think there's
like derivative of f

00:03:41.908 --> 00:03:43.807
with respect to that vector,

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:45.174
is one way people think about it.

00:03:45.174 --> 00:03:46.773
Some people will just write like partial

00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:48.274
with a little subscript vector.

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:49.674
There's a whole bunch
of different notations,

00:03:49.674 --> 00:03:50.708
but this is the one I like.

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:54.013
You think that nabla with
the little f down there

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:56.707
with a little v for your vector, of f,

00:03:56.707 --> 00:03:58.897
and it's still a function of x and y.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:02.540
And the reason I like this is

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.074
it's indicative of how
you end up calculating it,

00:04:05.074 --> 00:04:06.975
which I'll talk about
at the end of the video.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:09.041
And for this particular example,

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.241
a good guess that you
might have is to say,

00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:13.908
"Well, we take a negative
step in the x-direction."

00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:16.074
So you think of it as whatever the change

00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:18.274
that's caused by such a
step in the x-direction,

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:19.641
you do the negative of that,

00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:21.674
and then it's two steps
in the y-direction.

00:04:21.674 --> 00:04:23.375
So, whatever the change
caused by a tiny step

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.010
in the y-direction,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.775
let's just take two of those.

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:32.675
Two times partial-f, partial-y.

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:35.773
And this is actually how you calculate it.

00:04:35.773 --> 00:04:37.640
And if I was gonna be more general,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.241
you know, let's say we've got a vector, w.

00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.608
I'm going to keep it abstract

00:04:41.608 --> 00:04:46.208
and just call it a and
b, as its components,

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:47.674
other than the specific numbers.

00:04:47.674 --> 00:04:50.311
You would say that the
directional derivative

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.982
in the direction of w, whatever that is,

00:04:52.982 --> 00:04:56.407
of f is equal to

00:04:56.407 --> 00:05:01.282
a times the partial derivative
of f with respect to x

00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:05.941
plus b times the partial derivative of f,

00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:07.568
with respect to y.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:09.907
And this is it.

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:12.221
This is the formula that you would use

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:14.774
for the directional derivative.

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:16.341
And again, the way that
you're thinking about this

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:17.842
is you're really saying, you know,

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:20.478
you take a little nudge
that's a in the x-direction

00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:22.107
and b in the y-direction.

00:05:22.107 --> 00:05:23.575
So, this should kind of make sense.

00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:25.241
And sometimes you see this written

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.241
not with respect to the
partial derivatives themselves

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.041
and the actual components, a and b,

00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:32.507
but with respect to the gradient.

00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:34.241
And this is because it
makes it much more compact,

00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.848
more general, if you're
dealing with other dimensions.

00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:38.568
So, we'll just write it over here.

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:42.374
If you look at this expression,
it looks like a dot product.

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:46.464
If you would take the dot
product of the vectors, a, b,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.540
and the one that has the
partial derivatives in it.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.541
So, what's lined up with a
is the partial derivative

00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.541
with respect to x, partial-f, partial-x,

00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:59.641
and what's lined up with b
is the partial derivative

00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:01.417
with respect to y.

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:04.574
And you look at this and you say,

00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:06.841
"Hey, a, b, I mean that's
just the original vector.

00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:08.608
"Right, that's w.

00:06:08.608 --> 00:06:10.608
"That's the vector, w."

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:12.141
And then you're dotting this with,

00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.241
well, partial derivative
with respect to x,

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.008
in one component, the
other partial derivative

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.377
in the other component.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.108
That's just the gradient.

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.407
That is the gradient of f.

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.397
And here, you know, it's
nabla without that little w

00:06:24.397 --> 00:06:26.384
at the bottom, and this is
why we use this notation

00:06:26.384 --> 00:06:28.314
because it's so suggestive of the way

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:29.938
that you ultimately calculate it.

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:33.111
So, this is really what
you'll see in a textbook,

00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.711
or see as the compact way of writing it.

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:38.651
And you can see how this is
more flexible for dimensions.

00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:39.741
So, if we were talking about something

00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.307
that has like a five dimensional input

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.508
and the vector of the
direction you move has

00:06:43.508 --> 00:06:44.542
five different components.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:45.375
This is flexible.

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:46.742
When you expand it,
the gradient would have

00:06:46.742 --> 00:06:48.747
five components, and the vector itself

00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:50.475
would have five components.

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.644
So, this is the directional derivative

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:53.608
and how you calculate it.

00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:54.875
And the way you interpret,

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.142
you're thinking of
moving along that vector

00:06:58.142 --> 00:07:01.075
by a tiny nudge, by a tiny,
you know, little value

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:02.601
multiplied by that vector

00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:04.679
and saying, "How does
that change the output

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:07.902
"and what's the ratio of
the resulting change?"
