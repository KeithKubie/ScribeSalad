eyes of Nye companies like Monsanto had

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
eyes of Nye companies like Monsanto had

patents on genes and people were

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
patents on genes and people were
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.709
patents on genes and people were
questioning whether or not that was

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
questioning whether or not that was
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.429
questioning whether or not that was
ethical also there was this overarching

idea that we have enough food we just

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
idea that we have enough food we just
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.460
idea that we have enough food we just
can't distribute it properly and the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
can't distribute it properly and the
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.960
can't distribute it properly and the
reason people are starving in the world

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
reason people are starving in the world
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.609
reason people are starving in the world
is there's enough food and my concern

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
is there's enough food and my concern
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.979
is there's enough food and my concern
was the ecosystem this is to say you can

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
was the ecosystem this is to say you can
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.580
was the ecosystem this is to say you can
know each organism very well and by no I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
know each organism very well and by no I
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.350
know each organism very well and by no I
mean you can know its the sequence of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
mean you can know its the sequence of
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720
mean you can know its the sequence of
its genes and you can grow it in

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
its genes and you can grow it in
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000
its genes and you can grow it in
isolation and refuges and see how it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010
isolation and refuges and see how it
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889
isolation and refuges and see how it
performs and this time at crops now

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899

there would be no need to experiment

by the middle of the 21st century this
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249
by the middle of the 21st century this
is going to be 9 billion there might

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
is going to be 9 billion there might
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.859
is going to be 9 billion there might
even be 10 billion people so those

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
even be 10 billion people so those
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.010

people are going to have to be fed

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020
people are going to have to be fed
 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.470
people are going to have to be fed
and sure enough the way to do that is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
and sure enough the way to do that is
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030
and sure enough the way to do that is
almost certainly with genetically

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
almost certainly with genetically
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.370
almost certainly with genetically
modified crops which are much more

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
modified crops which are much more
 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.220
modified crops which are much more
productive than they used to be and then

from a historic standpoint humans have

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
from a historic standpoint humans have
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.360
from a historic standpoint humans have
always hybridized crops but now

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
always hybridized crops but now
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.070

the third thing that's very compelling

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410
the third thing that's very compelling
 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.790
the third thing that's very compelling
to me as a scientist is we've discovered

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800
to me as a scientist is we've discovered
 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
to me as a scientist is we've discovered
and maybe everybody knew this except me

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840
and maybe everybody knew this except me
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.090
and maybe everybody knew this except me
and I'm the first of them that we've

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
and I'm the first of them that we've
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.880
and I'm the first of them that we've
discovered that genes are introduced

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890
discovered that genes are introduced
 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.720
discovered that genes are introduced
between species naturally and the paper

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
between species naturally and the paper
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.460
between species naturally and the paper
that really got to me was the one about

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
that really got to me was the one about
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.790
that really got to me was the one about
sweet potatoes so sweet potatoes became

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
sweet potatoes so sweet potatoes became
 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.550
sweet potatoes so sweet potatoes became
sweet potatoes because something like a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560
sweet potatoes because something like a
 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.920
sweet potatoes because something like a
virus infected the sweet potatoes and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
virus infected the sweet potatoes and
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.880
virus infected the sweet potatoes and
changed their genes and then humans

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890
changed their genes and then humans
 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.550
changed their genes and then humans
cultivated those gene changed potatoes

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
cultivated those gene changed potatoes
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.060
cultivated those gene changed potatoes
and so without this introduction of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070
and so without this introduction of
 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.199
and so without this introduction of
inter species between species genetic

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209
inter species between species genetic
 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.770

transfer this wouldn't have happened so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780
transfer this wouldn't have happened so
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.980
transfer this wouldn't have happened so
this these three things the ecosystem

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990
this these three things the ecosystem
 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.640
this these three things the ecosystem
concerned the rate at which we can assay

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650

naturally anyway these three things have

naturally anyway these three things have
 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.960
naturally anyway these three things have
changed my point of view about

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
changed my point of view about
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.390
changed my point of view about
genetically modified foods and the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
genetically modified foods and the
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.980
genetically modified foods and the
regulations for them are actually quite

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990
regulations for them are actually quite
 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.150
