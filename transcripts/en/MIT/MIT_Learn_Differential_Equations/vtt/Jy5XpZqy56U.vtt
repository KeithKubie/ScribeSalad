00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.990
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.410
Here's an example that's
more or less for fun.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.200
Because you'll see
me try to do it.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.360
You can do it better.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.450
I call the problem
the tumbling blocks.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.090
Only in this example,
in my demonstration,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.270
it's going to be
a tumbling book.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm going to take a
book, the sacred book,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.960
and throw it in the air.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.140
And I'll throw it
three different ways.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.560
And the question is, is the
spinning book stable or not?

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.420
And let me tell
you the three ways

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.610
and then give you the three
equations that came from Euler.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.950
So those are the
three equations.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.960
You see that they're not linear.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.270
And those are for
the angular momentum.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.590
So there's a little physics
behind the equations.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.630
But for us, those are
the three equations.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.750
So the first throw
will spin around

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.730
the very short axis, just
the thickness of the book,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.810
maybe an inch.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.300
So when I toss that,
as I'll do now,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.960
you will see if I can toss
it not too nervously I hope.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.740
It came-- it was stable.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.820
The book came back to
me without wobbling.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.200
Of course, my nerves would
give it a little wobble,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960
and that wobble would continue.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.970
It will be only
neutrally stable.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.490
The wobble doesn't disappear.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.990
But it doesn't
grow into a tumble.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.490
OK.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.920
So that's one axis,
the short axis.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.600
Then I'll throw it also
around the long axis, flipped

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.780
like this.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.000
I think that will be stable too.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.410
And then, finally, on
the intermediate axis,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.470
is middle length axis.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.130
Notice the rubber band that's
holding the book together.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.210
Holding so the pages don't open.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.390
And this, we'll see, I
think, will be unstable.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.100
And similarly,
throwing a football,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.550
throwing other Frisbees,
whatever your throw.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.110
Any 3D object has got these
three axes: a short one,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.110
a medium one, and a long axis.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.570
And the equations
will tell us short

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.990
and long axes should
give a stable turning.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.500
And the in between
axis is unstable.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.990
Well, how do we decide for
our differential equation

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.510
whether the fixed
point, a fixed point,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.660
that's a critical
point, a steady state--

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.850
we have to find
this steady state,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.080
and then for each steady
state we linearize.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.660
We find the derivatives
at that steady state.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.440
And that gives us a constant
matrix at that steady state.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.280
And then the
eigenvalue is decided.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.730
So first, find the
critical points.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.050
Second, find the derivatives
at the critical points.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.830
Third, for that
matrix of derivatives,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.250
find the eigenvalues
and decide stability.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.200
That's the sequence of steps.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.840
OK.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.630
The first time we've ever
done a three by three matrix.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.080
Maybe the last time.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.540
OK.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.430
Let me, before I
start-- before I

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.970
find the critical points--
notice some nice properties.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.330
If I multiply this
equation by x, this one

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.410
by y, this one by z, and
add, those will add to 0.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.910
When there's an x there,
a y there, and a z there,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.070
I get a 1 minus 2 and
a 1 they add to 0.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.269
So x times dx dt.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.750
y times dy dt. z
time dz dt adds to 0.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.570
That's an important fact.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.890
That's telling me that the
derivative of something is 0.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.090
That something
will be a constant.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.960
So I'm seeing here
the derivative

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.685
of that whole business
would be the derivative

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:41.760
of a half probably.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.520
x squared, because the
derivative of x squared

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.760
will be with a half.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.860
The derivative will be x dx dt.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.630
And y squared and z squared
is the derivative is 0.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.680
The derivative of that
line is just this line.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.140
It's 0.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.280
So this is a constant.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.910
No doubt, that's
probably telling me

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.710
that the total energy, the
kinetic energy, is constant.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.420
After I've tossed that
book up in the air,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.900
I'm not touching it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.170
It's doing its thing.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.240
And it's not going to change
energy because nothing

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.490
is happening to it.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.750
It's just out there.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.150
Now there are other-- so
that's a rather nice thing.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.170
This is a constant.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.560
Now there's another way.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.390
If I multiply this one by 2x,
and I multiply this one by y,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.800
and add just those
two, that cancels.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.740
So 2x dx dt-- 2x times
the first one-- and y

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.100
times the second one gives 0.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.760
Again, I'm seeing
something is constant.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.600
The derivative of something,
and that something

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:22.745
is x squared plus 1/2 y
squared is a constant.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.680
Another nice fact.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.300
Another quantity
that's conserved.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.480
And as I'm flying
around in space,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.200
this quantity x squared plus
1/2 y squared does not change.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.820
This sort of-- that
involved all of xyz.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.290
And of course that's the
equation of a sphere.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:58.020
So in energy space,
or in an xyz space,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.990
our solution is wandering
around a sphere.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.830
And this is the equation for,
I guess, it's an ellipse.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.790
So there's an ellipse
on that's sphere

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.380
that it's actually
staying on that ellipse.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.720
And in fact there's
another ellipse

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.550
because I could've multiplied
this one by 2z and this one

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.470
by y and added.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.380
And then those
would have canceled.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.710
Minus 2 xyz plus 2xyz.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.270
So that also tells
me that it would

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:41.730
be probably z squared plus 1/2
y squared equals a constant.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.670
That's another ellipse.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.380
z squared plus 1/2 y squared.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.810
You see this?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.730
If I take the
derivative of that,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:57.540
I have 2z times dz dt
plus y times dy dt.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.180
Adding give 0.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.540
The derivative is 0.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.110
The thing is a constant.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.870
But!

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.880
But, but, but!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.650
If I subtract this
one from this one,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.850
take the difference
of these two.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.370
Suppose I take this
one minus this one.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.530
The 1/2 y squared will go.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.300
So that will tell me
that x squared minus z

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.870
squared is a constant.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.490
Oh, boy!

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:31.680
I haven't solved
my three equations.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.049
But I found out a whole
lot about the solution.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:39.549
The solution stays on the
sphere, wanders around somehow.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.039
It also at the same time
stays on that ellipse.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.010
And it stays on that ellipse.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.150
But this is not an
ellipse, not an ellipse.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.360
That's the equation
of a hyperbola.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.810
And that's why-- which, of
course, goes off to infinity.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.640
And that's why the-- well,
it goes off to infinity,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.800
but it has to stay
on the sphere.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.290
It wanders.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.080
This will be responsible
for the unstable motion.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.830
Professor [INAUDIBLE], who would
do this far better than me,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.800
his great lecture in 1803,
Differential Equations,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.150
was exactly this.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.470
The full hour to tell you
everything about the tumbling

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.470
box.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:32.370
So I'm going to do
the demonstration

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:39.380
and write down the main facts
and understand the stability,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.670
the discussion of stability.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.370
I'm ready to move on to the
discussion of stability.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.420
Again, here are my
three equations.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.250
We're up to three
equation, so we're

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.010
going have a three
by three matrix.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:10:00.880
And first I have to find
out the critical points,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.080
the steady states
of this motion.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.550
How could I toss it so
that if I toss it perfectly

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.640
it stays exactly as tossed?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.040
And the answer is,
around the axis.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.340
If I toss this perfectly,
with no nerves,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.620
it'll just spin exactly
as I'm throwing it.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.530
The x, y, and z will
all be constant.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.145
Now, when I toss
it on that axis.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.040
I'm looking for-- here
are my right hand side.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:47.500
YZ, minus 2XZ, and XY.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.320
And I wrote those
in capital letters

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.560
because those are going
to be my steady states.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.610
Now I'm looking for are points
where nothing's happened.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.700
If those three right hand
sides of the equation are 0,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.380
I'm not going to move.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.350
xyz will stay where they are.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.340
So can you see solutions
of those three equations?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.040
Well, they're pretty
special equations.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:23.450
I get a solution when, for
example, solutions could be 1,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.230
0, 0/

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.690
If two of the three--
if y and z are 0.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.400
y is 0, z is 0, y
and z are 0, I get 0.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.830
So that is a certainly
steady state.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.740
x equal 1, y and
z equal 0 and 0.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.310
And that steady state is
spinning around one axis.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.790
And, actually, I could have
also a minus 1 would also be.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.080
So I've found, actually, two
steady states with y and z 0.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.980
Then there'll be two
more with x and z 0.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.890
And this could be--
that'll be spinning

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.870
around the middle axis.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.090
And then 0, 0, 1
or minus 1, that

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.500
would be spinning around the
third axis, the long axis.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.840
So those are my steady states.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.130
And I guess, come
to think of it, 0,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.240
0, 0 would also
be a steady state.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.810
I think I found them all.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.180
These are the xy's.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:37.880
These are the x,
y, z steady states.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.360
OK.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.310
So now once you know the steady
states, that's usually fun,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.750
as it was here.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:50.800
Now the slightly less fun step
is find all the derivatives,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.970
find that Jacobian
matrix of derivative.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.190
So I've got three equations.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.350
Three unknowns, xyz.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.180
Three right hand sides.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:09.440
And I have to find-- I'm
going to have a three by three

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.010
matrix of derivatives.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.050
This Jacobian matrix.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.680
So J for the Jacobian, the
matrix of first derivatives.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.300
So what goes into the
matrix of first derivative?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.710
Let me write Jacobian.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.380
It is named after Jacoby.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.270
It's the matrix of
first derivatives.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.650
On the top row are
the derivatives

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.950
of the first function
with respect to x.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.400
Well, the derivative
with respect to x is 0.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.226
The derivative with
respect to y is z.

00:13:45.226 --> 00:13:49.910
The derivative with
respect to z is y.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.350
Those were partial derivatives.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:00.160
They tell me how much the
first unknown x moves.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.400
They tell me what's happening
with the first unknown

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.940
x around the critical
point whichever it is.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.440
OK.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.860
What about the
partial derivatives

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.390
from the second equation?

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.040
it's partial derivatives
will go into this row.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.256
So x has a minus 2z.

00:14:22.256 --> 00:14:26.280
y derivative is 0.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.470
z derivative is minus 2x.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.600
And the third one, the
z derivative is 0 here.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.910
The y derivative in x.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.790
And the x derivative is y.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.950
I've found the 3 by 3
matrix with the nine

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.800
partial first derivatives.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.540
OK.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.410
It's the eigenvalues of
that matrix at these points

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.460
that decide stability.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.280
So I write that down.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:05.782
Eigenvalues of J at
the critical points x,

00:15:05.782 --> 00:15:09.230
y, z that's what I need.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.270
That's what decides stability.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:19.030
Let me just take the
first critical point.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.440
What is my matrix?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.490
I have to figure out what
is the matrix at that point?

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.160
And I'll just take 1, 0, 0.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.600
1, 0, 0.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:37.050
If x is 1-- so I'm getting,
this is at the point x equal 1.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.090
y and z are 0.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.900
So if x is 1, then that
that's a minus 2 and a 1.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.830
And I think
everything else is 0.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.030
So it'll be the eigenvalues
of that matrix that

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:03.800
decide the stability 1,
0, 0 of that fixed point.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.930
And remember, that's the
toss around the narrow axis.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.810
That's the toss
around the short axis.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.010
OK.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.110
What about the eigenvalues
of that matrix?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:24.420
Well, I can see here that
really it's three by three.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.930
But really, with
all those 0s, that

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.700
gives me an eigenvalues of 0.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.290
So I'm going to have an
eigenvalue of 0 here.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.270
And then I'm going
to have eigenvalues

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.310
from the part of that
matrix, which is two by two.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.560
So I'll have a
lambda equals 0 here.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.230
And two eigenvalues from here.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:51.290
And I look at that,
and what do I see?

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.740
Now this is a two
by two problem.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.550
I see the trace is 0.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.420
0 plus 0.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.650
My eigenvalues are a
plus and minus pair

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.859
because they add to 0.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.339
They multiply to
give the determinant.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.530
The determinant of
that matrix is 2.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.319
The determinant of
that matrix is 2.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.069
OK.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.470
So it has a positive
determinant.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.359
That's good for stability.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.680
But the trace is only 0.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.079
It's not quite negative.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.099
It's not positive.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.579
It's just at 0.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.500
So this is going to be a
case of neutral stability.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.440
The eigenvalues will be-- I'll
have a 0 eigenvalue from there.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.130
The eigenvalues from this
two by two will be-- there'll

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:45.220
be a square root of
2 times i and a minus

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.610
the square root of 2 times i.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.220
I think those are
the eigenvalues.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.760
And what I see there is
they're all imaginary.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.040
This is a pure oscillation.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.320
The wobbling keeps wobbling.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.570
Doesn't get worse.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.360
Doesn't go away.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.360
It's neutral stability
at this point.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.240
So neutral stability is what
we hopefully will see again.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.270
Yes.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.820
And I think, also, if I
flip on the long axis.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.320
Good.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.600
Did you see that
brilliant throw?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.300
It's neutral stability.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.310
It came back without
doing anything too bad.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:38.240
And I finally have to do the
axis that we're all intensely

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.170
waiting for, the middle axis.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.960
And the middle axis is when
the book starts tumbling,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.590
and it's going to be a question
of whether I can catch it

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.460
or not.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.610
May I try?

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.440
And then may I find-- what am I
expecting on the neutral axis?

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.920
I'm expecting instability.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.980
I think actually it
will be a saddle point.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.820
But there'll be a
positive eigenvalues.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.660
There will be a
positive eigenvalue.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.770
And it is responsible for the
tumbling, the wild tumbling

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.280
that you will see.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.420
And it's connected
with the point staying

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.670
on this hyperbola that
wonders away from-- so it's

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.920
this one now that I'm doing.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.440
This guy is the-- I'll put
a box around-- a double box

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.490
around it.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:34.590
That's the unstable one, which
I'm about to demonstrate.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.020
Ready?

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.771
OK.

00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:39.270
Whoops.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.769
OK.

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:42.130
It took two hands to catch it.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.820
Let me try it again.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:52.420
The point is it starts tumbling,
and it goes in all directions.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.860
It's like a football, a
really badly thrown football.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:05.010
It's like a football being
thrown that goes end to end.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.260
The whole flight breaks
up, and the ball is a mess.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.660
Catching it is ridiculous.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.590
And I'm doing it with a book.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.230
Yes.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.520
You saw that by
watching really closely.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.480
OK.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.140
Better if you do it.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.360
I'll end with the
eigenvalues at this point.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.400
So the eigenvalues
at that point--

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.330
can I just erase my matrix?

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.570
So this was a neutrally
stable one, a center

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.810
in the language of stability.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.430
That's a center which you just
go around and round and round.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:47.640
But now I'm going to just take
x and z to be 0 and y to be 1.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.240
So can I erase that
matrix and take--

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.890
If x and z are 0, and y is
1-- so I get a 1 down here.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.040
And I get a 1 up there.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.280
And nothing else.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.540
Everything else is 0.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.470
OK.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.240
That's my three by three matrix.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.300
What are its eigenvalues?

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.240
What are the eigenvalues
of that three by three very

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.010
special matrix?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:25.860
This is now the-- this was
the first derivative matrix,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.950
the Jacobian matrix, at
this point, corresponding

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.670
to the middle axis.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:32.420
OK.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:40.810
Again, I'm seeing some 0s.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:47.150
I'll reduce this to that two
by two matrix and this matrix.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:52.190
Really, I have this two
by two matrix in the xz,

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.590
and this one in the y.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.400
How about that guy?

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.710
You recognize what we're
looking at with this matrix.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:08.830
So with that matrix, I can
tell you the eigenvalues.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.820
We can see the trace is 0.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.480
The eigenvalues add to 0.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.560
They multiply to
the determinant.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.870
And the determinant is minus 1.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.640
So the eigenvalues
here are 1 and minus 1.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.140
And then this guy gives 0.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.250
And it's that eigenvalue
of 1 that's unstable.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.980
That eigenvalue
of 1 is unstable.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.660
OK.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.270
So mathematics shows
what the experiment

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:44.430
shows: an unstable
rotation tumbling

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.150
around that middle axis.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.950
Thank you.
