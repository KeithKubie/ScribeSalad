00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.379
Howard Weiss, a mathematics professor at Georgia Tech has teamed up with Vicki

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.120
Hertzberg from Emory School of Nursing.
They are the principal investigators in

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.500
A newly released study on how certain
respiratory illnesses might spread during air travel."

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.560
Herzberg: "So we were curious as
to how much movement had to do with

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.460
transmission of disease in the airplane."
Weiss. "This is a project to quantify the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.620
transmission of large droplet-mediated
respiratory infectious diseases in an

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.059
airplane cabin during flight." The study,
published in Proceedings of the National

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.129
Academy of Sciences, tracked passenger
movement during 10 cross-country flights

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.079
and then created thousands of simulated
flight models based on that data.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.740
Weiss: "And then we leveraged that to be able to create thousands and thousands of different flights

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.559
where on each flight, each simulated flight, each passenger has the movement

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.540
of some passenger who is seated in that seat on one of the ten flights."

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
Their findings suggest that germs probably don't spread any faster aboard airplanes

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.480
than they do in other common settings.
Their chief finding:

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:25.520
Herzberg: "If somebody is seated either one row ahead or one row behind or two seats lateral to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.460
an Infectious passenger, then they
are the most likely to become infected."

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.380
Weiss: "If you're seated further than a few feet from an infected passenger and you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.880
practice good hand hygiene, you're very
unlikely to become infected."

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.940
They also sampled the cabin air during these flights.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.240
Herzeberg: "Boeing refreshes its air,  I'm told, much more frequently than your average office building.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.840
On all these surfaces and and in all the air samples, we submitted them for testing with a panel of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.320
18 common respiratory viruses that might be transmitted and all of those samples were negative.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.200
The study focused only on these common

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.640
respiratory viruses and how they might
spread in a passenger airliner.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.740
It did not look at other places in which passengers might get infected, like in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.010
the airport gate house area before
boarding or standing in a line at a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
hotel registration desk or riding in a
crowded subway car.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.460
It also did not measure the many other ways travelers might get sick during travel, such as

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.580
picking up germs from surfaces that a sick passenger has touched.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.640
Weiss: "I could also be infected and cough in my hand, and then go to the lavatory a touch a knob, and

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.600
then you go to the lavatory, touch the
same knob and then you wipe your eye or your nose."

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.800
But frequent hand-washing or using a hand sanitizer during travel can go a long way

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.260
to keep you from getting sick.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.500
Herzberg: "The findings from this study haven't stopped me from flying."
