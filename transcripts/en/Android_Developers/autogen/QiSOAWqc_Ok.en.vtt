and over the past year we've invested

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830
and over the past year we've invested
 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.219
and over the past year we've invested
significant resources and making sure

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229
significant resources and making sure
 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.950
significant resources and making sure
that Google Play Store search is

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
that Google Play Store search is
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.749
that Google Play Store search is
incredibly relevant but we also took a

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759
incredibly relevant but we also took a
 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.359
incredibly relevant but we also took a
step back and thought about new ways to

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369
step back and thought about new ways to
 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.940
step back and thought about new ways to
serve results on Google Play and so we

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
serve results on Google Play and so we
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.129
serve results on Google Play and so we
came up with this new experience well

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.139
came up with this new experience well
 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.430
came up with this new experience well
results the organic results are

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
results the organic results are
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920
results the organic results are
clustered around topics and concepts

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
clustered around topics and concepts

this does two things first it helps

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
this does two things first it helps
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.960
this does two things first it helps
users narrow their intent faster they

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970
users narrow their intent faster they
 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330

can easily browse scroll up and down and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
can easily browse scroll up and down and
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760
can easily browse scroll up and down and
see which of those sub concepts are they

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770
see which of those sub concepts are they
 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.950
see which of those sub concepts are they
actually relevant to their query second

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
actually relevant to their query second
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.050
actually relevant to their query second
it helps users understand the range of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
it helps users understand the range of
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.140
it helps users understand the range of
options and a range of apps that are

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
options and a range of apps that are
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.440
options and a range of apps that are
available on Google Play this experience

obviously only works well for queries

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
obviously only works well for queries
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.820
obviously only works well for queries
that are very broad areas that you can

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
that are very broad areas that you can
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830
that are very broad areas that you can
actually break down into sub concepts so

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
actually break down into sub concepts so
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470
actually break down into sub concepts so
look for us to continue to invest in

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
look for us to continue to invest in
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.020
look for us to continue to invest in

this and roll it out further from our
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.250
this and roll it out further from our
experiments we've seen that this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260
experiments we've seen that this
 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.070

experience drives a greater total number
 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.500
experience drives a greater total number
of install from more unique apps and

of install from more unique apps and
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.900
of install from more unique apps and
very importantly by more unique

developers all really really good things
 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.600
developers all really really good things
for our ecosystem so let's talk about

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
for our ecosystem so let's talk about
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.930
for our ecosystem so let's talk about
personalizing the store one of the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
personalizing the store one of the
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.730
personalizing the store one of the
insights we've had is that there is

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740
insights we've had is that there is
 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.470
insights we've had is that there is
really no average user when you have an

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
really no average user when you have an
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.540
really no average user when you have an
echo system like ours we have over a

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
echo system like ours we have over a
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.820

billion users and they issue 400 million

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830
billion users and they issue 400 million
 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.070
billion users and they issue 400 million
search terms each month you really don't

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080
search terms each month you really don't
 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.410
search terms each month you really don't
have a prototypical user or interest you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420
have a prototypical user or interest you
 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900
have a prototypical user or interest you
can design for and in fact if you build

can design for and in fact if you build
 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.330
can design for and in fact if you build
a product for the average you most

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
a product for the average you most
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.890
a product for the average you most
likely end up with a suboptimal

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
likely end up with a suboptimal
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.310
likely end up with a suboptimal
experience so we're invested a lot in

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320
experience so we're invested a lot in
 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.410
experience so we're invested a lot in
making sure that the Play Store is

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
making sure that the Play Store is
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.510
making sure that the Play Store is
relevant and highly personal to our

users we think of it as one user one
store and so if your user interested in

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
store and so if your user interested in
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.060
store and so if your user interested in

you may see this one and most
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.330
you may see this one and most
importantly we've learned that

importantly we've learned that
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.759
importantly we've learned that
personalization really drives an

personalization really drives an
 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.100
personalization really drives an
increase in installs and in fact doubles
