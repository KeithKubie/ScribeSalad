00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:27.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:29.730
STEPHEN COLBERT: Thank you.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: Welcome
to Google.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.660
STEPHEN COLBERT: A pleasure
to be here in the flesh.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.160
I watch you guys online
all the time.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.660
Really great show.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.270
It's slow, but you just never
know where the plot's going.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have asked
our employees what

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.090
questions they have.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.590
I'm going to give you
the first question.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.570
This is an anonymous question.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.390
STEPHEN COLBERT: So they
ask the employees?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.190
You're not asking
the employees.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.150
They are.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: No.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.184
The questions have asked
the employees--

00:00:58.184 --> 00:00:59.800
[LAUGHS]

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.190
ERIC SCHMIDT: The employees
have asked the questions--

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.390
STEPHEN COLBERT: So you've
done nothing.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.985
You've done nothing.

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:03.500
ERIC SCHMIDT: I do nothing.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.040
That's correct.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.570
STEPHEN COLBERT: You're just
a titular figurehead.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.675
ERIC SCHMIDT: That is correct.

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:07.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: All right.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: So the anonymous
question from Michael Jones

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.540
goes like this.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.130
STEPHEN COLBERT: That
sounds like an

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.600
anonymous name, actually.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: "I don't
understand the title 'America

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.390
Again, Re-becoming the Greatness
that We Never

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.760
Weren't.'" This is, of course,
your new book, which is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.660
already the number one best
seller in the nation.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.980
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yes.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.892
Yes.

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:28.142
Thank you.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: "'America again'
suggests re-creation.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.740
'Re-becoming' suggests
re-creation.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.160
'The greatness,'
'we,' is clear.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.150
All of this is logical and
fine, although obviously

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.250
Yoda-esque.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.020
But then case A, 'never were'
was the impression that you

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.500
were trying to create would
be a perfect conclusion.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.080
But you added the apostrophe,
n, t.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.940
Taken in total, this would be
a clever play on words,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.910
meaning once again becoming the
country we hypothecate,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.480
have built in myth or a fable.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.660
Is this not the title?

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.870
Hmm.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.665
Case B, 'never weren't' which
is what you chose, which

00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.480
means--" I'm not done
yet, Stephen.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.750
STEPHEN COLBERT: I know.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.460
No, no.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.870
Go on.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.490
Go on, please.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK. "Which means
we never were not, and thus

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.800
never have been.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.900
And thus, the whole phrase is
once again becoming the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.500
country we have always been.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.840
This is strictly logical, which
you cannot become, which

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.770
you're not at present." What
do you say to this?

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.670
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well,
I say to this.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.070
To Michael--

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: This is the
hardest and toughest criticism

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.950
of your title that
I have ever seen.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.151
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:28.880
So Michael.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.120
"Michael." "Michael Jones."
Michael, the fool says in his

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.480
heart there is no God.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.290
But by God, he means that thing
then which no greater

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.320
thing can be conceived.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.920
But by conceiving of that
thing, he automatically

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.720
defines God as whatever he
can greatest imagine.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.940
Therefore, God does exist
because he has imagined that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.520
thing which must be greater
in reality than in his

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.120
imagination.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: I completely
agree.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.350
All right.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: Those of you
who are not familiar with

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.860
Saint Anselm's ontological
argument, I'll boil it down

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.040
for you again.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.850
"America Again, Re-becoming
the Greatness We Never

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.750
Weren't" has to be
written this way.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.000
Because clearly, our country's
in trouble.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.570
Yes?

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.840
OK.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.780
OK, you can tell because I am
the country, and I'm all

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.330
beaten up on the cover here.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.100
We want to re-become the
greatness, right?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.360
All right.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.010
But if I said, we never were,
then that would mean America

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.020
was never great.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.480
Right?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.760
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.820
STEPHEN COLBERT: But if I said
that we presently aren't, that

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.350
would mean I am criticizing
America, which you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.690
mustn't ever do.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.670
Therefore, it's "America
Again, Re-becoming the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.460
Greatness We Never Weren't."
Unless you've got something

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.840
bad to say about America,
Eric Schmidt.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.480
Do you have something bad
to say about America?

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.250
Because let me know.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.400
Because I'm sure all these
people and YouTube would love

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.220
to know what problem you've got
with the US of A, mister.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.890
Because I don't.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.414
And I've proven it with a title
that makes no sense.

00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:15.665
ERIC SCHMIDT: But I
thought you just

00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:16.560
convinced us that it did.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.690
Now, I want to continue.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.890
STEPHEN COLBERT: The title
is a peon to all the--

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.600
the Republican Convention,
for instance.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.300
The Republican Convention
said, America is great.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.710
And we mustn't listen to these
people who criticize our

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.340
country and do not think
it's the greatest

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.420
country in the world.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.350
And then in the next sentence,
they would say, we must return

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.860
to greatness.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.310
They would say it sometimes
in the same breath.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: Makes
perfect sense.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.500
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.040
American exceptionalism means
the rules don't apply to us.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.680
But the feeling on the right is
that we are losing the game

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.330
of being a country.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.600
And so this was trying
to capture

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.880
both of those feelings.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.300
There's a dichotomy.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.930
There's a cognitive dissonance
that constantly exists on the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.780
right, and even more strongly
now, that we must return to a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.710
greatness that we
presently have.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.140
Now, I want to explore--

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.420
STEPHEN COLBERT: Did anyone--

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.000
hold on.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.880
Did anyone recognize--

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.920
I'm sorry I'm stopping
you in the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.810
middle asking me a question.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.860
But it's Google, and
there are no rules.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.030
I've been told I have
to keep my pants on.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.930
But that's it.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.355
And that he will enforce
it strictly.

00:05:23.355 --> 00:05:24.800
You will enforce
this strictly.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.190
Did anyone recognize Saint
Anselm's argument for the

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.320
ontological existence of God?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.650
Yes, you did?

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.076
Move to the head of the class,
where you already are.

00:05:32.076 --> 00:05:33.935
ERIC SCHMIDT: He actually
used Google.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.230
You pretty much ran for
president and raised a Super

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.700
PAC and so forth.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.860
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.320
I did absolutely have
a Super PAC.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.430
And I kind of ran
for president.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.650
I ran as much for president as
I wanted to avoid violating

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.650
federal law.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.100
Good answer.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.350
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good lawyer.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: Now, Jim DeMint
has just announced--

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.950
STEPHEN COLBERT: Jim
DeMint, yes.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.720
Jim's a friend.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.260
But go ahead.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: He's just
announced that he's retiring.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.600
And it occurs to me that
you might want to--

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.410
you're from South Carolina
originally, I think.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.960
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yes.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.440
I'm from South Carolina,
the palmetto state.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: You might want
to run for Senate.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.780
Have you considered--

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.140
STEPHEN COLBERT: No, I do not
want to run for Senate.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.870
I want Nikki Haley to just
appoint me to Senate.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.550
That's the great thing.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.190
People are asking me, are you
going to run for Senate?

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.640
I'm like, no.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.720
Why would you run?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.040
She just gets to
say, it's you.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.350
So yeah.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.110
I'm honored by what you're
implying and by the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.470
groundswell that I've felt.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.340
But obviously, that's something
I have to take up

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.260
with my family and my pastor
before I decide whether to

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.410
take that position.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.595
Is there another question,
Senator?

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:54.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do you think that
Bill O'Reilly would be a

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.310
better choice?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.650
STEPHEN COLBERT: He's not
from South Carolina.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.050
But he's a very talented man.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.890
And I sincerely admire his
broadcasting abilities.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: But you're locked
in a deathly battle.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.250
STEPHEN COLBERT: With
Bill right now?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.000
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.050
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh,
you mean over the--

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: The book.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.290
STEPHEN COLBERT: Over
the book, exactly.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:18.080
Bill's got a book out called
"Killing Kennedy." And I

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.690
admire his obsession with
terrible things happening to

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.800
presidents.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.810
He's got "Killing Lincoln,"
"Killing Kennedy," "Sodomizing

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.120
Coolidge." That's
a kids' book.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.270
And he was on Jon
Stewart's show.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.030
And he said his next book's
going to be called "Killing

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.800
Colbert." And it broke my
character's heart so much to

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.490
hear papa bear say that.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.120
So we launched operation killing
"Killing Kennedy,"

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.590
where I'm just telling my
audience out there--

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.810
I'm not telling you
to buy my book.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.150
I don't want to abuse
the relationship.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.410
But I'm just reminding them,
if you're going to buy my

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.380
book-- and you are.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.540
If you're going to buy my book,
just do it all in one

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.080
week so we can leapfrog
at least one

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.060
of his killing books.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which week
do you want us to

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.860
all buy your book?

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: Right now.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.440
As we speak.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right now?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.570
This week?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.200
STEPHEN COLBERT:
Yes, right now.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.030
Go right now and go to a local
bookstore, a small bookstore,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.260
a big bookstore, online.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.890
ERIC SCHMIDT: Your book
is on Google Play.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.140
STEPHEN COLBERT: What
does that mean?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
our online store.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.650
You're going to end up
being your best--

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.940
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah, I know
all about Google Play.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.430
Really?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.770
STEPHEN COLBERT: Go
to Google Play.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: Absolutely.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.550
STEPHEN COLBERT: And
what happens there?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.429
ERIC SCHMIDT: People are going
to pay you lots of money to

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.150
buy your book.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.929
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, then
it's a wonderful service.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.240
ERIC SCHMIDT: Excellent.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.659
STEPHEN COLBERT: So you go
there, and you click on it?

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.549
It's like going to--

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.320
it's like that one that's named
after a rainforest?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.890
You go to that one, and you
click on it, and you get it?

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.100
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, it's the
competitor to the rainforest.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.500
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: And furthermore
it's--

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.125
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good.

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.570
Because we got to preserve
that rainforest.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.260
We got to start making books
out of that rainforest.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.220
Do you get a physical book from
you guys, or is it all

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.140
the ebook thing?

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
an ebook thing.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.170
STEPHEN COLBERT: It's
only ebook?

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: You can get
a physical book, too.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.060
We'll sell you one of those.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.690
STEPHEN COLBERT: You will?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah, we'll get
it through your publisher.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.360
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: At list
price, no less.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.070
STEPHEN COLBERT: What?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.010
At less price?

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: At list price.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.510
STEPHEN COLBERT:
At list price.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.530
At list price?

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.780
So go to Google+ for no deal.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.420
If you're willing to pay list--
which you should.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.390
Because if you pay list price,
they include more book.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.000
ERIC SCHMIDT: Understood.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.340
STEPHEN COLBERT: I'm not going
to give any of this

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.570
stuff away for free.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.550
ERIC SCHMIDT: I want to
explore some of the--

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.800
and I should not turn this into
an Android commercial.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.230
STEPHEN COLBERT: Go ahead.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: But
Android is now--

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.890
STEPHEN COLBERT: Now,
Android is?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: The operating
system that we sell.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:33.770
STEPHEN COLBERT: Got it.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:33.850
Got it.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.340
All right.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: And Android
is five times

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.650
larger than the iPhone.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.160
STEPHEN COLBERT: I know.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.670
I know.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: And Google
Play runs on that.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.350
STEPHEN COLBERT: No, I
read that someplace.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: So people will
actually be reading your book

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.910
on the most popular
operating system.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.310
STEPHEN COLBERT: Then it's going
to make my book better.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: Absolutely.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.710
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.000
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which is
why we support it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.380
STEPHEN COLBERT: Great.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: Good.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.910
Let's try--

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.420
STEPHEN COLBERT: I have
a Google tablet.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.270
I have a Google tablet.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.980
I have that little
Google tablet.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.450
It's got that slightly pebbled
finish and everything.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's phenomenally
successful.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.800
STEPHEN COLBERT: Can I
make a suggestion?

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.750
STEPHEN COLBERT: Can I add an
external volume thing on it?

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.120
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.190
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because you
actually got to go into a

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.510
screen to do the volume.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.270
An external--

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.520
ERIC SCHMIDT: That
would cost extra.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: I'm
made of money.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.160
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.430
STEPHEN COLBERT: After
this thing--

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.940
ERIC SCHMIDT: I want to explore
the precedents that

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.390
brought you to this view of
American exceptionalism.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:32.140
And I want to understand why
"A Man for All Seasons" is

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.870
your most favorite book.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.570
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well,
it's a play.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.020
But the book form of it is
actually one of my favorite

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.540
things to read.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.160
The introduction to "A Man For
All Seasons," which is by

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.960
Robert Bolt-- and if you've
never seen it, it's the story

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.610
of Sir Thomas More,
or Saint Thomas

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.900
More if you're a Catholic.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.040
And I'm a Catholic.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.150
And it's the story of the man
who was a friend of the king,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.810
King Henry VIII.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.310
And he was made chancellor
of England.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.730
And Henry wanted to get rid
of his wife, be done with

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.070
Catherine and get Anne
Boleyn in there.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.270
And Thomas More wouldn't put
his hand on a little black

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.970
book, raise his hand and say,
I agree with the king.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.650
He just stayed silent, wouldn't
say anything.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.040
And Henry chopped
his head off.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: We saw this
in "The Tudors."

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.570
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.030
It's a little different
in the play.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:19.400
But less of this in the
Robert Bolt version.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:26.360
I really like it, because it's
the story about essentially,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.240
is there any part of you, as
More says, is there any part

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.370
of you that is not
your appetites?

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.560
Is there any part of you
that is not your fears

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.730
and not your desires?

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.152
In other words, is there
any part of you that

00:11:38.152 --> 00:11:39.270
doesn't want or reject?

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.670
Is there any part of you that is
just you and from which you

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.900
cannot retreat?

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.970
And

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.110
When I first started doing the
show, I asked, especially the

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.670
people who were at the head of
my show, for instance, Allison

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.220
Silverman, who was my
original executive.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.150
No, she was my first
head writer.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.020
I said, I'd love you
to read this essay.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.240
Because certainly during the
Bush administration, there was

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.080
no criticism of President Bush
when he first started.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.850
We tried to fix that.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, I'm going
to come back to that.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.890
STEPHEN COLBERT: What?

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.400
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm going
to come back.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.790
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.020
And there were so many people
who were afraid to be critical

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.880
of the government at all because
you could be called

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.000
anti-American.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.030
And I love the play, because in
this example, he loves the

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.850
king but can't agree with him,
in the same way that someone

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.480
could love their country but
not agree with them.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.150
And can you bring yourself to
swim against the tide of all

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.240
your fellows?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.520
Can you keep yourself with your
own opinions and your own

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.680
ethics, your own morals,
regardless of

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.000
the tide of the times?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.360
And the Bush administration
was--

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.820
so many people got swept in the
wrong direction, I think.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.840
ERIC SCHMIDT: And what
was interesting was--

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.710
I was in the audience when you
gave the speech at the

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.240
correspondents' dinner.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.180
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh,
you were there?

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.690
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.916
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:57.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: You know, I
have nothing else to do.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.990
And so I was sitting there.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:04.730
And I was shocked that they were
foolish enough to invite

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.970
you, because you were so good.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.380
And I think that performance
put you from sort of a

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.120
specialized service to a
truly national figure.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.770
That's my opinion.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.740
I think it literally
changed the

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.300
perception of you in society.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.925
STEPHEN COLBERT: I went from
boutique to chain store at

00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:25.000
that point, I guess.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: It was like
a step function.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.405
STEPHEN COLBERT: What's
a step function?

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.870
What's a step function?

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.085
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's a big jump.

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:31.810
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh, OK.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.090
Sure.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.700
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's a
mathematical term.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.630
STEPHEN COLBERT: Like
the number line?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.300
Like the number line?

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.890
Is that what you mean by math?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's
what we do.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.300
STEPHEN COLBERT: Number line,
I got the number line down.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.936
ERIC SCHMIDT: So it was like a
really big discontinuous jump.

00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:48.370
And why do you think
they invited you?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.222
Did they know what they were
getting themselves into?

00:13:52.222 --> 00:13:54.114
[THUD]

00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:56.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.440
STEPHEN COLBERT: They're
coming for me.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.180
I've been waiting.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.110
I've been waiting.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.680
I did peer through the
blinds for a couple

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.650
weeks after that show.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.850
I got invited really early.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.930
The show started on
October 17, 2005.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.790
And--

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.690
[BEEPING]

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.260
STEPHEN COLBERT: All right.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.710
ERIC SCHMIDT: So this building
was used by the Port Authority

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.620
to bring buses up and down.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.660
Those are the bus--

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.000
STEPHEN COLBERT: Lifts.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: --elevators.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.150
So there's a truck about to come
in and destroy us all.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.400
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.205
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's backing up.

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:32.960
That's the backing up sound.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.340
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, I'm glad
to be here with you at

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.200
the end, Eric Schmidt.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: I thought the
end was on December 21.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.330
STEPHEN COLBERT:
Probably, yeah.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:43.695
Probably.

00:14:43.695 --> 00:14:44.060
Yeah.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.300
Yeah.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.810
Though I've-- yeah, probably.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: No need to plan
for anything on December 22 in

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.840
the Mayan calendar.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.720
Getting me back to President
Bush, who we've conveniently

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.330
forgotten--

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.140
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well,
I was invited

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.710
by the press, actually.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.420
For the correspondents' dinner,
you are invited by

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.660
whoever is the head
of the White House

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.310
press corps that year.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.250
And it was a guy named--

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.050
I think it's Mark Smith was the
guy from the AP, I think.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.180
And he invited me.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.270
And we were only a few
months into the show.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.420
We started in October
17, 2005.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.720
And it was January, I think, or
early February when I got

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.890
the invitation.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.970
And I said to my agent,
James Dixon--

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:20.860
I said, let me call him back.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.360
Let me call him back.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.550
And I said, I think
I want to do this.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.550
I'm going to call him back.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.810
And I called Jon Stewart
immediately.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.820
And I said, hey, Jon.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.210
I got invited down to the
correspondents' dinner.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.850
What do you think?

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:32.320
What do you think?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.050
And he goes, to be a guest?

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.260
What you mean?

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.180
And I said, no, they want
me to be the guy.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.578
And he goes, what?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.550
Have they ever seen your show?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.800
And I said, I don't know.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.520
I said, I'm not going to ask.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.510
And I said, I think I kind
of got to do it.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.720
And he goes, you've
got to do it.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.000
And then we were
really worried.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.600
I knew I'd never get this
opportunity again.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.090
No one's ever going
to ask me back.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.120
But about two weeks out, we
started working on it

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.930
about a month out.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.730
And the very first joke we wrote
for it was, people say

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.620
that this administration is just
rearranging deck chairs

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.630
on the Titanic.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.180
That is wrong.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.190
They are not sinking,
they are soaring.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.110
If anything, they are
rearranging the deck chairs on

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.630
the Hindenburg.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.090
And to me, that was the spirit
of the entire thing.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.110
Like, how positive
could we be--

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.970
[JABBING SOUNDS]

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.690
STEPHEN COLBERT: --while
they knife them?

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.720
And the press too.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.730
And the press too, of course.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.450
Because people forget that
we did 10 minutes on the

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.740
administration, 10 minutes
on the press.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.840
But anyway, about three days
before I went down there, we'd

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.220
been working.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.930
We do 161 shows a year.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.860
And we pulled very long weeks.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.580
As I was saying before,
65, 70 hour weeks.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.340
And we were super tired.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.520
You guys know what that's
like, I'm sure.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.310
And I go in, I get my coffee
from a very nice woman who was

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.980
from Algeria.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.810
And I walked into her
coffee shop right

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.540
before I went down there.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.020
And she goes, (ALGERIAN
ACCENT) oh,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.740
babies, you're so tired.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.660
What's wrong?

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.170
And this is my Algerian
accent.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.950
And I told her what
I was working on.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.280
She goes, you're performing
for the president?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.819
I said, yes.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.359
And I go, he's going to be five
feet away from me the

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.319
whole time.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:22.119
And she said, but you
are, uh, a critic.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:22.900
You're a critic.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.819
And I said, yes.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.960
But I get to do my jokes
just right at him.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.540
And she leaned across.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.470
She's a little lady,
very cute.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.110
And she leans across
the counter.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.600
And she took my chin
in her hand.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.810
And she said, it's
a good country.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.730
And I said, yeah.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.260
It sure is.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.480
And I told that story
to the President.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.140
Because there's a party before
the correspondents' dinner

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.240
that's really great.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.580
It's you, some cabinet members,
heads of several

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.520
press organizations,
and the President.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.320
And my family was there.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.290
And my mother loved
President Bush.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.750
He couldn't have been
nicer to my mom.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.730
It was really a charming
party.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.450
And I told him that story.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.500
Because he goes, it's
nice we can do this.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.940
And I told him the story.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.250
And he goes, only in America.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:13.600
And it was a very positive kind
of vibe that lasted for

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.850
about another hour.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.370
It was fun.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.820
It was a really fun night.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: But
from that point,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.700
something happened in America.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.290
You and Jon Stewart actually
became the major political

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.120
operatives, whether you
like it or not.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.090
STEPHEN COLBERT: I don't.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.960
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, trust me.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.600
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because
I'm a comedian.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.390
I'm not a political operative.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.140
I make jokes about the news.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.900
A lot of the news is
about politics.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.770
That's not my fault.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.000
STEPHEN COLBERT: Do you
know what I mean?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.280
Political operative means that
you have some gain beyond what

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:43.690
you're doing.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.770
Politics itself means I am not
telling you my intention.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.250
I am showing you an action that
is causing a reaction

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.870
from you while I'm playing
another chess piece over here.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.150
And together I will triangulate
some secretive way

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.010
where I will achieve
power over you.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.290
Political action is class
against class.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.620
I'm not trying to get
power over anybody.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.310
That's why I don't like
the idea of political

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.030
actor in any way.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.530
I'm making jokes.

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.200
I'm trying to make
you laugh about

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.240
something that I care about.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.480
About something I care about.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.420
ERIC SCHMIDT: But the fact of
the matter is that the trusted

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.430
organizations of our
society have been

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.920
replaced by you and Jon.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.030
STEPHEN COLBERT: Bullshit.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.530
And I'll tell you why.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.020
No, no.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.600
I'll tell you why.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.110
I'll tell you why.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.670
ERIC SCHMIDT: Am I right?

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.050
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because if
that was true, they--

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.538
no.

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:25.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:25.514 --> 00:19:26.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: Come on.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.740
Come on.

00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:33.096
STEPHEN COLBERT:
That's lovely.

00:19:33.096 --> 00:19:34.250
That's lovely.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.820
Because people have asked
me this before.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.150
And I don't think that's true,
because if that was the case,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.380
people wouldn't get my jokes.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.450
Because I'm not explaining
that much to you.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.180
First of all, you have to know
what I'm referencing to

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.820
understand half of my joke.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.440
And two, I don't explain the
news story that well to you.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.280
People come to me
with knowledge.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.670
They might enjoy watching the
show more than they enjoy

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.000
watching straight news.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.210
But they had to have gotten
news someplace else before

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.010
they get to me, or else
they wouldn't care.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.500
ERIC SCHMIDT: But independent of
whether I'm right or you're

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.340
right, the fact of
the matter is--

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:02.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: No, no.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.700
I'm right.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.470
It matters who's
right, I think.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.830
It matters who's right.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.200
Because this is what's
wrong with news.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.280
They say, independent
of who's right,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.240
let's talk about something.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:13.570
No.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.910
Someone's right.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.700
I'm saying you're the problem,
Eric Schmidt.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.740
That's what I just said.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.550
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's agree that
there is an issue between you

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.810
now and the Washington
establishment because you have

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.610
enormous reach.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.110
STEPHEN COLBERT: I've got to be
careful where I point this

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.490
thing is what you're saying?

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:32.890
Because it's loaded.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: Wag
of the finger.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.230
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.780
Wag of the finger.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.750
Exactly, yeah.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Wag
of the finger.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:41.770
So do you think you and
Washington are oil and water?

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.650
How do you think it plays out?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.860
STEPHEN COLBERT: Man, they don't
seem to like it when I

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.200
go down there.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.920
They're never that thrilled
when I show up.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.890
So I don't know if we're
oil and water.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.900
But it's not my world.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.945
I don't have any desire to
have political power.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.080
People thought Jon and I were
doing that rally to

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.350
be players and to--

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.710
what was it?

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:10.120
We were accused of trying to
actuate the youth vote and to

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.240
drive people to the polls to
win for the Democrats.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.260
And we've got this power.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.040
How will we exercise this
political vote gun that we've

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.890
got with a quarter of a million
people on the mall and

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.170
all this attention?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.760
And it just reminded me of--

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.420
I'm a huge "Lord of the Rings"
fan, as people sometimes know.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.200
And there's a great moment
in "The Lord

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.130
of the Rings" where--

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.270
if there's somebody here who
doesn't know the plot, they

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.650
got a ring.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.330
They're trying to destroy
it to get rid of Sauron.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.020
Listen, 10 years ago, people
were going, oh, yeah.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.910
What's the story about?

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:40.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: Is--

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.050
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh, no, no.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.300
This is important.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.050
There's a meeting toward
the end of it.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.650
Gandalf says to everybody
here, everybody in the

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.410
meeting-- it's Aragon and
some other people.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.920
And he goes, listen, our only
hope, our only hope for Frodo

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.400
and Sam to succeed is that
Sauron cannot imagine anyone

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.020
would want to destroy
the ring.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.210
He can't imagine we don't
want this power.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.250
When people kept on saying,
what's their intention with

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.020
this rally?

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.860
It was like, we're just
Frodo and Sam.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.360
Washington is Mordor.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.590
We're trying to throw the Ring
of Divisiveness into the fires

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.870
of Mount Mall.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:29.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: So why can't
they just fly Frodo into

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:35.430
Mordor and throw the ring in
and solve this problem?

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.700
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because
they'd see him coming.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.630
And the Nazgul have
flying steeds.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: I don't think
DC has any Nazguls.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.390
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh, you're
back to the metaphor.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.210
I thought you were talking about
something important,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:23:00.070
"The Lord of the Rings."

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: Why don't
we continue?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.550
STEPHEN COLBERT: What
do you think of my

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.330
little metaphor there?

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think your
metaphor's fantastic.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: Thank you.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.520
Thank you.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.320
You're a very smart man.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.660
ERIC SCHMIDT: I want
to continue.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.600
STEPHEN COLBERT: Thanks to you,
we got a great shot of

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.530
the mall with all the
people on it.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.615
You helped us out with
that map image.

00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:19.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.930
Google Maps are phenomenal.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.350
Ask an Apple user.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: I want to ask--

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.190
things are going really well.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.310
STEPHEN COLBERT: In this
interview right now?

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: No.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.880
No.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.520
In Google.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.900
And I wanted to ask, for the
benefit of our employees, tell

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.150
us more about the Colbert
Platinum.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.010
STEPHEN COLBERT: Colbert
Platinum?

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:45.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.300
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, Colbert
Platinum, it's a rare

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.613
opportunity to upgrade your
membership to the nation.

00:23:55.525 --> 00:23:58.810
It upgrades your citizenship
in the United States.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.350
It get you into all the finest
things that I can't even tell

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.310
you about, because you're
not in the Platinum yet.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.540
You know how rich people
have better

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.690
things than other people?

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:08.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: Like that.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.960
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.550
How do these prospective
members join?

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.790
STEPHEN COLBERT: Working for
Google is a good start.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.130
The Platinum is actually a
piece we do on the show,

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.380
Colbert Platinum, about the
Platinum lifestyle.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.830
ERIC SCHMIDT: Now, you tell
everyone to turn off their

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.780
televisions unless they're--

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.070
STEPHEN COLBERT: If you're not
a Platinum member of the

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.240
nation, this not for you.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.680
So we tell them to go off and
go drink their store brand

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.360
sodas and come back to us later,
which is good for them.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.380
I understand it's
good for them.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.620
They just need the
carbonation.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.870
But we stopped doing Colbert
Platinum, actually, because

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.630
the economy got so bad that we
actually felt it bumming out

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.050
the audience.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.840
So for a while, we changed it.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.880
Starting in 2009, we stopped
doing Colbert Platinum because

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.730
it really was bumming
out people.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.820
And also, high end things
weren't being bought, like

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.690
personal submarines and
stuff like that.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.650
So we changed it for a while.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:07.900
We changed it to Colbert
Aluminum.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.860
And then now we just
don't do it at all.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.010
But we'll relaunch it
again sometime.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.950
ERIC SCHMIDT: I cannot wait.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.220
Now are you going
to have a whole

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.900
year of "Hobbit" stories?

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.750
STEPHEN COLBERT: No,
we did a week.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: I know
you did a week.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.460
STEPHEN COLBERT: We
did a week of it.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.360
And I kind of maxed out.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.720
And we got to come back.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.360
We got to leave Middle Earth
and come back to America in

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.920
the new year.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.730
ERIC SCHMIDT: And so in this
doctrine of American

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.620
exceptionalism, which is I
think what the book is

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.180
actually about.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:35.720
STEPHEN COLBERT: It is.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.760
That's the first chapter is the
thesis statement, American

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.750
exceptionalism.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.180
Rules don't apply to us.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:46.090
So if that's true, how does
America become great if the

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.880
rules don't apply to us?

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.230
STEPHEN COLBERT: Buy the book.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.810
Every chapter tells us how to
return to what we already know

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.780
is the right thing, is to
reject socialism, reject

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:02.870
collectivism, and
go with the gut.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.970
We even have a chapter
just on food.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:10.680
Why America is the crispest,
crunchiest, most corn-fed

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.860
nation on earth.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.350
And if you are what you eat,
then put a stick up our butt,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.860
and we're all corn dogs,
walking around.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: In preparing for
this book, did you study the

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.640
amendments to the
Constitution?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.990
And did you have any opinions
about the amendments?

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.540
STEPHEN COLBERT: I always have
opinions about the amendments

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.280
to the Constitution.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.880
I mean, everybody's got their
top, what their top 10

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:37.970
amendments are.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do you have
a top one you like?

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.806
STEPHEN COLBERT: My number
one would probably

00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:44.620
be the Second Amendment.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.010
And my number two
would probably

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.340
be the First Amendment.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.320
And then probably my third
would be the Seventh.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.670
My fourth would be the Tenth.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.880
Fifth would be the Ninth.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.680
Sixth would be the Eighth.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: Is everybody
writing this down?

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.790
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah, get this
down, because I don't

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.310
have a rationale behind it.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.877
So I won't remember.

00:27:02.877 --> 00:27:04.127
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.020
I'm waiting for you to think
some more about the

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.430
amendments, what they stand for,
American exceptionalism.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.020
STEPHEN COLBERT: Sure.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.070
I have nothing more to
say, Eric Schmidt.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.520
No, but there's nothing about
the Constitution in the book.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: But the
Constitution allows

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.120
this book to be--

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.380
it's free speech.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.190
STEPHEN COLBERT: Sure, no, no.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.550
Yeah, well, the Second
Amendment allows

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.830
this book to exist.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.110
ERIC SCHMIDT: The First--

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.290
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because
if anybody--

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.640
no, no, the Second Amendment.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.010
Because if anybody stopped me
from publishing this book, I

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.260
would shoot them in the face.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.080
Do you understand me?

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.640
Understand me?

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.670
Are we clear?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.560
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's
very, very clear.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:51.880
STEPHEN COLBERT: It does.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.390
The Second Amendment

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:53.640
guarantees all other liberties.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think it's time
to start getting some

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.640
questions from our audience.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: That'd
be great.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Who would like
to ask a question?

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.600
We have a microphone
right here.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.270
And we have a microphone
right over here.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.330
STEPHEN COLBERT: I like these
moments of silence.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.000
AUDIENCE: I've got
one for you.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.580
I'm curious to know when's the
last time you had to audition

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.820
for something.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.400
And how did it go?

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.520
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, I'll
tell you the first time I

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.290
didn't have to audition for
something was for "Law and

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.680
Order, Criminal Intent."

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.510
AUDIENCE: I actually
remember that.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:42.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: I played a
forger who lives with his

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.720
mother who's sort of a psycho
who kills people through the

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.540
mail with lie bombs.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.660
And I didn't have audition
because they said, we wrote it

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.910
with you in mind.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.660
AUDIENCE: Nice compliment.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.900
STEPHEN COLBERT: It's
been a while.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.170
Boy, I paid my dues, though.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.230
I auditioned for a lot.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.830
I don't know.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.500
I mean, I've auditioned
for movies, I guess.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.540
But I've been doing my
show for seven years.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.890
I don't think I've auditioned
for anything since I've done

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.770
my show because I don't
have time to

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.230
hypothetically do something.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.850
Do you know what I mean?

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:19.750
I either have to do my show.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.530
Or if you'd like me to do
something, I can try to make

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.010
time for it if it still sounds
like it's going to be fun or

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.430
challenging or something
like that.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.470
But seven years, eight years,
something like that.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.710
I don't mind auditioning.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.450
I really don't.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.620
Because if I was on the other
side, I would definitely want

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.350
to know whether the
guy could do it.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.780
I don't want to hire somebody
because they're famous or

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.930
really handsome.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.870
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:41.850
Thanks.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: You have
a question over here.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:49.650
Meanwhile, I'll ask you how do
you think Google can become

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.170
the greatness that
we never weren't?

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.270
STEPHEN COLBERT: It kind
of already is.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.560
And I'm not trying to blow
secondhand smoke up your butt.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.760
Google can be anything
you want it to be.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.380
Because it's a reflection
of your own desire.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.130
It's a porthole toward what
you want it to be.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.060
Unless you guys are putting
some restricters on the

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.660
information that I think I'm
getting, then it is anything

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.810
we want it to be.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.240
Because it's an actuator.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.330
Or it's a pathway to what we
want, rather than the thing we

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.050
want itself.

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:29.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.065
So it's the finger that allows
us to look at the moon.

00:30:35.655 --> 00:30:36.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: Good.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.540
We'll take that.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.130
STEPHEN COLBERT: You
know what I mean?

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.280
Don't look at my finger.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280
You'll miss out on all that--

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: Everyone
understood that's the

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.870
strategic [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.890
Go ahead.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.060
This is a few years ago, but
what actually happened between

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.440
you and "The Venture
Bros." guys?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.520
Is there bad blood there, or was
there a miscommunication?

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.030
STEPHEN COLBERT: No, I can't
do my show and do that.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.790
I also had to quit "Harvey
Birdman," too.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.470
I just couldn't do my show
and do the voiceovers.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:01.430
Because I think "The Venture
Bros." was great.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:05.940
And I loved doing "Harvey
Birdman." But they had to wait

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.170
for me too much.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:07.810
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.340
I eventually couldn't do
any of it anymore.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.940
When I had to quit "Harvey
Birdman," I played a guy named

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.310
Phil Ken Sebben and a
guy named Reducto.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.900
And Phil Ken Sebben would
say things like,

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.820
haha, bobbly parts.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.310
And when both of them died on
one show-- they were both hit

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.850
by a bus on the same corner at
different parts of the same

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.550
cartoon by the same bus.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.600
And if you freeze the frame at
the moment that I get hit, my

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.520
characters get hit, on the
side of the bus, it says,

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.480
watch "The Colbert Report,"
11:30 on Comedy Central.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.840
But no, there's no bad blood.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.600
I think they're both great.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.110
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.310
Thanks.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.080
ERIC SCHMIDT: Employees have
submitted questions online.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.115
Here's one that I'm not quite
sure how to interpret.

00:31:46.115 --> 00:31:48.115
So I'll just read it to you.

00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:48.590
STEPHEN COLBERT: Sure.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: "Would
you rather fight

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.180
one horse-sized duck"--

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.790
STEPHEN COLBERT: Or one
duck-sized horse.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.765
ERIC SCHMIDT: --"or 100
duck-sized horses?"

00:31:54.765 --> 00:31:55.160
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:55.638
Yeah.

00:31:55.638 --> 00:31:56.116
Yeah.

00:31:56.116 --> 00:31:57.366
Yeah.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.140
100 duck-sized horses,
I would say.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.080
100 duck sized horses.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.990
ERIC SCHMIDT: You heard
it here first.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.080
That's a clear answer.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.040
STEPHEN COLBERT: That's
a clear answer.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.100
Did I win?

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.620
Is there a right answer there?

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: I'm
sure there is.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.030
STEPHEN COLBERT:
How about you?

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:16.890
What would you rather do?

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: I would
pick the opposite.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.500
STEPHEN COLBERT: A
horse sized duck?

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.600
Are you insane?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.440
I mean, it's not a sharp
beak but one blow.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.940
The thing has got to weigh
like 1,200 pounds.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.980
Whereas duck-sized horses, you
could just snap their spines

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.170
as they came at you.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.010
What I don't understand is,
why are we fighting them?

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:41.620
Wait a second.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.770
I know why I'm right.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:43.760
I know why I'm right.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.370
Because horses are vegetarian,
and ducks are carnivores.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:49.630
The duck would come at you.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.520
And the horses essentially would
leave you alone unless

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.410
your pockets were
filled with hay.

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which
they are not.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.880
STEPHEN COLBERT: Which they are
not, as far as we know.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.510
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:59.780
That's a very clear answer.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.110
Yes, ma'am?

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.620
AUDIENCE: Can you recall a
time that you were struck

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.700
speechless?

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.110
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yes.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.320
Several, but the one that leaps
to mind immediately was

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.110
when I had Jane Fonda
on the show.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:19.380
And without preamble, she got
up, sat on my lap, and stuck

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.630
her tongue in my ear.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.370
And I was rigid.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.080
I didn't know what to do.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.220
And if anyone's old enough to
remember Johnny Carson, there

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.850
was the famous time when a
spider monkey crawled on top

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.950
of his head.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.750
He was having Jack Hanna on.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.240
And a spider monkey jumped
on his head.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.650
And I thought, Jane Fonda
is my spider monkey.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.290
I don't know what to
do with myself.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: Googlers have
continued to suggest important

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.910
questions as a follow up to the
duck versus horse debate.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.400
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh, really?

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.010
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:56.800
Here's the next one.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.740
STEPHEN COLBERT:
As a follow up?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.010
STEPHEN COLBERT: From my answer,
on a piece of paper?

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.460
Google's that good that they're
actually transmitting

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.490
onto a piece of paper
right now?

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.380
Why are you withholding
that technology

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.710
from the rest of us?

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.320
ERIC SCHMIDT: We really are.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:12.960
STEPHEN COLBERT: Wow.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.530
ERIC SCHMIDT: "What are your
plans for welcoming the royal

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.520
baby?" This is the question.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.580
I'm sorry.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:27.400
"Any suggestions to what the
baby should be named?"

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.710
STEPHEN COLBERT: Stephen
Colbert's got a nice ring to

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.790
it, obviously.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:35.770
Charles Phillip Arthur George,
George Phillip Arthur Charles,

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.150
Arthur Phillip Charles George.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.199
ERIC SCHMIDT: All four?

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.150
STEPHEN COLBERT: Any
one of those.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.120
ERIC SCHMIDT: In
whatever order?

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.739
STEPHEN COLBERT: Sure.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:43.110
Sure.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.670
If there's an infinite
number of four names.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.699
ERIC SCHMIDT: There are,
well, 2 to the 4th.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:49.600
STEPHEN COLBERT: 16
or something.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.969
2 to the 4 or whatever
you said.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:51.889
ERIC SCHMIDT: 4 times
3 times 2.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:52.100
STEPHEN COLBERT: Something
like that.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.510
Whatever.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.073
I don't know.

00:34:54.073 --> 00:34:55.474
I don't know.

00:34:55.474 --> 00:34:56.875
I don't know.

00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:57.342
Yeah.

00:34:57.342 --> 00:34:57.809
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:34:57.809 --> 00:34:58.280
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.275
Again, the number line.

00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:00.990
The number line.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.370
That's what I liked
when I was a kid.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.580
No matter what class you were
in, whether you were in first

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.560
grade or if you were in
calculus, the book starts with

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.870
the number line.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.770
First pages is let's remind
ourselves what integers are.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: Another
Google has asked--

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.210
STEPHEN COLBERT: That was the
middle of a sentence just now.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.950
Another Googler has asked--

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.350
STEPHEN COLBERT: You people
have to put up with this.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.090
I'm so sorry.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.260
Power mad, is what I
would describe you.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: Googlers have
asked, "How would you

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.420
officially determine if
a tree is balanced?

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:38.250
What is the runtime of your
algorithm?" For your benefit--

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.610
STEPHEN COLBERT: If a
tree is balanced--

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.840
a tree is balanced if you
can hang ornaments

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.090
on any part of it.

00:35:47.605 --> 00:35:49.036
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's a
very good argument.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.240
Did you have a question?

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.400
Yes, go ahead.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.060
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between Stephen

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.610
Colbert, the person,
and Stephen

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.070
Colbert, the character?

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.260
And what were the challenges
in you becoming Stephen

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.020
Colbert, the character?

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.210
STEPHEN COLBERT: There are a
lot of differences, I hope,

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.860
between me and my character.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.000
I mean, there are some things
we have in common.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.190
We're both from South
Carolina.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.690
We're both fans of
Tolkien's work.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.190
Though, I tried to keep that
separate at first.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.530
I tried to keep that membrane.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.090
At first I was like,
no, no, no.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:23.840
That's too important to me.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.340
I don't want him to have that.

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.540
But there were too many
opportunities for me

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.510
to wax about it.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:33.430
So I went ahead and let that
membrane be permeable.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:37.370
But we're both super
Catholics.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.250
He thinks he's Captain
Catholic.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.480
I still go to church.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.870
And I'm not a particularly
pious or devout Catholic.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.120
Though I still go.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.850
He's a well-intentioned, poorly

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.440
informed, high status idiot.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.370
And I'd like to think I'm
well-intentioned.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.730
I'm better informed
than he is.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.375
He is completely incurious
about the world.

00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:09.940
He is living an unexamined
life.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.970
And that's fine with him.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.100
He's high status.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.810
I really enjoy being
low status.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:19.180
I really enjoy playing
a weak character.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.180
That's why I really enjoy
him is that he is this

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.750
unbelievably self-important
character.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.560
In fact, Jim Fenhagen,
who designed the

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.840
Republican set this year.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.540
And he does the Olympics.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.555
He's a huge set designer.

00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:32.470
And he's a wonderful guy,
an old friend of mine.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.260
I said to him-- when he was
designing my first set, I

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.960
said, I want your inspiration
to be da Vinci's "Last

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.100
Supper." Because if you look at
da Vinci's "Last Supper,"

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.710
Christ has no halo.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.810
Existence, all of creation
is his halo.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.890
Because there are all these
converging lines in the room.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.000
And in reality, they converge
upon Christ's head.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.790
As the world is God's
foot stool--

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.070
as it says in Matthew--

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.120
the world is Christ's halo.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.070
And so I said, I want my
whole set to be like

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.250
a halo around me.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.680
So if you looked at my original
set, there were these

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.290
convergent lines that
come out of my set.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:07.480
And we painted it on the floor
so I am the rising sun.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.770
There are no television
monitors behind me.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.520
I'm not like what Brian
Williams' or even Jon's set.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.190
He's got television monitors
behind him.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.540
And he's conveying
the news to you.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.780
He is a conduit.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.880
I am the news.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.360
I am a dawn onto my own day.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.750
But that's the outward status
of the character.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.860
But his weakness and his
incuriousness and his thin

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.970
skinned quality weakens him
in such wonderful ways.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.970
And I love that weakness,
because I think that's the

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:34.780
reality of me.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:41.460
I think I'm not as well
defined and as he is.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.755
And I enjoy copping to that
in my own behavior.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.340
ERIC SCHMIDT: What's
interesting about--

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.285
I think there is union in your
character and you personally.

00:38:52.285 --> 00:38:54.880
You're very supportive
of the troops.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.945
And I remember when you were in
Iraq, you got the president

00:38:57.945 --> 00:38:59.630
to order you to get a haircut.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.370
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.190
ERIC SCHMIDT: Pretty serious.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.390
STEPHEN COLBERT: That was fun.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.610
Yeah.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.440
Sure, yeah.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.980
I knew I wanted to have my
head shaved, because I

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.825
thought, oh, that'll feel
good in the room.

00:39:08.825 --> 00:39:11.050
That'll feel good with
all the troops.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.490
And I said, who could
shave my head?

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.470
The general.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.760
Well, who's going to make
the general do it?

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.590
The president.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.570
And everybody said yes.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.540
It was really lovely.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.840
ERIC SCHMIDT: And I think this
work that you're doing with

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.970
the troops is fantastic.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.170
Was there some reason in growing
up or something that

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:25.750
you felt that way?

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.090
Or is it just you're
just a genuine

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.580
patriot about this stuff?

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.500
STEPHEN COLBERT: I don't know.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.490
I'm a genuine patriot.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:33.200
I love my country.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.320
And I think patriotism
does not require

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.590
focus on the troops.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.180
Do you know what I mean?

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.940
There are other ways to be
patriotic other than

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.420
association with the military.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.430
That being said, I think not
enough attention is paid to

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.300
the men and women who make the
sacrifices that we have

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.006
collectively decided they should
make and then ignore.

00:39:52.006 --> 00:39:52.352
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:39:52.352 --> 00:39:52.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: Do you
know what I mean?

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:53.420
ERIC SCHMIDT: I agree.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.280
STEPHEN COLBERT: We're
all responsible.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.070
We all are sending
the troop orders.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:39:59.130
Do you know what I mean?

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.150
And we did it without a lot of
thought, but with a lot of

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:07.800
emotion 10, 11 years ago, and
not a lot of discussion.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.040
And then we thought
our job was done.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.250
And so because I talk about it
a lot, or used to talk about

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.010
it more when it was more in the
consciousness, especially

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.970
the news consciousness, because
my show is a shadow of

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:18.280
the actual news.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.490
And I'm, in some ways, very
reactive that way.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:27.930
I felt at a certain point that
I had a responsibility, along

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.800
with my responsibility to be
funny, to take opportunities

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.550
that came to me to talk about
the troops when I can.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.060
I have an 82nd Airborne flag
in my office because very

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.110
early on in the show, a young
man and his wife came.

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:45.120
And she had to speak for
him because he had

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.040
such bad brain damage.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.260
And he still could hear.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.285
But he couldn't really
converse.

00:40:50.285 --> 00:40:51.630
And he enjoyed the show.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.150
And he gave me the flag.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.380
And all he could really get
out was, don't forget us.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.050
Please keep talking about us.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:58.970
So I've got it on my wall.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:59.730
And I think about it.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.030
And we don't nearly do enough.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.320
And we don't help as
much as we should.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.780
But certainly, when you have an

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.990
opportunity that fits within--

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.980
I still have the responsibility

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.530
to do a comedy show.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:14.060
When I can fit those two things
together, we're more

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.430
than happy to try to
make it happen.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.040
And as I said, we
should do more.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, we still
have 100,000 troops in

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:19.370
Afghanistan.

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.480
STEPHEN COLBERT: Right.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:20.720
Right.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.550
I mean, we went to Iraq.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.880
And I'd love to be able to do
something in Afghanistan, too.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.610
And sadly, I think I might
have the time to.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.060
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.410
Go head.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.630
AUDIENCE: So a few year's back,
you suffered a terrible

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.060
work related injury
at your wrist.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.460
So my question to you is, do
you plan to expand to other

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.540
body parts, like ankles, legs?

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.460
STEPHEN COLBERT: Anything that
shatters, I will call

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.660
attention to.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.325
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:43.325 --> 00:41:44.640
STEPHEN COLBERT: Anything that
happens to me-- that's the

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.610
nice thing about the character
and one of the things that

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.220
saves me when there's down
time in the news is that

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:53.910
anything I think is worth
talking about is news.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.650
That's the character,
can name it.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.390
Anything that happens to me is
the most important thing

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.750
that's happening right now.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.340
And when I broke my wrist, sad
to say, the first thing I

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.590
thought of is content.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.000
AUDIENCE: And I have
a further question.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.680
How is your auditioning of Eric
Schmidt going right now?

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.880
And do you plan on taking
Eric on your book tour?

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.470
STEPHEN COLBERT: He's
doing very well.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.350
He's doing very well.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.880
Do you have an up tempo
or a ballad?

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.130
ERIC SCHMIDT: Oh, my god.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.165
STEPHEN COLBERT: [SINGING]

00:42:29.165 --> 00:42:32.070
I really can't stay.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.555
Baby, it's cold outside.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:37.450
Go ahead.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.680
Hit it.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:42.710
ERIC SCHMIDT: I learned
how to dance with PSY.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.410
That was enough.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:43.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: You did?

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:44.570
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.380
STEPHEN COLBERT: Wow.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.430
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was
really bad.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: So is he.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.730
ERIC SCHMIDT: Come on, he is
the number one cultural

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.960
phenomenon, 800,000,000--

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.250
STEPHEN COLBERT: And if it's
popular, it must be good.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: Absolutely.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.180
Speaking of which, again, many
Googlers have been asking

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.040
questions about your upcoming
YouTube show.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.960
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah,
what is that?

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.090
I have an upcoming
YouTube show?

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, we have all
decided that you have to have

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.610
a YouTube show of some kind.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.770
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.830
Does that violate my contract
with Viacom to have that?

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.890
Because you guys had a billion
dollar lawsuit against each

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:17.875
other, you realize.

00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:19.420
And Sumner Redstone
would rather see

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:19.960
your head on a stick.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: You actually asked
us on television to give

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.050
you the money.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.130
You forget.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.950
STEPHEN COLBERT: No,
I don't forget.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:26.980
You never gave it to me.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: I know.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:28.280
I know.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:28.490
We discussed--

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.400
STEPHEN COLBERT: If you gave the
money, I'd be knee deep in

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.744
hookers and blow,
and I'd forget.

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.160
And I was deposed.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.960
I was deposed for
that lawsuit.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.770
ERIC SCHMIDT: I know you were.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:38.700
STEPHEN COLBERT: And I've
got a good story

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.950
if you'd stop talking.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.010
I'm sorry.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.940
What was your question?

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:45.750
ERIC SCHMIDT: Tell your story.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:46.135
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK.

00:43:46.135 --> 00:43:47.890
OK.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:48.980
So it's been a few years.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.070
I don't think I'm violating
anything.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.780
So I got deposed for the YouTube
Google thing, the

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.480
Viacom thing.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.030
Because boy, they were
mad at you guys.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.320
They were so mad at you guys.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.680
And so your all's lawyer brought
me in to say, well,

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.960
how isn't YouTube great?

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.960
And wouldn't you not have a show
if it wasn't for YouTube?

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.260
And all those kind
of questions.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.450
And the lawyer for Google would
read me statements that

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.210
I said on air.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:15.860
And I said, well, I
didn't say that.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.730
And he goes, no, you said it.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:18.640
You said it on this broadcast.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.150
I said, no, my character
said that.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.520
And my character's not
under oath right now.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:34.260
And they said, well, if your
character were here, what

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.720
would he say?

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.220
And so I would say, OK, well,
I'll tell you what.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.810
I'll tell you what.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:45.010
If you ask me questions that my
character has to answer as

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.180
opposed to me, I'll move my
coffee cup to the other side

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.950
of my place here.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.340
And then you'll know I'm
speaking as my character.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.680
And so they'd ask
me a question.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.960
I'd keep my cup over here.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.060
And then in the middle of a
question, I'd start moving it

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.420
over to the side.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.790
Because I realized they
were asking me

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.010
something for my character.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.310
And the person would go, let
the record reflect that the

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.040
coffee cup is now on the left
side of Mr. Colbert.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
have a question.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.220
STEPHEN COLBERT: My character's
answer was always

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.250
like, I don't know what you're
talking about, buddy.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.780
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, ma'am?

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.890
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you have anything left on

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.100
your career wish list?

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: Sure.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.860
I just don't know.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.270
I never know what's going
to happen even tomorrow.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.480
I just got to spend the week
with some of my favorite

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.440
creative artists with "The
Hobbit." It was unbelievable.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.730
Weta Workshop made me
my own hobbit feet.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:47.140
Next week, I get to sing with
all these wonderful artists

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.300
doing Christmas carols.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.510
I've done my own Christmas
special.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.990
I've had a rally on the mall.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.020
I've testified before
Congress.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:02.670
I may or may not appear
in "The Hobbit."

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.390
The nice thing about my
show-- and whether or

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.310
not I do show forever--

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:06.080
I mean, everything ends.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.630
But whether or not I do the show
forever, the nice thing

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.660
about my show is that as the
host and executive producer, I

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.120
get to ask of myself anything
I want to try.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.190
But that also means, I have
to do everything I know.

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.300
And so it's just this tremendous
sort of refreshing

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.770
gift, as tiring as the show
is, because I am kind of

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.200
decaying before your eyes.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.870
In the same the way, it's
also rejuvenating.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:37.480
Because the show is only
what I want it to be.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.080
I can always say no to myself
or ask myself something new.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.110
But beyond this, I just want
to work with people I like.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:45.320
I love the people I work with.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.490
I love what we do.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:47.900
And I just want to be able
to do it with joy.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.860
And the moment I can't do that,
I have got to stop and

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.400
try to do something else.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.400
AUDIENCE: There are times when
you've taken your persona

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.350
outside of the show itself,
like when you ran for

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:56.750
president or started
your Super PAC.

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:00.480
And I was curious, how did you
get the idea to do that?

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.130
Or why did you decide to start
taking the character outside

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.380
of the show itself?

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.790
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, he thinks
he belongs everywhere.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.500
You know what I mean?

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.750
He thinks he belongs
everywhere.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.552
AUDIENCE: So did he make the
decision, or did you?

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.020
STEPHEN COLBERT:
You know what?

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.190
ERIC SCHMIDT: That sounds like
one of those Google--

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.410
STEPHEN COLBERT: My ego is just
big enough that I'd like

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.150
to think I'm in the
driver's seat.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.670
But I'm not entirely sure.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: That sounds
like one of those

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.980
Google lawyer questions.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.355
Are you a Google lawyer?

00:47:28.355 --> 00:47:29.930
AUDIENCE: No, I'm an engineer.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: Ah, even worse.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.930
Very precise.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.470
STEPHEN COLBERT: I like putting
him in situations.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.740
Because he thinks he belongs
everywhere, anywhere he goes,

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.670
as long as we can prepare
for the situation,

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:46.900
I rarely take him.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.220
I do talk shows,
like right now.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.020
Or if I go on Dave, or I do
any news talk shows or

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:54.240
anything like that, or even the
books tour, any place I

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.990
would do it, I'm only myself.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.450
I could lapse into him or the
way he might behave at times.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.500
But out of context, he clangs
against the world.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.560
And I have to be prepared
for that clang.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.690
And so I'm very prepared for
the correspondents' dinner.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:08.150
We're very prepared for
the rally in the mall.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.290
I'm very prepared
to go to Iraq.

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:12.520
I'm very prepared to testify
before Congress.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.040
I'm very prepared to give a
testimony any place, appear

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.750
before the FEC, or give a speech
to supporters on the

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:24.060
streets of Washington, DC.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.790
There's a lot of preparation
that goes into that.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.330
And I like it because
I like changing the

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.230
context of a space.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:33.690
I like changing the context of
a supposedly not performance

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.375
space into a performance
space and to see--

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.380
well, here's what
I like to do.

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.060
I like to think of the character
as a pebble that I

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.825
can throw into the news and then
report on my own ripples.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.600
And I've said this before, but
Jon Stewart has characterized

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.990
what he does as sitting at the
back of America's classroom

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.560
and shooting spit balls.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.910
I am the spit ball.

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.540
And I like to shoot myself into
it and see what it looks

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.270
like when I'm in a news story.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:15.580
For instance, appointed Senator
of South Carolina.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.760
That's interesting.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.680
I didn't intend that.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.320
Usually the best ones, I didn't
actuate, I didn't push.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.750
They were invitations.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:25.840
I didn't say, I want to testify
before Congress.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.060
They asked me.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.430
And I said, you know this is
going to be a terrible idea?

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:31.780
And they said, we want
you to come anyway.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.360
And I said, all right.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.820
In the same way, yesterday I
was just walking around,

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.900
nothing happening.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.880
And suddenly, there was
a horse underneath me.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.370
And it was me being Senator
from South Carolina.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.690
I thought, how delightful.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.060
How delightful that we've
planned all these seeds of

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.740
political activism
in my home state.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.780
And it is a reasonable,
ridiculous thing to surmise

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.700
that I might get the job.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:56.380
But when you put yourself in
the story, and I put this

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.750
character, this very false
character into a story,

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.870
anything that looks
like me in that

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:03.740
story is probably bullshit.

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.790
And that's a specific
way of doing satire.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.950
It's satire by comparison,
rather than satire by

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.970
deconstruction, if you
can understand

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.210
the difference there.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.690
I'm falsely constructing the
satire as opposed to

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.220
deconstructing other
people's behavior.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: Two
more questions.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.210
I have a question.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.130
STEPHEN COLBERT: I've
really enjoyed this,

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.910
before we get to this.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:23.810
This has been lovely.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.060
ERIC SCHMIDT: You haven't heard
the last two questions.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.590
OK.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.105
Now, I'm concerned about
end of year timing.

00:50:33.105 --> 00:50:33.900
STEPHEN COLBERT: End
of year timing?

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.730
ERIC SCHMIDT: End
of year timing.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.980
Because this week is the week
we need to buy this book, en

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.770
masse, globally, everyone.

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:41.100
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.590
This is the first week
that you need to.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.010
ERIC SCHMIDT: The first week?

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.915
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:50:43.915 --> 00:50:44.390
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.120
Then we have December 21, which
is the end of the world,

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.960
which is the Mayan
calendar date.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.030
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah.

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.540
Do we know how that's
happening?

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: You'll have
to do some research

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.000
on Google on this.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.730
Perhaps we could look it up
while we're chatting.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.410
And then we have the fiscal
cliff, which Washington is

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:00.630
obsessed about.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.170
So do you have any comments on
the fiscal cliff and its

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:08.380
timing after your book and
after the Mayan end?

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.450
STEPHEN COLBERT: I'd rather the
world come to an end than

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:12.090
talk about marginal tax rates.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.440
We've got a pretty darn good
fiscal cliff script.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.400
I think that first show after
Thanksgiving was the first

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.460
show that I thought, oh,
this is the first

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.320
show after the election.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.630
Because after the election, up
to Thanksgiving, you're just

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:34.870
sweeping up shrapnel from the
election, emotional and

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:36.340
political shrapnel from it.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.230
And then the first show back,
we knew the fiscal

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.310
cliff was a big thing.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.020
We did a piece.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.710
It was a perfectly fine,
first act piece.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:43.810
We had a guest.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:47.510
We had Reihan Salam on the show
to talk about Republicans

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.160
capitulating taxes.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.100
And right after that, we wrote
another really nice fiscal

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:55.600
cliff piece that I keep waiting
to be out of date.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.630
But the ball just won't
move that much.

00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.240
I mean, Obama can submit
his thing.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.820
The Republicans can submit
their thing.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.340
But the story is
still the same.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.670
The story's about,
you go first.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:04.740
You go first.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: One side could
try to hide from the other.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.150
STEPHEN COLBERT:
What'd you say?

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:09.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: One side could
try to hide from the other.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.030
STEPHEN COLBERT: Then
someone has to yell,

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:12.120
olly olly oxen free?

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.395
Yes?

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.610
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's right.

00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:15.840
STEPHEN COLBERT: I'm actually so
avoiding talking about the

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.550
fiscal cliff that I actually
did a week on "The Hobbit."

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:21.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: We'll
have you have the

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.550
honor of the last question.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.590
AUDIENCE: Uh-oh.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:24.710
Do you need a writer
in that case?

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.840
I guess that's what
I should ask?

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.320
Why did comedy become your
thing, do you think?

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.290
Or did comedy pick you?

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:34.910
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, that's
a nice way of putting it.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.070
That's a nice way
of putting it.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:44.980
I would say, I can't under
emphasize how important

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.820
comedy's been to my life and
how important certain

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.840
opportunities that came
along to my life.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.785
And many of them seem
accidental.

00:52:52.785 --> 00:52:55.140
For instance, Second City.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.310
I didn't think I was going
to be comedian.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:58.760
I had a secret desire as a high

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.390
schooler to be a comedian.

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.120
I didn't know what that meant.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.400
I just really liked
being funny.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.750
I'm from one of 11 kids.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.830
And we're a funny family.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:10.090
And being funny is important.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.640
The king of the room was
whoever was funniest.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:18.350
And I remember as a child,
seeing comedy helped.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.480
My family had a tragedy
when I was younger.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.430
My father and two of
my brothers died.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.950
ERIC SCHMIDT: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:26.430
STEPHEN COLBERT: And I remember
my sister making

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.910
another one of my sisters laugh
so hard in the car away

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:32.980
from the cemetery.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.590
One of my sisters made the other
sisters laugh so hard

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.910
that she fell on the floor of
the limo, one of those big

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.590
floors, with the rumble seat
facing each other.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:41.550
And she fell on the
floor laughing.

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:44.440
And I remember thinking,
I want to do that.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.450
I don't know whether it was
specifically in the context of

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.560
dealing with tragedy, because
I was only 10.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.810
But I remember specifically
thinking, I want that.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.540
I'd love to have been able
to do that right now.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:00.450
And then I fell asleep every
night for years listening to

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:05.940
Bill Cosby, "Wonderfulness,"
"Very Funny Fellow," David

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.090
Frye, "Richard Nixon, A
Fantasy," George Carlin,

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:14.310
"Class Clown," "Let's Get
Small," "Wild and Crazy Guy."

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:17.600
Back when you could stack
albums, stack so many of them,

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.800
the top one kind of played
slow as it went around.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.830
And then I went to college
to be an actor,

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:24.780
but an actor actor.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.173
I wore black, and
I had a beard.

00:54:26.173 --> 00:54:31.250
And I was like, let me share
my misery with you.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.820
Poet slash jerk kind of actor.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.550
And then I accidentally met some
people from Second City

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:38.950
and took some classes there and
got invited to audition

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.150
and accidentally--

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:41.580
just sort of the happy
accident--

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.860
fell in with some
great people.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.850
And I quit Second City four
times in order to go do

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:50.100
straight, black box
avant-garde kind

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.360
of theater in Chicago.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.170
That's what I was going to be.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:54.590
I was going to live in a studio
apartment with no

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:58.370
furniture and a futon on the
floor that I stuffed myself

00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:59.430
with yak fur.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:04.780
And just single and
with a beard and

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.670
sandals and a tashiki.

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:10.120
And I was going to drink from a
samovar that was constantly

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.000
bubbling in the background.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.940
But then one day,
I was backstage.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.640
I kept on returning
to doing comedy.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.290
And I was backstage one night.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:20.460
And this is really the thing
that made the decision for me.

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.090
I was backstage with
a guy named Dave

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.100
Razowsky, who does a--

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:28.620
what's it called?

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.280
A blog?

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:31.750
Audio?

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:32.410
Does a podcast.

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.470
He does a great podcast.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:34.220
Yeah.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:34.880
What do you kids do?

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.630
Your podcasts?

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:37.700
He's a great guy.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.500
We're backstage.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.120
Somebody was on stage.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.150
And they were supposed to do
a very simple blackout.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.410
And a blackout is
a very short--

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.080
it's got one joke.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.960
And then the lights go out.

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.990
This is at Second City.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.720
It's a pace keeper
for the show.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.480
She goes out there.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.730
And the blackout is this.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.130
You're supposed to say, I'd like
to do a song for you now.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:56.900
Welcome to the No Exit Cafe.

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.550
I'd like to do a song
for you right now, a

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:00.220
song for the whales.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.960
And then you tune up your
guitar for a long time.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.800
This is a song for the whales.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.726
And then you go,
[MAKES WHALE SOUNDS].

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.090
It's very simple.

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.180
You do whistle and clicks
and everything.

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:14.960
It's fine.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.170
Not a great laugh, but
it works every time.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.040
She goes out there to do it.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.360
I'd like to do a song
for you right now.

00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.910
I'd like to do a song
for you right now.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:25.950
She goes into her whistling
and her clicking.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.850
We're backstage waiting
to go on for the next

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.190
scene, me and Dave.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:32.590
And we said, it's not
getting any laughs.

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:34.190
This is foolproof.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.090
No laughs at all.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:35.680
What's going on?

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.910
Something's wrong.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.140
And then she goes,
oh, I forgot.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.390
It's song for whales.

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:50.890
And we burst into laughter
backstage.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:54.140
And we threw our arms around
each other in the

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:58.340
agony of her failure.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.950
And we're just laughing.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.240
We fell like a collapsing
tee-pee.

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:05.190
We just fell to the ground.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:09.740
And Dave's feet went out onto
stage, like this, as we held

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.360
each other like lovers.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.270
The most intimate, joyful
experience at her

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.880
pain that we all knew.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.230
And she could hear
it happening.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:19.980
And the audience could
see our feet.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.390
And she started laughing
at how wonderfully

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:25.670
she had just failed.

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.960
And I thought at that moment,
this is what I want.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:34.970
If failure of this scale can
cause this much joy for

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.100
anyone, then this is the
healthiest thing that I could

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.320
do with the rest of my life.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.430
And I will do nothing else.

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:43.510
And I've never looked back
from that moment.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:56.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:01.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: So Stephen, I
think what you see is that it

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:06.780
really takes a brilliant man
to produce this character.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.020
And what I like about this is
we get a sense of who you

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.260
really are.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.190
And we get some extra
special, too.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.370
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, it
was nice of you to say.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: And thank
you very much

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.680
for coming to Google.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.430
Now, we've got 30,000,
40,000 employees.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.090
STEPHEN COLBERT: So I should
sign all of them.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:24.640
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's just review
what they have to do.

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.940
This book needs to
be the number one

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:27.050
best seller this week?

00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:27.340
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yes.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.830
ERIC SCHMIDT: And every
week thereafter?

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:30.110
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well,
one week will do.

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:30.960
And we'll see what happens.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: Until my book
comes out, anyway.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:35.740
Right?

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:38.450
So our instructions are--

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:39.550
STEPHEN COLBERT: Go
get the book.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:40.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: Buy the book.

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.440
STEPHEN COLBERT: Don't
even read it.

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:45.200
That doesn't matter to me.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.920
I just have to leapfrog one of
O'Reilly's best sellers.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: I actually
read it.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:52.760
And it's phenomenal.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.193
STEPHEN COLBERT: You
are so perceptive.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.540
There's a reason why you
are who you are.

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.270
ERIC SCHMIDT: I didn't quite
get the 3D glasses thing.

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:02.800
And so I didn't put
them on right.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.410
But aside from that,
it's a great book.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:07.400
STEPHEN COLBERT: You didn't
put 3D glasses on right?

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.960
ERIC SCHMIDT: No, I didn't.

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.240
STEPHEN COLBERT: You could
run Google, but you don't

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.300
understand 3D glasses
technology?

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.930
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have
much better glasses

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.004
technology at Google.

00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:18.280
STEPHEN COLBERT: I understand.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Stephen Colbert,
thank you very much.

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:20.440
STEPHEN COLBERT: Thank you.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.690
Thank you.
