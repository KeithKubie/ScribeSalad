LOGAN URY: So thank
you all for coming.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.730
My name is Logan Ury.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.750
I help lead a team at Google
called the Irrational Lab.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.185
We're a behavioral
economics unit,

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:11.480
and we work closely
with Professor Dan

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.560
Ariely, who we're very
lucky to have with us today.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.700
And Dan Ariely is the James B.
Duke Professor of Psychology

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.640
and Behavioral
Economics at Duke.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.740
He founded the Center for
Advanced Hindsight there.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.930
And he's the author of three
"New York Times" best sellers,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.920
including "Predictably
Irrational,"

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.350
"The Upside of Irrationality,"
and "The Honest Truth About

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.640
Dishonesty."

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.030
So we're going to do about
35 minutes of questions

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.280
between us, and then we'll
open it up to the audience.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.890
So save your questions.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.940
And, Dan, I wanted to start off
with a really simple question

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.190
that somebody in the
audience gave me beforehand,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.537
which is, what do women want?

00:00:48.537 --> 00:00:54.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.460
DAN ARIELY: What do
they say they want

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.440
or what they really want?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.800
Um.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.234
Any other questions?

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:03.520
LOGAN URY: We can
come back to that.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.730
So based on your knowledge
of human decision-making--

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.980
DAN ARIELY: By the way, I'll
say one thing about this.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.890
It seems like a booby
trap to get into this,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.430
but I will say there's some
really nice results showing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.780
that what women want in
terms of men actually

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.160
changes through the
menstrual cycle.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.220
And there are times in
the month that women

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.270
crave more men that
are metrosexual

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.690
and a time of the
month when they

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.230
crave men that look more manly.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.445
And you can guess
when is each of those.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:41.820
LOGAN URY: People
in the audience

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.861
are taking notes on that.

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:43.910
That's great.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.880
So based on your knowledge
of human decision-making,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.750
how would you design the perfect
date, from the initial messages

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.010
to the days after the date?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.840
DAN ARIELY: OK, lots of things
to say about an optimal date.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.660
So the first question
to ask is, what

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.180
is the objective of the date?

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.520
And is the date a starting
point for something else or is

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.890
this the end of the experience?

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.930
Let's just assume
that we're thinking

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.490
about a long-term
relationship, and we're

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.550
just thinking about
the first date

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.260
as something that could
have a potential long life.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.290
One of the things we
know is that the ending

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.720
matters a great deal.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.470
So we've done lots of
experiments on this,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.300
but the nicest experiment is
an experiment on colonoscopy.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.182
So imagine you give
people a colonoscopy.

00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:41.640
And this is not something people
particularly enjoy, right?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.560
So that's not the analogy there.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.700
But you have two
types of colonoscopy.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.080
Sorry to give you the details.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.660
But colonoscopy, the
unpleasant moment

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.804
is where you go
around the curve.

00:02:55.804 --> 00:02:57.220
So imagine you
have a colonoscopy.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.080
It takes half an hour.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.090
And then for some
people, you just

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.140
leave the probe in their anus
for just five more minutes,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.510
but you don't make it painful.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.136
So for some people, you have
the experience, unpleasant.

00:03:13.136 --> 00:03:15.010
And for some people,
you have the experience,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.140
and the last five minutes
are just not as bad.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.990
Now it's not a good experience.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.300
Nobody says, oh, give
me those five minutes.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.030
But it makes the average of
everything else go higher.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.520
Which one of those do
you think people prefer?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.350
They prefer 30 minutes of
an unpleasant experience

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.760
or 30 minutes of unpleasant plus
5 minutes of less unpleasant?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.450
They prefer the second one.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.030
Now that's an indication that
the end matters a great deal.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.500
And the end matters a great
deal in all kinds of things.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.080
Think about dinner.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.100
How do we end a dinner?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.400
We end it with a dessert.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.820
We end it with something extra.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.610
And how would you want
to end a vacation?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.110
You want to end it
with a high note,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.500
not getting home and
washing everything,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.700
and cleaning, or getting
stuck in an airport.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.760
So I think I would
start by thinking

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.000
about the end of the
dating experience.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.250
So that would be one thing.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.540
The second thing is
that really, sadly,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.170
our imagination is often
better than reality.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.400
So think about something,
almost everything.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.470
What is better?

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.060
The experience itself or how
you can imagine it would be?

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.130
We have a tendency
to fill in the gaps.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.540
And we fill in gaps in
over-optimistic terms.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.660
Actually, we see this
a lot in online dating.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.780
People read profiles of
people in online dating,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.940
and they fill in the gaps.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.760
And they say, wow, this
person likes music,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.710
they must love the
kind of music I like.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.740
Fantastic.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.830
And then, of course,
they meet for coffee

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.860
and get disappointed.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.960
So I would say the last moment
is incredibly important.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.320
And on top of that, leaving
something to the imagination

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.940
would be extra, extra useful.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.030
So that's one thing.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.980
The second thing is, how
do you get people to have--

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.210
so we talked about the end.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.710
You want the end
to be meaningful,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.116
and you want to leave something
for the imagination for later.

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:20.890
The other thing is
the question, how

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.960
do you actually make the
discussions meaningful?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.250
So we did this in an
online dating setup,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.830
and we got people to-- these
were MIT students, so it comes

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.550
with all the qualifications.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.240
Anybody here went to MIT?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.020
Yeah, so you know.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.240
So you know the material.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.434
But anyway, so these
were MIT undergraduates

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:42.850
who were dating
on this date site,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.370
and we just captured their
text messages to each other.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.360
And how wonderful do you
think their discussions were?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.620
How meaningful?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.429
They were terrible.

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:56.220
They were terrible.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.810
They were asking things like,
what are you majoring in?

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.340
And where do you go to school?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.580
And how many siblings?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.620
Now you could say that's what
they really want to know.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.130
What really makes a
first date interesting

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.890
is to go over each
other's resume

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.250
and exchange those details.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.020
The other possibility
is that we actually

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.670
don't feel comfortable sharing
intimate, useful details

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.110
about ourselves.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.230
And what we gravitate toward is
the lower common denominator.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.220
So we did another version of
this in which we gave people

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.620
20 questions.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.250
And we told people, look, you
can't ask anything you want.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.250
You have to pick from
those 20 questions.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.390
And the other person
knew that they could only

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.920
pick from those 20 questions.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.480
So if we have a first date,
and I start by saying, Logan,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.480
what's your most
interesting sexual fantasy?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.425
A little hard to
start a discussion

00:06:51.425 --> 00:06:56.090
like that because it violates
some rules about conversation,

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.160
where you expect people
to start by saying,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.850
where do you go to school?

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.610
But it's really
boring, useless stuff

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.380
that doesn't promote the
relationship in any way.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.090
So we gave people a
list of questions,

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.420
and we said, these are the
only questions you can ask.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.690
And what happened?

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.450
Everybody benefited more
from those questions.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.410
The people who asked got
answers that they cared about.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.634
And the people who
answered the question,

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.550
it's really much more
interesting than saying,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.805
read my resume.

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:25.430
So I think there's
another question of,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.080
how do we create a room for
a date, that during the date,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.340
we agree in advance
not to exchange

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.670
meaningless information?

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.710
How do you set the tone?

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.730
How do you set the
rules for that approach?

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.180
There's a very nice set
of questions in psychology

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.530
where they basically came up
with a list of 36 questions,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.650
I think, where they
said, these 36 questions

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.680
help people get to
know each other.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.080
The questions themselves
are not that crucial.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.660
What is crucial is
what they leave out.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.340
So thinking about the
date in terms of saying,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.580
how do we make it meaningful?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.930
And then the final
thing, I would say,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.970
is that, what are you really
trying to get out of a date?

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.950
You're trying to get a
glimpse of that person.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.560
And some of it comes from direct
questioning and answering,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.330
the interview process.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.740
But some of it comes
from getting people

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.410
to interact in the world.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.700
Imagine you could go
on a date with somebody

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.350
in an empty room
with nothing around.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.650
How much would you learn about
that person versus if you

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.690
went together to a concert?

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.470
And there's lots of
other people around,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.805
and vendors, and
noise, and things

00:08:43.805 --> 00:08:44.930
happen that are unexpected.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.010
How much would you be able
to learn in a slightly

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.710
non-mediated, non-clear way?

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.360
You would actually
understand that person

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.800
in a much better way.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.710
So thinking also about
what's the environment that

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.600
could maximize how much
you're going to learn

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.725
about that person is important.

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:02.600
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.030
So what about before
and after the date?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.090
Is there any research that says
people should play hard to get?

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.490
That's a question that my
friends ask me all the time.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.140
DAN ARIELY: Yes, absolutely.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.775
Playing hard to get
is a good recipe.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.540
So you know the term
cognitive dissonance, right?

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.220
So the original research
in cognitive dissonance

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.590
looked at the following.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.180
Festinger got people to a
room, and he said, please

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.980
screw this bolt for an hour.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.160
And people screwed
this bolt for an hour.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.750
And then he paid some people
$1 for this, very low.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.440
Some people, $20, very high.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.670
And then he basically tried
to get them to recommend

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.590
this task for other people.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.680
Now if you got $20 for this,
what do you say to yourself?

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.550
This was an unbelievably
boring task.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.130
I got paid a lot.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.740
Perfectly fine.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.520
What do you say if
you got paid $1?

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.950
You say, I got paid $1.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.820
This was unbelievably boring.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.990
Those things don't fit.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.095
Now can you change the
fact that you got paid $1?

00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:13.480
No, that's a fact.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.530
So what do you do?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.140
You change your perception
of the boringness.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.790
This idea of
cognitive dissonance

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.750
is it's uncomfortable
for us to live

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.780
with two ideas that don't fit.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.140
So you say, I got paid $1.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.170
This was boring.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.320
I don't like living
with this dissonance.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.580
So let me think about this
task as being more interesting.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.920
And now I feel more likely to
recommend it to other people.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.490
So think about it
in the same way.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.630
You're going on a date,
and you work hard for it.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.370
What do you say to yourself?

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:51.170
You say, I'm working
very hard for it,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.492
and this person is not worth it.

00:10:53.492 --> 00:10:55.020
It doesn't work as well.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.250
So the moment you work harder
for somebody, for something,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.450
you can't change that fact.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.890
You change your opinion
that this person is actually

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.400
worth more.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.130
You have to explain to
yourself, why did I try so hard?

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.180
Why did I try so hard
for such a long time?

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.690
And the only solution you
have is to say this person

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.530
must be amazing.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.220
So you convince yourself
that this person is amazing.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.081
So this is kind
of a justification

00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:20.080
for playing hard to get.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.210
Now there's probably a limit.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:32.350
But I think that making things
too easy are not worthwhile.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:38.334
There's another more recent
research on showing effort.

00:11:38.334 --> 00:11:40.000
Do you want to say
something about this?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.666
LOGAN URY: Sure.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.190
So Michael Norton, who's a
professor at Harvard Business

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.310
School, did some
research showing

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.200
how do people like to see the
search results for a travel

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.770
website.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.110
So you would think I like to
see them as quickly as possible.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.410
But he actually had a
condition in which you saw it

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.647
instantaneously, you saw
it with a progress bar,

00:11:57.647 --> 00:11:59.480
or you saw it with a
progress bar that said,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.610
we're now searching
thousands of websites,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.190
including Orbitz, and United,
and American Airlines.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.810
And people actually
preferred that third one

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.150
because they thought that
the, quote, "algorithm"

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.840
was working harder for them.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.960
So we like when things are
harder but show effort.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.860
DAN ARIELY: So it's
not just the hard,

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.480
but that we understand the
effort that goes into it.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.350
So when you think
about relationships,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.100
and you take two people in a
relationship, and you ask them,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.340
from the total 100%
of the relationship,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.550
how much work do you do,
and how much work do you do?

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.290
These numbers never sum
up to less than 100.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.070
It's always more than 100%.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.460
And why is it?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.130
It's because we see all
the details of what we do.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.180
I take the trash.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.450
My goodness, this is
a 17-step process,

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.770
takes a really long
time, really involved.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.760
My wife, she pays the bills.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.170
That has to be very simple.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.530
And the lesson from
this is you really

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.411
want to be more like Kayak
in every aspect of your life.

00:12:57.411 --> 00:12:59.410
You want to come home to
your significant other,

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.920
and you want to say,
I'm searching United,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.620
I'm searching.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.640
Here's all the things I've done
for our relationship today.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.480
And it's not about
lying or exaggerating,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.090
but it's really about
making the effort

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.485
that you put in clear to
the other person as well.

00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:15.110
LOGAN URY: It also
works for roommates,

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.370
I've recently discovered.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.530
Yeah.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.100
So something that I've
thought about for a long time

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.920
is we're now in
this age of Tinder.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.665
And you go on your
phone, and there's--

00:13:24.665 --> 00:13:25.498
DAN ARIELY: I'm not.

00:13:25.498 --> 00:13:29.020
LOGAN URY: --seemingly
limitless amount of people.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.500
And you think your soulmate
is just one swipe away.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.650
So with what you know about
the paradox of choice,

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.340
how should we
optimize for happiness

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.060
in this age of Tinder?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.090
DAN ARIELY: And it's not
just the paradox of choice.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.580
So imagine two principles.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.520
The first one is the grass
always looks greener.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.290
OK, let's take a step back.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.550
When you get to know
somebody better,

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.200
what are some of the first
things you learn about them?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.300
That they disappoint you
in all kinds of ways.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.210
So this is true in
visual illusion.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.700
If you take pictures of
people, and you blur them out,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.880
and you make them
fuzzy, everybody

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.660
looks more attractive.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.260
As you get into the
little details of life,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.900
you start seeing wrinkles.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.780
And it's true in
visual perception,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.830
and it's also true in life.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.660
When you look at people
in general terms,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.900
you only see the
good things in them.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.280
This, by the way, is not just
about romantic attraction.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.560
When companies hire
CEOs, and they hire CEOs

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.080
from outside the company, they
often have high expectations

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.580
from them.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.954
But when you look
at the results,

00:14:43.954 --> 00:14:47.195
the results show that they
pay way more to external CEOs

00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:50.579
than internal ones,
and they perform worse.

00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.120
But when you look
at an external one,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.620
it's very easy to
say, oh my goodness,

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.703
this person is just great.

00:14:54.703 --> 00:14:58.290
Because you don't know
the little details.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.030
So if you look at somebody
you don't know very well,

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.264
all the little annoying
habits that they have

00:15:03.264 --> 00:15:05.180
are just going to be
outside of scope for you,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.730
and you will just imagine
that they all work well.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.510
Only when they move in, you
get to see those details.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.490
So imagine a world in which,
when you look at other people,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.730
they look more
green, or they look

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.730
more glorious than when
you get to know them

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.440
in all the details.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.180
And now you're in
bed next to somebody,

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.160
and you wake up in the
morning, and you say,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.100
is this what I want
for the rest of my life

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.040
when I have other options here?

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.570
And this is the Tinder,
your phone is here.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.360
And basically, all of those
things, all of those options

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.890
look so wonderful.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.360
By the way, also, in
online dating, or Facebook,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.960
whatever it is, people only
present their positive sides.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.630
So you have this biased idea
that the outside option,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.120
the set of the outside
options, looks so promising.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.470
And now, you wake
up next to somebody

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.070
or you have a little
fight with somebody,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.700
and you think to
yourself, in one click,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.170
I could have a date
with somebody else.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:16.150
Now imagine that you
have an apartment.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.310
And you have a deal
with the landlord

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.220
that the lease is day-to-day.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.180
And every morning, you
wake up and you say,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.770
do I want to extend
this lease or not?

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.530
And every day,
your landlord will

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.450
decide if they want to
extend that lease or not.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.720
How much would you
invest in the apartment?

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.570
Would you paint the walls?

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.090
Would you get flowers?

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.265
Would you fix the walls?

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.640
Would you do all
kinds of things?

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.140
Of course not.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.540
Because you're always
with one foot outside.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.540
And I think that that's
really the issue.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.000
It's not just the existence
of Tinder, but this idea.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.835
So the analogy is
that you wake up

00:16:53.835 --> 00:16:56.210
next to your romantic partner
every morning, and you say,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.790
should we do it for another
day or should we stop now?

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.440
The moment you think in the
short-term horizon, the odds

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.270
that you will invest
in a relationship

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.420
is much, much lower.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.310
And there's actually
a beautiful research

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.160
by Dan Gilbert and Ebert.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.030
They got undergrads to
take a photography class.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.190
And at the end of the
two-week photography class,

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.670
they say, hey, you took
lots of pictures, pick one,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.990
and we'll send this one picture
to England to be developed.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.380
It'll be back here in two weeks.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.400
That's it.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.000
The other group, they said
the same thing, but they said,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.830
look, we're going to send
it to England for two weeks.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.860
It'll come back.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.390
But during those two weeks,
you can change your mind.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.170
In fact, even when the
picture comes back,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.690
you can change your mind.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.430
So the picture came
back after two weeks.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.471
Of course, they didn't
really send it to England,

00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:49.360
but they came back.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.880
And then they say, do
you change your mind?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.860
Nobody changed their mind.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.270
But how much did people
like their pictures?

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.020
The people who committed
to the pictures loved them.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.244
The people who were still,
all the time, saying, yes,

00:18:04.244 --> 00:18:05.660
I know I committed
to the picture,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.870
but there's all kinds
of other pictures,

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.900
should I change my mind, and so
on, actually liked them less.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.750
So the thing that
worries me is that when

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:20.300
we're in a relationship but
continuously with one foot out,

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.090
and continuously thinking
about how the outside world is

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.990
more tempting, and more
interesting, and so on,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.160
it's actually not a good
recipe for investing

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.760
in a relationship.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.830
And the relationship
gets better when you--

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.360
it's not a zero-sum game.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.580
It gets better when
you invest in it.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.860
And if you don't think
you're there for a long time,

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.544
the likelihood of investment
is just not that high.

00:18:40.544 --> 00:18:41.960
LOGAN URY: So
that's a great segue

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.100
into something I
wanted to talk about,

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.000
which is how do you choose who
you should settle down with?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.930
And maybe you could apply
this to the secretary problem.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.894
DAN ARIELY: So my
preference for all of you

00:18:50.894 --> 00:18:51.810
is to choose randomly.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.370
It's the best for
experimental research.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.515
We haven't been able
to do this experiment.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.510
So you know the
secretary problem, right?

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.470
The secretary problem
is a classic problem

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.980
in operation research.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.480
And the idea is that living
without the secretary is tough.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.480
These were the days when
people had secretaries.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.240
But let's say living without
an assistant is tough.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.750
Every day, you have
lower utility for the day

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.570
because you have to
do more yourself.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.980
And you interview people.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.360
And you interview people
one a day, they just arrive.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.770
You can't interview
them all at once.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.860
And if you delay the
hiring, you suffer

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.570
because you spend
time on hiring,

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.400
and you don't have a
secretary in the middle.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.730
But if you choose very early,
somebody who's not great,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.200
you might be missing on
somebody great down the line.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.402
And actually, there's an
optimal solution for that.

00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:50.110
Because what you really
want to do is you

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.670
want to sample
secretaries for a while

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.240
until you figure
out the distribution

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.100
of quality of people
out there in the world.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.461
And then the moment
you hit somebody

00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:02.460
who passed that threshold,
you should adopt them

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.160
because there's
opportunity cost.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.670
And the big insight from that
problem is opportunity cost.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.740
So what would you rather do?

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.860
Let's say you're a woman, and
you're trying to date a man.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:23.970
And let's say that men are on
one scale between 0 and 10.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.880
And one day, you meet
somebody who's 8 and 1/2.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.530
Do you say yes?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.404
Or do you say let me
search for somebody else?

00:20:32.404 --> 00:20:34.070
In the secretary
problem, the assumption

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.910
is if you throw somebody out,
you can never get them back.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.500
And you keep on sampling.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.040
And what we see happening
is that people don't take

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.890
opportunity cost into account.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.020
So what you need
to think about is,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.990
how much do you enjoy
life in the search

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.530
process versus how much do you
enjoy life when you're dating?

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.040
Hopefully, the dating one
is better than without it.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.470
But assuming this
is the case, there's

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.170
also a cost for
opportunity cost.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.960
Delaying this process by
three years also has a cost.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.760
People don't take the
cost into account.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.990
So there is an equation
of how to figure it out.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.950
I'm not sure people should go
exactly with this equation.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.650
But I do think that we
need to be a bit more

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.090
aware of the opportunity
cost and about the almost

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.760
on-going misery-- for some
people-- of being alone,

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.530
and how we take that
into account as well.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.880
Plus, I'm speaking
for all men, I

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.170
think women should just lower
their standards a little bit.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.530
LOGAN URY: So speaking
of lowering standards,

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.030
what's some of the best
and worst dating advice

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.090
that you've ever heard?

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.179
DAN ARIELY: The best
and worst dating advice.

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:49.595
LOGAN URY: It could also be
for relationships or marriage.

00:21:52.169 --> 00:21:54.210
DAN ARIELY: I'm not sure
if it's a bit of advice.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.340
OK, here's an advice--
ask your mother

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.590
about the person you're
dating and your best friends.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.670
You see, when we fall
in love with somebody,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.600
we're infatuated.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.480
It's an amazing feeling.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.850
And when we have
this amazing feeling,

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.425
we feel this euphoria
and attraction.

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:19.430
And we think this person is
everything about our lives,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.610
and we can't imagine
that anything will ever

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.319
be different.

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:26.360
The sad reality is that
it's a wonderful feeling,

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.510
it just doesn't last that long.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.510
And the question is,
when it goes away,

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.770
what comes in its place?

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.560
And the problem is
that when you're

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.920
infatuated with somebody,
you're really not

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.400
a good judge of the fact that
this feeling will go away.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.740
You're sure that you will
stay with that feeling.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.430
And you're not sure
that this person

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:55.145
has what it takes to have
the long-term aspect.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:57.270
Your mother is probably a
better candidate for that

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.860
because your mother
actually sees the person

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.740
without being infatuated.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:07.030
If you think about what makes
long-term compatibility,

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.990
it's not necessarily
something that you can

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.520
grasp when you're infatuated.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.120
There's a very sad result
that people actually

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.510
don't tell their friends what
they think about the people

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.380
that they're dating.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.800
So I'll tell you
a personal story.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.550
I have a friend, and
he was dating somebody.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.884
And I heard that they broke up.

00:23:30.884 --> 00:23:32.300
And I met him, and
I said, oh, I'm

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.110
so happy you broke up
with this awful woman.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.250
She's just terrible.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.060
Thank god it's over.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.065
And he says, we
just got engaged.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.800
And there are multiple
options, multiple things

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.530
you can say at a
junction like this.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.885
My choice was to say, you idiot!

00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:54.635
And I said, haven't
you talked to anybody?

00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:56.890
Haven't you talked to
any of your friends?

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.350
Everybody hates her.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.310
Haven't you talked to anybody?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.510
Well, we didn't talk
for a long time.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.000
But nobody told him.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.540
It is actually a very hard thing
to tell your friends that you

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.470
hate the person
that they're dating

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.750
or that you think they're
really a bad compatibility.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.880
But it's your
obligation as a friend.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.650
If you really value your
friendship, you have to do it.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.800
So I think, A, give more
advice to your friends.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.690
It would be nice to measure
how many couples break after--

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.591
LOGAN URY: There will be
a survey for everyone.

00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:36.090
DAN ARIELY: And then thinking
about long-term compatibility,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.090
what does that actually mean?

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.800
Have any of you
ever gone canoeing?

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.310
So I'm a big proponent
of the canoeing test

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.600
as a test for relationship.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.610
LOGAN URY: Oh, no.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.750
DAN ARIELY: Did you go
canoeing with someone?

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.725
So here's what
happens in a canoe,

00:24:56.725 --> 00:24:58.600
and I'm not talking
about canoeing on a lake,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.891
we're talking about whitewater.

00:24:59.891 --> 00:25:01.500
It doesn't have
to be very rough,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.120
but some kind of
streaming water.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.340
Now when you're in a
canoe, things happen.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:12.080
You hit a rock, you flip over,
there's a wave, you get wet,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.400
things happen.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.784
And the question is, how much
do you blame the other person?

00:25:17.784 --> 00:25:20.200
There's something called the
fundamental attribution error

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:20.900
in psychology.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.275
The fundamental
attribution error

00:25:22.275 --> 00:25:25.430
is the idea that when
bad things happen to us,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.840
we think it's because
of external events.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.570
When bad things happen
to other people,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.780
we say, they're just clumsy.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:37.162
So if I slip on a banana,
it's because somebody forgot,

00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:38.120
somebody was negligent.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.820
If somebody else slips,
they're just careless.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.480
Now when things happen to
us outside of our control,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.760
when it's for us, we
tend to blame the world.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.010
When it's for other people,
we tend to blame them.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.600
So it's a wonderful opportunity
to basically simulate

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.560
arguments.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.210
You go down canoeing,
bad things will happen.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.760
It doesn't look like
it's your fault.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.460
And now the question is how
you're going to negotiate that.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.430
Are you going to
blame each other?

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.660
Are you going to be
collaborative about it?

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.430
Are you going to take
it in a friendly way?

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.760
When you usually
date, you don't have

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.460
that many things
to argue about, not

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.154
many bad things happen to you.

00:26:18.154 --> 00:26:20.320
If you live in San Francisco,
the most you can argue

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.590
is the Uber is a little late
or something tragic like that.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:34.680
But realize, lots of things
happen outside of your control.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.810
And the real question is how
you're going to manage them.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.360
And something like
a canoeing test

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.655
is going to be an
acceleration for this process.

00:26:43.655 --> 00:26:47.130
So is there a good river
around here to try?

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.850
LOGAN URY: Yeah, some Groupon
sales for canoes will go up.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.450
So I wanted to go back to what
you said about infatuation.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.130
How does that relate
to arranged marriage?

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.800
How does that compare-- love
versus arranged marriage?

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.502
DAN ARIELY: So there's
this very kind of sad,

00:27:01.502 --> 00:27:02.960
kind of interesting
result. This is

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.310
a research in India
comparing love marriages

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.617
and arranged marriages.

00:27:07.617 --> 00:27:09.450
And of course, it's not
a random assignment.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.020
It's not as if you take
two people, say, hey,

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.186
you're an arranged marriage,
you're a love marriage.

00:27:13.186 --> 00:27:18.610
But they look, in general, at
duration of the relationship

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.400
and at happiness.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.370
And what they find,
unsurprisingly,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.150
is, which one starts better?

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.120
The love marriages.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.290
Love marriages start happy.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.390
Arranged marriages start worse.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.590
But what happens over time?

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:37.010
Love marriages go down,
arranged marriages go up.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.080
And they cross in year three.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.210
So in year three, they switch.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.710
Now there are many
reasons for that.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.875
So one thing in India, if you
live in an arranged marriage,

00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:50.820
you're not just marrying
the particular person.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.240
You're marrying into a family.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.220
But also, you have an idea of
what your individual roles are.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.719
So you marry into a family.

00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.260
You have an idea
what your roles are.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.950
There's a responsibility
and so on.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.370
And therefore, things
improve over time.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.110
Where love marriages are
actually very tricky.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.605
Do you know, there's
a term, lesbian death?

00:28:15.605 --> 00:28:16.480
LOGAN URY: Bed death.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.396
DAN ARIELY: Bed death?

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:18.810
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.540
You go ahead.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.240
DAN ARIELY: No, you go, you go.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.022
LOGAN URY: I think
there's a concept that

00:28:24.022 --> 00:28:24.980
has been put out there.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.570
DAN ARIELY: No, no,
there's a lot of research.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.990
Yeah.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.490
LOGAN URY: --that
around year seven

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.009
of a relationship
in a lesbian couple,

00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:31.550
there isn't a lot
of sexual activity.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.930
And they call it
lesbian bed death.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.638
DAN ARIELY: Yeah.

00:28:33.638 --> 00:28:38.596
And it's not so much at year
seven, but it happens early.

00:28:38.596 --> 00:28:42.080
And there was a
paper in, I think,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.460
the "American Sociology Review"
a couple of years ago on this.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.250
And the notion is that
because the relationships are

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.690
not as defined, and
because it's largely

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.920
about equal relationship
or about friendship,

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.700
the romantic aspects
of the relationship

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.840
don't flourish as much.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.400
The friendship does, but
the other ones don't.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.330
And that's actually a
big mystery, I think.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.620
We're moving to a
different realm,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.160
different types of relationships
than we had historically.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.590
And hopefully, we'll get
to be as equal as possible.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:25.850
There's more equality,
more camaraderie,

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.400
all kinds of things.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.050
How do we get that
on one hand and don't

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:34.217
get the cost of that in
terms of passion, romance,

00:29:34.217 --> 00:29:34.800
or the others?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.675
I don't think we have
a good answer for that.

00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:38.710
But it's certainly an
issue to figure out.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.460
LOGAN URY: So I know
you've done some work

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.700
with Ashley Madison, the
infamous site for having

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.710
an affair.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.550
Do you think that's a solution?

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.130
What do you think
about Ashley Madison?

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.980
DAN ARIELY: So I'll tell you
what the CEO of Ashley Madison

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.040
told me when I met him.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.840
So the last couple
of years, we've

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.200
been doing some
research on dishonesty.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.325
Actually, for many years,
we've been doing research

00:30:01.325 --> 00:30:01.908
on dishonesty.

00:30:01.908 --> 00:30:04.540
But we did a documentary
on dishonesty.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.050
And Noel Biderman that was
the CEO of Ashley Madison

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:13.570
before this happened, was one
of the people we interviewed.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:18.380
And he actually had some
interesting observations

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.450
about relationships.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.150
And one of the things
he said was that,

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.800
if women have problems
in the relationship

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.120
and they want to discuss it with
somebody, who do they go to?

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.970
Their women friends.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.300
What about men?

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.950
So how many men here have talked
about relationship problems

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.670
with your male best friends?

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.200
So how many of you
do it regularly?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.930
It's not fair because
very few people

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.040
would raise their
hands when you ask

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.331
a question like this on camera.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.730
But in general, it's
much less likely.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.000
Women have a tight
social network

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.110
where talking about
relationships is common.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.450
Men, stereotypically,
don't do it.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.940
We talk about sports.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.110
But talking about
relationships actually

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.370
helps you change your
relationship or improve things.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:15.720
Talking about sports doesn't
really help in that regard.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.680
And what Noel said
was that, when

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.250
people have an external
partner, that's actually

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.890
an opportunity for men to have
discussions about relationships

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.190
and so on.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.310
Now his hypothesis was that
it actually, in some cases,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.990
helped their relationship.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.870
We never got to test
that hypothesis.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.790
But it's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.790
And of course, the solution
doesn't have to be affairs.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.880
The solution could be, how
do we create support networks

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.710
for men?

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.574
Given that relationships
are more complex,

00:31:50.574 --> 00:31:52.240
not just for women,
but for men as well,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.920
how do we create social
networks for men?

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.720
That we can discuss those
things and have better aspect.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.270
The other thing we learned--
so Ashley Madison, men joined.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.640
You know the site, right?

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.230
The tagline used to be,
at least, "Life is short,

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.140
have an affair."

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.040
And in every zip code,
and in every country

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.450
that they were in, men
joined and women joined.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.910
And the question is, what is
the ratio between men and women?

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.990
So let's just talk
across countries.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.050
What do you think,
across countries,

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:32.030
best predict the
ratio of men to women?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.160
In which type of
countries is the number

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.460
more equal, and in
which countries there

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.314
are more men and fewer women?

00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:40.480
What does it correlate with?

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.396
What would you expect?

00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:43.479
It's a data question.

00:32:43.479 --> 00:32:44.270
AUDIENCE: Religion.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.145
DAN ARIELY: Religion?

00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:45.692
No.

00:32:45.692 --> 00:32:49.497
AUDIENCE: Well, the practices
of getting [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:49.497 --> 00:32:51.080
DAN ARIELY: The
practices-- oh, so you

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.770
think it's about the ratio
of men to women in society.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.700
So where more men--
no, but interesting.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.597
What else?

00:32:57.597 --> 00:32:58.369
AUDIENCE: Income.

00:32:58.369 --> 00:33:00.410
DAN ARIELY: Say more, what
do you mean by income?

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.170
AUDIENCE: So if equivalent
levels make roughly the same,

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.816
more likely to have equal--

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:08.190
DAN ARIELY: That's
exactly right.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.180
So the income gap.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.890
So women, almost everywhere
around the world,

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.470
get paid less than
men for the same job.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.850
As this income gap
is higher, there

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.740
are more men and fewer women.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:24.170
And as the income gap is lower,
the percentage gets closer.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.410
Which suggests that
the demand of women

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.790
for extramarital affairs
is being held back.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.255
You don't think that when
there's a big income gap, all

00:33:33.255 --> 00:33:35.463
of a sudden, the men are
just more wonderful so women

00:33:35.463 --> 00:33:37.530
want to stay with them longer.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:38.720
It's probably the opposite.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.790
But it just means that
something is holding women back

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.920
in that regard.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.162
It's because of
financial insecurity.

00:33:46.162 --> 00:33:47.620
LOGAN URY: So are
there any regions

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.380
of the country where
you've seen a lot of use

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.630
by, particularly, men or women?

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.890
DAN ARIELY: So that
was across the world.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:01.710
If we just look at the
US, the worst place,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:07.530
in terms of the ratio of
high men and very few women,

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.719
is a suburb of Silicon Valley.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.909
And this is across the US.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.020
And the reason for
that is I think

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.440
it represents probably
one of those cases where

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.130
it's a suburb.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.900
Women don't have a job.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.590
They are homemakers, low income.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.570
Men work in Silicon Valley.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.739
They get paid very well.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.510
The income gap is very high.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.050
And that's the recipe.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.760
So we had this discussion
about dating in San Francisco.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.120
How many of you live
in San Francisco?

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.179
So imagine a world in
which you have 101 women.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.580
It's a math problem.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.940
There's 101 women and 100 men.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.610
And we do this experiment.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.010
And we gave everybody $10.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:04.110
And we say, if at the end
of the game, you have money,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.310
you get to keep it as long as
you're paired with somebody

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.360
of the opposition gender.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.820
So if you're a man and
woman, and you're paired up,

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.780
you each get to keep your money.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.480
If you're not paired, the
money goes back to me.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.170
That's rule number one.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.100
And the second rule is
you could buy people.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.970
What does that mean?

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.830
So let's say that Scott
and Logan are together,

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:27.790
and I am alone.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.170
I can say, Logan, I have $10.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:35.402
If I give you $1, would
you drop Scott and join me?

00:35:35.402 --> 00:35:37.860
And the goal of the game is
not to be nice to your partner,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.160
the goal is to make money.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.560
So that's the goal.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.060
So let's say you switch to me.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.332
And then let's say Scott comes
and says he'll offer you $2.

00:35:45.332 --> 00:35:47.790
Now if you move to Scott, it's
not like an engagement ring.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.472
You don't get to keep my $1.

00:35:50.472 --> 00:35:51.430
You give it back to me.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.580
So at each point, if
you switch to somebody,

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.120
you take what they gave you,
but the money you got before,

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.660
you have to return.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.620
So now imagine the game.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.880
101 women, in total,
the women have $1,010.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.510
100 men, in total,
the men have $1,000.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.900
As the game continues,
at the end of the game,

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.290
when nobody's switching anymore,
how much money do the men have?

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.124
And how much money
do the women have?

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.510
What do you think?

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.570
So first of all,
who has more money?

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.826
The men or the women?

00:36:25.826 --> 00:36:27.627
AUDIENCE: Women.

00:36:27.627 --> 00:36:28.210
DAN ARIELY: No

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.580
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
not from San Francisco,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.424
but it seems to me that if
you give them enough time

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.478
to go back and
forth, the men will

00:36:35.478 --> 00:36:37.220
be left with next to nothing.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.650
DAN ARIELY: The men?

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:39.990
No.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.920
So the result is
that the men end up

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.060
with almost all the money.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.400
The women end up with $101.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.140
And the men end up
with everything.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.460
Why?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.080
So you have 100 men, 101 women.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.500
There's one woman alone.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.820
What does she do?

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.580
She goes to a man
and says, hey, I'll

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.160
give you $1 if you switch to me.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.200
The man switches.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.120
Now there's another
woman who's alone.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.750
She goes to another
man, another man.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.800
Eventually, all the men have
$11 and the women have $9.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.260
But there's still a
woman with no partner.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.300
So she continues.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.883
And the game continues,
and continues,

00:37:15.883 --> 00:37:18.100
and continues until
all the women have $1.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.350
Because if there's a woman
with $2 who is alone,

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.160
she will give that
$1 to somebody else

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.520
to switch with her.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.720
So eventually, and what's so
nice about this-- so nice.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.860
So interesting but depressing
thing about this game

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.800
is that you need a very
small asymmetry in the market

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.470
to create a tremendous
asymmetry of power.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:46.800
So think about it-- 100 men, 101
women, tiny level of asymmetry.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.410
What's the asymmetry
in terms of power?

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.190
Incredible.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.380
The men basically
have all the power.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.770
Now think about places
like San Francisco.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.430
Now San Francisco
actually has lots

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.000
of types of dating markets.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.010
But if you think about the
heterosexual dating market,

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.960
and you ask, what's the
ratio of men to women?

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.620
Or if you're not politically
correct, you could say,

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.270
what's the ratio
of dateable men--

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.960
what's the
expression-- to women?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.840
And if that ratio is such
that there are fewer men,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.015
then the power relationship
changes dramatically.

00:38:26.775 --> 00:38:27.400
LOGAN URY: Wow.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.130
DAN ARIELY: That's
a little depressing.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.171
LOGAN URY: Well, it sounds
like from your advice,

00:38:30.171 --> 00:38:31.790
we shouldn't live
in San Francisco

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.790
or a suburb of Silicon Valley.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.010
We should all go canoeing
with our partners.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.700
We should have
arranged marriages.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.330
DAN ARIELY: By the
way, suburbs is OK.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.288
You don't want to stay.

00:38:42.288 --> 00:38:43.830
You want to have
an equal income.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.190
LOGAN URY: OK, so equal
income wherever you live.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:50.920
And that we should opt for
the 35-minute colonoscopies.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.330
So with that in mind, let's
open it up to questions.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.560
And Scott's going
to take the mic.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.850
AUDIENCE: In the experiment you
described, 101 women and 100

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.810
men, this goes
with the assumption

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.570
there is perfect
knowledge of the system.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:09.080
How does it work in imperfect
knowledge systems, which

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.750
is the most real-world case?

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.500
DAN ARIELY: Yeah.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.330
So when we run this
experiment, by the way,

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.130
I usually run it with my
students on Valentine's Day.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.170
So I take my students,
and usually, there's

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:24.180
more than this number, and
there's never equal number.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.922
And it takes a
little bit of time,

00:39:25.922 --> 00:39:27.130
but the market solves itself.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.830
But of course, at any point in
time, you know if you're alone,

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.995
and you see who else is there,
the moment you're alone,

00:39:33.995 --> 00:39:36.480
you ask to break people up.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.300
And also, in the real
market, not everybody

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.810
wants to break up.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:46.520
So every time you have friction,
this effect will go down.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.150
So if we have loyalty.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.280
If somebody pairs
up with somebody,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.850
and even if they could
have somebody better,

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:58.370
they don't want to switch, this
creates friction in the system.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.940
So every time there's friction
for either reasons of loyalty

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.040
or lack of information and so
on, the effect will be less.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.680
But it doesn't mean
it will go away.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.109
It would just be
a smaller effect.

00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:11.900
AUDIENCE: When I think
of being predictably

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.750
irrational in the
context of relationships,

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.500
I immediately think
of "Men are from Mars,

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.439
Women are from Venus," a lot
of these paradigmatic problems

00:40:18.439 --> 00:40:20.480
of why we argue with each
other is because we try

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.450
and give the other person the
type of love and affection

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:22.990
that we need.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.580
And we don't understand
where they're coming from,

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.930
we misinterpret
what they're saying.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.670
I'm just curious if
you have any comments

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.670
about that general area.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.628
I don't know how much of
those pieces of advice

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:32.760
have actually been
put into practice,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.100
or if there are underlying
psychological mechanisms that

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.045
explain them more.

00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:37.670
Because that still
seems like something

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.383
that is underappreciated
in relationships.

00:40:40.383 --> 00:40:41.150
DAN ARIELY: Yeah.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.520
And I think the research on
that has not been that great.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.860
But we know, for example, that
people fight a lot about money.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.860
And fighting about
money is fighting

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.580
about priorities in life.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:01.135
And some of those fights,
people don't really

00:41:01.135 --> 00:41:02.760
understand what
they're fighting about.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.801
They're not understanding
that this pair of shoes

00:41:04.801 --> 00:41:07.400
is not really about the shoes,
or that this beer is not

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.190
about this beer.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.320
So how do you give
people some freedom,

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.706
and some control,
and some joint goals,

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:16.830
is something we don't know.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.230
I'm actually very
hopeful that we

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:22.470
need some technological
solutions for that.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.270
So people are going
to be different.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.740
And there's a question of, what
is the best way for couples

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.930
to manage their
money, for example,

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.930
in a way that gives them
some individual freedom

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.950
without getting upset with
the other person, but also

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.119
some commonality in
terms of their goals?

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:40.160
And I think there's all
kinds of interesting ways

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.190
to think about, how would
we design joint checking

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.670
accounts, and separate
accounts, and how much would we

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.100
put in each of those
if we wanted people

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.090
to at least not
fight about money?

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.199
So I think we have to
recognize that there

00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:55.240
are going to be fights
about all kinds of things.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.950
And I'm not sure we
can always explain

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.980
every fight, what it is about,
but how do we prevent those?

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.830
One of the nicest differences
that we know about

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.400
between men and
women is actually

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.050
in dating, not in
a relationship.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.710
So you all know what
speed dating is about?

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.590
Let's say there are
10 men and 10 women.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.210
And they talk to one
person for five minutes.

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.780
Then we ring a bell,
all the men switch.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.110
They talk to another person,
another bell, they switch.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.150
And at the end, they
give you a list.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.340
And they say, from
the 10 people I met,

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:38.210
these are the four or five I
want to meet for a second date.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.300
So imagine two
speed dating events.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.990
One has 10 men and 10 women.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:46.640
And the other one has
20 men and 20 women.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.014
Now what happens to the number
of people you say yes to?

00:42:51.014 --> 00:42:52.680
What happens to the
number of people you

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.980
say I want to meet them again?

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.590
It could have two models.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.300
You can have a
model that says, I'm

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.310
going to pick the top
three or the top x.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.440
And if you have that
model, it wouldn't

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.490
change whether you meet
10 people or 20 people

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.940
because you just pick the top x.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.270
Or you could say,
I have a threshold.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:14.010
I'm going to pick
everybody who's above 8.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.255
And then, of course,
if you pick above 8,

00:43:16.255 --> 00:43:19.300
when you move from 10 to 20,
there'll be twice as many--

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.676
on expectation-- people
who pass the threshold.

00:43:22.676 --> 00:43:24.050
So what do you
think happens when

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:29.980
people move from a small speed
dating event to a large one?

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.190
Do they have, let's call
it the budget approach,

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.780
where they have a top x?

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.460
Or do they have the
threshold approach,

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.824
which says everybody above 8?

00:43:39.824 --> 00:43:41.240
AUDIENCE: Somewhere
in the middle.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.740
DAN ARIELY: Somewhere
in the middle?

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.930
AUDIENCE: They probably
say yes to more people,

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.310
but not on a one-to-one ratio.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.830
DAN ARIELY: OK.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.011
So every time you listen to a
talk, think about the question

00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:52.510
before.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.690
You just asked me about
gender differences, right?

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.140
So there's a gender
difference here as well.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.920
So men and women
are very different.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.660
Women basically behave
as if they have a budget.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.850
So when the group
becomes larger,

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.890
women just become more
critical or more restrictive.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:11.330
They just say yes to--
their threshold goes up.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.010
And men say yes to the
same-- they have a threshold.

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:14.890
Everybody over 8.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.080
So their number
basically doubles.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.380
So this is actually one
of the biggest differences

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.160
we've documented in dating.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.410
Sorry.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.280
AUDIENCE: So going
off of that point,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.190
I have a question about
the new Tinder world

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:31.260
that we're all living in.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.430
So I think I totally agree with
what you said earlier about how

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:37.144
the mentality with having
Tinder and Hinge as an option,

00:44:37.144 --> 00:44:39.310
whether or not you're on
those apps, it's just grass

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.185
is always greener, one
foot in, one foot out.

00:44:41.185 --> 00:44:44.950
I think one argument for
using the apps is that it's

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.560
more exposure to more people.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.780
So I'm not going to meet
as many people in a bar

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.480
as I would if I decide
to swipe on Hinge.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.460
But I think what you
just said about how,

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.060
does it just make women so
much more critical if you're

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.040
given so many more options?

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.360
So do you think that in the
context of Hinge or Tinder,

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.010
it's better to be given
more exposure to more people

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.400
so that your chances
are technically higher?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.950
Or are you just
infinitely more critical

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.575
that it's not going to have a
positive outcome either way?

00:45:17.575 --> 00:45:18.283
DAN ARIELY: Yeah.

00:45:18.283 --> 00:45:24.880
So what is the percentage of men
that you see on Hinge or Tinder

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.320
that you're proposing to
them to go for coffee?

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.320
AUDIENCE: Me personally?

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:29.660
DAN ARIELY: Yeah.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.710
AUDIENCE: It's very minimal.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.501
DAN ARIELY: No, no.

00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:33.370
What is it?

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:35.850
Are we talking 10%,
1%, a fraction?

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.560
AUDIENCE: I think I'm 2%.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.474
DAN ARIELY: 2%.

00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:39.890
AUDIENCE: And I'm
not even asking.

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:40.950
I'll say yes if they ask.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:41.840
DAN ARIELY: You what?

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.090
AUDIENCE: Maybe I will agree,
but I'm probably not one

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.410
to proactively reach out.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:49.950
DAN ARIELY: So let's say you see
1,000 people on Tinder, which

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.490
is probably like 30 minutes.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.590
And how many of those
do you think, of 1,000,

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.066
you say yes to 20?

00:45:59.066 --> 00:45:59.690
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.730
Uh, yes, yes, maybe more.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.080
But yes, let's say.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.910
DAN ARIELY: 50 out of 1,000?

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.080
So that's half a percent.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.860
OK, so listen.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.310
The fact is that
in online dating--

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.510
I haven't seen the results from
Tinder-- but in online dating,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:20.010
people reject most people.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:24.420
When you go to speed dating,
people say yes to more than 20%

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.535
of the people they meet.

00:46:25.535 --> 00:46:27.110
It's kind of shocking.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:27.731
20%.

00:46:27.731 --> 00:46:29.355
You're talking 2%,
you're talking half.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.390
Part of the problem
is that in these apps,

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:40.110
we don't describe people in
a way that tells us anything

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.570
about how to consume them.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.620
But in general, what does it
mean to be with that person?

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.450
Imagine that the way we
describe food in restaurants

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.960
is describing them
by their ingredients.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:00.130
You have this grams of protein,
and this number of vitamin D.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:03.400
And how much would that give
you any sense about what

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.310
the food is like?

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.340
0.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.330
So now I think
about online dating.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.140
We describe to you
people by their height,

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.330
and weight, and
religion, and so on.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:19.360
In what way is it
giving you any insight

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.760
about what this person would be
like to go on a canoeing trip

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.800
with?

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.000
Not that much.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.620
So what happened is
you're very risk averse,

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:32.080
because the description of
the product is so mediocre.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.450
So you change your threshold.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:38.090
So in the spirit
of giving people

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.690
the sense that all that
matters is the picture,

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.100
I think we're misclassifying
lots of people.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.840
And we have the Indian
experiment, but how many of you

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.830
went to college in the US?

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.790
How many of you became
really good friends

00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:00.910
with some of the people
that you shared a room with?

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:01.950
Now think about it.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.730
This is the American version
of arranged marriages.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:09.270
Nobody said, oh, let's go
through six months dating

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.120
and then put you in
a room with somebody.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.420
It's kind of a random process.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.110
Maybe they look at a
few characteristics.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.720
But lots of people report
that they got into a room

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.500
with somebody and eventually
ended up loving that person.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.020
Now if you met this person,
would you predict it?

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:24.990
Not so much.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.880
Here's an experiment we did.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.670
Imagine we do it to you.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:33.250
Imagine I ask you for a list of
20 of your best friends and 20

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.810
people you like so-so.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:39.560
And then these 40
people, I ask them

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.750
to fill up their
online dating platform

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:46.272
on whatever, Match.com.

00:48:46.272 --> 00:48:48.730
And then I give those 40 to
you without the picture, so you

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.938
don't know exactly who it is.

00:48:49.938 --> 00:48:50.970
You don't know the name.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.350
And then I say,
hey, we have people

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:53.933
here that we think
you'll like, and we

00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:56.450
have people that we think
you will not like so much.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.940
How well do you think you'll
be able to sort them out?

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.590
It's terrible.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.460
It's basically random.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.980
Think about your best friends.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.150
If they were online
dating, and you

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.140
would look at their
profile, what would it

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.015
be about them that you'd
say, oh my goodness,

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:14.930
I want to be friends with
this person for 20 years.

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:19.420
Is it their height,
eye color, BMI?

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.630
I mean, what?

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.070
It's kind of crazy.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.630
And this is actually,
I think, a good point

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.320
to think about at Google.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.740
Why do we describe people
this way in online dating?

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.760
Because it's easy.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.220
It's meaningless
from the perspective

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.150
of predicting who you would
actually like or don't like.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.311
But it's easy to do, and
it's easy to search on.

00:49:43.311 --> 00:49:45.560
But just because it's easy
to do and easy to search on

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.300
doesn't mean it's
the right mechanism.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.210
Look, I want people
to find love.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:55.290
It's a wonderful thing.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:57.030
We should promote that.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.420
But the companies who
are doing it, I think,

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.500
are taking tremendous shortcuts.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.310
They're trying to do things that
are easy rather than effective.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:07.629
And it's a real shame.

00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:09.170
LOGAN URY: So what
question would you

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.170
ask that you think would
actually be predictive?

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:21.740
DAN ARIELY: So I think I would
not ask questions, actually.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.230
So let's think
about online dating.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:26.820
What is the process of this?

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.520
Is the process screening?

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.670
Here are all the people
I don't look like.

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:31.809
I think that's OK.

00:50:31.809 --> 00:50:33.350
I think you could
basically say, here

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.650
are the people I
would never like.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.140
And I don't think we even need
to show them to you to know

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.308
that you don't like them.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.160
So we did a study in which
we said, look, dating

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.120
is a very special thing.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.042
Dating is actually going
through a shared experience.

00:50:51.042 --> 00:50:52.500
And through this
shared experience,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.410
you get to do something.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.250
So we did a speed dating
event in an old people home.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:02.094
This was not for sexual
activity, necessarily,

00:51:02.094 --> 00:51:03.760
but we wanted people
to meet each other.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.470
They just moved to
an old people home.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.670
And the first time
we did it was a bust.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:11.540
They were just sitting there,
like, what do you talk about?

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.210
And then we asked them to
bring a meaningful object

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.040
from their life.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.480
And the discussions
were amazing.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.900
And people got engaged, and
shared experience, and so on.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:28.330
So if I was doing online
dating, I would say,

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.682
I want to do something where
people will share an experience

00:51:31.682 --> 00:51:33.640
in a quick and efficient
way so they don't have

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.640
to travel a long
distance and so on,

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.350
but it will give them a sense of
what the other person is like.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.470
So would it be solving
a puzzle together?

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.210
Or would it be listening
to music together?

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.710
It could be all kinds of things.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.120
Facing moral dilemmas
of what do you do.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.620
I think all of
those things would

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:58.200
be more effective than
something like this.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.270
So I think we're
confusing two things.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.480
There's the sorting
mechanism that

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.520
says there's too many
people, let me just focus

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.430
on the group I care about.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:08.180
But when you say the
group you care about,

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.330
it's probably a large group.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:12.840
You shouldn't sort it
too much because you miss

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.390
some really wonderful people.

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:19.060
And then we need a
different procedure.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.880
I had an idea once.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.880
How many people here
think that you're not

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.570
that good in making
first impressions?

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:30.490
OK, quite a few of us.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.910
Online dating
right now is really

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:35.350
built for people who could go
to and pick up people in a bar.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.060
It's not very different.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.820
Imagine if you had a dating
website only for people

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.310
who don't do well in
first impressions,

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.920
and you had a
different procedure.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.220
And you say, you know what?

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.340
Let's agree that
meeting somebody

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.210
for coffee for 15 minutes
is not really the solution.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:54.100
Let's agree that we'll meet for
three times over three weeks.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:56.070
We'll not come up to
judgments too early.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.460
And let's try to
create something

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.770
where people actually--

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:02.660
I'm not recommending
the dorm experience

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.930
where you're locked with
somebody for a semester,

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.290
but let's make something
where you actually

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:11.700
are committed to finding
out something about somebody

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.230
for a while rather than having
these quick judgments which

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.880
I think are awful.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.080
Not so good.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.360
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the Ashley Madison episode.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.680
And I read an article
after that came out

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.490
that like 90% of the female
accounts were actually faked.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:29.170
They were basically
just employees

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:32.380
of the company that were
talking to men as-- I mean,

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.460
it fits with your
thesis of conversation.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.670
But I'm wondering, do you
think the trend still holds?

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.154
Or is it just that all
these female accounts

00:53:42.154 --> 00:53:43.820
existed in rich
countries because that's

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.070
where the employees made them?

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:49.280
DAN ARIELY: So we looked only
at active accounts [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:49.900
accounts.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.500
And we had data so we
could separate this.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.130
Our estimation of how
many accounts were fake

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.670
was very different than
what other people had.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.160
But we looked at
active accounts that I

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.270
don't think people made up.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:06.980
We also had
geographic variation.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.280
So we could tell
you by zip code.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.930
So we could tell
you that Palo Alto

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:13.499
is different than Los Gatos.

00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:14.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.540
I would just like
to know if there's

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:19.520
any sites and relationship
differences between regions

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.490
where there's more tropical
weather, where you have more

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.890
body exposure, and in places
where colder weather would

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:27.890
have less body exposure.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.730
Because there's less
filling the gaps,

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.290
leaving it to the
imagination, at least

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:35.720
in a physical perspective.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.320
DAN ARIELY: Yeah,
so the site that

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.530
leaves the least amount
of room for imagination

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:43.250
is called Manhunt.

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:46.230
I don't know if you've
been on that site,

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.960
but it's really an amazing site.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:58.170
When we did this,
we did some work.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:01.620
So you know what's
called labor analysis?

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.700
Labor analysis is
an analysis in which

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.550
I take all your individual
characteristics-- your height,

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:10.800
your weight, your education,
all kinds of things--

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.460
and I regress it on your salary.

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.050
And this is the kind of
research you do to find out

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:17.540
what is the income gap.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.270
That men make more money
for the same job holding

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.100
everything else equal.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.250
So we did the same
analysis for online dating.

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.900
We said, let's look at you
and all your characteristics,

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.980
and let's find what makes you
attractive in online dating.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.770
And one of the things we
found was that women really

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.410
care about men's what?

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:40.560
Height.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.920
Actually, tremendously so.

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.210
So I'm 5' 9".

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:48.140
If I wanted to be as successful
as somebody who is 5'

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.270
10" in online dating,
how much more money

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.510
would I have to make a year?

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:56.053
What do you guess?

00:55:56.053 --> 00:55:58.510
AUDIENCE: $10,000.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.140
DAN ARIELY: It's about $40.

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.230
It's about $40.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.700
Now just to be
clear, you can ask,

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:08.230
are women really
that superficial?

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:11.440
And the answer is yes and no.

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.150
Partially, the
website, of course,

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.630
gets women to search on height.

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:18.450
So if you search and you say,
I want somebody who's 5' 10",

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.350
you'll never see somebody who's
a real sweetheart but 5' 9".

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:25.290
So sometimes, search
actually can take something

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:29.920
that people have as a bias or as
a tendency, and exaggerate it.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.330
But anyway, women care
a lot about height.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:35.400
By the way, men care
a lot about BMI.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.910
And how much would
a woman with a BMI

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:41.050
of, let's say 21, how
much more would she

00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:48.034
have to make to be as attractive
as a woman who has a BMI of 20?

00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:49.797
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:56:49.797 --> 00:56:51.880
DAN ARIELY: We can't
estimate it because men don't

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.240
care how much money women make.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.120
Anyway, so this guy
called me up from Manhunt.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.680
And he said, look, the online
dating markets on Match

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.180
or whatever it is
confuses two things.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.490
There's some people who are
there for the long term,

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.590
and some people there
for the short term.

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.740
And he said, let's
look at a website that

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.700
just focuses on the short term.

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:18.690
So he gave me his
password for Manhunt.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.970
And it's an amazing website
because they basically

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:25.720
don't even show a picture
of the whole body.

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.570
It's kind of-- uh.

00:57:30.615 --> 00:57:31.114
Um.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.975
So there are cultural
differences about what part

00:57:37.975 --> 00:57:39.790
you show.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.990
But I actually think it's
complex because it also

00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.320
shows something about
what kind of relationship

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.054
you want, long-term, short-term,
other things like that as well.

00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:51.720
LOGAN URY: That's a
good note to end on.

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.470
DAN ARIELY: Is it?

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:53.690
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:56.730
So thank you all for
coming, and thank you, Dan.

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:58.280
[APPLAUSE]
