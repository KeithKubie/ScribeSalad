00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.740
That's the basic HTTP request, now let's talk

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.460
a little about HTTP responses. Let's talk about where

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.040
we are first. You've got you and your machine

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.290
and you've got these servers. Your browser makes a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.690
request to the servers, and your server sends

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.150
back the response. We talked about the requests already,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.250
and the server responds with, a response, the document

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.230
that you requested or, you know, information about the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.280
document depending on what you requested. A basic HTTP response

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.235
looks actually very similar to the request. For a basic

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:34.656
request that looks like this, the response might look something

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:38.250
like this. Okay, so we can see a couple easy

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.970
things. First of all the stat, this is called the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.690
status line. And this is analogous to the request line

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.640
we had over here. Now the version of the status

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.380
line matches the version of the request line, and then

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.310
it's followed by two other pieces of information. One is

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.160
the status code and the other is the reason phrase. And

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.600
this is just an English language description of the status

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.092
code. There are some really common status codes and I'll I'll

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:05.892
show you some of them here. 200 OK, that means,

00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.674
the document is found. This is a far and away the

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:11.695
most common status code on the internet and hopefully we'll be

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:15.675
seeing a lot of these. 302 found that means the document

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.990
is located somewhere else. 404 not found you've probably seen

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.419
this one a lot, this means the document wasn't found.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.250
And 500 server error, that means the server broke trying

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.110
to handle your request. Unfortunately we will probably also be

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.450
seeing a fair number of these in our adventures in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.720
this course. Status codes basically begin with one, two, three,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.400
four or five. If it begins with a two, it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.740
basically means success, if it begins with a three, it basically

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.450
means we need to do something different

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.046
technically to find this document. Four means there

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:47.890
is an error on the browser side,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
requesting a document that doesn't exist, for example,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.420
and five means there's an error on

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.488
the server side, such as, the server's broken.

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:59.990
Okay, let's let's move on a little bit and talk a little more about responses.
