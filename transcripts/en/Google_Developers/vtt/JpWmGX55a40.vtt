TIMOTHY JORDAN: So this is
a talk about Glass--

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.070
in specific, building new
experiences for Glass.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.330
I'm Timothy Jordan--

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.970
that's me.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.320
Hi.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.220
I'm a developer advocate
at Google on Glass.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.945
If you want to get in touch
online after this, go ahead

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:25.530
and check out
google.com/+timothyjordan.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.740
So what are we going to
talk about today?

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.990
Project Glass, of course, which
is part of Google X, the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.960
moonshot factory at Google.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.050
Moonshots are these radical
ideas for changing the world

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.600
and improving the way
that we live.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.980
For more on Google X and
moonshots, you really should

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.620
check out Astro's
talk tomorrow.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.840
He'll be here in
the afternoon.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.360
This particular moonshot,
Project Glass, is about our

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.510
relationship to technology.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.680
It's about technology that's
there when you want it but out

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740
of the way when you don't.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.420
What do I mean by that?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.340
Last night I went
to this event.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.150
How many of us went to
parties last night?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.800
Just a few?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.880
OK, everyone.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.010
So as people were taking
the stage,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.205
this weird thing happened.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.240
And it happens at South By,
but it happens at other

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.890
places, too-- all of these
screens went up into the air.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.710
Tablets and phones--

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.440
all of these things mediating
these people's experience with

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.750
what was in front of them.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.870
It's weird because it felt like
they were watching the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.810
screens instead of the event.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.400
I mean, we all love technology
and what it can give us-- the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.080
ability to take and
share pictures--

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.870
but it feels like tech is often
getting in the way more

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.590
than it needs to.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.860
And that's what we're addressing
with Project Glass.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.790
It's so that you can still have
access to the technology

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.780
that you love but it doesn't
take you out of the moment.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.500
I'm going to play a video.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.545
Many of you have already seen
this video, but I want to play

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:57.760
it because I love it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.960
But also, it's really good at
showing you what it's like to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.210
wear Glass.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.430
Oops, I think I need to hook
in a cable for the video.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.680
OK, that'll take
just a second.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.275
How is everyone?

00:02:14.275 --> 00:02:17.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:19.225
AUDIENCE: Do you see anything
with those glasses right now?

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:21.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I will answer
those questions in a moment.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.140
Why don't I tell you a joke?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.200
This is a joke that I've been
thinking about a lot lately

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.300
because we've been
doing demos.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.690
You want to hear it?

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.855
It's a computer science joke.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.690
So a mechanical engineer, an
electrical engineer, and a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.330
computer scientist are riding
along in a car and the car

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.600
starts making this really
funny noise.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.160
And the mechanical engineer's
like, well, why

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.350
don't we pull over?

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.760
I'm going to pop the hood and
hit it with a big old hammer.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.780
The electrical engineer says,
that's kind of crazy.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.470
How about we pull over and
I'll hook up my computer.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.170
We'll see what code it's
giving and we'll

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.366
know what to do then.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:58.590
The computer scientist
says, oh, all that is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.020
just so much work.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.340
We're going to stop the car,
turn it off, get out, get back

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.355
in, turn it on, and see if it's
still making the noise.

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:10.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.028
I think we have audio.

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:29.205
It's OK.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.830
So this is the idea, that by
bringing technology closer we

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.006
can get it more out
of the way.

00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:40.360
It seems a little ironic and
it's a bit of a crazy idea but

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.520
that's why it's a moonshot.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.130
All right.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.620
So let me frame this talk
just a little bit.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.900
For more information on the
product, Glass, go to

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.390
google.com/glass.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.500
We've got a bunch of information
up there.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.820
Today, I'm going to be talking
to developers, those

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.930
interested in building new
experiences for Glass.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.440
So for the rest of this session,
I'm going to be

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.730
talking about APIs and
building with Glass.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.380
And you might ask, why are we
doing this now, because we're

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.020
not selling Glass and we're not
releasing any APIs today.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.230
In fact, I should let you
know-- we're not done.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.700
It's early days yet, and some
things that you see today

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.830
could change before we
release the API.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.590
But we're here because at
South by Southwest, it's

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.190
filled with builders and
visionaries and thinkers and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.180
the conversation that you have
out in the public is an

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.260
inspiration to us as we continue
to work on Glass.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.890
So we want your feedback and
we want to kickstart the

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.830
conversation with some more
information about how these

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.460
APIs are going to work.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.350
Does that sound like fun?

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.222
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:06:43.222 --> 00:06:44.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.250
Let me talk a little bit more
about that conversation,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.350
because I think this is
a really key point.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.220
So at Google I/O last year, we
had people sign up for what we

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.460
called the Explorer program
and it was a chance to get

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.310
early access to Glass.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.350
As they came up and they signed
up, we gave them a

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.390
glass bar, something that looked
a little bit like this.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.570
And I was so excited.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.410
They gave me one, too.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.955
This is mine and I'm
number 2182.

00:07:09.955 --> 00:07:12.100
It's a high number, I know.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.040
I went home and I took a photo
of this glass bar and I put it

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.830
on Google+.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.310
I posted it to all my friends.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.860
I posted it publicly so that
everybody could see how

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.520
excited I was.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.300
And it was interesting.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.500
This weird thing happened right
after that-- we started

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.240
seeing a whole bunch of these
photos go up, and people were

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.380
doing this crazy thing.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.450
They weren't just taking a photo
of the bar or talking

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.680
about the Explorer program--

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.040
they put the bar out there where
they live and took a

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.110
photo, or in front of the people
that they love, or in

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.110
front of things that they care
about, or the places that made

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.360
them feel home.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.620
And it was then that we started
to figure out that

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.020
this was more than just
a group of people

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.810
signing up for a device.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.060
It was a bunch of people
that wanted

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.380
to be part of something.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.470
OK.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.790
This is going to be kind of
crazy, but I'm going to ask

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.440
you a few questions.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.570
Maybe the people up here and
I'll repeat you say.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.530
Why did you come to this
session today?

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.259
AUDIENCE: I knew about the
technology and I wanted to see

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:15.452
it in person.

00:08:15.452 --> 00:08:17.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You wanted
to see the technology.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.890
What else?

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.330
Anyone, just shout it out.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.105

going to change UX.

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:25.040

it's going to change user

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.670

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.080
Yes?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.690
AUDIENCE: Learn something new
we don't already know about.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Learn something
new that you don't

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.270
already know about.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.959
Yeah, what else?

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.987
AUDIENCE: Wanted to be
on your spank bank.

00:08:33.987 --> 00:08:35.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I don't know
what that means, so I'm not

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.510
going to repeat it.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.770
Over here?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.206
AUDIENCE: Get to try
Google Glass.

00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:43.909
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You won't get
to try Google Glass today.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.220
Come on, seriously--
what else?

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.573
AUDIENCE: Because this is
the next thing, right?

00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:50.968
We're going from-- technology
is getting closer

00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:51.926
and closer to us.

00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:54.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Technology is
getting closer and closer to

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.920
us and this is the next thing.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.570
It's where things are going.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.900
Do something great.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.990
Now the thing is that I have
this conversation a lot, and

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.990
there's a couple new
things today.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.700
Again, I don't know what
you said, but I--

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.216
AUDIENCE: He wants to
be close to you.

00:09:12.216 --> 00:09:14.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.600
There's a few things that come
up time and time again.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.540
How is this going to
change the user

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.070
experience and what's next?

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.070
People keep talking about the
future of technology.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.070
And that's the thing is that
we as a group, we're the

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.150
pioneers that get to decide how
this fits into our lives.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.620
And with your help,
we can do that.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.100
This is about a conversation of
all of us together thinking

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.950
about this new generation of
technology, thinking about

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.430
something that doesn't
compete with but

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.840
blends into your life.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.670
After all, this is the future
that we're talking about, and

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.410
that's where we're going to
start, that one big theme,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.590
that we're building new
paradigms for how technology

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.700
and information works
for people.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.870
So let's start there.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.850
These are the four things
that we're going

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.780
to talk about today.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.120
I'm going to give you a demo.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.530
That's exciting, no?

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.010
OK.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.710
It's exciting for me.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.580
I'm going to show you a demo
and I'm going to give you a

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.170
quick look at the Glass
UI live onstage.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.610
We're going to look at the
Google Mirror API.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.610
I'm going to give you a sneak
peek of what's going to be

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.515
available to developers.

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:26.030
It's not everything, but
a quick overview.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.730
And then we're going to go
through some guidelines.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.580
These are things that we've
learned developing with Glass

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.260
over the last many,
many months.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.440
And these rules are going to
help us all sort of navigate

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.030
this new technology.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.630
And then finally, I'm going to
go through some great examples

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.820
of new experiences that
we've been building

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.700
with some of our friends.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.230
Sound like fun?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.514
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:49.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [CHUCKLE]

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.160
There's so many of you.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.970
OK, demo.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.460
Now, this is going to
be interesting.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.840
I was talking with the
folks back home--

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.240
I really wanted to show y'all
what it was like, what I was

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.730
seeing on Glass specifically.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.890
To experience Glass, you really
need to put it on but

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.250
I'm going to give you an
overview and do my best to

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.490
give you the feeling
live today.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.200
To do it, we had to
do some hacking.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.000
I've got a cable connected to
this demo device, the specific

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.920
device I'll be using for demos,
and it's going to

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.630
transit my screen through
the laptop and on there.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.790
It's going to be a little bit
more choppy and it's going to

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.040
be a little delayed.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.080
It's way more swift and smooth
actually on Glass.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.355
But the team wouldn't let me
bring 1,000 to Texas, so this

00:11:39.355 --> 00:11:40.605
is what we've got to do.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.130
All right.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.820
Let me set this up.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.405
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:47.655
Hopefully it'll be fun.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:53.960
Ooh.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.510
OK, I think it's
going to work.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:56.860
All right.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.780
So first off, when I put on
Glass, notice that it's not in

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.660
my line of sight.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.390
That's really key.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.290
Now, you've probably seen a
few people walking around

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.500
South By wearing Glass.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.630
And you'll notice that none
of them have it right in

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.032
front of their eye.

00:12:10.032 --> 00:12:12.850
And that's really important
because as I'm wearing Glass,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.030
I still want to be able to
connect with you and make eye

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.320
contact, and I also don't
want anything in the

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.770
way of what I'm doing.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.150
But we want Glass in our field
of vision, so all I have to do

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.430
is look up quickly and
there's the screen.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.520
So on the side here,
as you may have

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.740
guessed, is a touch pad.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.190
I'm going to go ahead and tap on
that and it's going to take

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.540
me to the home screen.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.100
If I go ahead and slide
down, it'll dismiss--

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.230
kind of like the back button
on your Android phone.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.100
And it can also hear me.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.475
OK, Glass, Google, how do you
say thank you in Japanese?

00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:56.000
Oh, arigato.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.410
So you'll see that--

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.130
you can clap as much
as you want.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.190
It's totally fine.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:05.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So that was
a live Google search right

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.060
there, and it gave me a
result on the screen

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.620
that I could see.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.910
And it also said to me how
to pronounce arigato.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.000
You didn't hear it because that
was audio just for me.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.890
You notice I don't have anything
in my ear so I still

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.610
hear all the ambient audio
around me, but I can also hear

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.265
something from Glass.

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:24.170
All right.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.597
Do you mind if I
take a picture?

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:26.094
AUDIENCE: Go for it.

00:13:26.094 --> 00:13:30.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, so
we'll do this one.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.010
OK, Glass, take a picture.

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:39.070
Hey, there we are.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.880
So you'll notice I can turn
Glass on by looking

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.670
up like I just did.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.320
And if I want, I can scroll
to that photo.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.980
And if I do a quick, hey, how
you doing, it'll nudge the

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.470
screen to dismiss it.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.340
So with these input options--
voice, touch on the side, and

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.690
some basic head gestures--

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.560
I can control Glass in just
about any situation.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.920
Let's do a couple more things.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.740
So I'm going to go to that
picture I just took.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.900
I'm here at the home screen.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.890
I'm going to slide forward.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.760
There's that picture--

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.710
don't you all look wonderful?

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.750
I'm going to tap right
on that picture,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.690
and I get card options.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.210
Now, this picture is
a timeline card.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.020
And on there, when I tap, I
can get options, including

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.210
Share and Delete.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.130
I'm going to choose Share and
I'm going to share it with my

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.380
friends on Google+.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.630
Done.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.980
These timeline cards, there's
a bunch of them.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.140
Sidney's taking some photos--

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.050
I'm getting some updates
from him.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.810
You'll notice that I
have his picture,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.880
I've got the arigato--

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.510
these are things that have
happened in time.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.510
We're going backward in time
as I swipe forward.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.060
If I swipe backward, we go
forward in time, or to the

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.920
left, and I can swipe all
the way over here to

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.880
some Google Now cards.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.870
You can see that I've
got the weather and

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.950
I've got some places.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.770
Now a note about this
special card.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.650
You'll notice it has a fold
in the upper right.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.010
If I tap on a card like this,
it expands into more items.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.160
In this case, it's the
three day forecast.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.950
If I swipe down, I'll kind
of back out of that.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.355
This is what we call a bundle.

00:15:24.355 --> 00:15:25.010
All right.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.570
Now I think there's enough
terminology for now.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.660
We've got the timeline, swipe
forward to go back in time,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.930
swipe the other way to
go to things that are

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.490
happening right now.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.640
At any moment I can swipe
down and tap and

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.890
I'm at the home screen.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.690
Does that all make sense?

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.570
Super simple, right?

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.420
All right.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.880
We're going to come back
to this, I promise.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.130
We're going to do more.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.000
But first, let's talk through
a few more things.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.050
Let's talk about the
Google Mirror API.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.100
This is the first time that
we're talking about the Google

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.520
Mirror API, and I have to say
I'm really excited to actually

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.380
start talking about this
in the public.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.260
We built the Google Mirror API
so people could build Glass

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.710
services quickly and easily.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.732
It's not complex.

00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:23.460
This is my fancy diagram.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.640
It's got three things on it.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.220
The only important thing for
this talk is this section over

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.220
here, because that's all
you have to build for.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.070
The Google Mirror API is a cloud
API and it works with

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.400
RESTful Services, OAuth2,
and we transport the

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.920
data through JSON.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.110
So a quick few questions
for you.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.270
We're going to know pretty
quickly how many engineers we

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.370
have in the audience.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.950
Who is familiar with OAuth2?

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.290
Ooh, a lot of you--
that's great.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.580
Who is familiar with REST?

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.630
Also a lot of you.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.440
And of course, JSON.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.910
More.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.650
Yes, OK.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.490
So for those of you that didn't
raise your hand, let me

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.030
go through each of these
very quickly.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.810
Now, they're open standards,
they're all available on the

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.260
web, with much more information
than I can explain

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.030
right here.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.569
But let me, again, just give you
a quick overview of each

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.760
so that you'll know
what I'm talking

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.740
about as we move forward.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.619
So first off, REST is
a web architecture.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.829
It's essentially a mechanism for
transporting data between

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:31.320
two surfaces using HTTP, or
the protocol of the web.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.800
It typically works with
resources or collections of

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.170
things that you can insert,
update, delete, and list.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.200
And you use HTTP methods
for that.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.050
You can use POST to insert, you
can use PUT to update, you

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:52.060
can use DELETE to delete, and
you can use GET to list all of

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.360
the items or any one item
in a collection.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.570
Does that make sense?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.500
OAuth2 has sometimes been
referred to as the valet keys

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.220
for the internet.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.820
It's a way to allow a third
party service to do things on

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.630
your behalf.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.930
In this case, if I want to
install a service for Glass, I

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.350
give it permission through
OAuth2 to write

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.670
things to my timeline.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:19.640
Again, really simple, right?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.990
You can think of that
as the install

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.795
process for Glass services.

00:18:22.795 --> 00:18:26.530
And finally, JSON, or JavaScript
Object Notation, is

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.840
just an encapsulation.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.360
We did XML for a long time as
a community, but now JSON's

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.610
really the thing.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.380
And it all centers around these
timeline cards, so let's

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.700
start there.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.700
The timeline card is just a
discreet bit of data that you

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.170
send to Google and then
Google syncs to the

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.550
user's Glass for you.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.290
Now remember that diagram--

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.650
all that syncing and knowing
whether the device is online

00:18:54.650 --> 00:19:02.130
or offline, that's all done for
you by Google, up to and

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.880
including how to display these
things on Glass and actually

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.360
rendering that UI.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.850
Now these timeline cards can be
text, images, rich HTML, it

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.835
can be video.

00:19:14.835 --> 00:19:16.740
And it can also be bundles
of things.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.020
Remember, we saw this with
the weather card.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.400
Whenever you see that fold in
the upper right hand corner

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.020
and you tap on it, it'll
expand into sort of a

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.450
subtimeline, if you will,
and you can see

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.270
multiple items there.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.590
And that's really great for
Glass, because you can kind of

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.700
have a very efficient timeline
but then you can drill deeper.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.140
Now this is what it looks
like in code.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:51.650
And it could be just as simple
as this, is you've got a text

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.220
variable set to "Hello world,"
you send that to Google, and

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:02.450
we push a timeline card to the
user that says "Hello world."

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:11.140
You can insert images this way
using a multipart request, and

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.240
you can insert rich
HTML as well.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.430
Now these items can be by
themselves or you can do

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.570
bundling, and there's two
ways to do bundling.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.170
The first way is through
something that's kind of like

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.250
pagination.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.120
It's a single card that you
insert into the timeline

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.090
collection that includes
an HTML cover

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.240
card and HTML pages.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.030
Those are the multiple pages
that you tap into.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.405
This is really great if you
have sort of a single item

00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:47.330
that you want to represent
in more than one screen.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.370
And it could also be multiple
timeline cards that are all

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.205
linked together with
a bundle ID.

00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:56.090
So you just set a common bundle
ID across multiple

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.440
cards that you insert and we'll
put them together in a

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.690
single bundle.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.660
If you want to do an update,
just do a PUT request.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.560
You'll notice on the endpoint
there I'm also specifying the

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.275
item's ID at the end
of timeline.

00:21:14.216 --> 00:21:16.820
And I'm just going to update
that again to hello world,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.990
this time without an
exclamation mark.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.890
You can do delete--

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.050
this is a DELETE request.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.770
And of course, you can list any
single item or the whole

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.020
list of items.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.255
So those are cards.

00:21:34.255 --> 00:21:36.660
You can insert them, they can
be lots of different types.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.312
There's also these
card options.

00:21:42.312 --> 00:21:45.280
Now remember, I tapped
on that picture and I

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.980
got Share and Delete.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.990
Well, you can specify that
menu when you insert a

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.770
timeline card and it's
really easy to do.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.540
There's two types of
these timeline card

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.130
options, if you will.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.860
There's Reply and there's
Read Aloud.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.700
Those are system options.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.240
You can also do custom options,
which are whatever

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.000
you specify.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.180
They have your display name,
your icon, and they do what

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.730
you want them to do.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:21.290
To insert system options, all
you have to do is name them.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.540
So you can see we're back to
this timeline card insertion,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.210
and we're specifying in the JSON
hello world, and I'm also

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.680
specifying an array
of card options.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.170
And the one that I specify, I'm
just naming it Read Aloud,

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.610
and that will add Read Aloud
to this timeline card.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.470
If I want a custom option, I've
got to specify just a few

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.070
more things.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:45.050
You'll see the action here
is custom, but then I'm

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.650
specifying an ID, a display
name, and an icon URL--

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.670
in this case, love, as if you
were to love an item on a

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.940
service, because we're
in Austin.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.970
No?

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.350
Come on, so much love
around here.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.800
We've got some share entities.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.510
Remember when I tapped on that
picture and then I tapped on

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.310
Share and I got my Google+
Circle for friends?

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.830
Well, Google+ is a Glass
service using the API.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.070
It added that share
entity for me.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:23.640
Any Glass service out there can
add their own set of share

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.630
entities so that when I take a
picture or a video on Glass, I

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.245
can send it to any one
of those services.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.070
To insert a share entity,
it's a POST request.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.910
But this time it's on the
share entities endpoint

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.650
instead of the timeline
endpoint, right?

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.650
So we're just sending this
to a different URL.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:55.100
And I'm specifying an ID, a
display name, and an image to

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.350
show along with that.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.200
OK, subscriptions.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.290
So this is the last big thing.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:08.620
For subscriptions, this is
important for your card

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.780
options and your share entities,
because what the

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.080
user is going to do is they're
going to perform an action,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.860
Glass will tell Google, and then
Google will notify your

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.410
Glass service, and it
happens real quick.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.280
To do that, you first need to
subscribe to the timeline

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.040
collection or whatever
collection we make available.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.940
And you specify your
subscription this way, by

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.050
doing, again, a POST request,
using the RESTful protocol to

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.140
say, hey, I want
a subscription.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.140
Here's the user token or the
verify token to repeat back to

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.840
me so I know what you're talking
about, and here's a

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.140
callback URL.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.700
This is where I want you
to send the data.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.470
And then what Google's going to
do is every time it gets a

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.870
user action, it's going
to send you a

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.780
lightweight ping in JSON.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.270
It's going to include things
like the timeline ID.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.910
So in the case of a picture,
you'll get that timeline ID

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.280
and then you'll do a GET request
on the timeline like

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.742
we saw earlier and download
the photo.

00:25:07.742 --> 00:25:10.280
Does that make sense?

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:10.810
All right.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.420
The lightweight ping's
going to look a

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.670
little bit like this.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.320
OK.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.810
So that was a mouthful,
mostly, for me.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.790
It was a lot of technical stuff
about how the API works.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.640
And it's really important
because these are sort of the

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.630
major building blocks for
creating Glass services.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.020
I'm going to go through
them one more time.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.900
You have the timeline cards, and
these are things that you

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.851
can insert for the user and
they'll see them on Glass.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.470
Those cards can have options
and those options can be

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.030
system options, like Reply or
Read Aloud, and we'll see

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:55.250
those in a demo in a moment, or
they can be custom options,

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.890
in which case you specify what
it's called and what the icon

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.890
is and then you handle
that for the user.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.010
The share entities--

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.110
and these get added to the
share menu for any media

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.025
created on Glass like pictures
and like videos.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.550
And then finally,
subscriptions.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.060
By subscribing to updates to the
timeline, you get notified

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.490
with lightweight JSON pings
whether the user hits a card

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:27.390
option or if they hit
a share entity.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.801
All make sense?

00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:30.910
OK.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.150
Next up, guidelines.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.820
So this is really key because
it's a new platform.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.400
It's a new form of technology,
so we need some new

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.540
rules for the road.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.930
We've done a lot of thinking and
playing and experimenting

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:49.140
and here's just four quick
things that we found make a

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.860
Glass service really great.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.760
First, design for Glass.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.780
Glass is a unique platform
that's mobile, but it's

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:04.770
fundamentally different than
existing platforms like your

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.530
phone or your tablet.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.630
And you want to build for Glass
with this in mind, that

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.170
it's for Glass.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.290
You wouldn't want to take an
experience somewhere else and

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.570
just stamp it out for Glass.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.610
And you'd also want to take the
time to experience it on

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.766
Glass so that you know what
it feels like and you

00:27:19.766 --> 00:27:21.520
know that it works.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.700
For example, you wouldn't
want to read an entire

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.060
news story on Glass.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.890
When we think about Glass, we
don't think about staring at

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:30.680
the screen all day.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.090
Again, it's not directly
in front of my eyes.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.590
We think about these
quick interactions.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.580
So what is a good experience
is reading a headline or

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.050
seeing a picture coming out
there from the world and

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.060
getting these headlines
throughout my day--

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.340
those short, quick
interactions,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.590
whenever I want them.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.890
The next thing is that you don't
want to get in the way.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.340
Glass users expect the
technology to be there for

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:01.740
them when they want it and out
of the way when they don't.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.230
You want to make sure that your
service supports this by

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.140
not being too frequent and loud
with notifications and

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.390
provide appropriate controls
for the user experience.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:13.960
And most of all, you don't
want to take precedence.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.420
You don't want to override
or require.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.940
If the user misses a
notification, it should be OK.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.970
And an example here is that you
wouldn't want to do any

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:26.270
motile dialogues, for our UX
friends out there, with Glass.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.320
If the user misses the
notification and doesn't

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.200
respond, it should decay
quietly and easily and

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.460
silently and the user should
keep getting notifications

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.060
like usual.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.810
And the reason is they're
wearing Glass

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.710
throughout their day.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:42.400
And when they're doing

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.000
something, let them do something.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.480
They'll get back to Glass
when they want.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.130
Keep it timely.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.470
When you think about it, your
laptop or your desktop

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.890
computer, you work with data
that's maybe over the course

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.980
of the last few months
or year.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.690
When you're working on your
phone, you can really think

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.350
about that as sort of
the day or the week.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.870
Glass is a very right
now device.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.460
So when you deliver data to the
user, you want to do it in

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.090
the moment and keep it up to
date, especially, like the A+,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.160
is if it matters to them for
what they're doing right now.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.500
And a real time notification
system is provided, right--

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.970
those subscriptions
that we saw.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.880
So when you get those
notifications, you'll want to

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.770
respond right away and provide
that user with the experience

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.500
that they're expecting,
which is right there

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.340
with them, right now.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.010
An example here is that you
wouldn't want somebody to send

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:47.130
a timeline card to you about
an email from a week ago.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.710
You probably already saw that.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.570
You want the email that happened
just now and happens

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.820
to also be important.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:00.140
Then finally, avoid the
unexpected, especially the

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.780
unexpected and unpleasant.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.520
You want to be transparent to
the user and give them the

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.730
functionality that they expect,
because unexpected

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.720
functionality is typically bad
on any platform, but it's

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.810
especially bad when it's on
Glass because the user is

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.060
wearing Glass.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.980
An example here is if I signed
up to be able to share images

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.350
with your service but you end
up sending me timeline cards

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.090
about all your wonderful new
features every day, that will

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:31.910
be a bad experience.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.060
You would want to use a
traditional channel like email

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.570
or something like that to let me
know what's happening with

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:39.220
the service and on Glass, I just
want that interaction.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.490
So those are the
big guidelines.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.000
Let me just highlight them one
more time on the screen here.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.040
You want to design for Glass,
specifically for the Glass

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.290
experience.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.830
You don't want to
get in the way--

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.030
we provide an experience for
the user that's there when

00:30:59.030 --> 00:30:59.700
they want it.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.560
You want to keep it timely--
make sure it's up to date and

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.160
matters to them in the moment.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.350
You want to avoid the
unexpected-- you want to keep

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.890
away from anything that's going
to jar them or shock

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.140
them out of their life.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.200
So we've been working with a few
friends to test this new

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.640
API and how these
new experiences

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.920
fit into our lives.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.510
You've got to play with it and
use it and see how it works.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.050
I'd like to share with you just
a taste of what we've

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.826
been playing with lately.

00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:36.310
Does that sound like fun?

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.340
I'm going to keep
asking you these

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.705
questions this whole time.

00:31:39.705 --> 00:31:41.260
Does that sound like fun?

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.144
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:42.144 --> 00:31:43.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.885
First, let's start with "The
New York Times." Now as you

00:31:46.885 --> 00:31:50.330
know, "The New York Times" is
a leading global multimedia

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.292
information company.

00:31:52.292 --> 00:31:54.790
It enhances society by creating
and collecting and

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.540
distributing high quality
news and information.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.030
And if you're like me, that
means you sit down every

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:03.510
Sunday morning and
read the "Times."

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.680
But I also want news throughout
my day during the

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.910
work week, but I don't really
ever have the time to sit down

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.940
and read a newspaper.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.690
What really works for me and
what we found is a great

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.905
experience on Glass is getting
headlines throughout the day

00:32:17.905 --> 00:32:21.500
that are there whenever
I look for them.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.390
And that's what we built.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:26.590
Let's take a look at what
that looks like.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.030
So here is a bundle of news that
I got from "The New York

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.210
Times" right before
I got up on stage.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.870
It's an article about
the Harlem Shake.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.170
And you'll notice it has the
curl in the upper right hand

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.520
corner there, that fold.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:47.810
If I tap on this item, I get a
bundle of all these different

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.490
headlines and rich images.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.440
And if I tap on any one of
these, I can get a card option

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.690
for read aloud.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.250
So this is really great
for me, actually,

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.500
because I can hear it.

00:33:09.001 --> 00:33:10.750
Uh huh.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.870
OK.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.160
The cool thing about that is
that I typically wouldn't do

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.370
that in front of an audience--

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.100
listen to a news article-- but
I thought it would be fun.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.560
But I would do that when I'm
walking in between meetings or

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.460
I'm going for a short walk to
take a break, because then I

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.660
can kind of look at the world
around me and I'm also hearing

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.880
something about what's
going on in the

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.130
greater world that me.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.110
So let's take a look at
the detail flow there.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.350
What "The New York Times" is
doing is they're inserting a

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.010
timeline card.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.020
In fact, they're inserting
several timeline cards and

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.120
they're setting a few
properties in there.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.600
They're using the rich HTML so
that it displays with these

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.330
beautiful photos
and headlines.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.070
They're creating the speakable
text, which is a little bit

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.630
different than I see
on the screen.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.660
What they're giving me is a
summary of the story, so I can

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.300
see the headline if I want and
I can have the whole summary

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.380
read aloud to me.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.320
And they're adding the Read
Aloud card option, so that I

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.420
can actually choose
to hear it.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.810
And finally, they're setting the
bundle ID on each of these

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.150
so that every hour--

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.830
which is what we've been
playing with--

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:22.770
I get a new bundle
of news items.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.909
And the cool experience here is
that as I'm going about my

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:32.100
day, I might see that this comes
in and take a look at

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.120
the news right there.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.659
Or maybe I'm waiting at the
bus stop and I can see the

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:38.650
latest articles.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.670
So let's go through the
guidelines one by one.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.810
There's four of them,
remember.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.250
First, design for Glass.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.170
What's cool about this is it's
simple, it's there when I want

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.449
it, and I'm able to have this
read aloud to me so I can go

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.330
about my day.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.840
It doesn't get in the way.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.520
If at any point I miss one of
these bundles, that's fine.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.770
The world keeps generating
news-- that doesn't stop--

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.570
so I can just see
the next one.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.320
It's up to date with
fresh data.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.890
So "The New York Times" is
really great about publishing

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.430
that news throughout the day
as it becomes relevant and

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.600
then delivering to me every
hour the top news stories

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.710
right then.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.770
And then finally, avoiding
the unexpected.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:20.740
And this is really easy--

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.160
I'm getting the news that
I expect regularly.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.610
In fact, we're trying out this
other flow that's really great

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.410
as well where you get
breaking news.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.650
And that just can happen
right away, and I get a

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.890
notification.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.520
And with Glass, using the head
gestures, I can just look up

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.660
and I can see that
breaking news.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.610
And "The New York Times" is
already really great about

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.230
delivering breaking news to
users when it's relevant, when

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.070
it's actually breaking and
important, and otherwise just

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.380
putting it into the
news cycle.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.110
OK, let's do another--

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.650
my favorite email
service, Gmail.

00:36:00.095 --> 00:36:01.980
Let's try this demo again.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.720
So far it's worked good.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.620
I'm going to go ahead
and tap here.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.330
And it looks like I got an email
just a moment ago from

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.320
Jenny, my colleague back
in Mountain View.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.500
Unfortunately, she couldn't be
here today, but we've got game

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.790
night this Saturday and I'm
going to kick her butt.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.000
Let me just go ahead and
reply to this email,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.250
if you don't mind.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.040
Are you kidding?

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:22.930
I can't wait.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.180
Smiley face.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.420
And it's going to send
that message to her.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.390
What it went into was a voice
dictation mode there.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:35.910
I started a little bit too
early-- that's why it had that

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.680
"remind" word.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.520
But then it heard what I said as
I said it, showed it to me,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.070
had the option to cancel that if
I wanted to, but I didn't.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.920
It went ahead and sent it and
she'll get an email that has

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.070
the text of what I just said
as well as the audio file.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.558
So let's look at this in a
little bit more detail again.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.330
So this flow starts when I
authorize Gmail to insert

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.930
timeline cards on my Glass.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.650
Remember that OAuth process
that I told you about?

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.320
Again, this is really
sort of the install

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.070
process for Glass services.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.900
I go over to the Gmail website
and I say, I want you to send

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.480
the most important emails
as they happen to Glass.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.660
And it jumps into the OAuth
flow, I give permission, it

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.890
calls back to Gmail,
and it's done.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.280
But at that moment, Gmail
does a quick thing.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.160
It inserts a subscription for
all updates on my timeline.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.210
Remember we talked about
subscriptions?

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.630
Essentially, it's subscribing
to everything I do on the

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.830
timeline that concerns it.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.310
OK, so now we fast forward
to I'm getting my emails

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.210
throughout the day.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:56.980
It inserts timeline cards.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.510
And on those timeline cards, it
includes just some simple

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.380
text and a creator-- in
this case, Jenny--

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.240
and some speakable text
so that I can have it

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.810
read aloud to me.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.440
It includes those card options
for Reply and Read Aloud.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.650
And when I get that email as
a user, I tap on Reply.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.860
Glass goes into voice dictation,
records what I say,

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:24.810
and then it notifies Gmail's
subscription endpoint.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.620
Remember, it subscribed
and then it sends the

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.330
notifications.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:30.730
The lightweight notification
just includes some JSON

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.760
specifying the timeline
item that has all that

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.930
text that I just said.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.040
Gmail will then retrieve that
item, download the audio,

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.170
compose an email, and
send it to Jenny.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.240
Again, very simple flow, all
cloud based, something that

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.930
you could build and do a first
version of in just a day.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.580
Let's go through
the guidelines.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.750
First off, design for Glass.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.100
It's a simple, quick
interaction, and it's easy to

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.260
do while on the go.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.430
It doesn't get in the way.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.950
And this is really key for Gmail
is that I'm not getting

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.190
every email message that
comes into my inbox.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.760
I wouldn't want that.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.240
But I do get the important ones,
and Gmail is already

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.750
good at figuring out which ones
those are and sends just

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.960
those to my Glass.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.580
And it's, of course, fresh.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.610
I get the new messages
as they come in.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.160
It's very timely.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.060
And it avoids the unexpected.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.850
I get emails and I send replies
whenever I want.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.100
It's just a simple flow.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.350
All right.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:37.224
Let's do a couple more.

00:39:37.224 --> 00:39:41.010
The next one is Evernote.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.960
So Evernote, as you know, is a
family of apps that help you

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.300
remember everything, communicate
effectively, and

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.230
really just get things done.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.640
In this case, I'm going to be
talking about two of them--

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.660
Evernote itself and Skitch.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.180
Who here is familiar
with Skitch?

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.430
A lot of you.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.670
I think Skitch is great.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.990
It's just a really quick way
to take an image or a

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.640
screenshot and mark it up with
text and arrows so that I can

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.780
communicate how I feel about
something, whether it's a UI

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.640
design or architecture
planning, whatever

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.120
it happens to be.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.090
The interesting thing about
Skitch, though, is that I find

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.610
myself, if I'm in a meeting
and I take a photo of

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.920
something that we're talking
about, I don't want to sort of

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.496
Skitch it up right then.

00:40:23.496 --> 00:40:23.990
Why?

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.290
Because I'm in the meeting and,
like, we're talking and

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.930
we're communicating
about next steps.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.590
Rather, I'd like to be able to
quickly give feedback at the

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.010
right time.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.390
So let's try that, shall we?

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:49.840
So I'm going to swipe over to
the picture I took of y'all

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.900
and I'm going to tap.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.460
I get my card options there.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.935
I'm going to tap on Share, and
I'm going to swipe to Skitch

00:40:58.935 --> 00:41:00.330
and I'm gong to tap on Skitch.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:11.735
Now what's happened here is that
Skitch was just notified

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:16.825
that I took an image and
I shared it with it.

00:41:16.825 --> 00:41:21.440
And again, how that happens is
I tap on the card option as

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.670
Skitch had previously inserted
a subscription and said, I

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.110
want you notify me at this point
whenever the user hits

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.260
the share entity.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.535
So I hit that share entity.

00:41:31.535 --> 00:41:35.030
It goes up to Google, Google
bounces that down to Skitch,

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.670
and then Skitch then takes that
information, downloads

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:43.020
the image, and sends an Android
notification to my

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.890
tablet, which is right here.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.920
I can't believe I'm screen
sharing multiple devices in

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.630
this demo-- it's cool.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.490
And this is Skitch.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.370
It just opens up with
that image.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:59.020
I'm going to go ahead and
buzz out my friends from

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.270
Engadget over here.

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:03.820
Oh, I'm just kidding--

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.390
I love you guys.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:14.115
And let's go ahead and
say awesome press.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.830
That's cool, right?

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.070
So these would, in any
other case, be my

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:24.910
notes during a meeting.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.170
I'm going to go ahead and hit
Done here and save it.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.240
And Skitch right now, as it
usually does, is going to

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.670
upload this into Evernote so
it's a note that I can access

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.860
whenever I want.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.280
Now what I like about this flow
and how I've started to

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.520
use it in my daily life is
that I end up at these

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.870
meetings getting caught between

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.580
feedback and paying attention.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.670
I can pay attention and with
Glass I can easily take photos

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.340
as things happen.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.050
And then as I'm walking back to
my desk or going for a walk

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.650
later, I just share that with
Skitch on my tablet and I can

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.380
mark it up and save
it to Evernote.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.780
And as you can see, there it
is right there in Evernote.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.060
I've also got some Skitches
about fish and this talk,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.880
because that's what this talk
needs is some more fish.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.470
All right.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.480
Let's go back to the
presentation here and go

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.850
through that again in detail.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.790
So starting with the OAuth flow
again, when I authorize

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.790
Evernote to do things on my
behalf, right afterwards it

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:32.880
inserts a share target for
Skitch, or a share entity, and

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.970
it adds a subscription
for timeline updates.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.510
Later, I take a picture.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.090
I choose to share
it with Skitch.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.280
Google then notifies Skitch
there's an update.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.245
Skitch pushes that to
one of my devices.

00:43:46.245 --> 00:43:50.570
I mark it up, save to Evernote,
and that's my day.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.020
And the guidelines-- let's
go through each of

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.430
those, one at a time.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.620
This one will go quick, though,

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.930
because it's really simple.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.500
You design for Glass.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.170
Again, being able to take a
picture without interrupting

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.400
what I'm doing and then be able
to take notes on that

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.470
picture whenever I want
is a very cool

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.370
interaction for Glass.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.950
And it doesn't get in the way
because I can use the share

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.220
target whenever I want.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.860
And as far as being timely and
avoiding the unexpected, I'm

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.460
making this happen by choosing
that share entity.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.690
So really, I, as the user,
I am in control

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.675
of this whole flow.

00:44:30.675 --> 00:44:31.106
All right.

00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:32.887
Should we do one more?

00:44:32.887 --> 00:44:35.322
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:35.322 --> 00:44:38.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.680
So who here is familiar
with Path?

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.430
Great.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.510
So Path, for those of you that
didn't raise your hand, is a

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.870
smart journal.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:50.300
It lets you share your life
with those you love and do

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.520
photos, thoughts, more
stuff than that.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.900
But one of my favorites is
simply adding an emoticon to a

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.600
friend's post when
it comes in.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.860
I can look at my Path timeline
throughout the day--

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.290
the path, if you will.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.970
And as I see pictures that my
friends have shared, I can tap

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.290
on them and hit like Smile
or Frown or Love.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:12.710
And I do this all the time
because it's a quick way I can

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.800
interact with them and yet
still go about my day.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.420
This is a really great
experience on Glass.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.700
So let's go ahead and see.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.380
Oh, I got a timeline card right
at the front there that

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.180
I took a photo.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.730
This is a demo device,
so that's why

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.160
there's multiple mes.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.870
Anyway, this is really
an excellent photo.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.120
I know, I took it.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.150
I'm going to go ahead and tap on
it, and I get card options

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:48.340
for all of these emoticons.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.600
And in fact, all the way at
the end, I also have the

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.110
ability to reply, which will
add a comment to this post.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:57.640
Again, super simple, quick
interaction that I can do

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.170
while I'm going about my day.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.500
I'm going to choose on Smile.

00:46:03.769 --> 00:46:05.320
And that's done.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.390
Path is going to get that
notification and it's going

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.620
add a smile from this demo
account to that photo.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.470
Let's look at that flow.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.946
Let's start one more time
at the OAuth portion.

00:46:24.946 --> 00:46:27.560
I as a user go to Path and
I say, I want you to

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.250
send stuff to Glass.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.770
I give permission, and then
Path immediately inserts a

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.505
subscription to timeline
updates.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.790
Then, as I'm going about the
rest of my day or the week or

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:45.410
the whatever, Path is sending
me pictures from the people

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.670
that I know really well,
the people that I love.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.940
And I can tap on any one of
these as they come in and I

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.680
can add a comment or I can
choose one of those emoticons

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.060
without really even breaking
my stride.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.450
Now, the design guidelines
are pretty clear as well.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.810
And we've been over these
a lot of times.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.130
Let me do them one more time.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.420
Design for Glass.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.500
Love the way emoticons
work on Path.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.370
It's just that quick
interaction.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:14.620
It's a really great experience
on Glass because I hardly even

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.370
have to take a moment beyond
appreciating that photo and

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:21.470
being able to tell my friends
how I feel about it.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:22.720
It doesn't get in the way.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.710
I get these pictures as
my friends take them.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.800
And because it's Path, they're
only people that

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.050
I know really well.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.850
It's very timely.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.650
I just get the pictures
as they come in.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:36.750
And it's never really
unexpected.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.450
This is the community that I've
already curated on Path,

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.650
and I'm getting the photos
that I love.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.680
I'm just getting them
on Glass now.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.770
So those were the demos.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.840
Let me say one more quick
thing to kind of

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.370
pull this all together.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:59.680
And this really calls back,
again, to those glass bars,

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.060
that feeling of the developer
community coming together and

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:07.050
wanting to do something together
on this new form of

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.300
technology.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:14.430
We looked at all of these
things in detail.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.170
The demo--

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:18.690
I gave you a quick look
at the Glass UI.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:19.970
And we talked about
the Mirror API.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.050
Remember, the four major
components were timeline

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:28.220
cards, menu options on those
timeline cards, share entities

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:33.550
to be able to share images and
video, and subscriptions to

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.570
get updates about both those
timeline card options and the

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.340
share entities.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.610
And we looked deeply at each of
these guidelines that we've

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.480
been discovering as we've
been building these new

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.820
experiences for Glass.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.770
There was designing for Glass,
making sure the experience

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:53.280
makes sense for a Glass user.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.620
Not getting in the way, making
sure that the experience

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.530
you're giving your user makes
sense for them right then at

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.550
that moment.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.660
Being timely or staying
up to date--

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.890
making sure that what you give
the user and how you respond

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.100
to them is in the moment.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.400
It's right now.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.910
And avoiding the unexpected,
especially the unexpected and

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.710
the unpleasant.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.300
You want to make sure that the
user is getting the experience

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.880
they signed up for, and you give
them the right settings

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:28.510
so they can adjust it for them,
like being able to turn

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:33.070
it off on the weekend or
when they go to sleep.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.260
And finally, we looked
at some examples.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.420
And this is just where we
started, with a few friends to

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.370
test out the API in
its early stages.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:45.930
And that's the thing.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.270
This is where we're starting.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:48.242
You've got to remember--

00:49:48.242 --> 00:49:50.280
and I'll leave you with
this thought--

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.302
that Glass is in
early days yet.

00:49:53.302 --> 00:49:56.050
We're really just getting
started, and the reason we're

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.990
talking about this today, the
reason we want to start having

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.530
this conversation, is that every
time we say something

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.820
and you guys respond with your
dreams and your visions for

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.580
using this new technology, it's
such a huge inspiration

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:13.000
to us, and it really affects the
work that we do on Glass

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.240
day to day.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.960
So please, keep that coming.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.770
Thank you.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:26.170
[APPLAUSE]
