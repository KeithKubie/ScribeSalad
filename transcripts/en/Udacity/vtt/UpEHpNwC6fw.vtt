00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.990
Now let's start here,
with the desktop computer

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.560
many of us have spent countless hours
working with to build and use software.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
It looks conventional and familiar
only because we've each spent so

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.770
much time with it.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.200
But something you'll notice about all
these devices when you look at them

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.340
without anything else in the picture.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.010
It's hard to see the human.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.780
Now one of my favorite thought
experiments is by the VR

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.110
pioneer, Jaron Lanier.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.460
You may have heard this before, so
just bear with me for a moment.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.420
What if aliens came to Earth and people
were nowhere to be found, and what if

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.060
these aliens tried to figure out what
we were like based on our computers.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.450
What would they think?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.710
DI mean do we have a hundred and
two fingers and one big eye?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
Now if they look to the hammer,
he'd make more sense.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.730
You can almost see the arm that would
wield this tool and hammer in nails.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.890
But this computer?

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.150
I mean, just look at that keyboard,
it's not really built for us,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.100
in fact, it's not even built for
us to type fast.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.070
Back when this keyboard
layout was designed,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.900
it was intended to keep
us from typing so fast,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.210
that these tight bars would get caught
together and screw everything up.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.880
But this, is what evolved
into the modern keyboard.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.630
Now this is a very physical difference
between a person and a machine.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.810
Let's look at a less physical
difference that's just as dangerous.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.610
Now what's wrong with this picture?

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.620
In many ways,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.920
this is our relationship to technology
today, it gives us a lot of value.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.480
However, we're adapting our lifestyle
to the technology that assists us,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.190
and there's a heavy cost, distraction.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.010
We pay that cost frequently.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.260
But what if we didn't have to?
