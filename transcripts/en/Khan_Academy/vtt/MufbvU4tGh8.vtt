00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.816
Let's try to calculate
10.1 minus 3.93.

00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:06.440
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.350
and try it on your
own first, and then we

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.590
can think about whether
we did it the same way.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.500
So let's just
rewrite it, aligning

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.380
the decimal and the
different place values.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.910
So 10.1 minus-- the 3
is in the ones place,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.910
so I'll put it right
under the 0-- 3.93.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.030
Now, let's just try
to calculate this.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.400
Now, before we subtract, we
want all the numbers on top

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.469
to be larger than the
numbers on the bottom.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.010
And we don't even
have a number here.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.910
We could stick a 0 here.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.850
Let me do that in a
different color here.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.450
We could stick a 0 here.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.400
10.1 is the same thing as 10.10,
but we still face an issue

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.900
here.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.120
0 is less than 3.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.370
1 is less than 9.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.850
0 is less than 3.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.040
So we're going to do a
little bit of regrouping.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.280
So let's do that regrouping.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.720
So we could take a 10 away,
one 10 away, and then one 10

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.490
is the same thing as 10 ones.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.790
So I could write a
10 in the ones place.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.430
And I could take
one of those ones

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.380
away so I'm going
to have nine ones,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.550
and give that one
to the tenths place.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.722
Well, one is 10 tenths.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:15.029
10 tenths plus 1 tenth
is going to be 11 tenths.

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:16.570
Now, I could take
one of those tenths

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.730
away and give it to
the hundredths place.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.155
1 tenth is 10 hundredths.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.860
And now I have a higher
digit in the numerator,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.852
or at least as equal
in the numerator

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:32.060
as I have in the denominator.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.912
So 10 minus 3 is 7.

00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:36.990
10 minus 9 is 1.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.730
I have the decimal.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.180
9 minus 3 is 6.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.610
And then I have
nothing over here.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.052
So 10.1 minus 3.93, 6.17.
