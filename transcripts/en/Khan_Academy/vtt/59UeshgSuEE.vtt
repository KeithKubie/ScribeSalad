00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.926
- [Voiceover] We have many
videos on the mean value theorem,

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:07.742
but I'm going to review it
a little bit, so that we can

00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:10.444
see how this connects
the mean value theorem

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.959
that we learned in differential calculus,

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.393
how that connects to what we learned about

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:17.110
the average value of a function
using definite integrals.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.310
So the mean value theorem
tells us that if I have

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.310
some function f that is
continuous on the closed interval,

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.277
so it's including the
endpoints, from a to b,

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:35.693
and it is differentiable,
so the derivative

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:39.660
is defined on the open
interval, from a to b,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.242
so it doesn't necessarily
have to be differentiable

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.310
at the boundaries, as long
as it's differentiable

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.943
between the boundaries, then we know that

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:54.943
there exists some value, or some number c,

00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:09.927
such that c is between the
two endpoints of our interval,

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:16.042
so such that a &lt; c &lt; b, so
c is in this interval, AND,

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:23.727
and this is kind of the meat of it,

00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:28.727
is that the derivative of
our function at that point,

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.092
you could use as the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:36.092
at that point, is equal
to essentially the average

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.443
rate of change over the
interval, or you could even

00:01:39.443 --> 00:01:42.443
think about it as the slope
between the two endpoints.

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:44.910
So the slope between the
two endpoints is gonna be

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.277
your change in y, which is going to be

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:48.977
your change in your function value,

00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:53.977
so f of b, minus f of a, over
b minus a, and once again,

00:01:57.677 --> 00:01:59.893
we go into much more depth in this

00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:02.477
when we covered it the first
time in differential calculus,

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:04.278
but just to give you
a visualization of it,

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:06.311
'cause I think it's always handy, the

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.560
mean value theorem that we
learned in differential calculus

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.478
just tells us, hey look,
if this is a, this is b,

00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:18.660
I've got my function doing
something interesting,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.576
so this is f of a, this is
f of b, so this quantity

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.060
right over here, where
you're taking the change

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.076
in the value of our function,
so this right over here is

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:33.393
f of b, minus f of a,
is this change in the

00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:35.561
value of our function,
divided by the change

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.645
in our x-axis, so it's a
change in y over change in x,

00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.610
that gives us the slope,
this right over here gives us

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.727
the slope of this line,
the slope of the line

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:48.877
that connects these two
points, that's this quantity,

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.592
and the mean value theorem
tell us that there's some c

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.626
in between a and b where you're
gonna have the same slope,

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:57.443
so it might be at LEAST
one place, so it might be

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.695
right over there, where you
have the exact same slope,

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.742
there exists a c where the
slope of the tangent line

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:06.444
at that point is going to be
the same, so this would be

00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:08.076
a c right over there, and
we actually might have

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:10.542
a couple of c's, that's
another candidate c.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:12.228
There's at least one c where the slope

00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:15.160
of the tangent line is the
same as the average slope

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.061
across the interval, and
once again, we have to assume

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:21.177
that f is continuous,
and f is differentiable.

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:25.828
Now when you see this, it
might evoke some similarities

00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:28.992
with what we saw when
we saw how we defined,

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:30.478
I guess you could say, or the formula

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:32.061
for the average value of a function.

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:35.444
Remember, what we saw for the
average value of a function,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:40.310
we said the average value
of a function is going to be

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.760
equal to 1 over b minus a,
notice, 1 over b minus a,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.626
you have a b minus a in
the denominator here,

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:51.626
times the definite integral
from a to b, of f of x dx.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.478
Now this is interesting, 'cause
here we have a derivative,

00:03:57.478 --> 00:04:01.827
here we have an integral, but
maybe we could connect these.

00:04:01.827 --> 00:04:05.643
Maybe we could connect these two things.

00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:07.242
Well one thing that might jump out at you

00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:11.010
is maybe we could rewrite

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.010
this numerator right over
here in this form somehow.

00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:18.443
And I encourage you to pause
the video and see if you can,

00:04:18.443 --> 00:04:21.477
and I'll give you actually
quite a huge hint,

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:23.361
instead of it being an f of x
here, what happens if there's

00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:27.542
an f prime of x there, so I
encourage you to try to do that.

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.493
So once again, let me rewrite all of this,

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:31.360
this is going to be equal to...

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.593
This over here is the exact same thing as

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:38.593
the definite integral from
a to b, of f prime of x dx.

00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:41.143
Think about it.

00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:43.242
You're gonna take the
anti-derivative of f prime of x,

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:45.144
which is going to be f
of x, and you're going to

00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.660
evaluate it at b, f of
b, and then from that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.943
you're going to subtract it
evaluated at a, minus f of a.

00:04:50.943 --> 00:04:52.992
These two things are identical.

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:57.992
And then, you can of
course divide by b minus a.

00:04:59.977 --> 00:05:02.893
Now this is starting to get interesting.

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:07.893
One way to think about
it is, there must be a c

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:12.157
that takes on the average value of,

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:14.639
there must be a c, that when you

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.291
evaluate the derivative at c,

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:20.924
it takes on the average
value of the derivative.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:23.707
Or another way to think about it,

00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:28.707
if we were to just write g of
x is equal to f prime of x,

00:05:31.458 --> 00:05:33.908
then we get very close to
what we have over here,

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:37.991
because this right over
here is going to be g of c,

00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.659
remember, f prime of c is
the same thing as g of c,

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.659
is equal to 1 over b minus
a, so there exists a c

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:53.107
where g of c is equal to 1 over b minus a,

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:58.107
times the definite integral
from a to b, of g of x dx,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.908
f prime of x is the same thing as g of x.

00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:05.189
So another way of thinking
about it, this is actually

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.074
another form of the mean value theorem,

00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:12.074
it's called the mean value
theorem for integrals.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.291
I'll just write the acronym,

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:20.291
mean value theorem for
integrals, or integration,

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.542
which essentially, to
give it in a slightly more

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:29.542
formal sense, is if you have
some function g, so if g is,

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:33.991
let me actually go down a
little bit, which tells us that

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:38.991
if g of x is continuous
on this closed interval,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.340
going from a to b, then there
exists a c in this interval

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.574
where g of c is equal to, what is this?

00:06:57.574 --> 00:07:00.575
This is the average value of our function.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:05.575
There exists a c where g of c is equal to

00:07:07.773 --> 00:07:11.023
the average value of your
function over the interval.

00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:14.257
This was our definition of the
average value of a function.

00:07:14.257 --> 00:07:16.491
So anyway, this is just
another way of saying you might

00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:19.507
see some of the mean value
theorem of integrals,

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:22.139
and just to show you that
it's really closely tied,

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.390
it's using different
notation, but it's usually,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.140
it's essentially the
same exact idea as the

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.659
mean value theorem you learned
in differential calculus,

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.325
but now your different
notation, and I guess

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:34.510
you could have a slightly
different interpretation.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.939
We were thinking about it
in differential calculus,

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.472
we're thinking about having a point where

00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:41.954
the slope of the tangent line
of the function of that point

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:44.273
is the same as the average
rate, so that's when

00:07:44.273 --> 00:07:46.287
we had our kind of differential
mode, and we were kind of

00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:49.371
thinking in terms of slopes,
and slopes of tangent lines,

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:51.573
and now, when we're in
integral mode, we're thinking

00:07:51.573 --> 00:07:54.157
much more in terms of average value,

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:57.107
average value of the
function, so there's some c,

00:07:57.107 --> 00:07:59.822
where g of c, there's some c,

00:07:59.822 --> 00:08:01.856
where the function
evaluated at that point,

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.989
is equal to the average
value, so another way

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:09.989
of thinking about it, if
I were to draw g of x,

00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:22.721
that's x, that is my
y-axis, this is the graph of

00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:26.239
y is equal to g of x, which
of course is the same thing

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.773
as f prime of x, but we've
just rewritten it now

00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:32.804
to be more consistent with
our average value formula,

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:37.338
and we're talking about
the interval from a to b,

00:08:37.338 --> 00:08:42.338
we've already seen how to
calculate the average value,

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:47.405
so maybe the average value
is that right over there,

00:08:47.405 --> 00:08:52.304
so that is g average, so
our average value is this,

00:08:52.304 --> 00:08:53.988
the mean value theorem for
integrals just tells us

00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:58.787
there's some c where our
function must take on

00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:03.105
that value at c, whereas that c is inside,

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:06.806
where the c is in that interval.
