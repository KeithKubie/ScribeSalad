00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.920
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're going to do a bit

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.890
of a deep dive in classifying
different types of goods.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.100
And before we even get
into the thick of things,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm gonna make some definitions.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.160
So the first definition
is that of a rival good.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.400
Now, a rival good, one
way to think about it is,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.920
if one person uses it,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.230
it impairs the possibility
of another person using it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.980
or it impairs the ability
of another person using it.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.730
So one person,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.230
one person or party using it,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.950
using it

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.300
impairs or oftentimes
prevents another party,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900
another person

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.160
from using it or getting the benefit,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.530
using it.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.320
And we're going to talk
a lot about some goods

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.840
that are rival goods
versus non-rival goods.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.200
Now, another related idea
is that of excludability.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.610
And as we'll see, sometimes
these things go together,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.280
but sometimes they aren't.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.183
So excludable,

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:06.520
excludable means that you could
stop someone from using it,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.650
can stop someone,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.010
someone from using it,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620
you can exclude them,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.620
using it.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.650
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna set up a bit of a matrix

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.070
where, on one axis, I'm gonna think about

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.860
whether something is a rival good or not,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.560
and then, on another axis,
I'm going to think about

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.950
whether it's excludable or not.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.053
So let me just do a big
two-by-two matrix here.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.293
So,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.783
that it looks big enough for me.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.540
Then I said I would do two by two.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.030
That looks like about halfway.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.100
I always underestimate.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.140
Okay, that looks about halfway,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.280
and now we'll do it here as well.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340
And so on this axis, I'm gonna think about

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120
whether something is a rival good or not.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.680
So rival good,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.880
question mark.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.510
This row is it is a rival good.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.010
This row is it is not a rival good.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.130
And then for the columns,
I'm going to think about

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.610
whether something is an excludable good,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.233
so excludable.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.230
Excludable, question mark.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.260
Yes and no.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.010
So let's start in this
first top-left cell.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.590
So what are examples of things

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.930
that are both excludable

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.410
and rival goods?

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.550
Pause this video, and see
if you can think of any.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.320
Well, actually many of the
things that we imagine buying

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.710
or using fall into this top-left category,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.170
things like a,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.300
so, let's say bananas.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.720
Bananas are for sure excludable.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.790
I could prevent someone
from taking my banana.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.350
You have to pay in order
to have access to a banana.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.390
And it for sure is a rival good.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.360
If I have a banana, especially
if I eat that banana,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.350
well, that's definitely
going to impair your ability

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.150
to eat that banana.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.563
Another example is clothing.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.010
It's definitely a rival good.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.060
If I'm wearing this shirt,
it's going to be very difficult

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.840
for you to wear that shirt as well.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.320
And like bananas, you can force someone

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.940
to pay money for that clothing.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.320
They're not just going
to get as much clothing

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.110
as they want for free.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.543
You could think of housing.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.630
You can exclude someone from your house

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.930
or from an arbitrary house.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.770
They have to pay for it or pay the rent.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.070
And it's a rival good.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.050
If one person or one
family is using a house,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.440
it definitely impairs the ability

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.160
for another family to use the house.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.320
And we could keep thinking of more

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.210
and more ideas in this top left.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.210
In general, goods in this top
left are called private goods,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.970
private,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.953
private goods.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.960
Now, let's imagine going to
things that are excludable

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.580
but maybe not as rivalrous.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.460
And there's really a
large spectrum of things.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.410
And as we'll see in the
future and you could imagine,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.900
some things are kind of blurring the line

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.370
or depends at what
context you're using it.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.800
But one example of
something that is excludable

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.680
but is not necessarily a rival good,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.290
that one person using it doesn't prevent

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.780
the other person from using it in theory,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.380
something like satellite television,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.623
satellite,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.030
satellite TV.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.230
Why is that excludable?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.930
Well, you can force someone to pay

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.900
to access satellite television.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.930
Only if you have access
to some type of a device

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.520
or some code, you might be
able to watch the signal.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.440
But the reason why it's
not a rival good is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.670
you have the satellites in space,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.930
here's my little satellite,
and it's beaming,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.900
it's beaming the signal down to Earth.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.710
And in theory, if I'm
receiving the signal here

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.190
and I'm watching satellite television,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.480
it doesn't impair someone else ability

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.070
to get to watch that satellite signal.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.240
But we have artificially made it scarce

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.470
by perhaps making people pay for that,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.300
even though everyone else,
everyone could use it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.200
without impairing the ability
for anyone else to use it.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.680
And so that's why this category of goods

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.270
is often called artificially scarce good,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.513
artificially scarce.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.780
The scarcity is artificially happening

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.930
because you're making it excludable,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.700
but it doesn't necessarily have to.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.863
Another example could be
something like a private park.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.400
If I go buy a bunch of land
and I landscape it nicely,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.270
I might say that you have to spend $1,000

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.600
to get entry to that park.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.610
Well, that is very, that's very exclusive,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.550
and I'm clearly excluding
people from that park.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.430
But in theory,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.260
if I go and enjoy that park
and if it's large enough,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.270
well, it doesn't necessarily
impair the ability

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.390
for someone else to
enjoy the park as well.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.430
Now, if all of a sudden thousands

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.940
or millions of people
tried to enjoy the park,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.370
then it might become a
little bit more rivalrous.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.570
Now let's go on the other side,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.940
things that are not so excludable.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.250
Well, if we think about
things that are rival goods

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.250
but not excludable, the classic
example here is fish stocks,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.780
fish stocks.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.530
When we're talking about fish
stocks, we're talking about,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.400
let's imagine some body of water here,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.603
and there are fish in this body of water.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.250
And let's say that everyone could,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.100
you can't exclude people from it,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.580
so anyone can go and stick
their fishing rod into this,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.400
into this pond or into
this lake and get fish.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.080
But the problem is, is
that if I get a fish,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.400
that's going to make it hard
for someone else to get fish.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.750
And you can imagine an extreme,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.990
if enough people are grabbing the fish,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.730
it is impairing the ability
for other folks to get fish.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.880
And so this type of resource

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.650
or I should say this type of good

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.240
is known as a common resource,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.000
common,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.653
common resource.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.370
And it's prone to what is known
as tragedy of the commons,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.630
and we have a whole video
on tragedy of the commons.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.820
But the tragedy of commons,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.430
which happens for common
resources is when every

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.020
individual person acts in
their own best interest,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.080
they might say, hey, I'm just gonna get

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.020
as much fish as I need
to support my family,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.460
I could even make a business
out of it, I can sell it.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.870
At the end of the day, you
might do something that's not

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.190
in the common interest,
and it's actually not even

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.240
in your own personal interest long term.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.650
Because if enough people
fish in the short term

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.370
and get that benefit, you
might deplete all the fish,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.720
and they're not able to reproduce.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.370
And then at some point,
there are no fish left.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.150
So in the medium to long run,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.680
you have hurt everyone,
including yourself.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.960
So that would be the
tragedy of the commons,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.060
which is typical for a lot of things

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.560
that are common resources.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.820
Another thing that you could view

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.750
as a common resource is timber

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.240
or wood that's on land
that anyone could access.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.570
In a lot of cases, clean, clean water,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.820
fresh water I should say,
not salt water, fresh water.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.470
Now, on some level, if there's
a lot of folks doing it,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.850
it's definitely going to be rivalrous.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.790
But if there's only one or two people

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.650
and your source of fresh water is huge,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.460
well, then it might feel
a little less rivalrous.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.730
So once again, we can debate,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.530
it might be under different circumstances.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.360
Now, last but not least, let's
think about what are examples

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.490
of things that are neither
rivalrous nor excludable?

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.880
And that whole category
is referred to as public,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.070
public goods.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.820
Pause this video, and see
if you can think of any.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.300
Well, one thing that is often

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.640
considered a public good is air.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.890
Now, you could debate,
at some extreme level,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.010
if the air is really used up or something,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.260
you might start to feel
like it's rivalrous.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.630
But for most cases, when
one person is breathing air,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.100
it's not impairing the ability

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.090
for someone else to use the air.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.740
And it's very hard to exclude
someone from breathing.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.280
People just need to take a breath.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.230
So it sits out here in public goods.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.690
You can imagine something
like national defense,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.053
national defense.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.340
If you are benefiting
from national defense

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.830
because of aircraft
carriers and missile systems

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.120
and planes and the military
that the nation has,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.000
does that exclude me, your neighbor,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.960
from also benefiting from it?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.910
No, and in fact, it would be
very difficult to exclude.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.140
You would have to kick
me out of the country

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.840
for me to not benefit
from the national defense.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.600
So in general, we would consider
it to be non-excludable.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.920
And then is it a rival good?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.040
Well, if you are feeling safe
because of national defense,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.770
that doesn't impair my ability

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.130
to feel safe from national defense.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.860
So it's also a non-rival good,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.090
at least in most general circumstances.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.340
So I would consider that
a public good as well.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.020
Now, when we talk about public goods,

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.080
there's the notion of
the free rider problem,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.950
free rider,

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.050
and that's because you can't
exclude folks from using it.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.530
It's usually not in the
incentive of any entrepreneur

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.400
to try to make these public goods happen.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.220
And so this is typically
the domain of government.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.420
And in general, when thinking
about this whole column

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.150
of things that are
non-excludable, this is a domain

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.410
where the government
tries to get involved.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.620
So we don't have the
tragedy of the commons

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.370
with fish stocks or timber or fresh water,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.020
they might put some regulation in

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.370
or some permitting process.
