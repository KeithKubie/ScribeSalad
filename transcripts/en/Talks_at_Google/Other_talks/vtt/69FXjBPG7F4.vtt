LOGAN URY: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.010
This is the first in our series
about modern relationships,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.600
and it's great to
have you all here.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.860
My name is Logan Ury.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.120
I help lead a team at Google
called the Irrational Lab.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.360
We're a behavioral
economics team.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.610
And we're very lucky to
have Sherry Turkle here

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.400
today in a conversation
about conversations.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.010
Sherry is a MIT professor
who has spent the last 30

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.600
years studying the psychology
of people's relationships

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.000
with technology.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.040
She's also the founder and
director of the MIT Initiative

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920
on Technology and Self.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.970
She's a licensed
psychologist and has

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.980
written four books
on our relationship

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.550
with digital culture.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.370
These include "The Second
Self," "Life on the Screen,"

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.999
"Alone Together," and now
"Reclaiming Conversation."

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.040
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.600
SHERRY TURKLE: I'm delighted
to be here-- really delighted

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.766
LOGAN URY: So today we'll
be covering your new book,

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.930
"Reclaiming Conversation,"
how we can improve

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.966
romantic relationships,
how this relates to Google,

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.590
and then we'll open
it up to questions.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.370
SHERRY TURKLE: Wait a minute.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.650
Wait.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.170
LOGAN URY: Yeah?

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.503
SHERRY TURKLE: How we can
improve romantic relationships

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:04.099
and how that relates to Google?

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.129
LOGAN URY: There's
a comma in between.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.572
SHERRY TURKLE: There's a comma.

00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:07.344
LOGAN URY: But it could
also be connected.

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.610
SHERRY TURKLE: I feel like
I really prepared for this,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.410
and then all of a sudden
I felt unprepared.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.670
I'd really gotten
myself together,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.462
and then all of a sudden
I felt unprepared.

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:17.920
LOGAN URY: And for
those of you who

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.489
want to take out
that comma, we're

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:21.530
going to open it up for
the questions at the end.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.640
SHERRY TURKLE: You have some
expertise I don't have, right.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.590
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.520
So just to start
off with the book,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.250
you talk about how
reclaiming conversation

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.699
begins with reclaiming
our capacity for solitude.

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:32.490
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.906
LOGAN URY: Can you
talk about what

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.450
we lose when we're alone
because of our devices,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.710
and what the value
of solitude is,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.520
and how it's different
from loneliness?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.394
SHERRY TURKLE: Right.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:44.210
Well, I think that this
probably-- the professor in me

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.500
wants to say that this
probably is the most

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.900
important piece of my argument.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.720
And here's why.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.200
Criticisms of my work, even as
recently as a Pew study that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.166
came out just a few months
ago, people say things like,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:02.790
OK, well, look.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.897
Let's give Sherry Turkle this.

00:02:04.897 --> 00:02:06.730
If you're together with
your friends and you

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.500
take out a phone, not good.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.620
Let's give her that, that
that kind of interrupts

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.340
the conversation and cuts
certain kinds of conversations

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.680
short.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.440
But if you're alone and
you take out your phone,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.840
why does that bother her?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.860
What's it to her if,
when you're alone,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.440
you're on the constant feed
and you can't-- what is she,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.080
the Darth Vader of the internet?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.700
I mean, what's with that?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.690
And actually I do
make the argument

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.655
that solitude and the
capacity for conversation

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:49.860
and relationship go together,
and they go together like this.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.700
Solitude is the capacity
to be alone with yourself,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.520
to know who you are so that
when you come to another person,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.550
you can hear what
they have to say

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.040
and not-- you can listen to them
and hear what they have to say

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.610
and who they are, and
not need to project who

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.270
you need them to be on to them.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.300
And we all know that
when we meet somebody

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.060
who doesn't know who they
are, and who can't stand

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.920
to be alone, and comes
to us for, quote,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.210
"conversation," they're not
having a conversation at all.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.830
They're kind of glomming onto
us to get us to almost support

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.980
their fragile selves.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.020
So if you, when you're
alone, are constantly

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.750
going to your phone
instead of being

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.640
able to tolerate that moment
of gathering yourself,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.580
that's a kind of wake-up
call for you to make sure

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.280
that you're comfortable with
who you are and have cultivated

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.860
this capacity for solitude.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.820
And recent research
is not happy research.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.200
I mean, part of why
I wrote this book is

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.874
that recent research on solitude
and conversation is chilling.

00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:14.790
There's this study that
shows that if you just

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.339
ask college students to
sit in a chair without--

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.660
and this is not my research,
but I'm reporting research.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.340
You ask them to sit in
a chair without a phone,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.160
without a book, and
say, we're going

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.322
to ask you to do this
for 6 to 15 minutes.

00:04:30.322 --> 00:04:31.280
Are you good with that?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.480
They say, sure.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.230
Then you say, well,
we're going to ask you

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.420
to do this for 6 to 15 minutes.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.160
Do you think that you'd want to
give yourself an electroshock

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.000
during that time?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.770
They say, uh, I don't think so!

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.650
And they look as though
the researcher is crazy.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.530
And then after six
minutes, they begin

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.290
to self-administer electroshocks
rather than just sit quietly

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.870
with their own thoughts.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.980
And this actually is
borne out in my research.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.710
I do research at
stop signs, where

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.460
that's like a three-second,
four-second stop.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.400
People pull out a
phone at a stop sign.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.225
They will not sit at a stop
sign without pulling out a phone

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:18.640
to check what's happening.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.100
So perhaps enough said.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.530
But there is a question.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.310
Of course, in
"Reclaiming Conversation"

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.240
I go on and on about
how people talk

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.960
about their incapacity, their
anxiety about being alone

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.170
with their thoughts, and how
they want to fill that space up

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.060
with what's on their phone,
and what that anxiety

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.830
is about, and so forth.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.970
So I actually think that
reclaiming conversation,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.120
reclaiming relationship, does
begin with reclaiming ourselves

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.360
in solitude.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.010
And this kind of false
dichotomy between,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.790
oh, give it to Sherry
that we're together, OK,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.844
we should lighten up with the
phone, but when we're alone,

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:03.260
it's none of her
business, I think

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.632
I'd like to break that down.

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:06.340
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.930
On a related note, the book
emphasizes the importance

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.789
of boredom, especially
for children.

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:11.580
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.320
LOGAN URY: Can you talk a bit
about what comes out of boredom

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.940
and why it's so important?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.860
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
neurophysiologically, a lot's

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.970
going on in boredom that is not
boring for your brain at all.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.890
Boredom is the time when your
brain is actually establishing

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.230
what's called the default
mode network, which

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.470
is the brain's sense of its
stable, autobiographical self.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:43.220
So in those moments of downtime,
your brain is very busy indeed.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.780
And again, if your idea
of a moment of boredom

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.820
is an opportunity to fill in
with the feed on your phone,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.690
you're depriving your brain
of something it really needs.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.040
Beyond that, boredom
is considered

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.260
by most psychologists
to be one of the signal

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.430
achievements of childhood.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.600
The capacity to be bored
and let your mind wander

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.820
is your imagination
calling to you to go inward

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.070
rather than to turn outward to
a phone or some other device.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:28.960
Which is why somebody like
me is so concerned with baby

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.600
bouncers that have
slots for an iPad,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.090
with potty trainers that
have slots for an iPad.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.110
These things were either moments
where a caretaker and a child

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.250
should have been allowed to
engage in the beginnings of eye

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.810
contact, communication,
conversation,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.820
or they're moments for reverie.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.700
And to think that these are
minutes for screen stimulation

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.084
again is robbing us of
an important moment.

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.250
LOGAN URY: Another key theme
in the book is empathy.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.320
And you mention
that a meta study

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.040
found a 40% decrease in
empathy in college students

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.840
over the past 20 years.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.390
You also mention
that kids who spend

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.460
five days at a device-free camp
displayed much more empathy

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.529
than a control group.

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:21.320
What can you tell us
about the relationship

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.881
between technology and empathy?

00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.630
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
I would say that this

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.760
is the sort of
leitmotif of the book,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.210
is this kind of empathy
crisis, because I was brought

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.730
in to studying the book
when I was asked to consult

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.370
by middle schools
about what teachers

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.409
felt were disturbing patterns
in middle school students.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.950
Which I wouldn't have
known from my own life

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.350
as an MIT professor.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.020
What I knew from my
life as an MIT professor

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.970
is that students didn't want
to come to office hours.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.520
Students want to
send in an email

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.750
and compose a perfect
question, and have

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.280
me write them back
a perfect answer,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.855
a kind of transactional model of
what goes on with a professor.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.230
And I didn't have
reason to think it was

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.260
because they lacked empathy.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.710
What I knew is that
they didn't know

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.800
the work that
conversation can do

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.150
in terms of sparking learning.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.330
Because nobody who loves
learning or who grew up to be

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.200
a professor was because
they wrote a professor

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.920
a perfect letter and got
a perfect letter back.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.520
It was because, on
the contrary, they

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.410
didn't have a perfect letter.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.270
They came in with
nothing, or little,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.660
and somebody said, well,
that's not very good,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.950
but I'm going to stick with
you because I care about you.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.900
Come back, and
we'll work on this.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.330
It wasn't because
they wrote a perfect

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.190
and got a perfect return.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:11.150
So I noticed a kind of lack,
a kind of transactional idea

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.225
about what a conversation was.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.720
But then I was asked to
do this consulting work

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.100
in middle schools,
where teachers

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:31.710
were observing a lack of
empathy among younger kids.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.390
And we're used to thinking
of cyberbullying as well.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.050
People don't see the face.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.890
And so, OK, they
cyberbullied because the face

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.230
isn't called up,
which is what calls up

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.100
the sort of moral
response in us.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.540
Philosophers have
been telling us

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.780
that for years, that
it's the face that

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.190
calls up our moral selves.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.055
But now psychology
is teaching us

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:59.700
that it's actually the lack of
a face, the lack of an identity,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.920
is what causes this
online-- I call it

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.900
a sort of disinhibition
that leads to cyberbullying.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.320
But now you're seeing that among
kids in face-to-face behavior.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.870
The way one teacher put
it, that 12-year-olds play

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.890
on the playground
like 8-year-olds,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.110
that they'll exclude a child,
and then they can't imagine,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.930
they can't put themselves
in the place of that child.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.760
They're not able to do
what empathy requires,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.780
which is to put themselves
in the place of.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:43.430
And the teachers began to
talk about that in one school.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.860
And in their mind, it had to do
with the way these kids weren't

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.580
talking to each other, but
were really almost all the time

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.300
talking to each other
through their phones.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.770
So in the lunchroom, their
way of talking to each other

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:03.000
was to take out their phones
and show each other what

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.400
was on their phones.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.830
And in fact, when I went to
camps, these device-free camps

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.930
where the empathy
level goes way back up,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.460
I think because kids
talk to each other

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.140
and get this practice in putting
yourself in the other person's

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.730
place-- I don't think this is
complicated-- the kids said

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.800
that what was different between
their relationships at camp

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.000
and at home was that
they spoke to each other,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.940
not about what's on
their phones but what

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.940
was just happening at camp.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.650
So there were signs from a lot
of different places and spaces

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:44.610
that there was something
up with empathy.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:51.360
And since the early days
of working on this book,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.900
this empathy gap has
certainly become a major theme

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.460
both in my work and
throughout the research

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.980
literature in psychology.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.020
I will say that I recently just
spent a day with the woman who

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:10.080
did the study showing the 40%
decline in the past 20 years

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.900
among college students,
big empathy drop.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:19.160
And she is developing
empathy apps for the iPhone.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.620
And I think that's where
I'd love, in a Q&amp;A,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.360
to hear your thoughts.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:32.750
I mean, because here
we are at a place where

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:39.190
it's not out of line to think
of you developing empathy apps.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:45.840
And clearly I think of
us as the empathy app.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.980
We are the empathy app, since
the way we develop empathy

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.470
is to talk to each other.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.510
But I'm not closed
at all to the idea

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:08.350
of using technology to help
us in reclaiming empathy.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:14.380
But my first instinct is,
we are the empathy app.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.680
We need to talk to each other.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.710
We need to talk to
our kids, that somehow

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.300
putting a baby in a baby bouncer
and putting a screen that

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.790
has an empathy app
in front of this baby

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.780
instead of putting
you-- and yet I

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.960
felt for her that
she was so upset

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.340
when she got this response.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.030
She got this result. She
wanted to do something.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.640
And I think that that's part of
one of the themes of the book,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.010
is that it's not
anti-technology.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.140
It's pro-conversation,
that sometimes we

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:53.260
just need to know when to
be there for each other.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.750
So anyway, that's
my empathy story.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.030
Clearly I'm-- oh, and also,
what's the difference between

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.196
empathy and compassion?

00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:02.570
Since the book
came out-- I mean,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.720
really I wrote it to
spark a conversation

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.470
about conversation.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.310
There's been a lot
of talk about, well,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.140
empathy isn't as
important as compassion.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.710
I mean, look at all the
stuff we learned about places

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.720
all over the world because
we have the internet.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.340
Now maybe the
important thing we have

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.640
is compassion for all these
things we don't know about,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.790
and maybe empathy is
a little old-school.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.487
So I'm here to say I don't
think empathy is old-school.

00:15:30.487 --> 00:15:32.070
LOGAN URY: So now I
want to transition

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.710
a bit into talking about--

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.980
SHERRY TURKLE: Romance.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.063
LOGAN URY: Modern romance.

00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:37.250
So in the book, you
mention that the sight

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.950
of a phone on a table,
even if it's silent,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.720
even if it turns over, worsens
the quality of the conversation

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.749
and makes it less empathetic.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:46.540
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.831
LOGAN URY: So I'm definitely
going to take that advice.

00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:51.670
I was wondering what other
advice you have for people here

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.900
who feel like
technology is getting

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.314
in the way of their
romantic connections.

00:15:56.314 --> 00:15:58.105
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
this study is amazing.

00:15:58.105 --> 00:16:02.550
I mean, if you just did one
thing, but not just in romance,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.300
in your families,
in your friendships,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.040
with your children,
with your everybody--

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.370
so just make sure you understand
the setup of this experiment.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.862
Take two people out to lunch.

00:16:12.862 --> 00:16:15.320
Obviously you don't tell them
what the experiment is about.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.900
You feed them their lunch.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.510
On the table, there's a phone
turned off and turned over.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.200
And you're measuring
their conversation

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.500
against a control
group with no phone.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.980
Just the silent
phone on the table

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.200
will cause the conversation to
go to truly trivial matters.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.720
And the people will report
less of a sense of connection

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.680
with each other, less of a
sense of caring about each other

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.160
or of understanding what's
on the other person's mind--

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.770
just the presence of that phone.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.400
So they re-did the study.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.890
I mean, it was such
an amazing study.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:55.340
They re-did the study
in a natural setting.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.500
Forget the laboratory and giving
people lunch in a laboratory.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.170
In a natural setting
like a shopping mall,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.700
and they just put the
phones on the periphery

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.790
of people's vision--
I mean, like

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.190
at the edge of people's vision.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.079
And again they found that even
a silent phone disconnects us.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:17.740
So the most important
thing you can do on a date,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.010
or on a breakfast,
or at a lunch,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:26.670
or at a business meeting, or at
an anything where your goal is

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:32.630
to have the conversation
not degrade to trivialities,

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.050
to maybe make an empathic
connection, like maybe

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.380
like a second date
where somebody-- or more

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.120
than that, the first
step in falling in love

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.910
has to be that somebody
feels that something big is

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.866
at stake-- is put
away your phone.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.490
It's not enough to
turn off your phone.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.840
Put away your phone.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.190
Because a phone reminds
us, whether or not

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.720
we want it to
remind us, that you

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.980
have the capacity
to be elsewhere.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.490
It's not even that you
want to be elsewhere,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.590
but that you have the
capacity to be elsewhere.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.440
So I think that before I go
on to other Turkle tips--

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.390
because I must say that
the research on this book--

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.350
and a whole chapter
is on romance--

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:23.894
I'm surprisingly filled
with tips and advice.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:26.670
And the book was reviewed by
Jonathan Franzen in the "New

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.230
York Times," and he
described it as in part

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.570
a kind of like
totally high-class

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.840
academic self-help book.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.380
And I couldn't figure out if
that was like good or bad.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.766
LOGAN URY: I wanted
to ask you about that.

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.140
SHERRY TURKLE: On
the one hand, I

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.790
thought, kiss of death
with my colleagues,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.120
like people will never
again invite me to lunch.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.810
And then I thought, well, after
investigating conversation

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.950
and empathy, why
shouldn't I have

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.590
written a book that actually
tells some people things

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:04.680
about how to be an
advocate for conversation?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.580
So I decided to own it.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.820
So I'm OK with that.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.200
But that is the most
important thing you can do,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.730
is really sacred spaces.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.730
Put away your phone.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.490
And then sacred spaces
for conversation--

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.290
the dinner, the kitchen,
the dining room, the car.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.080
The car.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.132
You're driving-- and I
was about to cross myself,

00:19:29.132 --> 00:19:30.090
even though I'm Jewish.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.570
Really, it's not the place.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.930
No devices.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.490
And if you're in a family,
you tell your family,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.680
we need to talk to each
other in this family.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.350
That's important to
me in our family,

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.280
that we talk to each other.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.715
That's just how
it's going to be.

00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:54.120
It's easier to tell this to
somebody who's a younger child,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.060
but an older child or a
boyfriend or girlfriend

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.622
you can also tell.

00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:03.080
If you're sitting next to your
boyfriend-- you're driving--

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.150
and he takes out his phone,
you say, it's important to me

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.410
that we talk.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.590
And if he doesn't like
it, you just repeat.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.340
And then the same thing
if your girlfriend

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.830
is using that as her time to
catch up on her social media

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.990
feeds.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.190
Create a culture
in the car where

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.050
that's a time for talking.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.630
And I think that's
very important.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.170
A third tip, and
this is something

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:33.770
that was so important in the
interviews I did on romance,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.650
was the-- I call it
the nothing gambit.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:44.640
In romance, so often what you
get back in texting is nothing.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.710
And people talk to me about it.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.670
They ask me, in
history, could you

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:54.926
ever do that before, people
just dropping out like nothing?

00:20:54.926 --> 00:20:58.660
And, like, nothing?

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:07.100
And actually, people
could not call you back,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.590
but that's a little different.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.610
That's like a statement.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.360
That's saying, I'm
not calling you back.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.350
But it's not like in the middle
of a conversation-- I say this.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.230
You say this.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.472
I say this.

00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:20.400
[SILENCE]

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.910
And people actually experience
that quite differently,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.180
as, the date ends.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.130
There's just nothing after.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.690
And people sort of say, well,
she didn't call me back.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.280
He didn't call me back.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.340
You could check.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.170
Some people check in to-- they
know they shouldn't, but they

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:42.670
do.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.600
But sometimes
there's a check-in,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.770
but people kind of know that
if there's a great quieting,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.380
they know what happened.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.440
But it's almost as though the
human nervous system isn't

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.370
set up for conversation in which
you say this, and I say this,

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:04.800
and I say this, and-- and
people find it quite upsetting.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.540
And I would say that
it isn't a good way

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:14.260
to end your relationships
because it actually

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.070
causes distress and
disorientation, much

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.940
more than you mean to cause.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.990
Because usually when people
are doing the nothing response,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.750
all they're doing
is they're deciding

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.458
they really don't want
to go out anymore.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.307
It's really like
not calling back.

00:22:32.307 --> 00:22:33.973
But they're not
treating it like they're

00:22:33.973 --> 00:22:35.660
in the middle of a conversation.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.960
They're treating it
like they've had a date,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.460
and they don't want to call her
again to go on another date,

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.550
or call him again.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.560
But psychologically,
it's not like that.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.680
LOGAN URY: So what
should people do instead?

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.830
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, the
best thing to do is say--

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.085
and this is the thing
that no one wants to do,

00:22:54.085 --> 00:22:55.710
but again, it's to
have a conversation,

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.850
like I loved our date.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.500
It was so fun, and I just loved
going to the [? Gotzengould ?]

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.000
opera.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.320
It was amazing that you
thought to invite me there.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.160
We share so little.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.640
But in business, there's
this ridiculous--

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.760
when you have a
manuscript turned down,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.820
or I don't know how many of you
have submitted film scripts,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.210
there's this new
line, we've decided

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.860
to go in another direction.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.650
Have you heard this?

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.330
Have you heard this
line, we've decided

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.830
to go in another direction?

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.660
It's actually a very
interesting line

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.737
because it basically doesn't
say your thing is bad.

00:23:38.737 --> 00:23:40.820
It says, we've decided to
go in another direction.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.270
You just say, you know,
I really had a good time,

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.330
but I think this just
isn't right for me.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.860
And it's the functional
equivalent of,

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.884
I decided to go in
another direction.

00:23:50.884 --> 00:23:52.300
Which the first
time I heard it, I

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.230
thought, oh, this
is so pretentious.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:58.270
It must have been
invented in California.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.460
But actually I've
come to appreciate it.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.140
I've just come to appreciate
it because I think it actually

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.020
is very honest.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.730
I mean, it actually is kind.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.430
It's saying, I'm going--
it's accurate in some sort

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.600
of bizarre-- it's like, I'm
going in another direction.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.600
So the kindest thing is
to just actually complete

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.920
the conversation.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.420
I'm going in another direction.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.630
Which is what you say
when you say that I think

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.700
that this isn't right for me.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.450
I like "it isn't right for me."

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.980
Continuing on a romantic
basis isn't right for me.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.712
So that's my love tip.

00:24:38.712 --> 00:24:40.170
LOGAN URY: We'll
check on your mic.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.610
On a related note, one of
the most memorable stories

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.290
in your book, and Aziz Ansari
also put this in his book

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.020
from your research,
was the story

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.100
of a young man
who had a standing

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.180
date with his grandparents
to have dinner there.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.060
And when he wanted
to cancel, he just

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.915
wanted to send them a text or an
email to say he couldn't come.

00:24:55.915 --> 00:24:57.200
And his mom said no.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.354
SHERRY TURKLE: So did Aziz
quote me, or did I quote Aziz?

00:25:00.354 --> 00:25:01.770
LOGAN URY: Aziz
quoted you, right?

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.706
SHERRY TURKLE: Yeah.

00:25:02.706 --> 00:25:04.285
LOGAN URY: Yeah, OK.

00:25:04.285 --> 00:25:06.910
SHERRY TURKLE: Because Aziz and
I worked together for a minute.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.940
It could have been either.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.960
LOGAN URY: I think
it's your research.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.793
SHERRY TURKLE: Yeah.

00:25:09.793 --> 00:25:12.990
LOGAN URY: So the mom said, you
have to call your grandparents.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.695
And in calling the grandparents,
he heard the disappointment

00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:16.320
in their voice.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.694
They had already
started cooking.

00:25:17.694 --> 00:25:18.660
They had set the table.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.042
And it was much
harder to cancel.

00:25:20.042 --> 00:25:22.000
And I just thought that
was so profound because

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.610
of not only how people break
up, but just general flakiness.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.407
So maybe you can talk
a bit about that.

00:25:27.407 --> 00:25:29.490
But I thought that was
just such a good tip, which

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.700
is if you want to
cancel plans, you

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.430
should suffer the
consequences of knowing

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.660
how it affects the person.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.230
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, this has
also to do with apologizing.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.540
What was nice about
this story was

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.910
that it came upon very
naturally in the family.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.420
So this was the
mother's parents--

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.710
and they lived very close--
would invite the son over

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.290
to-- I think he was 11-- would
invite him over to dinner.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.720
And it wasn't like Thanksgiving.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.240
This wasn't Rosh Hashanah.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.900
I mean, it was just like,
come over to dinner.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.800
And as he got a
little bit older,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.330
because it wasn't like a
big holiday or something,

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.670
he just got preoccupied
with other things.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.460
And this thing settled in
where because he didn't

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.360
have to see them, he could
just type, I'm sorry,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.710
can't come, and hit Send.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.890
And it really was not
good for the family.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:41.120
And he was not feeling that
he was causing distress.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.090
And the mother just decided that
he had to at least call them

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.830
because when he
called, he got to hear,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:55.430
your grandfather went to get
sundaes with caramel sauce,

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.250
and he got all the toppings,
like you do a sundae bar.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.822
There's a roast in the oven.

00:27:01.822 --> 00:27:03.530
I'm making your favorite
russet potatoes.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.860
I mean, he got to hear
that actually they

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.360
were going to have this dinner
anyway, the grandfather liked

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.550
the caramel sauce
anyway, that it wasn't as

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.320
though these people were
incompetent and dependent

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.470
and were going to fall apart.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.680
But he was going to be missed.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.350
And I think that that's
what you don't get with,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.660
I'm sorry, and hit Send.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.260
Because the dance of what
happens in an apology--

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.260
I mean, take it to the higher
level for romantic purposes.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.935
An apology is so important.

00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:34.650
And in my book, I
interview a woman

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.920
who says, if my boyfriend
apologizes by phone,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.170
I know 100% of the
time that we are

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.300
going to go back
over this again,

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.400
because none of the work
of an apology gets done.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:52.400
Because in an apology, I get to
see-- I'm apologizing to you.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.860
I get to see that you're upset.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.820
Then you get to
see that I'm upset.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.020
And so you soften.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.120
You think, OK, she's really--
my grandmother used to say,

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.520
don't apologize until
you're contrite enough,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.090
or it's not going to work.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.490
Hold off.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.560
Think about it
until you mean it,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.190
or else it's not going to work.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.560
An apology is not
saying I'm sorry.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.150
You have to have this
whole dance go on.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.750
So then you see I'm really
upset, and you soften.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.820
What, you can't
make eye contact?

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:26.320
AUDIENCE: I didn't
do anything wrong.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.430
SHERRY TURKLE: No, no, no, look.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.850
But you see how hard it is?

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:35.990
Because then you have to
see that I really feel bad.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.760
It's hard, because then you
have to see I really feel bad.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.970
And then I see, ah,
I have an opening.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.480
Now you can break
our eye contact.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:51.300
I have an opening that I can
make something happen here.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.950
But unless I see
that he-- the reason

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.280
I was disoriented
when he looked away

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.320
is because I was actually
trying to put myself

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.740
into that state of mind.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.890
Do I have an opening with this
guy where if I say I'm sorry,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.310
we can move to something else?

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:11.550
And that's a whole
complicated dance

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.490
of people learning empathy.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.860
And if you don't do that,
if you don't teach that,

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.860
if you don't model that, if
you don't learn all of that,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.920
you're missing a lot.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.295
In a romantic context, that's
sort of back to basics.

00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:31.420
I mean, people are hurting
each other all the time.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.470
I mean, there's no way to have
a close relationship in which

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.550
you're not having bumps.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.120
If you're not
having bumps, you're

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.734
not in a close relationship.

00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:40.400
I mean, it's almost
you put it that way,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.577
that it's not just like
in a close relationship,

00:29:42.577 --> 00:29:44.160
there are obviously
going to be bumps.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.535
But if there aren't
bumps, you're

00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:47.130
not in a close relationship.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:53.880
So being able to
have ways of saying,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.070
hey, what I did
wasn't cool, or hey,

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.510
I can understand
how you felt there,

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.000
that becomes part of the
dance of the relationship.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.410
And if you're not doing
that face to face,

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.270
the balance of things
isn't going to work.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.066
So I would not use
texting for that purpose.

00:30:12.066 --> 00:30:13.690
LOGAN URY: So that's
a great transition

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.014
into my next question,
which is about eye contact.

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:18.430
And I thought a lot about this
as I was reading your book,

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.100
and now as I'm talking to you.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.380
And it just seems
like eye contact

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.680
is such a key part of exchanging
information and a developing

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.290
connection.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.750
And a few months
ago, this article

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.970
came out about 36 questions
that lead to love.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.950
And it ends with people
staring into each other's eyes

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.400
for four minutes.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.566
So I think as we're going
through Turkle tips,

00:30:38.566 --> 00:30:40.690
we should think a little
bit more about eye contact

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.665
and really what it
can do for intimacy.

00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:43.540
SHERRY TURKLE: Right.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.940
Well, obviously eye
contact is so important.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.960
And that's why
really I want people

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.640
to think so hard about
screens in front of kids

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.910
during moments when parents
used to look at them.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.080
I have a very close colleague
at MIT, Cynthia Breazeal,

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.230
who's developing robots
that will read to children.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:13.570
And I certainly get the gist.

00:31:16.395 --> 00:31:19.170
They will learn more
words, socioeconomic groups

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.810
that don't have words.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:31.090
But really, money for people
who would be with those kids

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:36.025
and read to them-- I mean,
a half-million dollars

00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:38.700
to have some people
reading to those kids

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.330
so they could make eye contact.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.480
I really worry about that,
that they would actually

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.010
develop something that people
will put in their homes

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.590
so they can do their
email, and the robot

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.870
will read to the children.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.900
I really worry about
this, or the idea

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.590
of putting a baby bouncer
and having an activity,

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.640
this slot for a pad.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.195
Because eye contact is so
crucial for developmentally,

00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:09.770
and it's so crucial
in every relationship.

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:15.990
And Skyping is so
interesting because in order

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.684
for-- let's say I'm
Skyping with you.

00:32:19.684 --> 00:32:22.092
No, actually him.

00:32:22.092 --> 00:32:23.760
LOGAN URY: You're next.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.596
SHERRY TURKLE: In order-- no,
now you have to look at me.

00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:29.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.550
In order to-- or
I'll Skype with him.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.370
He wants to.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.490
In order to Skype-- OK,
you don't want to Skype.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.890
In order to Skype
with you, and for you

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.730
to have the feeling that
I'm looking at you, which

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:51.430
is crucial to me, let's say,
if I want you to bond with me,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.070
if I want you to feel the
full blast of my attention,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.340
I have to look at the camera.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.480
So I can't be
looking at anything

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.350
happening in order to give you
the experience of I'm looking

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.390
at you.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:10.680
Now, how effed up is that,
that I'm having no experience,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.480
or I'm only pretending to
have an experience in order

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.470
to give you a fake experience
that I'm looking at you?

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:27.110
So Skyping is really
perfect for a couple.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.700
Bringing you to the romantic
thing, you're in love.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.720
You're at a distance.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.530
You're in Chicago.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.870
She's in New York.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.130
You're cooking dinner.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.680
You set up to Skype.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.210
And as you're each cooking
dinner, you're on Skype,

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.410
and you're chatting.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.320
And you have that
sense of co-presence,

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.130
and you're seeing each other's
bodies as you both cook dinner.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.530
Fantastic.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.750
In different states
of undress or whatever

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.060
you want, whatever
you want to do.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.860
But that's what
it's optimized for.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:03.785
It is not the place to do this.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.510
And I've found, studying
different kinds of conference

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.630
calling where theoretically the
camera situation is much more

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.250
diffuse, so you should be able
to have that feeling of looking

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.580
in each other's eyes,
is also very complicated

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:29.120
because there comes a point
where somebody feels they're

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.870
in the main room
and some other group

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.106
feels they're not
in the main room.

00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:35.730
And it usually
happens-- sometimes it's

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.674
not clear where the main
room is going to be.

00:34:37.674 --> 00:34:39.590
There's like a little
bit of a power struggle,

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.110
like who's in the main room?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.699
And then something happens,
some subtle shift, and some room

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.892
becomes the main room and some
room becomes not the main room.

00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:50.100
And then the people who are
not in the main room, who

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.639
decide that they're not in
the main room, start to text.

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.530
And sometimes they start
to text under the table,

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.376
which is called phubbing.

00:34:59.376 --> 00:35:00.750
And my students
tell me they know

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.470
how to do this, that they all
learned it in middle school

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:09.510
when they wanted to text, and
not be seen by their teachers.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.500
So sometimes you see people
doing it under the table,

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.700
and then sometimes, as though
they aren't being seen,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.630
they'll just be doing it right
there because they're not

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:19.700
in the main room.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.590
So again, it has its place.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.600
You're a global company.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.480
You have to do it.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.980
But it's more
like, have respect.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.010
My message is, have
respect for this thing

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.420
that we know how to do
humanly, and it definitely

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.300
has its place.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.400
And do it when you can,
and respect its power

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.470
when you get a chance to do it.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.270
And in romance, I tell
a story of a couple who

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:58.110
choose-- this is this Adam and
Tessa couple who actually like

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.780
screen stuff
because, particularly

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:07.190
on the part of the guy, he
feels that he can be a better

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.340
self when he is online.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.820
More empathic.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.270
He can edit himself.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.010
He can get it right.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.990
I'm not going to ask for a
show of hands, but all of us

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:25.122
have had the feeling that--
I sometimes get angry.

00:36:25.122 --> 00:36:28.660
You wouldn't believe that, but
I sometimes can get very angry.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.890
And I have that
bitch-- that kind of

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.800
like just angry response.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:40.114
And then online, I'm just, oh,
that's a kind of funny thing

00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:40.905
to have had happen.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.930
I'm a better person.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.584
I can just have that
moment, and then I

00:36:47.584 --> 00:36:49.000
don't have to show
it because I've

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.950
had that delay time to edit.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.830
So we've all had that experience
of feeling like the better me

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.430
gets to be the one online.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.060
So the guy in the
relationship, Adam,

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.060
really likes that, feels
that he is the better himself

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.575
in the online presentation.

00:37:06.575 --> 00:37:09.650
And he's with a woman, Tessa,
who basically is telling him

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.600
that he's not empathic enough
throughout the relationship.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.360
I mean, she ultimately
breaks up with him

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.485
because she's telling him
he's not empathic enough.

00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:21.810
I mean, even online, even with
all these efforts after three

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.820
years, he hasn't reached
her empathy standard.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:35.960
So love tip-- you are the self.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.860
You can edit online
and be-- it's

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:47.564
good to be a more-- when you're
with people you care about,

00:37:47.564 --> 00:37:49.230
and with people who
are working for you,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.390
when with your loved ones,
nothing wrong about being

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.660
online and not having
that immediate bitch

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.620
response that I sometimes get.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.220
You know, I'm overworked
and overstressed and running

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.887
around, and somebody
does something

00:38:03.887 --> 00:38:05.470
which is going to
cost me three hours.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.620
And I'm like, are
you kidding me?

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.350
That kind of response.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.560
Nothing wrong with that, with
going online and suppressing

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.540
it.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.700
But really let the people
you love see who you are.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:31.290
Because it is the unedited
you that you have to accept,

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.550
that they have to accept,
that you have to work on,

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.650
and you have to feel loved for.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:43.120
And it works in romance,
but more dangerously.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.540
Parents-- again,
in the book, I talk

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.080
about parents wanting their
children to talk to robots.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.740
And Hello Barbie or Siri--
Hello Barbie is a fancy one,

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.420
but all kinds of
sociable robots are

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.990
being invented to
talk to children,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:01.210
to be their best friend,
to be their buddy.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.520
And I talk about, from
a psychological point

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.250
of view, that danger lurks.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.425
Because one of the
messages the child--

00:39:09.425 --> 00:39:10.975
I mean, apart from
the fact that I

00:39:10.975 --> 00:39:14.250
think pretend empathy
is toxic, but that's

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:18.020
such a different lecture that
I won't even get into it here.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.750
In the book, I go into
this in great detail.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.570
But apart from that,
you have to let

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:32.800
a child feel that their truth is
something that a parent can not

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.260
only tolerate but love.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:39.730
And similarly, in romance,
at the end of the day,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.240
you have to feel that
the truth of who you are

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.460
is what the person
you love can love.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.010
So that is a more
profound-- since we

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.520
began on sort of putting
away your phone on a date,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.925
this moves us to the deepest
level of tips for romance,

00:39:57.925 --> 00:40:03.280
is you have to feel that the
person you're with actually

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.050
loves you, with all the
flaws, and loves who you are.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.730
And there's something about
this going online and editing

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.017
yourself that can
interfere with that.

00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:16.270
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.200
So I want to make sure
people in the audience

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.300
have time for questions, so
I'm going to let you choose

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.880
the next question from me.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.757
First choice is, people
in the audience--

00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:26.840
SHERRY TURKLE: Wait, I get
to choose the question?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.480
LOGAN URY: I'm going to give
you my next two questions.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.240
You choose which one to answer.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.160
How does that feel?

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.280
The first one is,
we're at Google.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.920
A lot of people in this
room probably make devices.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.710
If you could design
any device that

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.680
would help reclaim conversation,
what would that be?

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.330
Your second choice is, if
you could take over-- I

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.650
like to ask this to everyone--
the google.com homepage for one

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:50.640
day so billions of
people around the world

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.759
would see something
under the Google logo,

00:40:52.759 --> 00:40:53.550
what would you say?

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.800
SHERRY TURKLE: They
could click on my book.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.217
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.217 --> 00:41:03.050
LOGAN URY: Your publishers
love that answer.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.450
SHERRY TURKLE: No, I want
people to read my book.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.270
I do.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:14.050
I mean, I really worked to--
this is a very different book

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.260
from other books I've written.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.500
It is a lot of research.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.076
I mean, for six years I've done
nothing but interview people.

00:41:23.076 --> 00:41:25.860
I mean, it's not out of my head.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:32.210
But I had a mission.

00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:37.615
At the end of "Alone Together,"
all these people were saying,

00:41:37.615 --> 00:41:40.540
I'd rather text than talk.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.500
And I thought, I'm
a psychologist.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.720
If they really mean it, there
are profound implications

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.770
for how kids are growing up, how
loving partners are relating,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:59.870
how business is being done,
what families look like, what

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.500
solitude is looking like.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.550
I want to do a kind of
ethnography of conversation

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.370
in America.

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:13.600
And if they mean it,
I want to tell them

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.070
that conversation is the
talking cure for the failing

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.720
connections of our digital life.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.600
And they meant it.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.650
There was this flight from
conversation that I really

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.960
hadn't-- "Alone Together"
really wasn't in a position

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.800
to document that.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.030
It was about 1,000 other things.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:42.590
So I was on a mission, which
was very different than "Alone

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.995
Together," where I'd done 15
years of NSF-funded research,

00:42:45.995 --> 00:42:48.469
and I reported out.

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:50.510
Or the same thing for "The
Second Self" and "Life

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.680
on the Screen."

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.274
Whereas here, I kind
of wanted to know,

00:42:55.274 --> 00:42:57.440
what was the state of
conversation in America today?

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:03.030
And if so, I felt very
strongly about conversation,

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:07.220
based on my life as a
psychologist and my training.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:14.900
And I don't see why technology
can't be pro-conversation.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.950
In other words, I think this is
absolutely a false dichotomy.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:22.085
I don't think technology has
to take a stand against-- you

00:43:22.085 --> 00:43:26.700
don't need to be anti-technology
to be pro-conversation.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:30.140
I'm pro-technology,
pro-conversation.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:35.700
So the idea that you're taking
a stand against technology

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:41.170
to be pro-conversation I think
is just very bad for technology

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.560
to be put in a position
where it's taking

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.670
a stand against conversation.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.600
That has to end, because
that is not sustainable.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.740
So this is just the last thing
I would say before questions,

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.030
that really I think the
future for a company

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:59.890
like this is to get on the
conversation bandwagon.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:07.160
Because you want to find a way
to have conversation be part

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:12.160
of your message, conversation
be part of your product,

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.900
technology be easily
integrated into conversation.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.160
Just like you don't want
computer-assisted learning

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.180
to be an anti-conversation
strategy.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.120
You don't want
computer-assisted learning

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.410
to be something that closes
down conversation in schools.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.640
And if you find
applications of computers

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.310
in schools that are closing down
conversations in classrooms,

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.930
you want to change
those applications.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:48.160
I mean, I think that both
the money and the-- it's

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.790
not just the money.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.850
But let's say the money.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.510
I mean, the money-- I'll
take it on any level.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.180
I mean, it's the
money, the humanism,

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.630
the forwardness, the future,
is for the corporate world

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.420
to enhance conversation, enhance
learning, enhance excitement.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.539
You don't want
students who don't

00:45:06.539 --> 00:45:08.080
want to come talk
to their professors

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.050
because they think
that they'll get

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.610
the right-- this
transactional model is not

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:18.450
where you want to go.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.970
Yeah, so I wouldn't
mind everybody

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.140
at Google reading my book.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.950
I think that that would be good.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:24.950
LOGAN URY: That's great.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.330
OK, well let's open it up.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.510
Let's be pro-conversation--

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.330
SHERRY TURKLE: Pro-conversation.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.163
LOGAN URY: --and open
it up to the audience.

00:45:30.163 --> 00:45:33.022
OK, so just stand up, and
Scott will bring you the mic.

00:45:33.022 --> 00:45:33.881
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:45:33.881 --> 00:45:34.380
It's on.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.171
AUDIENCE: Is it on?

00:45:35.171 --> 00:45:35.850
Great.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.440
I thought I might start,
if you don't mind.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.890
Do you have any thoughts
about online dating

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.370
and what happens
when relationships

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:49.850
are conceived online?

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.510
And so all of the initial
courtship occurs digitally,

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.670
and then they finally meet.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.090
And I don't know
what happens there.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.423
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, I've had
some hysterical interviews

00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:00.680
with people who meet online,
and both partners don't

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.970
want to end the online part.

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:14.040
So finally one will say,
well, how long can this go on?

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.560
Because the online part is
so fulfilling because you're

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.070
very busy.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:25.160
You're very-- either it's
going to get fantastic,

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.850
or it's going to end.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.890
Everybody feels that
way about dating.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.510
And online, you can be
the person you want to be.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.580
They're being the
person they want to be.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.810
And they're being the person who
they think you want them to be.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.500
You're both being the
person you think--

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.350
we've all become very
good at picking up

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.300
online signals of who we
should be for other people.

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.530
I mean, that's another
skill set that's

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.930
being developed that
who knew we had,

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.505
of being able to
be-- I mean, that's

00:46:53.505 --> 00:46:56.810
a new kind of empathy
that's useful,

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.570
but sort of gets
us into trouble.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:04.610
Online, you know how to pick
up this new kind of empathy

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.920
that I don't even want to
call empathy because you're

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:13.080
playing to a fantasy thing.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.230
It's not the old
kind of empathy.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.460
It's not doing the work of
the old-fashioned empathy.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.960
So I interviewed so many
people who could not get

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.570
that real person into the room.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.820
I would say that you want to get
the real person into the room.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.490
The idea that the longer
you keep it online,

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.776
the better it's going
to be because-- I would

00:47:36.776 --> 00:47:39.220
say the longer it's
kept online, the greater

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.180
the chance that the
person who shows up

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:46.550
is going to be nothing like
the rare and totally perfect

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:50.102
creature that you've been
talking with for 18 months.

00:47:50.102 --> 00:47:51.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.000
LOGAN URY: Good Turkle tip.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.940
SHERRY TURKLE: Another
Turkle tip, right.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:59.170
I am really glad I came,
and I'm looking forward

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.890
to reading the
book, in large part

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:04.730
because I was a big fan of
your books from the first two,

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:05.230
actually.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:07.840
In 1995, I remember
reading "Second Self"

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.530
and immediately
feeling like this idea

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.840
that people have identities
online that give them freedom--

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.770
SHERRY TURKLE: You mean
"Life on the Screen."

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.520
AUDIENCE: "Life on the
Screen," that's right.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.220
That was the one
even earlier, then.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.673
I read it in
probably 1994 or '95.

00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:20.480
SHERRY TURKLE:
Right, early adopter.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.390
AUDIENCE: I completely
wanted-- that book

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:25.650
made complete sense to me.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:27.120
I was very receptive to it.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.040
This book I'm
incredibly resistant to.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.710
So that's a great sign
that I'm going to like it.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.044
It's like I--

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:37.550
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, I'm
not-- I mean, you see me.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:41.100
I'm not like a--
this is what I think.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.074
I mean, this book,
this is what I think.

00:48:43.074 --> 00:48:43.740
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.432
And this is my question.

00:48:45.432 --> 00:48:46.890
The two things that
leap to my mind

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.130
are largely historical when
I think about my resistance

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.210
to these.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.500
We've had some of this before.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.800
This doesn't at least
seem to me to be that new.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.770
You have to kind of
go back in time a bit.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.445
So a lot of what
you've talked about--

00:48:59.445 --> 00:49:00.450
SHERRY TURKLE: Like the book?

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:01.650
AUDIENCE: The book
and letters were

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.900
the two things that struck me.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.710
So I'm really curious
if you had a chance

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.190
to look at kind of
historically how

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.560
the rise of the cheap
paperback, for example,

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.240
and the experience of letters
challenged conversation

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.410
in their historical periods.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:16.201
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:49:16.201 --> 00:49:19.520
And I'm only sorry that
I didn't stop the book

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.160
and say, and now let me talk
about the book and letters,

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.400
because I should have.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.110
But since I didn't, let me
just talk about it here.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.010
So how many times have you
been talking to somebody--

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.420
if I went, you know what?

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:39.050
We're in this conversation,
but what I really want to do

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.913
is read, like, three
paragraphs of "Madame Bovary."

00:49:43.913 --> 00:49:45.246
LOGAN URY: Never happened to me.

00:49:45.246 --> 00:49:48.620
SHERRY TURKLE: So hold on.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.886
I'll just get right back to you.

00:49:50.886 --> 00:49:52.960
And you go to "Madame Bovary."

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.500
You read your paragraphs,
maybe just one paragraph.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.960
AUDIENCE: Oh, I will
say kids do that.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.055
Kids will do that.

00:49:59.055 --> 00:49:59.930
SHERRY TURKLE: Right.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:03.960
But you read a little "Madame
Bovary," and then you just say,

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.760
I'm back.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.400
So it's what Linda Stone called
continual partial attention,

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:18.723
is that it's the
lack of segregation.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.240
Because I think the book thing
is very important, more so

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.650
than the television example,
because in this book,

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.410
I use television as
a good example of how

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:37.100
we can turn things around.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.960
Television is an example
of people jumping around

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.390
and making all kinds of
fuss about a technology that

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:45.636
could be used socially if you
wanted it to be used socially.

00:50:45.636 --> 00:50:47.052
And why everybody
assumed that you

00:50:47.052 --> 00:50:49.190
were going to be using
this not socially

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.850
is just like part
of the zeitgeist,

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.110
that people saw it as
destroying the family.

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:57.260
But in my family, watching
television was a contact sport.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:01.051
So we sat around, watching
television and arguing

00:51:01.051 --> 00:51:02.800
about what was happening
on the television

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.966
and fighting about what the
people on the television

00:51:04.966 --> 00:51:05.570
were doing.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.410
Well, it brought the
family completely together.

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.860
I watch television
with my daughter.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.885
I mean, we watch
television together.

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.364
Obviously she's
graduated college now,

00:51:18.364 --> 00:51:20.780
so she actually has less time
to watch television with me.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:22.446
But we watch "Game
of Thrones" together,

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:26.560
and it's like our closest--
when they killed off

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.910
that whole family, I was
like, no fuckin' way.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:32.920
I jumped up.

00:51:36.541 --> 00:51:39.459
It's a very social--
watching "Game of Thrones,"

00:51:39.459 --> 00:51:40.250
that's another tip.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:41.874
I don't know if it's
a tip for romance,

00:51:41.874 --> 00:51:44.360
but it's definitely a tip.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.320
It's definitely a
tip for families who

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.560
feel they want to get closer.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.860
I'm very big on television,
games, card games.

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.512
The point is, it's a technology,
but it's a technology

00:51:56.512 --> 00:51:57.720
of talking and socialization.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.180
The point is that.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.740
So television is a great example
of how it's not the technology,

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.870
it's the social context.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:09.304
So the trouble with
this kind of-- this

00:52:09.304 --> 00:52:10.720
is because you're
telling somebody

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.897
who literally is-- you're in
the middle of a conversation.

00:52:14.897 --> 00:52:15.855
You're a tape recorder.

00:52:15.855 --> 00:52:17.110
I'm putting you on pause.

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:19.080
I'm going to the
people in my phone.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.460
Or I have a lot of
data on how people

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.720
use this thing called
this rule of three,

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.330
where they're sitting at dinner.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:29.880
You're six, and three people
have to have their heads

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.820
up before you go
down to your phone.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.230
And it's basically just
the same as in the--

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:40.240
which is how college students
behave in dining halls.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.800
And the conversation
stays light,

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.210
and people don't feel
connected to each other.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:51.530
So that's the social norms
around using the phone.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:58.970
People don't, at dinner, say,
we're at dinner together,

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:05.240
and I'm going to just read
a few paragraphs of my book.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.350
Now, that's because
we have social norms.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.290
It's not because they couldn't.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.670
It's because we've just
evolved social norms that say,

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:13.930
really, no.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:14.560
Not.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.510
Don't do that.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.820
And we can do that
for our phones.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.120
So that's kind of my message.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.930
It's not the phone.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:24.380
It's that, how did it
come to pass in the past--

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.320
so as I was watching
this, this thing

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.671
unfolded, this rule of three.

00:53:28.671 --> 00:53:30.420
How did it come to
pass that it was really

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.870
fine to go to dinner with four
people, and have two of them

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.370
on their phone?

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.255
And that's like what going
out with my faculty colleagues

00:53:38.255 --> 00:53:40.380
is like.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.700
That is not unusual.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:46.390
And you say, why
is the phone here?

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.260
And they'll say, an emergency.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.372
And then you ask
them-- I mean, I'm

00:53:52.372 --> 00:53:54.080
allowed to ask them
because it's like I'm

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.320
pretending it's research.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.150
What emergency?

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:02.450
And the bar is very low.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.050
The bar is very low.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.300
The bar is very low.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.225
And that's what this
book is arguing,

00:54:08.225 --> 00:54:11.130
that these are social rules.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.430
We've just invented them.

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.710
They're extremely new.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.010
And we didn't invent
them for the book.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.150
And let's un-invent
them for the phone.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:25.090
And that this is work
we know how to do.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.230
I love my favorite
example-- I mean,

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.150
this is taking too long
to answer a question,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.060
but my favorite example
of turning something

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.500
around is nutrition, actually.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.350
Because I was raised
by a mother who adored

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:42.050
me-- and I use this example
a lot-- in the '50s and '60s

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:47.550
who fed me white bread and soup.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.220
The main two ingredients
were sugar and salt,

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.190
with a little bit of
ketchup in the soup,

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.700
I think, a little
tomato something.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:55:00.980
And fruit that had
like this sugary syrup

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:04.170
thing, and vegetables in a tin.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:05.530
And she loved me.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.090
I mean, it wasn't money.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:11.020
And if I had fed that to my
daughter who just has graduated

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.910
college, I would have
been an abusive parent,

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.690
or it would have been like
a "Mad Men" retrospective

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.020
thing I was doing.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:25.810
And it would have been like I
was doing a retro, fun evening.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.430
But it would have been, we
know that we can't do that.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:31.120
And obviously there are still
people who eat like that,

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.410
and that's still what's
on a lot of shelves.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:40.470
But basically-- I was
looking for a little bit

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.955
of junk food in your
cafeteria because it's

00:55:43.955 --> 00:55:46.070
been real-- I started
this morning at 5:00 AM.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.480
It's been a very long day.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.380
I couldn't find anything.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.560
I couldn't find the basics
of the junk food option.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.924
So we know that
this is not good,

00:55:55.924 --> 00:55:57.090
and we've changed our diets.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:59.140
That's now how we eat anymore.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.260
And that's not how
I fed my daughter.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.400
And we've turned-- it
didn't happen immediately.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.360
There was a tremendous
amount of opposition.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.290
It wasn't like the entire
food industry said,

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:09.950
you know, you are so right.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.580
We just so completely
fucked up when we

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:14.890
tried to sell you that stuff.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:21.550
We are so sorry that we broke
up the local food markets

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.110
and put everything on this
national food market that

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.000
gave you no fresh food.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.610
Our bad.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.840
That isn't how it happened.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.994
It was like a social movement.

00:56:34.994 --> 00:56:36.160
It was a political movement.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.250
It was very hard.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.660
It's not done.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.010
It's not even done.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.370
But you know, it's
kind of getting done.

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:50.240
And I believe that's going
to happen with phones.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.230
And education, and
that's why I think

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:55.250
that a company like this-- I
mean, just to say it again,

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:56.625
just in case you
didn't catch it,

00:56:56.625 --> 00:57:01.290
you should be in the forefront
of making that happen.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.720
Think of yourself just
being the forefront

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.665
of making that happen.

00:57:05.665 --> 00:57:07.040
AUDIENCE: You
talked a little bit

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.905
about being pro-technology
and pro-conversation,

00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:12.670
and I wanted to get
your thoughts on,

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.120
as a researcher,
what's important for us

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.910
when we're designing
technology to incorporate

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.850
in what we're doing.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.590
Because sometimes we create
technology that kind of

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:24.930
wipes out part of the usual
human interaction instead

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:27.175
of augmenting or enforcing.

00:57:27.175 --> 00:57:28.800
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
keep this in mind.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:33.700
I mean, when she said, what do I
really wish on the Google page,

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.950
I said, read the book.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:39.300
Think about conversation
as a design criteria.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.770
Think about conversation
as a design criteria.

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.450
I mean, I think
Skype is fascinating.

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.910
I mean, I really want
to know why there can't

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:47.700
be a technical fix to this.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.210
I want somebody to sit
down and explain to me

00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:53.240
why there can't be,
after how many years

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.840
has this product been out?

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.910
There's got to be a
technical fix where

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:59.540
in order for my daughter to
feel that I'm giving her eye

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:05.216
contact, I have to be literally
not looking at her for an hour.

00:58:05.216 --> 00:58:07.466
LOGAN URY: Does anyone here
work on the Hangouts team?

00:58:07.466 --> 00:58:08.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.420
SHERRY TURKLE: I think that's
really an interesting-- I mean,

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.100
here's a really popular product.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.822
And people use it to look
kind of like, uh-huh.

00:58:18.822 --> 00:58:25.110
And to me, its very
basic thing that it's

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:29.490
supposed to accomplish, it's
taken itself out of the game.

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:34.420
So you should all
consult to them

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.340
and tell them how they
can upgrade themselves,

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.220
or somebody should.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:41.090
Or there's got to be a technical
fix where you look at something

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:42.200
and it changes your game.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:46.120
I mean, it's got to be
some physics or-- I mean,

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.660
it's got to be something.

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.360
Gotta get some hacker on that.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:49.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.700
No, seriously, because
this is ridiculous.

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.980
In order to make
you feel that I'm

00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.170
giving you my full attention--
because I'll tell you

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.300
what's important.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.760
I'm trained as a psychoanalyst.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.800
And now psychoanalysts are
doing psychoanalysis by Skype

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.620
to China.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:10.560
And all these Chinese
psychoanalysts

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.870
are not-- to give them eye
contact for supervising

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:17.890
sessions, where you
can't be staring

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.485
like this in a
supervising session,

00:59:19.485 --> 00:59:21.110
they're going to be
staring at a camera

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.510
and never looking at the
person they're supervising.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.060
This is crazy because you have
to look at the person you're

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.550
supervising.

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:29.800
So this is so crazy.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.500
This is like 15
articles' worth of crazy,

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.780
to be giving someone clinical
supervision without actually

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.300
looking at them.

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.840
Because technically
it's not possible to.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.657
Don't get me started.

00:59:44.657 --> 00:59:46.240
AUDIENCE: We're
missing out on empathy

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.570
as we see less empathy,
especially among kids.

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:49.670
Does that mean that
we're being replaced

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:50.794
by the opposite of empathy?

00:59:50.794 --> 00:59:52.240
I'm thinking,
what's the opposite

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.660
of empathy, selfishness?

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.490
But then there's
also self-doubt.

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.330
And you mentioned when
you're eating lunch

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.070
with your colleagues, and
they pull out their phone,

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:01.403
why did you pull out your phone?

01:00:01.403 --> 01:00:02.225
It's an emergency.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:03.684
To me, that sounds
like self-doubt,

01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:06.141
that maybe you're scared, and
you need to look at the phone

01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:08.286
because my relationship
is in a place where

01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:09.910
I need to be responsive
to this person,

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.630
or my relationship
will collapse.

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.620
And you have so
many relationships

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.036
where you're looking
at your phone

01:00:14.036 --> 01:00:15.537
because you have
so much self-doubt,

01:00:15.537 --> 01:00:17.077
so if you don't
respond, you're going

01:00:17.077 --> 01:00:18.520
to endanger your relationship.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.930
Or maybe it is just selfishness.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.450
Every Facebook Like that you
get, every new Tinder match,

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:23.825
just boosts your
self-confidence.

01:00:23.825 --> 01:00:25.900
SHERRY TURKLE: This
is so depressing.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.520
This is like an interview,
with you describing

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.404
why people are-- yes!

01:00:30.404 --> 01:00:31.570
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm curious.

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:32.520
SHERRY TURKLE: The answer
to this would be yes.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.250
AUDIENCE: What are you seeing?

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:33.720
Are we--

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.920
SHERRY TURKLE: I'm
seeing all of this.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.180
I'm seeing all of this.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.060
I'm seeing people insecure
in their relationships.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.880
If you don't talk
to people, you get

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.160
insecure in your relationship.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.910
That's what I say.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.130
For the failing connections
of our digital world,

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:51.240
conversation is
the talking cure.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.604
Because if your relationship
is too much online,

01:00:54.604 --> 01:00:56.395
you will get insecure
in that relationship.

01:00:56.395 --> 01:00:59.359
It's going to happen.

01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:00.900
AUDIENCE: So you
think that it's fear

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.640
that's driving people towards--

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.080
SHERRY TURKLE: I think you
get a lot of self-doubt if you

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.280
don't-- I mean, just having been
with you for just a very short

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.419
time, I feel confident
in our connection.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.710
You just feel confident in
the connection with someone.

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.100
With you, I feel very confident.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.440
I mean, we're built for this.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.610
This is what I mean.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:27.600
I mean, we have to at
some point acknowledge

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.350
what we are built for.

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:34.910
We are built for eye contact,
conversation, bodies together.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:38.190
We're built for this.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.450
And we're putting
ourselves-- and it's better

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:45.170
to design for what
we're built for.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:48.460
And then we want to
expand our horizons.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.870
We want to expand the things we
can do, great with technology.

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.099
But we should design
around our vulnerability.

01:01:55.099 --> 01:01:56.140
But I think you're right.

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.970
Where you're right
is that a lot of-- I

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.620
don't mean to say
that technology is

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.910
causing some of these problems.

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:06.560
I think technology
is enabling people

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.870
to not have face-to-face
conversations that they'd

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.770
just as soon avoid.

01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:16.120
AUDIENCE: I was curious
about what metrics

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.310
for measuring empathy
you've encountered,

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.853
and what your
analysis of that is.

01:02:21.853 --> 01:02:24.620
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, the
metrics for measuring empathy

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.030
are very simple.

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.520
There are tests, and there
are many, many tests,

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.480
where basically you tell a
story or you show a film.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.001
And then you basically
say, what is this person--

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.375
can you put yourself in the
point of view of this person?

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:39.750
Can you put yourself in the
point of view of that person?

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:40.664
Now let's switch.

01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:41.830
What is this person feeling?

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:44.930
What is this person feeling?

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.550
And it's very primitive.

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.870
But it gives you a sense of
whether or not people are

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:54.460
able to do this perspectival
switching and being

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.737
able to put themselves in the
perspective of other people.

01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:00.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:02.350
So I have a question
that's not about phones,

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:04.830
but it's about empathy, since
you've done a lot of research

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:05.670
into empathy.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.120
So what I'm curious
about is, can you

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.140
compare now versus in history--
people's empathetic behavior

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:14.820
in the second half
of the 20th century

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.850
and 21st century-- versus how
people behaved 200 years ago,

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.430
300 years ago, 400 years ago?

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.680
Do you think we're more
empathetic or less empathetic?

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.480
Or can you characterize
it at all in that way?

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.980
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
it's very hard.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.440
I mean, obviously
we're not doing

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.940
these-- I don't
want to say things

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.320
where I couldn't possibly give
a scientific answer because we

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.660
didn't do these tests.

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:44.314
So we can only measure--

01:03:44.314 --> 01:03:46.230
AUDIENCE: I'm only
interested in your opinion.

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.545
I--

01:03:46.545 --> 01:03:47.420
SHERRY TURKLE: Right.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:59.380
What I think is that the
capacity for conversation

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:07.400
and the fact of conversation
generates empathic connection.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:17.160
And I believe that we had
more conversation when we

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.330
didn't have other distractions.

01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:26.980
And so I extrapolate
from that that we

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:38.440
became practiced at what
you get out of conversation,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.660
which is reading other people.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.330
That's really all I can say.

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:47.150
But my concern-- I
mean, just say this

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:49.770
again so that--
everybody hear me right.

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:55.020
My concern really is not in
proving that we're on a-- I'm

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.000
not Ray Kurzweil.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.910
I'm not trying to
prove [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.330
that we're on a slope up or
a slope down or on a slope

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.470
to being robots.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.040
I'm just saying,
in our moment now,

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.690
if you care about
empathy now-- so this

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:14.480
is why I want to
just sort of keep it

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.650
to what I'm an expert on.

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:24.310
In our moment now, if you
care about this value now,

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:30.490
we're not on a good trajectory,
and technology is an enabler.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.856
Right now, the way we're
socially using the phones now,

01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:40.070
technology is enabling us on
a path that's not helpful.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:43.380
And we can turn it around,
because actually we

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.970
are the empathy app for the kind
of empathy I'm talking about.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.710
That really is all my
research and my methodology

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:59.820
can bring to you, to be most
humble about what I can say.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:04.880
So that's my message.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:13.000
This kind of understanding,
it matters deeply to me.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.850
I think that raising children,
raising human beings without

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:23.580
it, is not going to be-- we
freak out about Asperger's.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.680
We freak out when people
don't make eye contact.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.100
We freak out when they
don't connect with us.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.580
And we're putting screens
in front of babies

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.810
at the very moments that
were the key moments when

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.580
we know that we're
supposed to be

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.639
making eye contact with them.

01:06:42.639 --> 01:06:44.055
So my favorite
line in my book-- I

01:06:44.055 --> 01:06:45.888
don't know if I said
it-- is that technology

01:06:45.888 --> 01:06:48.460
makes us forget what
we know about life.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.770
So my message, just
to close, is remember

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.570
what you know about life,
whether it's in dating,

01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:55.962
where you really don't
want somebody looking

01:06:55.962 --> 01:06:58.170
at their phone-- if somebody's
looking at their phone

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:01.670
during a date, I say, look.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:02.860
They're not your person.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.650
They're not your person.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:07.150
But if you say to them, look,
that's not the kind of thing--

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.691
I'd rather you didn't, and they
start giving you a hard time,

01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:12.230
how this is important because
it might be an emergency,

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:13.680
they're not your person.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.990
They're not your person.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.940
I mean, they're not your person.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.236
They should be trying to
make eye contact with you

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:22.360
and just figuring out how
they're going to do that.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.000
So remember what
you know about life.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.756
If you're fighting with
somebody about their phone,

01:07:29.756 --> 01:07:31.380
and on a date, they're
not your person.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.150
And remember what you know
about life with your kids,

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.497
that they need your eye contact.

01:07:35.497 --> 01:07:36.580
They need your connection.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.420
And start the conversation.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:40.920
Thank you.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.120
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.061
SHERRY TURKLE: Thank you.

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:46.070
LOGAN URY: It was
great talking to you.
