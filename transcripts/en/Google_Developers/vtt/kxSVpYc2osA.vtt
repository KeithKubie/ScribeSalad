[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.840
FILIP: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.660
Welcome back to the
Flutter Boring Show.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.230
I'm here.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.236
My name is Phillip.

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:13.110
I'm a developer advocate
on the Flutter team.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.950
And with me is Will.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.180
Will is an engineer on
the Material Design team.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.900
Will, hi.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.750
WILL: Great to be here, Filip.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.250
Thank you.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.820
FILIP: Yeah.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.120
So I was always
going to ask you,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.120
what does an engineer do on
the Material Design team?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.490
WILL: Well, we have
different teams

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.600
set up for all the
different platforms--

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.650
iOS, Android, web,
and now Flutter.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.350
And we work on what we call
the material components, which

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.770
are, in the case of Flutter,
the widgets and the material

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.920
library, the things that
implement material design

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.380
and material theming.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.297
And we build them, or
maintain them, or collaborate

00:00:49.297 --> 00:00:50.880
with the teams that
are building them,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.210
in order to keep
them up to date,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.060
and try to make them
consistent across all

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.462
the different platforms.

00:00:58.462 --> 00:00:59.170
FILIP: All right.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.590
So a lot of the widgets that
we're using in an app like this

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.720
are coming from you.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.110
WILL: Well, I mean, I can't
take all the credit myself.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.869
But yeah, my team is
definitely always helping

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.410
to make sure that
they're up to date.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.285
And if we know anything
is around the corner,

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.180
then Flutter can get
it at the same time

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.744
as the other platforms,
which is great.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:23.910
FILIP: So we were thinking--

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.295
OK, so we have our Hacker News
app, which by the way, amazing.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:27.920
WILL: I saw it.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.730
I love it.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.850
It's great.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.190
FILIP: So would do you think
that it's like the top app

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.932
that you've ever seen,
in terms of design?

00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:37.140
WILL: Well, you're starting
with Material Components.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.330
So you're already on the way.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.290
That's good.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.930
I think if we were to
critique the look, the style

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
at the moment, it's
a little out of date,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.410
or a little default or plain.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.910
There's probably
some things that we

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.880
could do with material
theming and with styling

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.115
in order to make it fresher.

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:00.990
FILIP: OK, all right.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.830
So let's do just that.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.920
So just for people who are
completely new to the show,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.520
these is our Hacker
News Reader app, which

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.944
is very simple and functional.

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:13.720
Do you have-- this is
actually-- since last episode,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.300
this is actually talking to
the Hacker News API proper.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.940
So these are new things
coming from Hacker News.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.150
WILL: No, that's great.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.640
FILIP: You get the news
stories, the top stories,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.960
and you can open this.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.640
And I'm not going to do
that, because I don't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.360
know what these articles are.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.130
But you can open it
in your web browser.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.480
And that's basically it.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.740
We're not going
to make anything--

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.930
no new features, I think.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.950
We'll just keep this with
this kind of functionality,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.890
maybe unless you hate
this, we could just

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.016
keep this opening like this.

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:49.807
WILL: Oh, yeah, no.

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:50.990
I think that's great.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.420
FILIP: And then--
but yeah, maybe we

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.760
can mix it even nicer-looking.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.132
WILL: So where I start--

00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:00.340
you know, I'm not a designer.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.170
I am an engineer.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.900
But I know that there
are a lot of resources

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.310
out there on our website, on
material.io, for both designers

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.340
and developers to have
inspiration and tools in order

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.880
to help with design.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
So when I need to redo
something on my own,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.630
that's where I start in
order to get some inspiration

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.720
and some existing
designs that designers

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.890
have spent their time.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.652
FILIP: So you're
saying material--

00:03:26.652 --> 00:03:27.490
WILL: --.io.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.990
Yeah.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.910
FILIP: So what do you do here?

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.480
WILL: So if I was just coming
in to get documentation

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.560
about any of the tools I was
using, I'd go to Develop.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.750
But since today we're
worrying about design,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.690
I'd click on Design.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.830
FILIP: This is slow today.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.962
OK.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.720
Is it just me?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.917
WILL: So this is
essentially what

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:54.500
we call the material
guidelines, which

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.430
is the breadth of
knowledge and opinion

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.250
that we've put together with
research over the years that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.520
keeps apps looking consistent,
and usable, and beautiful.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.440
And one of the things
we've done recently

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.584
is put, under Material Studies,
some hypothetical apps that

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.209
look like something
somebody would find

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.250
from another
company, not Google,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.380
so that you can
get an idea of what

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.440
options are out there for
styling and theming your apps.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.520
FILIP: Nice.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.600
So OK, so let's go with Basil.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.900
And then you can tell
us-- ah, that's nice.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.870
All right, so this
is for people who

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.320
don't know where to start
with material design.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.110
And this will give them
some kind of a framework.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.040
WILL: Yeah, so this
is taking all things

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.380
that we have in the
guidelines, and actually

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560
putting them to
use in one place.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.650
And kind of showing you step by
step all the different values

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.880
that got us there.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.660
So if you down to Color,
you'll see the palette.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.380
There it is.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.330
Keep going down.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.160
This is the color scheme that
the designer came up with.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.760
This is a food app.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.960
So it's inspired by
pesto, literally.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.600
And then if you keep
going down to typography,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.060
you can see the
different typefaces

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.810
that were chosen for this.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.520
And there's iconography, and
motion, and other cool things

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.140
there.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.890
And so we have this for
several different apps.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.640
FILIP: Right.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.660
Which of those apps--

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.110
so this looks like 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 different apps.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.317
Which one is most similar
to this, do you think?

00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:42.650
WILL: I think one of the ones
that might be very similar

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.240
is Fortnightly.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.530
It's a newspaper app.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.830
So a very similar idea--
serving content, lots of text,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.690
text being very important.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.690
And also kind of getting out
of the way of the content

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.970
since there's so much.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.960
When you have a lot
of text on the screen,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.020
that's work for
the eye, and kind

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.230
of work for the person who's
using it to try to consume.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.120
So this puts that in the
front, and spends time

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.000
on the information
architecture and space

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.850
around the text as
necessary, to make it

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.260
more readable and consumable.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.540
So that's a good one.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.970
Another one that might
be good is Reply.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.320
FILIP: Reply.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.190
WILL: This one's an
email or message creator.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.880
But obviously it's not
about the functionality.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.540
It's about, does this show
the same similar things,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.260
which is text.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.630
Again, we're showing
text, and this is text.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:48.380
So this kind of comes at
it from a text-heavy angle.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.250
And then if we wanted to get
really wacky for some reason,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.030
probably the most
fun one is Owl.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.040
FILIP: Yeah, if you
can't remember Owl, yeah.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.890
WILL: This one's got
the bright colors.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.130
This one is a study in
super-bold design choices,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.380
and then also what I call scoped
theming, where different--

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.040
you can see here on the screen
that the personalized flow is

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.800
based on yellow, the browse
flow is based on blue,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.860
the learn flow is based on red,
which is just this cool idea

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.050
that if you have a
multi-featured app that

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.760
does several different
things, maybe you

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.400
can use theming to help people
have a better ground to where

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.960
they are, based on a context.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.010
FILIP: I like it.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.110
Yeah, so what do you think
about Flutter Hacker News?

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.720
Do we want to do
something wacky, or more

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.589
like the Fortnightly?

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:49.130
WILL: Well, if we started with
Fortnightly, we could always--

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.171
we can try more than one.

00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:52.580
I mean, that's the great
thing about Flutter

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.689
is it moves so fast.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:54.230
FILIP: Right.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.250
WILL: You can
check your choices.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.080
FILIP: So, OK.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.832
Let's get-- so
where do we start?

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:01.790
Where do we start here?

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.710
So basically this is the
whole code of the app,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.100
because the rest is
just different classes,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.240
like serializers
and stuff like this.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.850
So we can just start
here, and I guess

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.287
play with this theme data.

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:18.870
WILL: Exactly.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.660
So every material app that takes
theme data in the theme field.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.970
And in there, that's where
you can set all your things

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.730
having to do with
your color scheme

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.330
and with the text theme
that you will have,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.580
button theme, which is of
course how your buttons will

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.539
be styled.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.049
So yeah, if we take a look
at theme data and its fields,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.110
see how many that was?

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.130
There was a lot there.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:50.260
We can start changing some of
the values that we see on--

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.500
any from the study side.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.000
Yeah.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.694
It might be good
to start with Owl,

00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:56.360
because then we'll
really be able to see

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.410
the changes quickly.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.110
So you can get some hex values
down in the Color section.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.610
FILIP: Ah, all right.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:14.030
So well, I mean, we kind of
have to work around, I think,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.840
the Hacker News orange.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.720
Maybe not.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.610
I don't know.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.350
WILL: Well--

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.590
FILIP: [INAUDIBLE] That's OK.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.462
Let's do what the
designers [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.503
WILL: They'll never know.

00:09:23.503 --> 00:09:24.430
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.940
FILIP: So primary swatch?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.110
WILL: Yeah, the
primary swatch is

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.570
a color that's then
also applied sometimes

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.181
through darker use of it.

00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:38.930
So that's how we get
that thing in the app

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.800
bar where the status bar is
darker that's beneath it.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.780
FILIP: So--

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.260
WILL: So, what do you think?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.070
The yellow section, the red
section, or the blue section

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.589
would be a good
one to start with?

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:51.630
FILIP: I like the yellow.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.370
WILL: Let's start with yellow.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.330
FILIP: Yeah?

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.050
So I just say this--

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.442
this guy, FF--

00:09:57.442 --> 00:09:58.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.950
WILL: For the
swatch, you might not

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.670
be able to put hex
value in there.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.904
I believe you have to
send in a material color

00:10:05.904 --> 00:10:07.820
type or something like
that, which is actually

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.960
a collection of colors.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.016
So it would probably
be better just

00:10:12.016 --> 00:10:13.640
to get rid of primary
swatch, and start

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.970
with the primary color.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.490
FILIP: Primary color is--

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.221
and I don't know.

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:25.210
Is there a copyable--

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:25.980
WILL: No.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.980
It just appeared to you.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.671
So FFDE03.

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:30.254
FILIP: FFDE03.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.350
WILL: And then FF
again for the alpha.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.240
FILIP: OK, yeah.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.436
WILL: [INAUDIBLE] was
the alpha at the start.

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:43.310
Well, we'll find out.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.939
Ah, alpha must be at the start.

00:10:44.939 --> 00:10:45.480
FILIP: Right.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.810
That's also good, by the way.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.560
WILL: There we go.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.320
FILIP: Nice.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.120
WILL: Yellow.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.760
FILIP: So-- oh, I thought--

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.070
so do we want to
have it like this,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.180
or like they have it
at the background?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.185
Everything is yellow like this.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:07.390
WILL: Ah, yeah,
so that would be--

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.780
I forget which color is the
background for a scaffold.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.284
Does this list view have
any color set on it,

00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:17.450
or is this just the default?

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.700
FILIP: Yeah, it's the
default. So can we

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.210
do like a background color?

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.906
WILL: We'll try
background color.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:26.075
FILIP: And do,
since I have this--

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.200
WILL: No, that's not it.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.712
FILIP: Let me see
if [INAUDIBLE] do

00:11:34.712 --> 00:11:36.435
we have color here somewhere?

00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:41.370
WILL: Let's look
in the theme data,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.584
and see if it's obvious from
the names of the fields.

00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:44.500
There's a lot of them.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.160
There we go.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.576
That might be the
one right there,

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:48.080
scaffold background color.

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:51.250
FILIP: OK, so--

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.952
WILL: All right.

00:11:55.952 --> 00:11:56.660
FILIP: All right.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.590
WILL: Already starting
to look more like Owl.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.090
FILIP: Yeah.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.423
WILL: It's definitely more Owly.

00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:01.400
FILIP: Uh huh.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.760
So what do we do with the top?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.610
WILL: So let's see if
there's any inspiration back

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.890
in the study
[INAUDIBLE] It doesn't

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.340
look like they use an app
bar in that part of the app.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.430
FILIP: We also don't need to.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.120
It doesn't do anything
really important.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.840
WILL: What's that
Why button for?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.010
FILIP: That's not a button.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.190
That's just an
icon that flashes.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.880
That was one of our things.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.670
It flashes when you load.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.260
But nobody notices, so I
think we can get rid of it.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.770
WILL: Yeah.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.630
I mean, so one of
the things that I've

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.880
seen in a lot of
people do when they

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.690
don't want a very defined
app bar is to color the app

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.430
bar the same color
as the background,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.550
and remove its elevation,
so that you still

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.270
get the functionality of an app
bar, which is having the title,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:55.786
without having to have
it be so pronounced.

00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:57.410
FILIP: So that would
be a primary color

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.820
with the same color.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.650
So now just for the sake of--

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:09.350
so this would be our const
primaryColor is this.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.740
WILL: Always a good
idea-- best practice.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.470
FILIP: Maybe static.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:21.200
And then, so that's primayColor,
and that's a primaryColor.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.907
And then we delete this.

00:13:22.907 --> 00:13:24.740
[MAKING PERCUSSIVE SOUND EFFECT

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.537
OK.

00:13:25.537 --> 00:13:26.120
WILL: Awesome.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.250
FILIP: And then
you're saying app bar

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.100
now doesn't have elevation--

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.050
0.

[MAKING PERCUSSIVE SOUND EFFECT
 WITH MOUTH]

00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:37.780
Interesting.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.670
WILL: So that's a very
iOS paradigm, the idea

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.020
of not having a shadow.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.790
FILIP: Right.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.210
WILL: Yeah.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.220
FILIP: Now I want to have it
left-aligned with the rest.

[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.400
WILL: Well, if we get
rid of the leading, what

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.441
will happen to the title?

00:13:55.441 --> 00:13:57.444
It will move over?

00:13:57.444 --> 00:13:58.860
Because you said
we don't need it.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.410
FILIP: Yeah.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.050
WILL: Close.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.650
That would drive
me insane, though.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.570
FILIP: I mean, let's not maybe--

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.710
I don't know.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.580

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.790
FILIP: Do we really
want that, though?

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.560
WILL: Oh, no.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.140
I think on Owl, they,
instead of having an app bar,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.380
have a really cool title
with an image at the top.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.750
It's their logo lockup,
essentially, at the top.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.310
FILIP: Yeah, I saw that.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.900
So this, right.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:33.890
So we could just-- hm, I
still want to have it aligned.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.344
Is it just me, or--

00:14:35.344 --> 00:14:36.510
WILL: No, it's not just you.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.150
FILIP: OK, so can we
left-align it just by--

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.660
WILL: Maybe.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.610
So what's going on
inside the app bar

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.800
is probably harder
to change than what's

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.720
going on inside your list view.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.940
Do have padding going on
inside of these widgets?

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.890
FILIP: Yeah, I think
all is default.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:15:00.240
So we have a list view
build item that's-- oh,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.340
that is padding.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.890
WILL: I bet it's 8.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:12.120
FILIP: OK, so-- yeah.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.030
No?

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.530

00:15:20.605 --> 00:15:21.105
FILIP: 4?

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:25.742

00:15:25.742 --> 00:15:26.450
FILIP: All right.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.241
WILL: And then the way
you can double-check

00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:30.565
this is with the inspector.

00:15:30.565 --> 00:15:31.190
FILIP: Tell me.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.240
WILL: Because if you
highlight either of those,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.630
a line will draw
around it, and then

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.190
that will give your
eye an easier way

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.239
to focus down to see if that
line, in your imagination,

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:41.530
kind of goes down to the next--

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.135
FILIP: Right, right.

00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:45.260

of looks like the X-Men logo?

that, and then you

can click into any of the things
on the screen in the simulator.

00:15:53.624 --> 00:15:54.290
And then there--

FILIP: No, this is not on an
emulator, that's the thing.

00:15:56.435 --> 00:15:56.890

so we click outside.

because my finger is so chunky.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.721
No.

00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:28.220
FILIP: Ah.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.970
WILL: OK, so it's
wrapped in your padding.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.440
FILIP: All right.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:37.370
WILL: See, so that's
not your padding.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.470
That must be a padding that you
get for free from what's the--

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.904
FILIP: Safe area.

00:16:42.904 --> 00:16:43.570
WILL: Safe area.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.114
Yeah, all right.

00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:48.280
Which is great, because
that means you can trust it.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.450
FILIP: Right.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.680
Good, that's awesome.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.560
So OK, so we have this.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.390
I already like this.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.730
Let's not do that now.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:04.540
So are we gonna
maybe make this--

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.410
maybe the list style
should be a little more--

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:08.619
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.077
WILL: I thought it
was good on top.

00:17:10.077 --> 00:17:10.720
FILIP: Yeah.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.680
On top?

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.220
Yeah, OK.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.970
WILL: Yeah, the vertical
padding was good.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.036
FILIP: Right.

00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:16.119
WILL: So you can do that--

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.440
FILIP: So, symmetric?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.050
WILL: Yeah.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.290
FILIP: OK, so the
horizontal is 4,

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.520
and vertical is [INAUDIBLE] 16.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.324
WILL: It was 16.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.050
FILIP: Now I think it
might be even less, like 8.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.710
What do you think?

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.320
WILL: 12.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.505
We do things in fours.

00:17:41.505 --> 00:17:42.455
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:46.620
WILL: That feels
right for some reason.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.520
FILIP: Yeah, all right.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.890
I trust you.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.450
WILL: And that's
one of the lessons

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.550
we got from
Fortnightly and Reply,

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.280
is giving space to the words.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.770
Because one of the
things that we've learned

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:04.810
is that if you read a
pictographic text, like most

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.260
Chinese glyph
sets, and Japanese,

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.790
you can take much
denser text and still

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.320
be able to comprehend
it quickly.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.340
But we, being based
on Latin characters,

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.060
end up reading these things
out phonetically in our heads.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.550
So if too much is
going on, then we

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.880
can't follow the
line with our eyes

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.770
in order to read it out loud.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.230
So that's why we prefer--

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.550
speaking English-- more
space around these words.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.134
But if you were doing
this in Chinese,

00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:38.174
you could go ahead and
bring that all the way in,

00:18:38.174 --> 00:18:39.550
and try to put as
many characters

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.200
as you want on the page.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.079
And that might be
preferred by your users.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:43.870
FILIP: Interesting.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.610
That's good to know.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.230
OK, so we have this now.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.520
Now what about this bottom bar?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.480
Do we want to--

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.230
WILL: Yeah, it's not
doing much right now.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.170
FILIP: Should I
just make it black?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.740
WILL: Black would be cool.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.780
I mean, we're just
playing now anyway.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.280
I mean--

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.690
FILIP: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.990
So I saw a bottom bar color.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.247
So we can just do black.

00:19:09.247 --> 00:19:10.580
WILL: But that's bottom app bar.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.998
This is a tab bar.

00:19:11.998 --> 00:19:12.956
FILIP: Ah, that's true.

00:19:12.956 --> 00:19:14.240
OK.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.610
So we need to set it--

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.990
I think we need to set
it somewhere around here,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.890
BottomNavigationBar.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.757
BottomNavigationBar.

00:19:24.757 --> 00:19:26.590
WILL: Were there no
fields inside theme data

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.210
that refer to bottom
navigation bar?

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.912
FILIP: I'm not sure.

00:19:29.912 --> 00:19:30.940
I assume not.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.600
So bottom-- no.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.100
WILL: OK.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.050
FILIP: So color?

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.800
Fixed color?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.300
WILL: Hm.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.800
FILIP: Hm.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.130
The color of the selected
item on button navigation bar

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.690
is fixed.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.800
WILL: Well it shouldn't be
broken in the first place.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.450
So, ThemeData.primarycolor
is what

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.290
it's taking, which is why
it's yellow to read there.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.280
And then if I don't know
where a color is coming

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.860
from in the widget because
theming is involved, I go back

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.500
to the inspector, and look up
the tree till I find a theme

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.110
data that encapsulates
it, and then

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.420
see this is clearly a
white or gray, like--

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.130
FILIP: Right.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.430
So I just do the
whole thing here?

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.230
WILL: Mm-hmm.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.220
FILIP: And then we have--

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.350
WILL: Probably this stack or
the bottom navigation tile

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.380
is the thing that
actually has a color.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.050
And it may not
tell you in there,

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.610
which is OK, because we're just
going to keep going up the tree

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.470
until we find what
we're looking for.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.602
FILIP: So should I go up?

00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:46.143
WILL: Mm-hmm.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.270
Great.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.311
So that's the other tile.

00:20:52.311 --> 00:20:53.580
That's the two tiles.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.900
There's a text
tile, which must be

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:02.012
we're getting the information
for the text that's in there.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:03.220
FILIP: So that's the builder.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.890
WILL: Go past that Custom
Paint, because that's

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.150
the top thing I can see.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.370
So it's a piece of material.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.130
FILIP: Mm-hmm.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.348
Transparency, though.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.190
WILL: So we could find
out where material

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.827
with the type transparency
gets its color by default.

00:21:28.827 --> 00:21:31.821
FILIP: OK.

00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:33.772
WILL: That's my best guess.

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:34.750
FILIP: Let's do that.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.750
WILL: There might be a
better way to do this,

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.250
and I just don't know.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.510
FILIP: So do we--

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.080
ah.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.520
WILL: So I do
Command-O, and that

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.890
lets me pull up the
class that I want to see.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.006
Yeah.

00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:53.317
And it's good to--

00:21:53.317 --> 00:21:55.650
especially for material-- do
that, because material.dart

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.690
is also an umbrella header.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.390
So if you end up trying to
go to the file material.dart,

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.700
you may end up in the one
that has no content for you.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.960
FILIP: Right.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.610
So we need a transparency--

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:08.790
OK.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.000
And so where is this used?

00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:19.520
Oh, many places.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.524
Hey, it looks like
it's just transparent,

00:22:21.524 --> 00:22:22.440
which is weird, right?

00:22:26.832 --> 00:22:30.170
WILL: Yeah, so it returns
that instead of the other one

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.870
that has a background
color set on it.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.380
FILIP: So maybe there's
something even like--

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.320
WILL: Maybe there's another
way that this is set, then.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.700
FILIP: So do this again.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.240
Constraint docs?

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.220
WILL: Oh, it looks like it's in
the-- was it in another stack?

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.981
FILIP: This?

00:22:49.981 --> 00:22:50.480
WILL: Yeah.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:50.800
Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.341
You're right.

00:22:51.341 --> 00:22:52.730
You still keep going up.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.760
And then-- because you
see, it's all still

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.070
around just that area.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.142
OK, now we've left it.

00:22:59.142 --> 00:23:01.100
So whatever the last
thing you hit was before--

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.766
FILIP: This one.

00:23:01.766 --> 00:23:03.031
WILL: --going up.

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:03.530
OK.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.930
So that is the top
widget in this branch

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.360
of the tree that controls
the bottom navigation bar.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.568
FILIP: This is really useful.

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:15.266
We're getting, like, how do
you debug things like this.

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:21.650
Oh, color-- FAFAFA, maybe.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.310
WILL: Maybe.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.046
"Fa-fa-fa."

00:23:24.046 --> 00:23:26.700
FILIP: " Can I change it here?

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.537
No.

00:23:27.537 --> 00:23:29.870
WILL: No, but we could then
search through the code base

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.150
to see where that is.

00:23:35.775 --> 00:23:40.130
FILIP: But physical model
having color, isn't that weird?

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.220
WILL: Well, physical
model is one of the--

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.163
if I'm not mistaken, what
material is made out of.

00:23:45.163 --> 00:23:46.070
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.030
WILL: So since material is
the primitive of all views

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.660
that we have in the
material library,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.310
this is the primitive of that.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.880
FILIP: Right.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.780
So I think this might be
what we are looking for.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.350
WILL: OK, so the color
is being set somewhere.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.760
FILIP: This is the color here.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.415
That's for sure.

00:24:06.415 --> 00:24:07.870
Hm.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.790
WILL: But the problem is
if it's not part of the API

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.740
that we have access to
in bottom navigation

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.740
bar, that's not much use to us.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.446
FILIP: Yeah.

00:24:17.446 --> 00:24:19.484
Widget Animate Color?

00:24:19.484 --> 00:24:20.432
Hm.

00:24:20.432 --> 00:24:21.380
Widget Color.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.360
Yeah.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.215
All right, so where is this--

00:24:27.215 --> 00:24:30.610
WILL: This might be a
Stack Overflow moment.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:31.440
FILIP: Oh, really?

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.030
WILL: Yeah

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.400
FILIP: OK

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.930
WILL: Oh, did you
think I was teaching?

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.920
No.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.770
FILIP: No, wait, so there's
the background color used here.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.460
getBackgroundColor.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.530
How do you get a
background color?

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.030
WILL: Oh--

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.930
FILIP: Material.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.820
WILL: Return null.

FILIP: Theme.of context
cardColor, or canvasColor.

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:54.780
WILL: Only if that's
your type of material.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.600
And ours is transparency.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.820
FILIP: Well, but no,
this is coming from--

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.050
we're not coming
from the add bar.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.950
I came here from the other one.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.980
WILL: Oh, from bottom--

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.820
FILIP: Yeah.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.830
Let's try either--

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.900
WILL: Yeah, let's play with
the other theme data values.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.550
FILIP: Yeah, canvas or card.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.490
OK.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.050
Just before we go through
the whole cycle of things.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:29.060
So, cardColor, Colors.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.836
Yeah, I don't want this anymore.

WILL: Not cardColor,
which makes sense.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.185
It's not like a card.

00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.530
But it's kind of like a canvas.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.113
FILIP: Canvas.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:45.370
Ooh.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.100
WILL: Yes.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:46.734
FILIP: Yes.

00:25:46.734 --> 00:25:47.400
WILL: That's it.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.935
FILIP: Does it look good?

00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:50.310
WILL: Well, the
one thing that we

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.540
might want to check
is, is the black, which

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:59.490
is kind of our text color,
accessible against the yellow?

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.695
Does it have a high
enough contrast ratio.

00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:03.840
And so I do that by--
there is a website,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.670
if you search for
it in Google.com,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.880
just go contrast ratio.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.290
FILIP: What the hell was that?

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:11.340
Contrast ratio.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.210
WILL: I can't teach you
how to spell, Filip.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.650
FILIP: Contrast ratio.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.770
WILL: Yeah, and
then scroll down.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.845
There's like-- there it is.

00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.220
You know, I could
have remembered

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.410
that-- contrast.ratio.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.280
So it doesn't matter
if you put one

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.730
in the background or the other.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.400
It's just going to give you the
same number, because they're

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.899
related.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.667
FILIP: And then black?

00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:36.500
WILL: Yeah, I think you
can just type black,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.830
and it understands it.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.899
FILIP: 15.7.

00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:39.690
WILL: That's great.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.140
FILIP: That's great?

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:40.639
WILL: Yeah.

00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:45.960
Just for fun, go to
white where black is.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.970
FILIP: White.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.480
WILL: Yeah.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.740
So you see?

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.198
This is a mistake
that people make.

00:26:52.198 --> 00:26:52.906
FILIP: I like it.

00:26:52.906 --> 00:26:55.710
WILL: Yeah, very sad.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.090

least 3, I think,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.820
for large text, and
4.5 for small text,

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.070
is a good rule of thumb.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.407
FILIP: OK, so we're good.

00:27:09.407 --> 00:27:10.240
WILL: So we're good.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.365
Just a good thing to check.

00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.930
FILIP: So one thing
that we're not that

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.110
great with is black on black.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.760
So maybe we can fix that.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.290
Let's see.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.538
[ELEVATOR MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.830
So there was so long
odyssey of looking

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.450
at code and other
things, using the things

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.880
that we've shown you before.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.300
We basically went
to the inspector

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.850
and saw that the text that we
were trying to get not black

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.680
is here, and that it's defined
in bottom navigation tile.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.650
So we did bottom
navigation tile,

00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:02.040
and we read the source until
Will figured out that it's

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.485
using the caption theme.

00:28:03.485 --> 00:28:04.860
WILL: Yeah, it's
got a cool color

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.900
tween, which is a
kind of animation that

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.910
goes between two colors.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.640
And it said that one
color is the color

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.350
that we've passed in
another place, which

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.370
ends up being the yellow.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.953

was the one that you

FILIP: That's true.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.500
WILL: Which makes
sense, because it's

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.160
kind of like a caption for
the icon, or a caption for--

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.920

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.230

other one on the right?

between, we have this.

FILIP: Yeah, that's my bar.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.870
WILL: One thing I worry about
is you want to make sure

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.065
that you have 48 by 48 for
the hit zone around anything

00:30:41.065 --> 00:30:42.190
that's going to be touched.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.640
And this one brings it pretty
close to the other one.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.050
FILIP: Right.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.740

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.709
so if you tap on Comments,
does that do anything?

00:30:50.709 --> 00:30:51.750
FILIP: No, but it should.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.320
It should.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.653
WILL: What do you want it to do?

00:30:53.653 --> 00:30:56.460
FILIP: To maybe open
the comments of the--

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.160
because this one goes
to the source article,

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.750
as in your Hacker News, but
this one shows you the comment--

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.660
should show you.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.820
We haven't implemented it yet.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.740

to say, I think I could--

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.054
if it were pinned to
it over here, or if--

00:31:12.054 --> 00:31:13.710
OK.

I'm not married to it
being this icon, right.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.240

Let's do Start.

WILL: Well, what
I think would be

00:31:24.395 --> 00:31:28.925
perfect is if you could
tap on the title now

00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:31.300
that it's selected, because
it kind of looks like a link,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.398
and if that took you out there.

00:31:33.398 --> 00:31:35.880

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.150

FILIP: But we're using
this expansion tile.

it can do for us.

Initially expanded-- yeah,
that's really much it.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.650
I think it only has that.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.530
WILL: Well, IRL, we could
wrap the text widget

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.920
inside a gesture
recognizer for tap.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.710
And we might need
to then really note

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.970
if it's already in its
expanded state or not.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.672
Well, it depends on what
we want the UX to be.

00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:17.170

needed to check.

00:32:25.101 --> 00:32:25.600
OK.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.480
OK, so because of the
limited time, let's just--

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.820
WILL: Let's lose it,
and just align the 810.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.110
FILIP: Yes.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:40.970
So the whole thing here, we
don't need this, by the way.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.737
So the whole row--

00:32:43.737 --> 00:32:44.570
WILL: The whole row.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.260
FILIP: --should
be a heading of--

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.870
WILL: Is that 16?

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.220
FILIP: Mm-hmm.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.050
And it's probably symmetric.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.666
Horizontal 16.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.756
Sorry?

00:33:03.756 --> 00:33:05.130
WILL: It's starting
to look good.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.990
I like that layout already.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.920
One thing that's not so
great is that the icon

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.580
is center-aligned to that text,
and it might make more sense

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.778
if it were baseline-aligned.

00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:22.145
FILIP: Oh, so like
crossAxisAlignment, cross--

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:25.650
baseline?

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:26.160
WILL: Maybe.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.130
If not, then the bottom one.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.080
FILIP: What does it say?

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.930
crossAxisAlignment
is not baseline.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.770
Oh, we need the text baseline.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.680
WILL: Oh, well then
let's try just--

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.350
because we're lucky it's
aligned with the end.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.422
No, because that-- is
that an icon button?

00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:54.380
That looks bad with all
that padding around it.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:54.830
FILIP: Yes.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.538
WILL: Never mind.

00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:56.960
It's fine the way it was before.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.790
FILIP: Right.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:04.440
Maybe we'll want to just give
it some space, like with a--

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.280
I sometimes do this if I'm lazy.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:06.830
So like--

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.229
WILL: We all do that.

00:34:09.229 --> 00:34:09.729
FILIP: 16.

00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:13.912
WILL: Oh, that's much better.

00:34:13.912 --> 00:34:15.620
Now I really feel like
I have enough room

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.000
kind of for my thumb.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.650
FILIP: Right.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.179
WILL: Or whatever.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.095
Well, I mean, most of
the time you touch stuff

00:34:20.095 --> 00:34:21.100
with your thumb.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.600
Yeah.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.590
FILIP: Yeah, all right.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.960
So what else?

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:32.060
So I don't love the blue,
but maybe it's fine.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.710
WILL: Well, I think
we need to admit

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.650
that, while we've had some
fun putting in the Owl thing

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.409
to see the big changes, now
might be the time to put them

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.750
to the values from
Fortnightly, which

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.275
would be probably more beautiful
and pleasing in the long run.

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:46.400
FILIP: Right.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.520
So you want to do the--

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.150
WILL: To white.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.691
FILIP: White.

00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:51.540
Back to white.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.310
WILL: Yeah.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.989
So--

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.459
FILIP: So the primary
color would be just white.

00:34:56.459 --> 00:34:57.250
WILL: Let's try it.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.460
FILIP: Yeah.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.310
WILL: Looking good.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.900
FILIP: Yeah.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.899
WILL: And you know what?

00:35:06.899 --> 00:35:10.820
I don't hate the black
tabs at the bottom, either.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.680
FILIP: Mm-hmm.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.800
Do you want to use a
different font, maybe,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.355
and that would be our finishing
thing to do in this [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.355 --> 00:35:21.920
WILL: Yeah, we
have a custom font.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.500
FILIP: Yeah?

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.690
WILL: Google Fonts has
thousands of them for free.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.230
FILIP: Fonts-- but you can
use any TrueType font, right,

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.620
or any webfont--

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.274
or basically, you don't
need to use Google Fonts is

00:35:36.274 --> 00:35:36.940
what I'm saying.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.606
WILL: Oh, right.

00:35:37.606 --> 00:35:40.040
No, it's just good to
know that your font has

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.170
a proper license for the
use you're going to have.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.340
FILIP: True.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.602
And with Google
Fonts, you're covered?

00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:48.060
WILL: It will tell
you the license,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.420
and if I'm not mistaken, almost
all of them are OK for use.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.230
FILIP: All right,
so what should we--

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:57.380
WILL: So usually
things are about type

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.510
have a serif font, like
Times New Roman or something

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.160
like that.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.370
FILIP: And by the
way, we're not--

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.970
you're not reading a lot.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.050
You're basically
reading just the title.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.910
So maybe for this--

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.400
and maybe we can keep
the comments in--

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.739
WILL: --in a sans-serif, yeah.

00:36:16.739 --> 00:36:18.280
I'm just talking
about headline text.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.321
FILIP: Yes, the headline.

00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:22.860
So the headline could be
something even like display.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.920
So the categories, I think, is
like-- so serif is like this,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.890
but display are
these weird, more--

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:30.930
WILL: Oh, those are fun.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.263
FILIP: Yeah, those are more fun.

00:36:32.263 --> 00:36:33.380
So maybe one of those?

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:33.880
WILL: Hm.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.840
Something futuristic
if it's Hacker News.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.530
FILIP: Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.321
WILL: We could go with
something monospace,

00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:40.860
because it looks like code.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.690
FILIP: True.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.020
Something bold, maybe?

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.380
Like the Fortnightly.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.984
I have-- where are they?

00:36:47.984 --> 00:36:48.952
Fortnightly.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.380
Oh, it's not bold.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.437
WILL: Well, it's kind of bold.

00:37:02.437 --> 00:37:03.520
FILIP: Right, yeah, it is.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.040
OK.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.020
So would you like--

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.409
should I start filtering?

00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:16.450
WILL: Well, I don't know.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.450
I'm no good at shopping.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.740
Oh, that one's kind of cool.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.510
FILIP: This one?

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.980
WILL: It's all futuristic-y.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.360
FILIP: Not very
readable, though.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.525
WILL: Not very readable.

00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:29.650
FILIP: What about this one?

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.615
No, it's--

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.253
WILL: That looks
like a ransom note.

00:37:32.253 --> 00:37:33.080
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.871
FILIP: That's true.

00:37:38.617 --> 00:37:42.044
This one is very newsy.

00:37:42.044 --> 00:37:43.768
Ugh, really?

00:37:43.768 --> 00:37:46.460
WILL: I-- ah-- too code?

00:37:50.364 --> 00:37:51.570
FILIP: I don't know.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.990
WILL: Too retro?

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.165
FILIP: We can do that.

00:37:54.165 --> 00:37:55.380
WILL: Do it.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.700
You'll notice it.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.770
FILIP: Yeah, all right.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:03.260
So normally, I never
know how exactly

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.449
to work with this, but
basically I do the--

00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:07.240
WILL: Move it down.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.660
FILIP: Yeah.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.960
And then it gives me a ZIP file.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:17.990
And then there's the license,
which I don't understand.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.080
And then there's the TTF font.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.030
And then I just put it inside--

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.850
WILL: I like to make
a fonts directory

00:38:27.055 --> 00:38:28.000
FILIP: Yes.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.840
Let me just make this.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.030
So--

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.690
WILL: Sibling with lib.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:41.290
And I'm just going to--

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.000
WILL: Drag it in.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.920
FILIP: Drag it in.

Yes.

00:38:51.877 --> 00:38:53.710
All right, and now we
need to go to pubspec.

00:38:58.646 --> 00:39:00.856
Now I don't know how to add it.

00:39:00.856 --> 00:39:03.040
WILL: It's a font.

FILIP: Right.

I'm just going to do this.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.690
So the family, we can actually--

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.010
so PressStart.

WILL: I think so.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.330

need to close the app,

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:52.720
and rerun it again.

Oh, you want to do
it with a text theme?

call this the Boring Show,

but I've always

model isn't just a great way

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.290
to pass information
through your widget tree,

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:05.780
it's also an elegant way to
implement material theming.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.730
It's a good thing.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.505
FILIP: Yeah.

00:41:07.505 --> 00:41:13.630
It's [INAUDIBLE] All right, so
it looks like it's coming up.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.160
OK.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.430
Yep.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:20.050
And now you were asking me--

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.930
how do we get this huge text?

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.040
WILL: So I think if we click
on text, and then look at its--

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.750
for default text style
and then its debug label,

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.891
that's what it is.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:34.390
Subhead.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.660
FILIP: Subhead.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.560
Is it subhead?

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.920
Really?

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.780
WILL: Well, what do
you think a subhead is?

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.613
FILIP: I don't know.

00:41:40.613 --> 00:41:42.410
[CHUCKLING]

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:51.740
OK, so subhead is new text
style with a font family of--

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.630
I forgot-- PressStart.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.270
WILL: And if it
didn't yell at us--

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.210
FILIP: Whoa.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.170
[CHUCKLING]

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.640
WILL: Well--

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.310
[CHUCKLING]

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.200
--you notice it.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.810
I've definitely
noticed the change.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.470
I bet everybody
at home has, too.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:12.360
FILIP: Yes, yes.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.590
No, I like it.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.090
I like it.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.280
Maybe I'll make it
a little less huge.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:17.790
WILL: Yeah.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:21.960
FILIP: Yeah, so maybe what--

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.750
WILL: 12.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.820
FILIP: fontSize--
not fontWeight.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.770
fontSize 12.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.960
No.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.590
Was it 12?

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.049
WILL: Since it's the theme, you
might have to do a hot restart.

00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:42.590
FILIP: Right.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.360
No

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.340
WILL: Did that get bigger?

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.877
FILIP: No, it's the same size.

00:42:51.877 --> 00:42:52.960
I know what was happening.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.489
WILL: Oh, it's new text.

00:42:55.489 --> 00:42:56.030
FILIP: Right.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.280
What does it not get--

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:07.050
oh, maybe it's
overridden by the thing.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:08.300
But anyway, we don't have--

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.085
I think we don't have time
for another hunt for where

00:43:13.085 --> 00:43:14.120
it's set up.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.950
I think we've definitely
made it a more memorable app.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.750
Thank you for your
service, Will.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.130
WILL: My pleasure.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.350
So I know we're out
of time for today.

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.380
We haven't gotten the
app where we want it.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.760
It's certainly not in the
finished design state.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.580
But we have discovered all
of the API in the places

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.160
that we need in order
to make some of our most

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.300
opinionated changes.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.210
So maybe on your own,
or with a designer,

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.060
you can then go in and really
pick the font that you want,

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.200
really pick the
colors that you want.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.530
And now you know how to
make it look that way.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.110
FILIP: Yeah.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.910
And thank you for being
with me on the show.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:57.920
What we talked today about
is the Material.io site,

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.710
where you can get
inspiration for your app,

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.300
and how to architect
it in terms of design.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:09.590
We also talked about
basically theming in general.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.130
How to-- if you don't
know how to get--

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.530
like how does Flutter get
to say that this thing will

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.370
be, like, gray?

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.820
How do you do debug that
using the Flutter Inspector?

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.870
And then we also implemented
new fonts, and made--

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:30.080
I think the app looks way
better than it did before,

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.820
and it's definitely more custom.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.420
WILL: Yeah.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.280
And we definitely changed the
theme data values ourselves,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:42.480
with copy width, and also by
making some of them explicit.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.930
And so these will propagate
throughout the whole app.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.070
FILIP: Yeah.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.840
All right, so
thanks for watching,

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.100
and see you in the next episode.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.700
WILL: Thanks.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:55.250
