00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629
let's do one more radical equation

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
let's do one more radical equation
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.889
let's do one more radical equation
example and we'll make this one a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
example and we'll make this one a
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.950
example and we'll make this one a
slightly a slightly hairy one so let's

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
slightly a slightly hairy one so let's
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.560
slightly a slightly hairy one so let's
say we have the principal square root of

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570
say we have the principal square root of
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.730
say we have the principal square root of
10 minus 5x plus plus the principal

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
10 minus 5x plus plus the principal
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.939
10 minus 5x plus plus the principal
square root of 1 minus X is equal to 7

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
square root of 1 minus X is equal to 7
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.830
square root of 1 minus X is equal to 7
now just like I've said over the last

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
now just like I've said over the last
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.050
now just like I've said over the last
two videos your goal is always to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
two videos your goal is always to
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.089
two videos your goal is always to
isolate one of the radicals and then

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
isolate one of the radicals and then
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.400
isolate one of the radicals and then
square both sides of the equation so we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
square both sides of the equation so we
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.860
square both sides of the equation so we
can isolate this one right here by let's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
can isolate this one right here by let's
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930
can isolate this one right here by let's
subtract this radical from both sides of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
subtract this radical from both sides of
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000
subtract this radical from both sides of
this equation so you get minus the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010
this equation so you get minus the
 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.850
this equation so you get minus the
square root of 1 minus X minus the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
square root of 1 minus X minus the
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.479
square root of 1 minus X minus the
square root of 1 minus X the left-hand

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
square root of 1 minus X the left-hand
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910
square root of 1 minus X the left-hand
side these cancel out the left-hand side

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
side these cancel out the left-hand side
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549
side these cancel out the left-hand side
you're just left with the square root of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
you're just left with the square root of
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.380
you're just left with the square root of
10 minus 5x is equal to on the right

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390

this from both sides essentially moving

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
this from both sides essentially moving
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.590
this from both sides essentially moving
it over to the right hand side now we've

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
it over to the right hand side now we've
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.050
it over to the right hand side now we've
isolated one of the radicals let's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
isolated one of the radicals let's
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.870
isolated one of the radicals let's
square both sides of this equation so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
square both sides of this equation so
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480
square both sides of this equation so
this squared 10 minus 5x squared is just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
this squared 10 minus 5x squared is just
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399
this squared 10 minus 5x squared is just
going to be or the square root of 10

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
going to be or the square root of 10
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.010
going to be or the square root of 10
minus 5x squared so if I square that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
minus 5x squared so if I square that
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480
minus 5x squared so if I square that
that's just going to be equal to 10

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
that's just going to be equal to 10
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690
that's just going to be equal to 10
minus 5x and this is going to be equal

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
minus 5x and this is going to be equal
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.840
minus 5x and this is going to be equal
to this expression squared now this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850
to this expression squared now this
 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910
to this expression squared now this
might look a little daunting but you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
might look a little daunting but you
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039
might look a little daunting but you
just have to remember you just have to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
just have to remember you just have to
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.640
just have to remember you just have to
remember that a plus B squared is equal

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
remember that a plus B squared is equal
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.840
remember that a plus B squared is equal
to a squared plus 2 a B plus B squared

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
to a squared plus 2 a B plus B squared
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.770
to a squared plus 2 a B plus B squared
in fact you don't have to remember it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
in fact you don't have to remember it
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120
in fact you don't have to remember it
you could actually multiply it out if

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
you could actually multiply it out if
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.310
you could actually multiply it out if
you ever forget this now this is just

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
you ever forget this now this is just
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.760
you ever forget this now this is just
the same situation where a is a 7 and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
the same situation where a is a 7 and
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.090
the same situation where a is a 7 and
our B is negative the square root of 1

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
our B is negative the square root of 1
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.719
our B is negative the square root of 1
minus X so if we expand this out or

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
minus X so if we expand this out or
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209
minus X so if we expand this out or
multiply this out this is going to be 7

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
multiply this out this is going to be 7
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580
multiply this out this is going to be 7
squared it's going to be 7 squared which

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
squared it's going to be 7 squared which
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.380
squared it's going to be 7 squared which
is 49 and then plus 2 times 7 times this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
is 49 and then plus 2 times 7 times this
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359
is 49 and then plus 2 times 7 times this
so this is a negative right here so it's

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
so this is a negative right here so it's
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.770
so this is a negative right here so it's
going to be minus 2 times 7 let me write

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
going to be minus 2 times 7 let me write
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.460
going to be minus 2 times 7 let me write
well.alright

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
well.alright
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550
well.alright
times 7 times the square root

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
times 7 times the square root
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890
times 7 times the square root
root of 1 minus X we got the negative

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
root of 1 minus X we got the negative
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500
root of 1 minus X we got the negative
sign from that negative sign the 7 is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
sign from that negative sign the 7 is
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.270
sign from that negative sign the 7 is
over there 1 minus square root of 1

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
over there 1 minus square root of 1
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.059
over there 1 minus square root of 1
minus X is there 2 times it when you

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069
minus X is there 2 times it when you
 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.500
minus X is there 2 times it when you
take a perfect square that just ends up

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
take a perfect square that just ends up
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.880
take a perfect square that just ends up
when you actually take the product and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890
when you actually take the product and
 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.350
when you actually take the product and
then finally Plus this guy squared this

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
then finally Plus this guy squared this
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
then finally Plus this guy squared this
guy over here squared now the negative

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
guy over here squared now the negative
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280
guy over here squared now the negative
part negative 1 squared that's just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290
part negative 1 squared that's just
 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.160
part negative 1 squared that's just
becomes positive square root of 1 minus

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
becomes positive square root of 1 minus
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.670
becomes positive square root of 1 minus
x squared is just going to be 1 minus X

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
x squared is just going to be 1 minus X
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.059
x squared is just going to be 1 minus X
and let's simplify this so this is going

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069
and let's simplify this so this is going
 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.800
and let's simplify this so this is going
to be equal to 10 minus 5x is equal to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
to be equal to 10 minus 5x is equal to
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.960
to be equal to 10 minus 5x is equal to
well one thing we can do let's add the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
well one thing we can do let's add the
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.620
well one thing we can do let's add the
49 and the 1 so you add the 49 and the 1

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
49 and the 1 so you add the 49 and the 1
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.300
49 and the 1 so you add the 49 and the 1
you get 50 50 and then minus this is 2

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
you get 50 50 and then minus this is 2
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.559
you get 50 50 and then minus this is 2
times 7 is 14 times the square root of 1

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
times 7 is 14 times the square root of 1
 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.140
times 7 is 14 times the square root of 1
minus X and then we have this final

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
minus X and then we have this final
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.009
minus X and then we have this final
minus X out here minus X now let's see

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019
minus X out here minus X now let's see
 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.860
minus X out here minus X now let's see
what else we can do here we can subtract

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
what else we can do here we can subtract
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.050
what else we can do here we can subtract
10 from both sides of this equation I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
10 from both sides of this equation I
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460
10 from both sides of this equation I
don't want to do too many steps at once

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
don't want to do too many steps at once
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.370
don't want to do too many steps at once
cuz I don't want to this is a slightly

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
cuz I don't want to this is a slightly
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140
cuz I don't want to this is a slightly
involved problem so if you subtract 10

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
involved problem so if you subtract 10
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530
involved problem so if you subtract 10
from both sides you get negative 5x is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540
from both sides you get negative 5x is
 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.180
from both sides you get negative 5x is
equal to 40 minus 14 times the square

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
equal to 40 minus 14 times the square
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.979
equal to 40 minus 14 times the square
root of 1 minus X minus X and then we

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
root of 1 minus X minus X and then we
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.530
root of 1 minus X minus X and then we
can add X to both sides essentially

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540
can add X to both sides essentially
 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.599
can add X to both sides essentially
getting rid of that character over there

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609
getting rid of that character over there
 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.930
getting rid of that character over there
so if you add X to both sides of this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
so if you add X to both sides of this
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.680
so if you add X to both sides of this
equation

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
equation
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.789
equation
the left-hand side becomes negative 4x

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799
the left-hand side becomes negative 4x
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.069
the left-hand side becomes negative 4x
and the right-hand side this guy

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079
and the right-hand side this guy
 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.840
and the right-hand side this guy
disappears and you're just left with 40

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
disappears and you're just left with 40
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.349
disappears and you're just left with 40
minus 14 times the square root of 1

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359
minus 14 times the square root of 1
 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.410
minus 14 times the square root of 1
minus X and now let's subtract 40 from

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420
minus X and now let's subtract 40 from
 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.390
minus X and now let's subtract 40 from
both sides I'm just trying to isolate

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400
both sides I'm just trying to isolate
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.129
both sides I'm just trying to isolate
this expression right here so let's

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139
this expression right here so let's
 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.069
this expression right here so let's
subtract 40 from both sides we get

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079
subtract 40 from both sides we get
 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.720
subtract 40 from both sides we get
negative 4x minus 40 is equal to

so the first one if we have negative 129
 

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.009
so the first one if we have negative 129
plus 105 plus 105

00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019
plus 105 plus 105
 

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:58.110
plus 105 plus 105
what do we get negative 24 then you

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120
what do we get negative 24 then you
 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.639
what do we get negative 24 then you
divide that by 8 that's going to be

00:08:59.639 --> 00:08:59.649
divide that by 8 that's going to be
 

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:01.710
divide that by 8 that's going to be
negative 3 so one of our answers is

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
negative 3 so one of our answers is
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.040
negative 3 so one of our answers is
negative 3 now what happens if we take

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.050
negative 3 now what happens if we take
 

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:12.629
negative 3 now what happens if we take
negative 129 minus 105 minus 105 we get

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:12.639
negative 129 minus 105 minus 105 we get
 

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:17.009
negative 129 minus 105 minus 105 we get
negative 234 divide that by 8 divide

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:17.019
negative 234 divide that by 8 divide
 

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:22.139
negative 234 divide that by 8 divide
that by 8 we get negative 29 point 2 5

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:22.149
that by 8 we get negative 29 point 2 5
 

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:23.850
that by 8 we get negative 29 point 2 5
so our two answers are negative 3 and

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:23.860
so our two answers are negative 3 and
 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.660
so our two answers are negative 3 and
negative 29 point 2 5 so X is equal to

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:27.670
negative 29 point 2 5 so X is equal to
 

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.809
negative 29 point 2 5 so X is equal to
negative 3 and x is equal to negative 29

00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:30.819
negative 3 and x is equal to negative 29
 

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:33.300
negative 3 and x is equal to negative 29
point 2 5

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
point 2 5
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.210
point 2 5
now remember this is a radical equation

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.220
now remember this is a radical equation
 

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.160
now remember this is a radical equation
we have to validate that both of these

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.170
we have to validate that both of these
 

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.990
we have to validate that both of these
work or if they don't work what they're

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000
work or if they don't work what they're
 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.759
work or if they don't work what they're
going to be extraneous solutions or one

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:41.769
going to be extraneous solutions or one
 

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:42.869
going to be extraneous solutions or one
of them might be an extraneous solution

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:42.879
of them might be an extraneous solution
 

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:46.980
of them might be an extraneous solution
so let's copy these and go back up to

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:46.990
so let's copy these and go back up to
 

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.860
so let's copy these and go back up to
our original problem up here right there

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:49.870
our original problem up here right there
 

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.240
our original problem up here right there
let me paste them so we remember what

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.250
let me paste them so we remember what
 

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.850
let me paste them so we remember what
our solutions were and let's let's just

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
our solutions were and let's let's just
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.980
our solutions were and let's let's just
evaluate them in the calculator to see

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:58.990
evaluate them in the calculator to see
 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.329
evaluate them in the calculator to see
if they work to see if they work I don't

00:10:03.329 --> 00:10:03.339
if they work to see if they work I don't
 

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:05.249
if they work to see if they work I don't
want to use that calculator use this

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:05.259
want to use that calculator use this
 

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.369

calculator much better all right so

00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:08.379
calculator much better all right so
 

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:10.619
calculator much better all right so
let's try negative 3 so we're going to

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:10.629
let's try negative 3 so we're going to
 

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:19.920

take the square root of 10 minus 5 times

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:19.930
take the square root of 10 minus 5 times
 

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.420
take the square root of 10 minus 5 times
negative 3 that's that right there we

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:24.430
negative 3 that's that right there we
 

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.790
negative 3 that's that right there we
got out of the radical plus the square

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800
got out of the radical plus the square
 

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:34.079
got out of the radical plus the square
root of 1 minus negative 3 1 minus

00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:34.089

obviously that would be positive 3 and

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:37.389
obviously that would be positive 3 and
 

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:38.970
obviously that would be positive 3 and
all of that what is that going to be

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:38.980
all of that what is that going to be
 

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.509
all of that what is that going to be
equal to it's equal to 7 so negative 3

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519
equal to it's equal to 7 so negative 3
 

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:44.309
equal to it's equal to 7 so negative 3
definitely works now let's try negative

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:44.319
definitely works now let's try negative
 

00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:48.660
definitely works now let's try negative
