00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.190 align:start position:0%
episode itself I thought it was kind of
 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.060 align:start position:0%
episode itself I thought it was kind of
lame<00:08:56.370><c> their</c><00:08:56.670><c> chemistry</c><00:08:57.000><c> was</c><00:08:57.060><c> awesome</c><00:08:57.540><c> I</c><00:08:57.810><c> I</c><00:08:58.320><c> I'm</c>

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
lame their chemistry was awesome I I I'm
sure<00:08:59.100><c> they</c><00:08:59.370><c> probably</c><00:08:59.400><c> won't</c><00:08:59.970><c> do</c><00:09:00.090><c> another</c>

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.330 align:start position:0%

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.330 align:start position:0%
sure they probably won't do another
crossover<00:09:00.720><c> but</c><00:09:01.050><c> if</c><00:09:01.170><c> they</c><00:09:01.320><c> did</c><00:09:01.530><c> maybe</c><00:09:01.890><c> I'd</c><00:09:02.160><c> be</c>

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
crossover but if they did maybe I'd be
 

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.100 align:start position:0%
crossover but if they did maybe I'd be
on<00:09:02.430><c> board</c><00:09:02.700><c> I</c><00:09:02.940><c> thought</c><00:09:03.240><c> was</c><00:09:03.420><c> great</c><00:09:03.540><c> like</c><00:09:03.930><c> they</c>
