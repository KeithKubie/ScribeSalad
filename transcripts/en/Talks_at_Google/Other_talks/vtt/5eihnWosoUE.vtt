00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: For all conditions, if
you look at men and women, if they have diabetes,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:13.181
they are three times more likely to die from
heart disease, no matter what they do. The

00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:18.020
only piece of good news is this study done
in The New England Journal in 2002 that looked

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.570
at people who were at risk of developing diabetes,
and they randomized these people to three

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.619
different groups. They gave one group of people
a sugar pill, one group they gave a diabetes

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.350
medicine that has been shown to prevent diabetes,
and in the third group they said 'here's your

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.420
diet, we want you to exercise 30 minutes four
times a week'. And they followed them for

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.190
four years and you can see that the rate of
developing diabetes if you did nothing is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.090
58 percent in this group. If you took the
medication, the rate of developing diabetes

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.710
is 31 percent. And if you adhered just to
lifestyle changes and didn't take medication,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.650
the rate of developing diabetes was 19 percent.
So diabetes can be prevented, which is probably

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.160
the single most important thing that we need
to know from this slide.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.690
I'm going to talk a little about stress and
heart disease and stress and women and heart

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.750
disease. This is the first report of a cardiomyopathy,
a weakening of the heart muscle, provoked

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.810
by stress in women in the United States is
published in the Journal of Circulation. And

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.490
this is what it looks like, it's called, you
may have heard of it, it's called "Broken

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.890
Heart" syndrome or sad heart syndrome or the
real name is stress-induced cardiomyopathy

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.929
or Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy. But this is
a picture of the main pumping chamber of the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.030
heart, and there's a catheter in here that
you really can't see very clearly. The catheter

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.390
is injecting dye into the main pumping chamber.
And this is before the heart beats and this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.260
is when the heart beats. So you can see in
this instance that this is the base of the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.280
heart and this is the apex of the heart. The
base of the heart is squeezing normally and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.530
the rest of the heart is just ballooning out.
The other name for this syndrome is called

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.690
'apical ballooning syndrome'. And this is
purely a response to some sort of severe emotional

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.060
stress. Fatal at times and seen almost exclusively
in women. This is an example of just an MRI

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.650
sequence. These are relaxation of the heart
pictures in people with stress-induced cardiomyopathy

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.720
and then in normal patients and then when
the heart beats, you can see the muscle here

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.290
compared to here thickens in normal people.
And in people with stress-induced cardiomyopathy,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.770
it actually doesn't thicken and bows outward.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.160
&gt;&gt;female #1: What kinds of stress [inaudible]?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.350
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, that's a great question.
Let me get to it, right here. So this is,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.730
this is actually the first group of patients
characterized in The New England Journal immediately

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.660
after that circulation article. Neurohormonal
features of myocardial stunting due to sudden

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.700
emotional stress, The New England Journal,
famous journal. Another same picture and you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.060
can see that in people with stress-induced
cardiomyopathies, this is an MRI sequence,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.860
there is no scar, this is all muscle looks
like on MRI, it looks the same kind of gray

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.100
density. In people with heart attacks, there
is a very bright scar. This is scarring and

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.640
permanent damage of the heart muscle. In the
cardiomyopathies, you don't have permanent

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.600
damage, you have transient damage that goes
away as the stressor goes away. So this is

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.120
the list of 19 patients that have this condition
and you can see the patients are numbered

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.180
here. Their age is given here and they range
anywhere from 27 to 77 and you can see they're

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.790
almost all women. There is one man in this
group, alright? And if you look a little further

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.220
you look at the emotional stressors.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.750
&gt;&gt;female #2: [inaudible]
[audience laughs]

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.840
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Exactly. Exactly right.
That is why that my wife will never have a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.260
surprise party as long as she lives, and that's
my excuse.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.260
[laughter]

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, so one surprise party
and some other, some other [inaudible]. But

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.350
most of them are deaths.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.420
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.850
&gt;&gt;Atul Sharma: I'm sorry.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.910
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible]

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.709
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Sure, sure. Mother's death,
car accident, surprise reunion, [audience

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.280
laughs] surprise party, father's death, husband's
death, friend's death, father's death, mother's

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.650
death, fear of procedure, which is an interesting
one. [audience murmurs] Fierce argument, friend's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.000
death, court appearance, fear of choking,
public speaking.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[laughter]

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.280
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, exactly. Husband's
death, armed robbery, son's death, and tragic

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.760
news. So usually some sort of

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.954
&gt;&gt;female #4: [inaudible] When someone asks
a question, do you mind just repeating it

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:49.954
into the mic so that [inaudible].

00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:51.950
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Oh sure, that you, yes,
I should do that, thank you, I forgot to do

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.840
that. So that's one link to stress and heart
disease that is not coronary artery disease.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.680
Most of the data on psychological stress and
psycho-social stress comes from a number of

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.200
European studies and this is the biggest one.
Eleven thousand patients and thirteen thousand

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.100
controls. They took people that were matched
for age, for sex, for gender, for occupation

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.621
and matched them as best they could and they
asked them to classify their stressors. Whether

00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:30.500
they were work stress, home stress, financial
stress or major life issues. And they just

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.490
followed these people for years. And they
found that people who classified themselves

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.280
as having one or more stressors were four
times more likely to have heart disease and

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.470
have heart events, whether it's a stress-induced
cardiomyopathy, sudden death, other conditions,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.030
other cardiomyopathies that are unexplained
or heart attacks. Another case, cardiovascular

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.700
events during the World Cup. This is actually
true of the Super Bowl, too. Viewing a stressful

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.850
soccer match more than doubles the risk of
acute cardiovascular event. In fact, in this

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.260
article the authors actually said that they
need to have preventive measures, I don't

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.330
know what those preventive measures would
be, but they need to take preventive measures

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.580
when the World Cup is on. [laughter] I don't
even know what they would do, but something

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.290
like that, right? Overtime work. Overtime
work associated with an increased risk of

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:30.400
developing heart disease. Being on call 24
hours, as a doctor, associated with an increased

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.090
risk of heart disease. In fact, this is one
of the reasons that the laws have changed

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.600
for physician work hours in Australia and
in the U.K. way before they changed here,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.500
but they finally changed here, too. That people
were developing stress-induced cardiomyopathies

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.040
and heart disease working 24-hour shifts.
Now, we don't really know why this happens,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:00.419
but stress leads to direct biological effects,
physical strain, hormonal changes, it leads

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:06.190
to maladaptive coping behaviors, such as smoking
or eating excessively, drinking excessive,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.100
alcohol. And then there are emotional immediate
effects on diet and activity levels and they

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:18.070
all lead to increased risk of disease. The
body's response to stress is usually one of

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.420
three, a set of three different phases. The
first phase is an acute alarm phase, where

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.740
you kind of everyone knows what it feels like
when you feel stressed, you get dry mouth,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.919
your hands get sweaty, you feel your heart
racing. Over time as you get used to the same

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.330
stressor, your body develops a kind of a tolerance
and a, and an acceptance of that level of

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.990
stress. And that's where most people are.
They're in high states of psycho-social stress

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.550
and they've kind of learned to resist those
effects on their body because they couldn't

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.770
have that same kind of effect for an extended
period of time. Eventually over time, the

00:07:52.770 --> 00:08:01.180
theory is that the energy sources become depleted
and the ability to resist stressors goes down.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.139
So psycho-social stress and heart disease
is very important because there are many different

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:12.199
kind of impacts on psycho-social stress. Psycho-social
stress in and of itself is a predictor for

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:18.240
heart disease. It is highly preventative and
people know it, but they won't go and seek

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.290
the care they need to because usually the
stress is preventing them from going and doing

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:30.600
something else. Stress in and of itself causes
a barrier to medical interventions and commonly

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.810
masquerades as heart symptoms. I see 10 to
15 patients a week who come see me for chest

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:44.610
pains and palpitations [inaudible]. Let's
talk a little more about psycho-social stress

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:51.139
and what I mean about it. It's grouped into
two big categories, one are emotional factors,

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:55.540
the other are chronic stressors. We'll talk
about emotional factors first. The first is

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.920
depression. This is a study looking at people
who had a heart attack and they classified

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.869
themselves into four different categories
based on a depression index. The higher the

00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:10.759
number, the more they were depressed. And
you can see that this is on the Y axis the

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:18.509
survival, the survival and this is days on
X axis and for any given increase in quartile

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:24.660
of the depression index they had an increased
risk for death. In fact that risk, clinical

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.230
depression, if you were actually classified
as being clinically depressed, is a higher

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:37.060
risk than diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking
or age. Two point nine, two point six nine

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.982
percent, sorry two point six nine times more
likely to have a second event. Hostility index.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:50.449
Hostility index is an interesting, I'll tell
you an interesting story. One day we were

00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:54.959
looking to, I was actually looking to park
my car near my apartment . Anyone who drives

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.619
in New York knows parking spots are at a premium.
I saw a spot, cut across, was ready to park

00:09:56.619 --> 00:10:04.939
into my spot and then of course someone else
drives in to park in, drive into the spot.

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:10.050
So I'm in front trying to parallel back in,
the person in front is trying to go in. So

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.200
of course being the Type-A personality and
hothead I am, I get out of the car and say,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.790
"What were you doing? This is my spot." Out
comes a very big, very tall, very strong looking

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.790
man

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.790
[laughter]

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.110
&gt;&gt;Atul Sharma: Who is not happy that I've
gotten out of my car, seemingly threatening

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:34.839
him. He gets out, starts yelling at me, hits
the back of my hood, of my trunk, the next

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:40.369
thing you know, the back windshield, broken.
Very high hostility index.

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:41.369
[laughter]

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:43.610
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Needless to say, I lost
the parking spot. And that kind of anger,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.499
if you've ever seen anybody , one of those
people that walks the street and gets pissed

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:54.119
off if you're walking too slowly, muttering
under your breath.

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:55.119
[laughter]

00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:59.869
&gt;&gt;Atul Sharma: You know those people? You
are classified as having a high hostility

00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:04.660
index and if you do or do not have heart disease,
you are at more risk for it. Twenty percent

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.369
increased risk of heart disease. So even if
you're just angry for any reason.

00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.040
&gt;&gt;female #5: [inaudible]
[laughter]

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.079
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, there is. This is
something I find really interesting. Type

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:21.130
A personality and heart disease first described
by two doctors, Friedman and Rosenman, described

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:27.189
as a continuous, deeply-ingrained struggle
to overcome real and imagined obstacles imposed

00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:32.360
by events, other people, and especially time.
Initially it was called the Hurry Sickness.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.660
Now I don’t imagine there's a lot of this
at Google.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.660
&gt;&gt;female #6: None.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.660
[laughter]

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.939
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: This seems like a very
relaxed, nice place to work.

00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:39.939
[laughter]

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:43.500
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: But where I [laughter]
where I work, we're all Type A.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.819
&gt;&gt;female #7: [inaudible] it's almost a requirement.

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:47.480
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Is that right?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.569
&gt;&gt;female #8: [inaudible] We hire Type A's.

00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:54.149
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Is that right? Well look,
they're, they're considered to be impatient,

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:55.619
competitive, easily irritated, hostile.

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:56.619
[laughter]

00:11:56.619 --> 00:12:00.899
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: The initial description
of Type A, competitive, suspicious and quick

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:05.420
to anger. Obviously they're very highly successful.
Those behaviors make them highly successful,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.430
however, they are not highly successful to
themselves, which is part of the problem.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.610
So there is one study that looks at Type A
personality and the risk of developing heart

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.360
disease and they found that there's a 50 percent
increase in coronary events over eight years

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.850
if you are a Type A. And it is a good predictor
of a second event if you already had a first

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.380
event. This is confirmed in large-scale population
studies, the Framingham study is probably

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.629
the biggest large-scale study that looks at
heart disease, this was confirmed in that

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:40.079
cohort of patients as well. And I think this
is probably the most important thing, you

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:46.470
know obviously, as you know, I have a young
daughter and I'm, I'm, I'm so Type A that

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:53.029
when she eats I've got a paper towel in my
hand, so I'm always wiping her hands and like

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:56.739
wiping the table and wiping the floor. So
now she has taken to grabbing the paper towel

00:12:56.739 --> 00:13:01.020
and just start cleaning wherever she is. So,
I tried to figure out if Type A personality

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.949
was inherited or taught.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:03.949
&gt;&gt;female #9: Taught.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.989
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Right, interesting question,
right? So, Karen Matthews, the University

00:13:07.989 --> 00:13:12.939
of Pittsburgh, noticed a striking parallel
between Type A adults and Type A children.

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:17.190
I'm just gonna read the paragraph, I think
it's interesting. Type A behavior may develop

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.041
as the result of child-rearing practices in
which parents and strangers, alike, urge children

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:27.149
to achieve at higher and higher levels, but
give them ambiguous standards for evaluating

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:32.170
their performance. The example is, "You're
doing fine, but next time try harder." This

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.689
leaves a child frustrated, without a sense
of belonging, and mistrustful of society.

00:13:36.689 --> 00:13:39.819
I think that may be a little much, but. [audience
chuckles] Moreover, there seems to be a snowball

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:46.259
effect: Children react to the combination
of positive evaluation, "You're doing well"

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:51.930
and urging of improvement, "Next time, try
harder" by becoming more competitive. In turn,

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.209
competitive, impatient children elicit more
positive evaluation and urging. So I find

00:13:57.209 --> 00:14:00.629
that to be very interesting. The structure
of the American classroom, with its reward

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:04.779
system, its competitiveness and its hourly
bells, can be seen to encourage such behavior

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:09.620
in children whose home environment makes them
susceptible. So, I'm worried for Zia.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.620
[laughter]

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.399
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: This is another thing I
find very interesting, it's an area of interest,

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:19.970
an area of research for me now, is chronic
stressors as they relate to work stress. So

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.239
there are two models for work stress. Now
again, this probably doesn't exist at Google,

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:29.129
but it exists a lot at the hospital. There
is the job strain model, which is very popular

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:34.670
in the United States, and looked at, looks
at job latitude as it relates to job demands.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.610
So if you have very high job demands, but
you have high job latitude, you don't have

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:44.759
someone micromanaging you, that's not considered
to be something that causes increased stress.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:50.439
However, if you have have high job demands
and low work latitude, that's considered to

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:55.061
cause job strain and increases your risk for
physical illness. Makes sense, but it's interesting

00:14:55.061 --> 00:15:01.850
that it's been studied. In Europe they, they
look much more at a reward-effort model. So

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:07.600
if you look at effort either low or high and
job reward low or high. If you're high effort,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.379
high reward, that's not dangerous. But if
you've high effort, low reward, that's job

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:17.840
imbalance and again, increases the risk of
physical illness. Marital stress. This does

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840
not apply to me.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840
[laughter]

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.809
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: So this is, this is a group
of women who were classified in three different

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:32.019
groups, either satisfied and married, unmarried,
or not satisfied in their or lowly satisfied

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:38.570
in their marriage. And the Y axis looks at
plaque scores within heart arteries. So you

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:43.709
can see that if you are happily married, you
are at lower risk than if you are not happily

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:49.790
married. The unmarried people are somewhere
in between, but not significantly different

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:56.199
than the married happy people. In addition,
the development of further plaques over the

00:15:56.199 --> 00:16:01.779
next two years is much more likely to occur
if you remain in an unhappy or a low-satisfaction

00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:10.439
marriage. Interesting. Ok. We've talked a
lot about stress, heart disease, problems.

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:17.019
How do we modify risk? I will stop for a second
and take questions if there are any. If not

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.019
I'll keep going. Yes.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.109
&gt;&gt;female #10: You showed, you were talking
about stress and stress events like your public

00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:20.230
speaking and if you're repeatedly exposed
to that kind of stress then your physical

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.230
reaction will decrease. Does that mean that
they're no longer stressed, or that someone

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:38.169
is no longer stressed, or does it just mean
that your body can't react [inaudible]?

00:16:38.169 --> 00:16:46.850
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: The question was, if someone
is repeatedly exposed to a stressor, such

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:53.329
as public speaking, usually they adapt, does
that mean they're no longer stressed or have

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:58.279
they adapted? The question, the answer is,
people have, adapt, they adapt to their environment

00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:03.660
and they no longer perceive that stress in
the same way, but they are still as stressed.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.350
Their body is still as taxed, they just don't
recognize it. It's like, the example I can

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:15.870
give you is if you were to have a kind of
a background kind of ringing noise in your

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.951
office, you might find it annoying for the
first day, two days, three days, but if it

00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:21.680
remained there, it would probably still be
annoying to you, but your level of perception

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.310
would decrease and you wouldn't notice it
as much. So it's similar for that. Yes?

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:38.040
&gt;&gt;female #11: So I looked at all of this and
I'm like ok, [inaudible] all day long.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.040
[laughter]

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.470
&gt;&gt;female #11: I drink a bottle of wine [inaudible]

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.470
[laughter]

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.470
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: That's very good for you,
I'll get to it.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.470
[laughter]

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.770
&gt;&gt;female #11: I have annuals, I have physicals
here and there, I mean I'm pretty much clean,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:58.090
right, very healthy? But I still, after looking
at this, I still have this fear of heart disease,

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:08.400
or heart attack at my desk one day or whatever.
So are you gonna talk about what we should

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.230
do to fix it, if we're worried about these
things but we still are, are getting a clean

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.510
bill of health from our doctors?

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.190
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: It's not part of the talk,
but I'm happy to talk to you offline about

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:23.200
it. There are a lot of new, newer techniques,
and this is something that you know being

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.390
part of a wellness and prevention center we
focus on. A lot of newer techniques to sub,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.730
to identify subclinical disease, disease that
doesn't give you symptoms, but is there. And

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:41.080
the extent of that disease based on age-match
controls will tell you if you are at high

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.060
risk or if you have a very low risk [inaudible].
There are ways to kind of see whether or not

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:52.530
you're in that quartile of people that have
subclinical disease but don't have symptoms

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.530
yet.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:19:04.870
&gt;&gt;female #12: [inaudible] What steps are taken
if you have a history of heart disease [inaudible].

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:10.280
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: So the question is, "What
steps are taken if you have a history of,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.491
a family history of heart disease?" And that's
a really good question, because I think that

00:19:13.491 --> 00:19:18.440
is one of the flaws in current risk assessment
for cardiovascular disease. If you look at

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.040
all the mod, and this is not to get too technical,
but if you look at all the modeling for cardiovascular

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.360
risk, the big studies for women, there's a
score called the Reynolds Risk Score, you

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.800
can look it up online. It's validated more
in women than the Framingham Risk Score, which

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.720
is actually based on a population in Framingham,
Massachusetts, middle aged white male population

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.500
doesn't apply to most of us in this room.
So they have these models, but none of them

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.390
incorporate family history into the model
because it's very hard to model something

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:54.920
so heterogeneous. So in that group of people,
the family history group of people, I think

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:02.630
there needs to be, what's happening now is
some sort of atherosclerotic imaging, imaging

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.540
to look for the precursor of cholesterol buildup
and so that's what I usually do. That's, I'm

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.880
on the writing committee guidelines that are
coming out next year for that as a AHA statement

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.920
and that's what will be advocated. It's not
advocated yet, but it will be in the next

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:27.570
year. Ok. Yes. I will keep going.
Modification of risk. Ok? This is probably

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:33.980
the most important slide. Multifaceted approach
to modification of your risk for developing

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:40.070
disease and risk for having some sort of body
reaction to stress, not just coronary artery

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:46.440
disease, blocked arteries, but body, physical
and mental breakdown from stress is best approached

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.670
through a multifaceted way. Whether it's dietary
changes, regular moderate physical activity,

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:58.500
smoking cessation for people who smoke, maintaining
an optimal weight, or really body mass index,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.920
not weight, moderate alcohol consumption and
behavioral modification to reduce stress.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.850
I will go through each one of these quickly
and in a little more detail. But this is a

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:15.480
slide looking at the importance of a multifaceted
approach. On the X axis here is a number of

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.180
protective factors and here are, there's three,
four and five if you look at the table on

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:27.530
the left. Three protective factors, sorry,
if you didn't smoke, you ate a healthy diet,

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.060
whatever that means, and regular exercise,
you reduced your risk for developing heart

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.920
disease by 50 to 60 percent. If you incorporated
a healthy body weight, it dropped to 66 percent,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.240
I'm sorry it increased to 66 percent. And
if you incorporated moderate alcohol use,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.560
out of moderate, the key word is moderate,
I'll get to what moderate is, your percent

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:53.450
reduction goes to 83 percent. So the more
different things you do, yes, yes, yes, I

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.980
agree. The more different things you do, the
better off you are.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:02.980
So let's talk a little about diet. So this
is a slide that talks about structuring your

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:11.250
meals. Practical advice. If you can either
plan your meals or have a single meal replaced

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:21.480
[inaudible] loves to go to this, this juice
place on 1st and 1st, what's the name?

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.480
&gt;&gt;female #13: [inaudible]

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.110
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Juice [inaudible] And she
will often use that as a meal replacement,

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:29.880
a lunch replacement. That has been shown,
and this is a study to prove it, that that

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:35.440
works better or as well than if you plan your
meals. So if you say I'm gonna eat this this

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.740
day, that that day, this that day, you plan
your diet out for the week. That's as good

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.090
as taking one day or one meal a day and having
a meal replacement. It has to be something

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:50.360
reasonable, whether its whatever, it needs
to be Slim Fast, but it can be, you know,

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.000
juicing, it can be whatever you want it to
be as a meal replacement, as long as it is

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.520
planned, it is much better than kind of winging
it for lunch. If you plan your food, you're

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:07.430
much more likely to lose weight, keep the
weight off. This is a slide looking at the

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:13.000
nurses' health clinic, this is the largest
cohort of women and it's women because it

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.520
started in the 60s where it was 99.4 percent
were female nurses. Looking at the nursing

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.990
health study and looking at fruit and vegetable
intake per day and risk for heart disease.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.550
So obviously we all know that people tell
you to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables and

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.240
you won't have heart disease. This is where
it comes from. This is the group of patients

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.030
that go from three to eight servings of fruit
and vegetable a day and you can see your risk

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:44.910
for developing heart disease drops about 20
percent. This is a similar slide, same group

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:53.830
of patients, in terms of dietary fiber, whole
grain and fiber. The more fiber you eat, the

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.990
more your risk of heart disease goes down.
What about different diets? There's so many

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.140
out there. We all know most of them. Ornish
diet, which is made very popular by Dean Ornish,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:11.140
a very, very low fat diet, it's a vegetarian
diet, almost all the protein comes from vegetarian

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.710
sources, almost no meat. The Pritikin diet,
which is a variant of the Ornish diet. Then

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:23.220
there are the intermediate fat diets, Sugar
Busters, Zone, etc. And the low-carb diets

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.880
which we all know about, Atkins, South Beach,
Slow Carb. And then calorie restriction diets,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.220
right? Weight Watchers. Which one of these
is better? Long term, short term? Well here's

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:39.380
the data. Ok? This is one study, 160 patients
randomized to four diets. This is kind of

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.850
an old study, but I'll get you the more newer
studies in a minute. Atkins, Zone, Weight

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:48.880
Watchers and Ornish. So Ornish is low fat.
Weight Watchers is a point system based on

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.830
calories, which is pretty easy to follow.
Zone is moderate carbohydrate. And Atkins

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:02.610
is low carb, high meat, high animal protein
source, sorry. And you can see the weight

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:10.130
loss is essentially the same [inaudible] seven
pounds and five pounds. The problem is most

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:16.080
people couldn't stay on the diet, which is
what we find with most diets, right? So no

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.260
real difference, hard to sustain. You can
see that 26 out of 40 stay on the diet. These

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.790
are people who are enrolled into a study.
They are people who are motivated to stay

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:29.500
on diets and even they can't stay on the diet.
So if you were to take it to the general population

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:38.790
it'd be less. This is a study looking at high
fat, protein or carbs. Either high carb or

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.670
low carb diets. High fat or low fat diets.
High protein and low protein diets. None of

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:49.040
them make a difference in terms of your weight
loss, in terms of change in your waist circumference.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.750
They're all kind of the same, you can see
the graphs are exactly the same. There's one

00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:02.550
controversial study, this is just the same
thing in a different table form, this is carbohydrates

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:09.200
at 65 percent, the square is 55, circle is
45, the diamond is 35. There's really no difference

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.190
whether you eat a high carb or low carb diet
long term in terms of weight loss, in terms

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.080
of waist circumference. This is the single
study that throws a wrench into all of that.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.250
This is a study published by the New England
Journal in 2008 and it looks at three different

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:29.190
diets, a low-fat diet, a Mediterranean diet,
which I'll get to, and a low-carb diet. And

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:34.480
that low-carb diet is a diet where it's less
than 30 percent of your calories from carbohydrates,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.100
so you really have to restrict all the carbs
you eat. And this is months on the X axis,

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:48.620
so it goes out two years, and this is weight
loss. And you can see that for a given time,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.000
you lose more weight with a low-carb diet
and you're more likely to keep it off compared

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.779
to a low-fat diet. This is the single study
that shows it. There's no difference between

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:01.460
low-carb and Mediterranean, but there is a
difference between both and a low-fat diet.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.110
So this is where the whole low-carb movement
came from. Everyone said, oh, this is the

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.170
way to go. This is the study that proves it.
This is a very controversial study and the

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:17.900
only study that shows it. [microphone feedback]
This is a, in my mind, a more important study.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.710
This is 605 people, it's called the Lyon Diet
Heart Study. It's probably the most famous

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:27.640
and most quoted heart diet study. Six hundred
five patients who had an event, had a heart

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.059
attack, randomized to either Mediterranean
or a Western diet. And the people who ate

00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.200
a Mediterranean diet lived longer. This is
the only study to show people lived longer

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:44.110
by eating a certain diet. It's followed over
five years. Ok, what is a Mediterranean diet?

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:50.960
This is the Mediterranean diet pyramid. Right?
Daily physical activity on the bottom, 30

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.900
minutes a day is what they advocate. Whole
grains as a base for your food, whether it's

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.950
couscous, polenta, wheats, and then large
servings of fruits, beans, nuts and vegetables.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:10.350
Oil, olive oil is the base for your cooking.
Cheese and yogurt daily, but in small amounts.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:17.890
And then less frequently fish, poultry, eggs,
sweets and very rarely, red meat. And in this,

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.940
wine in moderation, it's about two glasses
a day, and six glasses of water. So this is

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.970
a, this is a table for it and this is a practical
guide to a Mediterranean diet. If you wanted

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.870
to have a Mediterranean diet and you wanted
to know how to put it into action, this is

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.880
a simple way to do it. Base the diet on fruits,
vegetables and whole grains. If you need snacks,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:43.080
either keep nuts or carrots, almonds, apples,
bananas. These are things with low sugar index,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.480
so they're better foods to eat, pears also.
Breakfast every day. It's part of the Mediterranean

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.150
diet. You have to eat a breakfast. Most people
in that diet eat yogurt for breakfast, but

00:28:52.150 --> 00:29:02.190
you can have eggs. Obviously extra-virgin
olive oil or hummus as your, as your spreads,

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:07.090
and then whole grain bread instead of white
bread. Grilled fish or poultry if you're gonna

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:13.040
use a protein source that's what they want
you to eat. Eating oily fish three times a

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:19.170
week. And then milk, yogurt and cheese daily,
but not in large amounts.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:25.230
Alcohol. This is the only study looking at
alcohol and mortality. And I will keep it

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:31.231
short. They grouped people into who never
drank and assigned them an index of one. That's

00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:37.640
their relative risk. People who drank, but
very infrequently, and they defined that as

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:44.170
less than three drinks a week. People who
were former drinkers, drank more than 14 drinks

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.670
a week in the past. And then they grouped
three different groups of people who drink

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:54.430
regularly. So light was less than three drinks
a week. Moderate was three to fourteen drinks

00:29:54.430 --> 00:30:00.630
for men and three to ten drinks for women.
And heavy was more than 14 drinks for men,

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:06.340
more than 10 drinks for women per week. And
you can see that the light and moderate group

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.340
of people had a 25 percent reduction in all
cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:19.080
If you drink in moderation, you raise your
HDL, the good cholesterol, and you live longer.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.760
The heavy drinkers, it was indeterminate,
the line crossed over, the line of identity

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.420
crossed over, so it was a wide range, so it
couldn't tell if heavy drinkers were at high

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:33.350
risk or not at high risk. But the low people
who drank light or moderate amounts lived

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.350
longer.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.710
&gt;&gt;female #14: Can I ask a question?

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.390
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yes?

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:44.840
&gt;&gt;female #14: I've heard a lot about the benefits
of red wine. Is that, is this beyond red wine

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.461
or is this [inaudible].

00:30:46.461 --> 00:30:47.990
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: This is beyond red wine.
This is, they were not restricted in what

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.260
they could and could not drink. The reason
to drink red wine, especially if you're, if

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:59.760
you're thinking about it from a Mediterranean
diet perspective, is that most mixed drinks

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.010
or hard alcohol have, are sugar based, so
you have large sugar loads, which increases

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:09.809
your insulin levels, which is not thought
to be good long term. And dry wines are not

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:16.440
as sugary. So, so not a Riesling, but you
know something dry like a, like a Cab or something

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440
like that.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440
&gt;&gt;female #15: [inaudible]

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.500
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: So, yeah, I'm gonna go
over it again. The question is what is how

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:32.990
we define the alcohol usage. Light alcohol
was three, three drinks on average a week.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:40.950
Moderate was three to ten, for women, three
to fourteen for men. And heavy was more than

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:46.390
ten for women and more than fourteen for men.
Yes.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:55.510
&gt;&gt;female #16: So back to the red wine. So,
what do you tell your clients?

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.510
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Oh, yes, patients.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.510
&gt;&gt;female #16: As far as, you know [inaudible]

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.510
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: That's a good question.
I tell them to have a glass or two of wine

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:04.620
a day. And I don't think there's any risk
for that. A bottle of wine a day I'm not sure.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.620
&gt;&gt;female #17: I'm totally kidding.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.620
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: I know. I'm only joking
too.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.620
[laughter]

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:13.850
&gt;&gt;female #18: One more question. Is this really
saying that if you are an infrequent drinker

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:17.710
or you don't drink, that you're better off
starting to drink?

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yes.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.710
&gt;&gt;female #18: Wow.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:20.710
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yes, that's what it says.
[laughter]

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:21.710
&gt;&gt;female #19: [inaudible]

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.670
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: I will say it again. This
is saying that if you are not a drinker, if

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:34.480
you never drank, your risk is X. If you start
to drink, and you drink in the specified zones,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:41.179
your risk goes down by 30 percent, 25 percent.
Now that risk, that's a relative risk. Let

00:32:41.179 --> 00:32:46.060
me just kind of talk about risk with you here.
The numbers seem big. Let's say this is relative

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:52.100
risk, so I'll just give you a definition between
relative and absolute risk. Relative risk

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:58.770
is a term that we use that's based off absolute
risk. So if your risk is 5 percent and I tell

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:04.510
you that your relative risk reduction is 25
percent. It's 25 percent of 5 percent, so

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:10.480
it goes from 5 percent to 3.8 percent or whatever
it is. Right? So you're still at a risk of

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.933
[inaudible] percent, but it's, it's based
off an absolute risk, whatever your absolute

00:33:12.933 --> 00:33:20.650
risk would be.
Exercise. So this is a, a group of people

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:27.570
were asked to classify themselves in terms
of their fitness, whether they were considered

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:37.290
to be fit or unfit. Unfit was category one
[inaudible] and for any given group of fitness,

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.460
if you are unfit, men or women, you're more
likely to have cardiovascular events, you're

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:48.480
more likely to have your own classification.
So how do you become fit? Well, you exercise

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:57.270
obviously and how do you do that? The results
will surprise you. If you exercise at home

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:04.570
based on if you join a gym, you're much more
likely to A. continue to exercise and B. lose

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:11.639
weight. My [inaudible] Most people join a
gym, they go for awhile, they stop going.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:16.149
If you incorporate exercise into your home,
you're more likely to do it although we have

00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:21.859
heard of many treadmills as a clothing rack,
so. But this is the data. The data is what

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:25.329
the data is. I don't know what to say about
it. You lose more weight if you exercise at

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:26.329
home.

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:27.329
&gt;&gt;female #20: [inaudible]

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:30.730
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Then you can exercise at
home. So if you live in a studio apartment,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:35.899
this is what you do, this is what you do.
You are more likely to lose weight and more

00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:41.289
likely to be healthy if you engage in short
bouts of regular physical activity than if

00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:48.579
you plan to do one long 45-minute run. Ok?
So, this is the data saying if you exercise

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:54.339
in short bouts, you're likely to do more exercise
and likely to lose more weight. So how do

00:34:54.339 --> 00:34:57.710
you do that? You make it part of your life.
This is something that Googlers do a good

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:03.680
job of. If you program your physical activity
into your daily life, for example, [inaudible]

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:10.049
walks to work every day, then you are much
more likely to keep the weight off and keep

00:35:10.049 --> 00:35:16.690
exercising. So that is a single take home
point. Put exercise into your daily routine

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.619
so you don't have to go somewhere to exercise.
That is probably the most important thing

00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:26.650
you can do to continually exercise. Because
invariably you have demands from work, home,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:32.810
friends, whatever, and you can't get to the
gym [inaudible]. So you know the, New York

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:38.940
City has talked about a big ad campaign [inaudible]
to get off two stops, one or two stops before

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.670
their stop and walk the rest of the way, so
that's [inaudible].

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:54.680
Behavior modification. Behavior techniques.
How do you adjust your behavior? I'm not gonna

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.290
spend too much time on it, but there are ways
to self-monitor, which I think is very important.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:06.630
Ways to control your stimuli and ways to channel
negative thoughts and problem solve. So behavioral

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:12.140
elements in terms of self-monitoring. Create
a food diary and an exercise diary. Use it.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:18.390
Why do I say that? This is the data. They
looked at four different groups of people

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.650
who monitored their physical activity and
their diet. So either you didn't monitor at

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:27.430
all, monitored a little bit, monitored it
sometime, monitored it all the time. And over

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:33.279
time, people who monitored their diet and
exercise fastidiously, sorry, lost dramatically

00:36:33.279 --> 00:36:39.720
more weight than people who didn't monitor
at all. I'm talking 30-35 pounds. This is

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:45.369
an example of a food diary. I showed you one.
This is my food diary before I started my

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:51.499
diet. So you can see here before I started
this diet, this is my, this is my breakfast,

00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:58.690
I ate a lot of crap. [chuckles] Two eggs over
easy on a roll with hot sauce, not so good.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:04.799
Benny's Chicken Pad Thai for lunch, not so
good. Candy. I love chocolate, so. Chocolate,

00:37:04.799 --> 00:37:09.940
a lot. Or Van Leeuwen ice cream. And then
my wife and I used to order out a lot for

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:17.069
food, so either we'd order Indian food or
order in Kung Pao Chicken or whatever. And

00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:19.829
I thought nobody wanted to hear from a fat
cardiologist, [audience laughs] so I thought

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:25.700
I should change what I ate, so this is my
after I saw what I was eating, this is one

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:31.400
week of a three-week diary, I decided to change
my diet based on a kind of a slow-carb diet

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.990
to see what would happen. And this is my food
log for the next two weeks, and it's basically,

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:40.500
I'll talk about the diet offline if anyone
is interested, but high-protein meal first

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.430
thing in the morning and I found I wasn't
very hungry. So you can see my, just tracking

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:51.960
what I ate, I ate a lot less and I was able
to see it. Some people say write it down,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.249
some people say put it on a Google doc, some
people say take a picture of everything you

00:37:55.249 --> 00:38:01.599
eat before you eat it. So you can see what
you're eating. Exactly right. So in this diet

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:05.440
I wasn't allowed to eat certain things six
days a week and so I had a little section

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.423
where I had a wish list. And that was my wish
list. I wanted ice cream the first day I was

00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:13.330
on the diet. I wanted my Kit Kat the next
day. I wanted dark chocolate the next day

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:17.869
and then by the fourth day I didn't want anything.
And then I had a vice list. A list where I

00:38:17.869 --> 00:38:23.310
had, I don't know where my little tab is,
my vice list and my vice list is right here.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.381
So I was drinking two large bottles of this
every day and when I started this diet I thought

00:38:27.381 --> 00:38:30.999
I would cut down to the smaller bottles, didn't
really work very well, but I did have my one

00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:36.269
vice, which I think is very important. You
cannot deny yourself everything that you want,

00:38:36.269 --> 00:38:40.720
otherwise every diet is doomed to fail. So
on this diet I was able to eat, I was allowed

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.290
to eat whatever I wanted to eat on Saturdays.
So Saturdays, the first Saturday I had a , a

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:51.140
bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. Yeah, exactly.
And then a sandwich, because I wasn't allowed

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:54.010
much bread. And then I had my Kit Kat and
my ice cream.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.010
[laughter]

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.809
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: And then I had pasta, which
I also was not allowed to eat, and potatoes,

00:38:58.809 --> 00:39:03.260
which I was also not allowed to eat. So I
had my cheat day and that week I lost six

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.339
pounds. So the diet works. I don't know. This
is two weeks of the diet. But the idea is

00:39:07.339 --> 00:39:11.470
that if you monitor everything you eat and
make yourself look at it, you're more likely

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:17.400
to kind of be conscious of what you're doing.
So that's my story on that.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:23.160
Stimulus control. I think this has happened
at Google I think too. Modifying your environment

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.109
to facilitate weight control. So reduce cues
for overeating by only eating in one particular

00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:33.809
place. So, in our house we don't allow our
daughter to eat anywhere but the dining table.

00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:38.200
And we don't, well I don't eat anywhere but
there either. I can't say that for everybody.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200
[laughter]

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.549
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: If you, if you take stuff
and put it away where you can't see it, you're

00:39:44.549 --> 00:39:50.430
unlikely to eat it. So I think, I think that's
happened here. They've taken all the snacks

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.480
that used to be everywhere and moved them
to a kitchen, right? I think so. They're not

00:39:53.480 --> 00:40:00.900
all right in front of you to eat all the time.
If you keep healthy food in those locations,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.069
so let's say you like to watch TV and you
like to eat when you watch TV. If you put

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:10.720
almonds, unsalted almonds next to your couch,
you're more likely to eat those than to eat

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:17.250
Oreo cookies that are in the other room. And
give yourself a reward when you meet your

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.779
certain goals. Ok, that's the idea behind
my Saturdays, eating whatever I wanted.

00:40:21.779 --> 00:40:27.069
I don't know how much time I have left, probably
not much. But stress reduction I will talk

00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:32.630
a little about it. Stress reduction again,
multifaceted approach. The one approach that

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.990
has been studied a lot in the medical literature
is called the 'relaxation response'. It's

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:41.380
very similar to Transcendental Meditation.
It's sitting quietly in a room, closing your

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:47.420
eyes, focusing on a word that generally can
or cannot have meaning. The idea is not to

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:52.030
focus on the meaning of the word, but to focus
on the word itself and allow your mind to

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:57.549
kind of dive deeper into its recesses [inaudible].
The analogy they give is your mind is like

00:40:57.549 --> 00:41:01.829
an ocean and the top layer is choppy, but
if you allow yourself to get underneath it,

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:07.470
it seems quite tranquil. So if you allow yourself
20 minutes two times a day, to kind of just

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.970
let whatever thought comes to you come to
you, by thinking of one word, not pushing

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:16.069
thoughts out, but just letting it come to
you, that's been shown to reduce blood pressure,

00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:22.640
shown to reduce sugar levels and increase
energy levels. This is the study that looks

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:31.249
at behavior therapy and risk for heart disease
and I'll just circle the conclusion. A cognitive

00:41:31.249 --> 00:41:35.049
behavioral therapy approach reduces the risk
of recurrent heart disease in people who have

00:41:35.049 --> 00:41:39.319
previous heart attacks. And what did they
incorporate? They incorporated group therapy

00:41:39.319 --> 00:41:43.460
to discuss common stressors. So if you have
something that stresses you out, find a group

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:48.619
of people, your friends most likely, who have
those same stresses, very easy to talk about

00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:53.130
it. If you build social networks to handle
your chronic stress, you're much more likely

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:59.130
to be able to deal with that stress. Improving
your interpersonal relationships by being

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:05.359
direct and honest instead of kind of holding
on to that irritation and anger, just tell

00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:08.690
somebody, "You know, I really, I really didn't
like when you did that." It's much better

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:14.170
for you and probably better for your relationship
as well. And then incorporating relaxation

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:18.700
techniques. Yoga, Transcendental Meditation,
Tai Chi, anything you want. The idea is not

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:25.381
one better than the other. The idea is something
to reduce the effects of chronic stress. Behavior

00:42:25.381 --> 00:42:31.940
modification is well studied. That is a situation
where you sit in a room, a dark room, let's

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.130
say you [inaudible] something that really
stresses you out, let's say giving talks stresses

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:41.750
you out. Sit in a dark room, you allow yourself
to kind of relax your mind, you focus on thinking

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:46.960
about a presentation you might have to give
and then try to manage your response to that

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:54.690
stress in your home environment, not actually
giving the talk. Biofeedback is another way

00:42:54.690 --> 00:43:02.380
to deal with this. Biofeedback is a way where
you have continuous kind of either visual

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.410
or auditory cues that kind of effect, that
kind of tell you how you respond to certain

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.569
stress. So let's say you're in that same situation,
you're thinking about a presentation you have

00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:15.700
to give. You put a little monitor on your
finger to monitor your heart rate. You're

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.670
thinking about it and you're trying to kind
of control your response and you're getting

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:23.200
a feedback based on the beeping of the heart
rate monitor. Is it going up? Ok, I have to

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.599
kind of control that. It's coming back down,
I'm handling it better. Biofeedback is a way

00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:36.420
to incorporate behavioral modification.
So, take home points before we get to questions:

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:42.150
Heart disease is common in women, is often
misdiagnosed and can be fatal. Stress is a

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.420
major factor in the development of heart disease,
especially in women, due to their multiple

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.609
roles in and outside the family. And Type
A personalities are more likely to have stress-related

00:43:51.609 --> 00:43:57.809
cardiovascular events as are people who have
anger issues and people who are depressed.

00:43:57.809 --> 00:44:02.510
So simple steps to healthier living. Again,
multifaceted approach. Mediterranean diet,

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:12.530
the best diet for long-term health. If you
don't like to eat fish or you're a vegetarian,

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.530
make sure you take fish or flaxseed oil on
a regular basis, provides Omega 3 fatty acids

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:19.430
you don't get elsewhere. Of short-term diets,
slow carb, low carb diets may be the most

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.390
helpful in achieving desired weight loss,
that's based on that one study, but long term

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:28.950
you have to make sure to get enough fiber.
Regular physical activity is associated with

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.680
improved survival, so incorporate it into
your daily activities, the most important

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:38.650
thing to do. Hypertension, diabetes really
increases your risk for any cardiovascular

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:43.660
event. Maintain an ideal body mass index.
Body mass index calculators are available

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.660
online. Just Google BMI calculator, a million
of them pop up, there are specific ones for

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:53.910
women. And keep a food diary. The whole salt
issue I didn't get to, it's very controversial

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.920
whether eating a lot of salt increases your
risk for having high blood pressure. Recent

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.119
studies suggest it may not be the case. To
increase your energy levels, I didn't get

00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:08.180
to this either, spend 15 minutes in the sun.
Most people have Vitamin D deficiency who

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.499
live in New York, not in California, but in
New York, especially over the winter, that

00:45:12.499 --> 00:45:17.430
leads to increased cardiovascular events and
general fatigue. So if you can't be in the

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:23.930
sun take Vitamin D, but I'd say go sit in
the sun 15 minutes. Eat lots of garlic. If

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:28.269
you don't like garlic, and you have high cholesterol,
take a garlic supplement. Garlique is a brand

00:45:28.269 --> 00:45:33.739
of supplement, tastes like nothing, I've tried
it. Take a multivitamin, for all the women

00:45:33.739 --> 00:45:38.039
in this room, multivitamin, folic acid and
selenium every day. Each one has been shown

00:45:38.039 --> 00:45:44.259
to reduce cardiovascular events in women.
Moderate alcohol, smoking cessation, important,

00:45:44.259 --> 00:45:49.150
I've discussed why. And then stress reduction
through multifaceted approach is the best

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:55.749
way to reduce heart risk and improve one's
sense of happiness. I was gonna play this.

00:45:55.749 --> 00:45:59.280
I can't play it. It's the 'Serenity Now' montage
from Seinfeld, which I thought it was really

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280
funny.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280
[laughter]

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.369
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: And just a quick note,
national Go Red for Women Day, February 3,

00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:13.170
2012. Very important. I am a speaker for Go
Red for Women. There are guidelines coming

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:18.631
out, reiterated guidelines for evidence-based
practice for care of women with risk for heart

00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:24.790
disease and who have heart disease. This is
very important to everyone in this room. I

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:29.720
want to thank Kristy for all her help, Eileen,
all your help, and to the two women in my

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.720
life.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720
&gt;&gt;audience: aahhhh

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:37.859
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Thank you very much. Questions?
Comments? Feel free to e-mail me. You can

00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:45.769
call my direct line at work or my cell. I'll
open up to questions.

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.519
[applause]

00:46:47.519 --> 00:46:57.250
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yes, in the back.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:07.539
&gt;&gt;female #21: So I think that [inaudible]
and you know I think [inaudible] a lot of

00:47:07.539 --> 00:47:12.529
us definitely [inaudible] do exercise and
eat right and we have [inaudible] to do that

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.839
and exercise options, but stress is kind of
unavoidable in certain pieces. So I don't

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:18.289
know who can actually avoid this, but though
if you are kind of doing the right things

00:47:18.289 --> 00:47:29.230
[inaudible] list is in terms of health and
exercise, but yet you know emotionally stress

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.029
just keeps coming in. And we're doing relaxation
things as well, I mean how much do you think

00:47:32.029 --> 00:47:42.490
[inaudible] you know, factor in against each
other? You are a healthy person, but [inaudible]

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.859
you've got a great BMI, you've got low cholesterol,
low blood pressure, but yet you're stressed

00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:47.859
a lot [inaudible].

00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:51.040
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah. The question is if
you're doing all the right things with diet

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.500
and exercise and you're, you're an optimal
BMI, but you still feel stress and you're

00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:02.289
trying to do things to reduce your stress,
what do you do? And the answer is that the

00:48:02.289 --> 00:48:07.710
more things you do in a multifaceted approach
to reduce your stress, the better off you

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:12.890
are. Now it's hard to quantify, there aren't
really many studies that quantify well if

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.109
you do Tai Chi you're gonna get a 20 percent
reduction in your cardiovascular events, but

00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:21.960
if you do Transcendental Meditation you get
a 25 percent, etc., etc. So, you're better

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.900
off saying, ok, I'm doing the right things
diet wise. Exercise helps me with my stress.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:34.269
I need to do x, y and z to deal with my stress
at work, or my stress at home. And again,

00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:39.131
those are multifactoral approaches. If you
have stress at home, for example, there are

00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:41.680
unresolved issues with you and your significant
other, direct, open communication are important

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:48.529
to say what it is. I, you know I think there
aren't a lot of studies to prove that, it's

00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:53.329
very hard to study that. It's very difficult
to study, but in the psychology literature,

00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:58.509
that has shown at least anecdotally to improve
interpersonal relationships. If you have stress

00:48:58.509 --> 00:49:04.049
at work, one of the nice things about Google
is that, at least my impression of Google

00:49:04.049 --> 00:49:07.940
is that, you might have 20 minutes during
the day to kind of.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.029
&gt;&gt;female #22: Have a massage.

00:49:09.029 --> 00:49:13.069
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: There you go. Have a massage.
Meditate while you're having a massage, right?

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:20.349
Go for a walk. Lots of different things you
can do. Right? So I think incorporating as

00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:23.910
many of those as possible into your daily
routine, will make you, not only will it make

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.119
you less stressful, it will make you happier.
Sorry.

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:26.119
&gt;&gt;female #23: Just to piggyback on that, do
you recommend, if you still feel very stressed

00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:27.119
and you're taking all of these, doing all
of these things that you mentioned, to actually

00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:40.579
see a cardiologist just to sort of [inaudible]
heart disease?

00:49:40.579 --> 00:49:49.230
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Well, the question is if
you still feel stressed, should you see a

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.999
cardiologist to rule out heart disease? I
think honestly, if you're doing all the things

00:49:53.999 --> 00:49:58.130
that you need to do and you still feel stressed,
I think you have to take a kind of a hard

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:02.910
look at what your stressors are and if they're
at all modifiable. If they're not modifiable

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:07.779
and you're doing everything you can reasonably
to reduce your stress, yet you can't reduce

00:50:07.779 --> 00:50:12.609
your stress, then it's probably not a cardiologist
you need to talk to, you probably need to

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:16.079
talk to your general physician about how to
deal with stress and you know there are many

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:20.369
different ways to deal with stress. If you
cannot reduce the stressor, then and you cannot

00:50:20.369 --> 00:50:25.930
find other alternatives to dealing with stress,
then you know, I don't like to recommend pharmacologic

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:29.500
therapy, since I'm not an expert in that area,
but there are pharmacologic options to reduce

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.280
stress. Ah, yes.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.260
&gt;&gt;female #24: Have there been any studies
on caffeine and heart disease?

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.690
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Caffeine and heart disease
studies. Yes. Many studies on caffeine and

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:44.329
heart disease. Caffeine does not necessarily
promote coronary artery disease, but caffeine

00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:52.180
in large amounts does cause skipped beats,
extra beats and the feeling of palpitations

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:57.470
and can lead to arrhythmias, unstable heart
rhythms or stable heart rhythms from the small

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:02.549
chambers of the heart. So, drinking three
of these is not really very good for you.

00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:06.599
&gt;&gt;female #25: What is too much caffeine?

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:12.301
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: [sigh] That's a, that's
a very difficult question to answer. What

00:51:12.301 --> 00:51:19.109
is too much caffeine? Too much caffeine is
different for each person. And there aren't

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:25.940
any pre-specified numbers for caffeine like
there are for sodium, like there are for sugars.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:31.759
But if you feel the effects of caffeine, which
most people can tell they feel, or more tellingly,

00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:35.599
if you don't have caffeine and you have effects,
then you're taking too much caffeine. What

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:39.559
I used to tell my patients when they, when
they had that is to cut their caffeine intake

00:51:39.559 --> 00:51:43.690
by one drink a day for the first month, sorry
by one drink a week for the first month. So

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:49.079
if you're drinking, like if I, this is like
I don't know nine cups of whatever tea, like

00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:53.069
two of these. So I would want to cut it to
eight the first week, seven, six and then

00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:56.660
five and then sit there. [inaudible] get a
50 percent reduction in you caffeine generally

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.140
makes you feel better. Yes?

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:04.690
&gt;&gt;female #26: So, I really liked your slides
and I'd love to [inaudible] obviously this

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:10.779
is your, this is your patented information
or whatever you call it [inaudible]

00:52:10.779 --> 00:52:15.869
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: No, I'll, I'll make it
available. I'll leave the PowerPoint for you

00:52:15.869 --> 00:52:16.869
guys. I can .pdf it or I can just leave it
like this. I don't really have any problem

00:52:16.869 --> 00:52:17.869
sharing it. Yes?

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:18.869
&gt;&gt;female #27: I heard about lipoprotein little
a for the first time when Eileen, [inaudible]

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:19.869
a lot of doctors don't test for and when I
spoke to Dr. [inaudible] he was like, you

00:52:19.869 --> 00:52:21.859
know, this is one of the big risk factors
for cardiovascular disease and you don't hear

00:52:21.859 --> 00:52:48.960
a lot of people talking about it. And when
I asked some of the other doctors, they're

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.089
like, well, there's nothing you can really
do about it. So just curious.

00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:57.869
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, there are a lot of
those. So the question is what about lipoprotein

00:52:57.869 --> 00:53:10.650
little a? And there are a whole host of other
kind of newer emerging risk factors for heart

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.690
disease that are pharmacologic testing, etc.
There's lipoprotein little a, there's homocysteine,

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:18.080
[inaudible] These are all there and they're
all available. The problem with most of them

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:24.509
is we don't know whether modification of that
number, of that factor, leads to long-term

00:53:24.509 --> 00:53:29.369
outcome improvement. So it's one thing to
say, I have elevated lipoprotein little a.

00:53:29.369 --> 00:53:33.469
The best example is homocysteine. People who
have high homocysteine levels are at increased

00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:38.670
risk for cardiovascular disease. But, and
surprisingly, lowering homocysteine levels

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:43.759
to normal with folic acid, does not reduce
your cardiovascular events. Alright? So on

00:53:43.759 --> 00:53:48.989
one hand there's a link, on the other hand
there's not necessarily causality. Alright?

00:53:48.989 --> 00:53:51.969
Reducing it doesn't change your events. So
that's where we are with lipoprotein little

00:53:51.969 --> 00:53:57.489
a. It can be reduced by a medicine called,
or a B vitamin called niacin. Alright? So

00:53:57.489 --> 00:54:02.559
you can take over-the-counter niacin, which
generally causes you to get very flushed,

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:06.599
but you can take it. You can take it as your
B complex vitamin to reduce your lipoprotein

00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:12.859
little a. But we don't know that reducing
LP little a has dramatic effects on cardiovascular

00:54:12.859 --> 00:54:16.640
events, so that link is not there yet and
that's true with a lot of these newer markers.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:23.539
So yes, it's a risk factor, no I wouldn't
go crazy over it if your, the rest of your

00:54:23.539 --> 00:54:29.410
risk profile is low.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:34.720
&gt;&gt;female #28: But if our parents had like
a history of it, should they be telling their

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.720
doctors, that they should get this tested
as well?

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.720
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, it's a good question.
If they have a history of, history of elevated

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:37.720
LP little a?

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.079
&gt;&gt;female #28: Or a history of cardiovascular
disease.

00:54:40.079 --> 00:54:46.309
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Um, yes and no, it depends
on, it depends on what kind of person you

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:49.940
are. If you're the kind of person who will
obsess over, over the result and kind of worry

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:53.109
about not, and have stress from the result
of not being able to do anything about it,

00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:56.599
no don't check it. But if you're not that
kind of person and you want a kind of overall

00:54:56.599 --> 00:55:00.610
global risk assessment and you'll modify what
you can modify, understanding that you can

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:05.700
never modify your risk to zero, then yes,
you can check it and understand that it's

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:10.799
part of a group, it's not taken by itself,
it's taken as a, as part of a group of risk

00:55:10.799 --> 00:55:11.980
modification. Yes.

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:18.490
&gt;&gt;female #29: [inaudible] your thoughts are
on recent [inaudible] sleep [inaudible]

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:23.279
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: I am, I will, as my wife
will tell you. The question is about sleep.

00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:28.660
As my wife will tell you, I'm a little sleep
obsessed. I have been studying sleep and how

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.660
to get better sleep and I actually sleep very
well. The impact of sleep on cardiovascular

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.339
disease is very well known, especially if
you don't get regular sleep, if you don't

00:55:33.339 --> 00:55:43.109
get to REM sleep, if you don't get at least
four hours of sleep a night, and if you, if

00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:48.190
you have sleep apnea. All those things increase
your risk for cardiovascular events. So, sleep's

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:55.499
very important. I mean, the thing I, the things
you read about sleep is don't bring any electronic

00:55:55.499 --> 00:56:01.140
gadgets into the bedroom. If you're gonna
sleep, sleep. Make the bedroom a place you

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:07.359
know for sleep. Don't put a TV in the bedroom.
You know, don't do any of that stuff because

00:56:07.359 --> 00:56:11.170
you going to the bed, make it relatively a
cool place, a dark place. You're going there

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:17.130
to sleep, so sleep. And don't be distracted
by other things. Put your phone somewhere

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.130
else.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.510
&gt;&gt;female #30: Yeah, phones, digital devices,
blinking devices, your Blackberry.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.320
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, that can't be there.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.320
&gt;&gt;female #30: Don't use your computer a few
hours before bed so you can change your brain

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.320
waves back to kind of human neutral.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.910
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Right. Don't do it while
you're in bed trying to go to sleep. You won't

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.910
sleep.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.549
&gt;&gt;female r #31: [inaudible] have periods of
time where they don't sleep well, right, and

00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:32.819
then you go back to old sleep habits, that
has no long-term you know effect on you or

00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:39.369
is it once you sleep again then you're good?

00:56:39.369 --> 00:56:48.599
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: No, no. Usually if you
don't sleep well it's usually from some sort

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:53.209
of outside stressor. And the key is to resolve
the outside stressor and then your sleep patterns

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:56.914
were usually were turned back to what they
were. And that doesn't have long-term effects.

00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:59.029
Other questions.
[cell phone rings]

00:56:59.029 --> 00:57:06.180
&gt;&gt;female #32: I think we are really [inaudible]
about your [inaudible] Thank you for coming

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:20.109
in and talking to us. It's common sense and
I think what a lot of us I mean they have

00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:27.170
the conditions here at Google to practice
wellness all the time. This place is set up

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:31.920
for healthy living, healthy eating. Yes, it's
a stressful work environment in general, but

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.509
all the conditions for staying healthy are
reinforced through our wellness programs,

00:57:34.509 --> 00:57:37.819
the kinds of foods that are served, there's
the best fish probably in New York [inaudible]

00:57:37.819 --> 00:57:48.940
and so we're into the question of mindfulness
and respect for your body and taking responsibility

00:57:48.940 --> 00:58:09.430
for your wellness instead of waiting to treat
illness. So thank you Dr. Sharma for all of

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:15.709
your intelligent insight and for putting up
with like an hour and a half of our questions.

00:58:15.709 --> 00:58:17.239
We really appreciate it.

00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:18.239
[applause]

00:58:18.239 --> 00:58:19.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Thank you very much.

00:58:19.299 --> 00:58:20.299
&gt;&gt;female #33: I still like butter on my popcorn.

00:58:20.299 --> 00:58:21.299
[laughter]

00:58:21.299 --> 00:58:22.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: And that's ok.

00:58:22.299 --> 00:58:23.299
&gt;&gt;female #34: [inaudible] a little butter
and a lot of truffle salt.

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:24.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Sounds good.

00:58:24.299 --> 00:58:25.299
&gt;&gt;female #35: [inaudible] have gone to [inaudible]
questions [inaudible] cardiovascular events

00:58:25.299 --> 00:58:26.299
[inaudible]

00:58:26.299 --> 00:58:27.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yes.
[sounds of video chat happening]

00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:28.299
[computer powering down]
&gt;&gt;female #35: All of that stuff is encompassed,

00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:29.299
not just coronary artery disease.

00:58:29.299 --> 00:58:30.299
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Right. Cardiovascular events,
yes, exactly right, heart disease, atrial

00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:35.559
fibrillation, your, oh, a stroke, yeah, I
missed the big one, but I missed the big one.

00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:40.309
&gt;&gt;female #36: And you mentioned, you mentioned
that there's some controversy around salt.

00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:46.000
[inaudible] My sister's [inaudible] she's
now managing my mother and telling my mother

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.250
that she absolutely has to stay away from
[inaudible]

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:56.650
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: If you have heart failure,
salt is a must to stay away from. Incorporating

00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:01.119
as many of those as possible into your daily
routine, will make you, not only will it make

00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:02.119
you less stressful, it will make you happier.
Sorry.

00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:03.119
&gt;&gt;female #23: Just to piggyback on that, do
you recommend, if you still feel very stressed

00:59:03.119 --> 00:59:04.119
and you're taking all of these, doing all
of these things that you mentioned, to actually

00:59:04.119 --> 00:59:15.759
see a cardiologist just to sort of [inaudible]
heart disease?

00:59:15.759 --> 00:59:25.539
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Well, the question is if
you still feel stressed, should you see a

00:59:25.539 --> 00:59:30.309
cardiologist to rule out heart disease? I
think honestly, if you're doing all the things

00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:34.430
that you need to do and you still feel stressed,
I think you have to take a kind of a hard

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:39.209
look at what your stressors are and if they're
at all modifiable. If they're not modifiable

00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:44.089
and you're doing everything you can reasonably
to reduce your stress, yet you can't reduce

00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:48.989
your stress, then it's probably not a cardiologist
you need to talk to, you probably need to

00:59:48.989 --> 00:59:52.390
talk to your general physician about how to
deal with stress and you know there are many

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:56.680
different ways to deal with stress. If you
cannot reduce the stressor, then and you cannot

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:02.230
find other alternatives to dealing with stress,
then you know, I don't like to recommend pharmacologic

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:05.809
therapy, since I'm not an expert in that area,
but there are pharmacologic options to reduce

01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:07.589
stress. Ah, yes.

01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:12.570
&gt;&gt;female #24: Have there been any studies
on caffeine and heart disease?

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:14.980
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Caffeine and heart disease
studies. Yes. Many studies on caffeine and

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:20.630
heart disease. Caffeine does not necessarily
promote coronary artery disease, but caffeine

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:28.499
in large amounts does cause skipped beats,
extra beats and the feeling of palpitations

01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:33.779
and can lead to arrhythmias, unstable heart
rhythms or stable heart rhythms from the small

01:00:33.779 --> 01:00:38.859
chambers of the heart. So, drinking three
of these is not really very good for you.

01:00:38.859 --> 01:00:42.869
&gt;&gt;female #25: What is too much caffeine?

01:00:42.869 --> 01:00:48.610
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: [sigh] That's a, that's
a very difficult question to answer. What

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:55.420
is too much caffeine? Too much caffeine is
different for each person. And there aren't

01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:02.239
any pre-specified numbers for caffeine like
there are for sodium, like there are for sugars.

01:01:02.239 --> 01:01:08.069
But if you feel the effects of caffeine, which
most people can tell they feel, or more tellingly,

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:11.900
if you don't have caffeine and you have effects,
then you're taking too much caffeine. What

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.869
I used to tell my patients when they, when
they had that is to cut their caffeine intake

01:01:15.869 --> 01:01:20.010
by one drink a day for the first month, sorry
by one drink a week for the first month. So

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:25.390
if you're drinking, like if I, this is like
I don't know nine cups of whatever tea, like

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:29.309
two of these. So I would want to cut it to
eight the first week, seven, six and then

01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:32.960
five and then sit there. [inaudible] get a
50 percent reduction in you caffeine generally

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.450
makes you feel better. Yes?

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:40.999
&gt;&gt;female #26: So, I really liked your slides
and I'd love to [inaudible] obviously this

01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:47.089
is your, this is your patented information
or whatever you call it [inaudible]

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:53.819
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: No, I'll, I'll make it
available. I'll leave the PowerPoint for you

01:01:53.819 --> 01:01:54.819
guys. I can pdf it or I can just leave it
like this. I don't really have any problem

01:01:54.819 --> 01:01:55.819
sharing it. Yes?

01:01:55.819 --> 01:01:56.819
&gt;&gt;female #27: I heard about lipoprotein little
a for the first time when Eileen, [inaudible]

01:01:56.819 --> 01:02:14.039
a lot of doctors don't test for and when I
spoke to Dr. [inaudible] he was like, you

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:26.549
know, this is one of the big risk factors
for cardiovascular disease and you don't hear

01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:27.779
a lot of people talking about it. And when
I asked some of the other doctors, they're

01:02:27.779 --> 01:02:28.779
like, well, there's nothing you can really
do about it. So just curious.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:34.180
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, there are a lot of
those. So the question is what about lipoprotein

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:40.710
little a? And there are a whole host of other
kind of newer emerging risk factors for heart

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:47.940
disease that are pharmacologic testing, etc.
There's lipoprotein little a, there's homocysteine,

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:55.100
[inaudible] These are all there and they're
all available. The problem with most of them

01:02:55.100 --> 01:03:00.539
is we don't know whether modification of that
number, of that factor, leads to long-term

01:03:00.539 --> 01:03:05.670
outcome improvement. So it's one thing to
say, I have elevated lipoprotein little a.

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:09.779
The best example is homocysteine. People who
have high homocysteine levels are at increased

01:03:09.779 --> 01:03:14.979
risk for cardiovascular disease. But, and
surprisingly, lowering homocysteine levels

01:03:14.979 --> 01:03:20.059
to normal with folic acid, does not reduce
your cardiovascular events. Alright? So on

01:03:20.059 --> 01:03:25.299
one hand there's a link, on the other hand
there's not necessarily causality. Alright?

01:03:25.299 --> 01:03:28.279
Reducing it doesn't change your events. So
that's where we are with lipoprotein little

01:03:28.279 --> 01:03:33.799
a. It can be reduced by a medicine called,
or a B vitamin called niacin. Alright? So

01:03:33.799 --> 01:03:38.859
you can take over-the-counter niacin, which
generally causes you to get very flushed,

01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:42.910
but you can take it. You can take it as your

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:49.170
little a. But we don't know that reducing
LP little a has dramatic effects on cardiovascular

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:52.950
events, so that link is not there yet and
that's true with a lot of these newer markers.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:59.289
So yes, it's a risk factor, no I wouldn't
go crazy over it if your, the rest of your

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:02.900
risk profile is low.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:11.009
&gt;&gt;female #28: But if our parents had like
a history of it, should they be telling their

01:04:11.009 --> 01:04:12.009
doctors, that they should get this tested
as well?

01:04:12.009 --> 01:04:13.009
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, it's a good question.
If they have a history of, history of elevated

01:04:13.009 --> 01:04:14.009
LP little a?

01:04:14.009 --> 01:04:16.219
&gt;&gt;female #28: Or a history of cardiovascular
disease.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:22.309
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Um, yes and no, it depends
on, it depends on what kind of person you

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:25.650
are. [chuckles] If you're the kind of person
who will obsess over, over the result and

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:29.200
kind of worry about not, and have stress from
the result of not being able to do anything

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.369
about it, no don't check it. But if you're
not that kind of person and you want a kind

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:36.259
of overall global risk assessment and you'll
modify what you can modify, understanding

01:04:36.259 --> 01:04:41.699
that you can never modify your risk to zero,
then yes, you can check it and understand

01:04:41.699 --> 01:04:46.380
that it's part of a group, it's not taken
by itself, it's taken as a, as part of a group

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.240
of risk modification. Yes.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:54.790
&gt;&gt;female #29: [inaudible] your thoughts are
on recent [inaudible] sleep [inaudible]

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:59.589
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: I am, I will, as my wife
will tell you. The question is about sleep.

01:04:59.589 --> 01:05:04.959
As my wife will tell you, I'm a little sleep
obsessed. I have been studying sleep and how

01:05:04.959 --> 01:05:05.959
to get better sleep and I actually sleep very
well. The impact of sleep on cardiovascular

01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:09.769
disease is very well known, especially if
you don't get regular sleep, if you don't

01:05:09.769 --> 01:05:19.420
get to REM sleep, if you don't get at least
four hours of sleep a night, and if you, if

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.489
you have sleep apnea. All those things increase
your risk for cardiovascular events. So, sleep's

01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:31.809
very important. I mean, the thing I, the things
you read about sleep is don't bring any electronic

01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:37.440
gadgets into the bedroom. If you're gonna
sleep, sleep. Make the bedroom a place you

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.670
know for sleep. Don't put a TV in the bedroom.
You know, don't do any of that stuff because

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:47.480
you going to the bed, make it relatively a
cool place, a dark place. You're going there

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:53.440
to sleep, so sleep. And don't be distracted
by other things. Put your phone somewhere

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440
else.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440
&gt;&gt;female #30: Yeah, phones, digital devices,
blinking devices, your Blackberry.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Yeah, that can't be there.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.949
&gt;&gt;female #30: Don't use your computer a few
hours before bed so you can change your brain

01:05:58.949 --> 01:06:00.339
waves back to kind of human neutral.

01:06:00.339 --> 01:06:04.349
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: Right. Don't do it while
you're in bed trying to go to sleep. You won't

01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:05.349
sleep.

01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:07.859
&gt;&gt;female #31: [inaudible] have periods of
time where they don't sleep well, right, and

01:06:07.859 --> 01:06:09.130
then you go back to old sleep habits, that
has no long-term you know effect on you or

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:15.529
is it once you sleep again then you're good?

01:06:15.529 --> 01:06:24.910
&gt;&gt;Dr. Atul Sharma: No, no. Usually if you
don't sleep well it's usually from some sort

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:29.519
of outside stressor. And the key is to resolve
the outside stressor and then your sleep patterns

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:34.500
were usually were turned back to what they
were. And that doesn't have long-term effects.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.200
Other questions.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:51.199

salt is a must to stay away from.
