00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.306
Assume this application is strongly compute bound,

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.143
whereas computation is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:13.116
If we run the same application on a different GPU with twice the memory bandwidth,

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:17.393
which curve best represents the performance that you might see?
