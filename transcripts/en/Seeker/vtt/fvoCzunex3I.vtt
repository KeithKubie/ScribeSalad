00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.810
Did you know there’s a fire in Australia
that’s been burning for thousands of years?

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:12.880
It sounds like a horror film but it's real.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.619
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.030
If you’ve ever played Silent Hill you know
how eerie that town is.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.230
A few streets are all the remains from a once
booming town.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
No people.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.230
Just emptiness.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.230
And toxic smoke.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.060
What if I told you that town is REAL.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.380
Well in way.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.980
The town Centralia Pennsylvania once boasted
a booming population of over 1200 people.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.010
Now empty lots and cracked pavement sit on
top of a giant burning pit of fire.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.010
Seriously.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.680
A fire has been burning underground since
May of 1962.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.490
It all started when a bit of garbage in a
nearby landfill started smoldering.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.100
Since the landfill was built on top of an
old coal mine, it was only a matter of time

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.820
before the fire reached the coal.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.470
Some 50 odd years later and numerous attempts
to put it out, the fire now stretches nearly

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.829
400 acres.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.360
It smolders just below the surface, occasionally
releasing toxic gases into the air, such as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.739
carbon monoxide.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.220
In fact it’s those gases that caused people
to leave the town.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.790
Some residents started passing out in their
basements and soon town officials couldn’t

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.220
deny it anymore, the area wasn’t safe.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.520
So most residents left and the town is declared
“condemned”.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.510
Now tourists and fans of Silent Hill flock
to the town to check out the sights.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.510
Or smells.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.170
Our AP Julia was one of those tourists back
in 2009.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.409
She described it as “like hell on earth”.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.560
While Centralia certainly is the most famous,
it’s not the largest or the oldest underground

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
fire.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.450
Coal fires can occur naturally too, from lightning
strikes or even from spontaneous combustion.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.450
Yeah.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.800
Coal can spontaneously burn, it’s just it’s
natural reaction when it interacts with oxygen.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.590
Even at temperatures as low as 104 degrees.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.560
Whatever sets the the spark, it doesn’t
take long for a seam to catch fire.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.630
And even though it might be underground, oxygen
rich air reaches the coal in the small spaces

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.470
between rocks and soil fanning the flames.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.009
And then burns for centuries.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.220
Here in the states, the oldest coal fire lies
outside of the smalltown of Glenwood Springs

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.220
Colorado.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.840
The South Cañon Number 1 Coal Mine fire has
been burning since 1910 maybe even since 1899.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.880
But it’s by no means a novelty in the area.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.850
The surrounding mountains are littered with
underground coal fires.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.410
It’s so common place, there’s a park called
“Burning Mountain” and nearby towns even

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.599
host a “burning mountain festival”.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.060
But even those aren’t the most dangerous.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.300
That honor goes to an underground fire outside
of St. Louis, Missouri.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.320
Well it’s more of smolder.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.240
This heat doesn’t have any actual flames
yet.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.700
According to a St. Louis Country report, it’s
called a “sub-surface smoldering event”.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.950
It only started in 2010, but already it’s
putting thousands of residents at risk.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.260
Only 1200 feet away lies an old nuclear waste
site!

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.440
So if the smolder reaches the waste, well
it’s not good.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.879
Most residents were unaware such a danger
lurked in their neighborhood till a little

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.060
pamphlet showed up at their door like “hey
guys… here’s the emergency evacuation

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.819
plan just in case this really bad thing happened
or as they call it a “"catastrophic event".

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.319
Basically it won’t go “boom” but it
could create and release large amounts of

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.050
radioactive fallout into nearby areas.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.690
But officials claim the landfill “is safe
and intensively monitored."

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.770
The only thing at risk from the fire is your
nose.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.880
Apparently it smells horrible.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.090
Those are just a few of the fires in the US,
there’s dozens of fires in India and China.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.250
It’s a surprisingly common problem.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.240
A fire burning throughout a coal seam in China
spreads for thousands of miles.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.900
Or a fire in Jharia, India is reportedly 100
years old.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.740
It started in 1916 and rages to this day.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.290
But even that might not be the oldest one.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.330
In Germany Brennender Berg, or burning mountain
caught fire in 1688.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.379
The oldest one might be in Australia also
called…

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.879
Burning Mountain… okay wow these names are
super original… and some estimates say this

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.239
fire hasn’t gone out in 5,500 years!

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.019
There’s literally hundreds of thousands
of these coal seam fires burning all over

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.220
the world right this very minute.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.100
But if you’re wondering yeah, there is an
environmental cost.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.130
All these fires send millions of tons of CO2,
a greenhouse gas, pouring into our atmosphere.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.190
But the problem with all these fires… well
there’s a reason many have been burning

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.190
for so long.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.700
They’re notoriously hard to put out.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.729
Some experts think the only solution is a
backhoe, digging them out.

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.039
But others worry exposing the fires to air
might make them worse.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.919
In Centralia they spent over 5 million dollars
trying to find a solution of smothering it

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.939
with concrete and soil.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.319
So sometimes it’s just cheaper and easier
to let it burn.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.889
According to experts, Centralia could burn
for another 250 years.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.580

So there’s loads of fires underground, but
there's also water down there… a lot of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.550
it.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.520
Dr. Carin Bondar explains in this video how
researchers discovered a whole ocean of water

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:21.939
near the core of 
the earth!
