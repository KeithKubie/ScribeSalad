00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.430
ALAN SEALES: "Bandstand," the
new musical that explodes with

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.470
the most high-octane,
heart-stopping,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.480
and best dancing onstage today--

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.980
which just won the Tony for
best choreography, by the way--

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.380
The show-- yes-- the
show is set in 1945

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.750
as America's soldiers come
home to ticker-tape parades

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.000
and overjoyed families.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.720
Private First Class
Donny Novitski,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.540
singer and songwriter,
returns to rebuild his life

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.330
with only the shirt on his
back and a dream in his heart.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.160
So we're going to get a
commercial rolling for you guys

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.695
to get it started, and then go
straight into the performance.

ANNOUNCER: Direct
off "Hamilton,"

Broadway's hottest
director-choreographer creates

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.110
the best dance on Broadway in
the Tony-nominated musical,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.530
"Bandstand," a dazzling,
stand-up-and-cheer new musical

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.200
but should not be missed.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.730
"Bandstand," on Broadway.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.574
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:51.490
COREY COTT: Hey, guys.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.880
Hey, I'm Corey Cott,
play Donny Novitski.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.337
Just so you know, we're all--

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:58.420
our cast is currently
questioning our life choices

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.320
by being in Google.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.420
This is so cool for us, and are
super jealous of all of you.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.310
So yes, so the show takes
place right after World War II.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.690
My character comes back,
is very down on his luck,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.210
struggling to find work.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.640
My character, Donny, is a piano
prodigy-singer-songwriter,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.500
dreams of being the next
Bruno Mars of the early '40s.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.600
But it's really hard
because I've gone to war

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.060
and gone through
a lot of trauma.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.570
And I'm trying to figure out how
to get my life back on track.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.140
So I hear about a national
songwriting competition,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.810
a swing songwriting
competition, that the winner

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.440
will get to be in an MGM musical
with their song featured.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.020
And I get this idea
of assembling a swing

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.900
band with a bunch of vets.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.027
And so this is the
song "Donny Novitski."

00:01:57.027 --> 00:02:02.017
[MUSIC - COREY COTT, "DONNY
 NOVITSKI"]

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:53.610

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.220
Thanks, guys.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.950
And now I'd love to bring up my
lovely co-leading lady, Laura

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.640
Osnes.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.139
Please give a round
for Laura Osnes.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.210
LAURA OSNES: So I play
Julia Trojan in "Bandstand."

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.610
And my character is a war widow.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.980
I lost my husband in
battle in World War II.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.550
And it just so happens that
he, Michael, was best friends

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.100
with Donny Novitski overseas.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.670
And so Donny comes
back and is feeling

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.680
this responsibility
and this charge

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.290
to check in on his buddy's wife.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.210
And he finds out that I
sing in my church choir

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.270
and ropes me into being the
singer of this band of vets

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.630
that he's putting together.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.680
So I reluctantly join this band
and realize that it is actually

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.030
going to be a beautiful healing
thing for my character, as well

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.210
as everybody else's
characters as well.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.080
I write poetry as an outlet.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.300
And Donny is inspired
by that and starts

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.300
setting my poems to music.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.130
And we end up singing
one of the songs

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.457
that they write together
for the competition,

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:06.540
the statewide competition.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.440
And so this is the
song that they sing.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.640
And it's all about Julia's
desire and yearning

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.540
and wondering if love
will ever find her again.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.910

00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:24.060

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.589
I'd love to bring Corey
back on the stage.

00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:28.130
COREY COTT: One more
thing, actually,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.240
just a little
tidbit-- we actually

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.740
all play our own
instruments in the show.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.740
It's about a swing band.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.310
And on that track that Laura
so gloriously just sang,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.900
we're actually all playing
the instruments on that.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.690
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.480
LAURA OSNES: That's true, Corey
plays the piano in the band.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.938
And he practiced three hours
a day for the last nine months

00:10:40.938 --> 00:10:42.860
and rocks it on
stage every night.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.080
And yeah, we have trombone,
saxophone, drummer, trumpet--

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.590
what else?

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.680
COREY COTT: Bass.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.010
LAURA OSNES: And bass!

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.835
And bass.

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:50.810
COREY COTT: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.490
LAURA OSNES: So you'll get to
meet those guys in a little bit

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.770
here.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.978
We're going to do a talkback.

00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:56.090
But this next song
is a duet that we get

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.740
to sing together in act two.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.740
And as you can
probably tell, it's

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.280
a very complicated relationship
that these two have.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.380
The closer they work together
and the more the music

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.390
helps heal them and
bond them together,

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.310
they start to have
feelings for each other.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:18.140
But it's complicated because he
was my husband's best friend.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.110
And there's other
difficult things,

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.620
if you come see the show, to
know the past that they have.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.630
But they're also
the only two people

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.560
that knew her husband so well,
so they bond over that as well.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.470
So it's tricky.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:32.180
It's complicated.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.046
And this next song--

00:11:34.046 --> 00:11:34.545
yeah.

00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:38.120
COREY COTT: Yeah, there's a
moment in the second act where

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.550
we get a little too
close and question

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.580
the feelings that we're
starting to have for each other.

and co-writers Robert Taylor
and Richard Oberacker.

00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:08.420
Did I say that correct?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:08.540

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.230

Get your water.

00:15:10.636 --> 00:15:12.260
I always enjoy when
the people on stage

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.030
match the people
in the pictures.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.960
That's very--
that's a lot of fun.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.230
I want to touch on something
that, Corey, you and Laura just

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.140
said in the setup
of that third song,

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.504
that you played piano for three
hours a day for months, right?

00:15:29.504 --> 00:15:30.420
COREY COTT: Yeah, mhm.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.330
ALAN SEALES: So what came
first for all of you?

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.380
Was it learning the
instruments for the show,

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.088
or did the show come
and dictate that you

00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:39.470
had to learn instruments?

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.530
COREY COTT: That's
a good question.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.180
ALAN SEALES: Or for your
life, not the show, yeah.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.800
You want to start down there?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.720
GEOFF PACKARD: Yeah.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.470
I'm Geoff Packard.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.959
I play Wayne Wright in the show,
who is a marine coming back

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:49.500
from the war.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.050
But he also plays the trombone.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.530
I am an actor
first and foremost,

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.260
but I was in the high
school marching band--

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.630
--as a euphonium player.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.470
Any low-brass, kick-ass
fans out there?

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.997
GEOFF PACKARD: No?

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:06.080
JOE CARROLL: Lots of then.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.180
GEOFF PACKARD: But I went to
school for musical theater,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.490
and they beat it into our
heads that you put everything

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.410
that you can possibly
do on your resume.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.820
So I put that I--

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.070
and I played the trombone
in jazz band in high school,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.880
so it was my second instrument
in high school, 14 years ago.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.280
So I kept it on my resume.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.980
And I picked it back up when
I did a reading of the show.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.910
And they said, we're going
to do a lab now, so just play

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.210
the trombone for us and
we should be good to go.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.454
And I went, oh, god.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.070
So it was like
teaching myself again

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.600
how to speak a language
I barely knew, basically.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.850
Does that answer the question?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.730
I don't even remember
what the question is.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.670
I just love this mic in
being here at Google.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:50.460
ALAN SEALES: No, dude.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.310
Yeah, so you already knew
how to play before you

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.185
joined the show, yes?

00:16:53.185 --> 00:16:56.900
GEOFF PACKARD: Basically,
I knew nothing.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.420
I played in high
school, but anybody

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.780
who plays a brass
instrument knows that if you

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.270
let your embouchure go
or your face muscles

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.440
that you use to blow it--

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.099
it's very tough to
pick that up again.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.660
So I had to reteach myself
over a period of two years

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.063
to get ready to play with
actual musicians in the show.

00:17:19.063 --> 00:17:20.947
JOE CARROLL: I have a
dead mic or something.

00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:21.418
BRANDON ELLIS: Check.

00:17:21.418 --> 00:17:22.876
JOE CARROLL: Can
I borrow your mic?

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:23.710
I'm Joe Carroll.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.450
I play Johnny Simpson, the
drummer in "Bandstand."

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.390
And I was a crappy
rock and roll drummer

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.420
before I started this show--
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:41.230
And I've basically grabbed
hold of the pit drummer,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.570
the guy who plays
in the pit, and

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.300
some other professional
drummers in town

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.140
and tried to get as
many lessons as I could.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.950
But I played drums from a
very young age, and poorly.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.912
And then, sort of
similarly to Geoff,

00:17:55.912 --> 00:17:57.370
picked it up more
seriously when we

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.750
did a reading of "Bandstand"
about three or two

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.010
and a half years ago.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.420
But I went to school for
musical theater as well.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.420
And so I'm an actor first.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.110
But from crappy rock and roll
drumming to intense swing

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.144
drumming, I feel like I'm
figuring it out slowly.

00:18:15.144 --> 00:18:16.810
BRANDON ELLIS: My
name is Brandon Ellis.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.611
I play Davy Zlatic the
attractive, young ingenue

00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:20.110
in the show.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.540
And I'm an actor,
first and foremost.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.890
I started on cello, played
that most of my life.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.670
Picked up bass around when
I was exiting high school,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.960
played that for a while.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.150
And really started taking
it seriously, though,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.690
once we started doing this show.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.330
In fact, much like
your chops, you've

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.940
got to build up calluses to be
able to play an upright bass.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.790
And during our first
final callback,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.960
my fingers cracked open
and bled everywhere.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.710
But I didn't stop.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.190
Booked it.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.170
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:18:59.489 --> 00:19:01.780
GEOFF PACKARD: So we came in
the first day of rehearsal

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.280
and we all had bloody
finger-- we cut our fingers,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.420
we thought that
was the way to go.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.430
LAURA OSNES: I'm lucky
because I get to sing.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.210
I get to be the singer.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.918
And yes, I've been
singing my whole life.

00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:14.890
I dabble in piano, and I learned
eight chords on the ukulele

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.180
that I play in the show.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.720
But these guys have
really worked hard.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.220
COREY COTT: Yeah,
so I didn't know--

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.594
I knew a little
bit on the piano,

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:24.530
but I pretty much had
to learn everything

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.170
in the show and practice a lot.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.500
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.740
COREY COTT: Yeah.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.030
ALAN SEALES: I thought you'd
been playing your whole life.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.920
I mean, everybody
else is amazing.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.619
But you're featured so much,
and I was watching your fingers,

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:33.535
and you're going nuts.

00:19:33.535 --> 00:19:34.260
BRANDON ELLIS: He's crushing it.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.468
COREY COTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:35.468 --> 00:19:41.140
No, it took a lot of sitting at
the piano when I was unemployed

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.860
for a long time and just
annoyed my wife every day

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.991
by playing the same songs over
and over and over and over

00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:48.490
again.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.260
So yeah, when you're unemployed
for a year and a half

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.510
and you have time to just
sit down and play every day,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.480
it's pretty cool.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.710
You can learn cool
stick skills and stuff.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:57.834 --> 00:19:59.500
ALAN SEALES: You say
you were unemployed

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.140
for a year and a half.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.110
So were you trying to
learn piano to get this?

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.440
COREY COTT: To be fair, I
took some lessons as a kid

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440
for four or five years.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.450
So I knew very basic--

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.990
I've always sang, so I
could read music and stuff.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.610
But I did not know how to--

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.250
I could barely do
a C major scale.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.470
Yeah, I could not
do what I do now.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.224
It took a lot of time.

00:20:19.224 --> 00:20:20.890
PATRICK CONNAGHAN:
The two of you guys--

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.285
ALAN SEALES: So both
of you are swings?

00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:23.440
PATRICK CONNAGHAN:
Yeah, correct, yeah.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.920
ANDREW LEGGIERI: Correct.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.670
PATRICK CONNAGHAN: So
we are understudies,

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.450
and we also swing, which means
we cover ensemble tracks.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.940
But we both stand by for
two of the guys in the band.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.490
So I've been a trumpet player
for close to 20 years now.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.150
So I was always trying to book
the understudy role, which I

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.310
did, but on my final callback.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.012
It took nine callbacks over a
year and a half to get here.

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:43.720
COREY COTT: Geez.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.280
PATRICK CONNAGHAN: I'd been
playing trumpet the entire time

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.863
to the point where
I had all the music

00:20:46.863 --> 00:20:48.690
memorized when I came
in for the callbacks.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.857
And on my final audition,
I had my hand on the door,

00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:52.523
and they were like,
what are your skills

00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:53.620
like on the trombone?

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.084
And I was like, I don't
play the trombone,

00:20:57.084 --> 00:20:59.500
but I'm confident in my ability,
and I'm willing to learn.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.880
I think I could
learn the trombone.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.230
And they were like, good answer.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.902
So I got an email
with the offer.

00:21:05.902 --> 00:21:07.360
And I'm scrolling
through, and so I

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.920
have Nick, the trumpet player.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.850
I'm like, great, cool,
exactly what I wanted.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.611
And then I keep going, and you
got Wayne the trombone player,

00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:14.110
too.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.526
And I was like, well, I guess
I need to go buy a trombone.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:17.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.944
So I quit my job.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.860
And I had a month of
unemployment where I just

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.950
locked myself in my apartment,
and I learned the trombone

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.890
from scratch.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.270
So I used the foundation that
I had with brass instruments

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.610
and just transferred
it to low brass.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.820
But yeah, I've also went to
school for musical theater,

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.110
so I've been singing for
a very long time as well.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.680
So it's kind of an amalgamation
of all of the weird things

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680
that I like to do.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.750
So it's a dream job.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.100
It's great.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.600
Andrew.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.141
ANDREW LEGGIERI:
I'm Andrew Leggieri.

00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:44.950
I'm also a swing.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.600
And a similar story to them--

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.420
I was an
instrumentalist younger,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.650
and learned the alto
saxophone, and went to college

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.174
for musical theater, and had
to pick it all back up again.

00:21:58.174 --> 00:21:59.590
And when this came
up, I had never

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.970
touched a tenor saxophone.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.490
I rented one for the audition.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.546
And then after I
got the job, they

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:08.920
were like, oh, we're starting
to add some clarinet stuff.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.630
I'm like, great, I've
never, never played that.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:16.552
So I looked up YouTube videos
and taught myself how to play.

00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:18.010
GEOFF PACKARD:
Sponsored by Google.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.620
GEOFF PACKARD: I will
also-- can I add that--

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.440
so the two guys that
they understudied

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.690
are musicians first.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:33.223
And they are the two musician
members of the Donny Nova Band.

00:22:33.223 --> 00:22:34.875
ROBERT TAYLOR: We
call those ringers.

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:36.083
GEOFF PACKARD: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:36.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.190
And they were both
in the horn section.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.440
So I show up on the first
day, and the guy to my right

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.180
was a trumpet
major at Juilliard,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.780
and the guy to my left was a
composition major at Berkeley,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.510
and I played in the crappy
jazz band in my high school.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.290
But it's really worked out.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.030
And they had not
been on stage-- one

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.700
of them had not
been on stage ever,

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.960
and the other had very
limited experience.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.410
So they did a good job
casting a broad skill

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.140
set so that we were able
to lean on each other.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.800
Some of them leaned on us in
the book scenes or the acting

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.630
portions of the
show, and I certainly

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.720
leaned on them whenever
we were playing musically.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.190
So they did a good
job of mixing it

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.550
so we took care of each other.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.050
LAURA OSNES: Good point.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.970
It worked It worked
for the monkeys,

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.303
it could work for you guys, too.

00:23:18.303 --> 00:23:19.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:20.401
GEOFF PACKARD: How dare you.

00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:21.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.300
ALAN SEALES: Hey, they
had two good seasons.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.309
Hopefully you will
have many more.

00:23:26.309 --> 00:23:28.350
And also, Andrew's going
on for the role of Jimmy

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.342
for the first time tonight,
so break legs, break legs.

00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:34.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.230
Robert Taylor, Richard
Oberbacker, the co-writers--

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.080
where did the two
of you guys come up

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.310
with the idea for this show?

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.726
How long has it
been in the works?

00:23:44.974 --> 00:23:46.640
ROBERT TAYLOR: It's
about four years ago

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.720
we first put pen to paper.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.340
And we had this idea that we
wanted to really pay tribute

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:03.210
to musicals from The Golden Age,
but come at them from a very

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:08.340
contemporary perspective, in
that all of the situations

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.630
that MGM musicals tend to gloss
over in a Hollywood fashion,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.710
we would actually be honest,
the actual circumstances

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.730
of the characters.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.230
RICHARD OBERACKER:
That was really--

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.730
it was almost like
a thesis project,

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.470
where you basically say--

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.110
you look at all these MGM
movie musicals and The Golden

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.310
Age of Hollywood, and they're
building blocks of what we know

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.384
and treasure today.

00:24:31.384 --> 00:24:32.800
I mean, "Hamilton"
is built on all

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.600
this stuff in a lot of ways.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.560
But it was basically like,
well, OK, if on the town,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.280
the three sailors came back
to New York for a day off,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.480
but they really were
sailors, they really

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.460
were coming off the
battlefield, they really

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.810
had been through three years
of arms being ripped off

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.660
and heads being blown
off and ships going out

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.880
from underneath
their feet, what's

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.520
the truth about what this
country really went through?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.570
And then that led to this idea
of, what kind of a country

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.360
just glossed over so
much of this stuff

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.720
and turned it into the greatest
generation when we know,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.510
those of us that have these
parents that lived through it,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.200
they became alcoholics because
they're numb to their pain?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.000
And it was just this
amazing dichotomy

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.890
between what we
think of and what

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.270
we hold onto as our mythology
from mid-20th century

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.850
and how we just look at
it as this shining, almost

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.010
Emerald City.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.869
But those of us--

00:25:27.869 --> 00:25:29.410
you close the door
behind it, and you

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.420
remember grandpa was a mess.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.260
And why was grandpa a mess?

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.550
And so that's really
where the idea was born.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.350
So the cliches and the tropes
in this story were intended.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.940
They just were
intended to be looked

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.099
at from a very, very raw
and realistic point of view.

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:49.390
ALAN SEALES: And then, so
how did it make it from paper

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.880
into the Paper Mill
Playhouse-- right?--

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.046
is where you workshopped it?

00:25:52.046 --> 00:25:55.750
ROBERT TAYLOR: Yes, we
had a number of readings

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.390
only six months after we
finished the first draft.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.420
We finished the first draft
in about three months' time.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.150
Six months later, we had our
first reading here in New York.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.740
And many of these
people were involved

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.200
in the very first
reading, and then

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.660
a couple of subsequent readings,
and then a big lab workshop

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.500
at Lincoln Center, and
then Paper Mill Playhouse

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.080
a year later.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.400
And from there, our producers
decided we were ready.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.350
ALAN SEALES: Many of
them are here tonight.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.460
They swarmed in for this thing.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.100
I love it.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.166
RICHARD OBERACKER: They
just wanted the food--

00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:33.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.480
--which is awesome.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.267
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.267 --> 00:26:36.850
ALAN SEALES: [INAUDIBLE]
to truck pit.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.808
They liked the dessert.

00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:39.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.970
So for the cast here, being
as young as all of you are,

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.060
I assume none of you were
actually in World War II.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.599
How did you prepare
for these roles?

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:48.640
Did you talk to veterans?

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.874
Did you get a feel for
what they went through?

00:26:51.874 --> 00:26:52.540
COREY COTT: Yes.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:58.510
So some of us are wearing these
six pins that you guys see.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.790
It represents an organization
called Got Your 6,

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.150
which is this incredible
vets organization that really

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.450
attempts to re-fabricate
the stereotype of veterans

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.220
in our society and
how they're actually

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.030
doing incredible
things for our society.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.800
They're not to be pitied
or looked down upon.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.290
But they're actually making
our society and culture

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.080
more stable.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.840
And so one of the
things they do is

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.907
they look at different pieces of
entertainment films, TV shows.

00:27:24.907 --> 00:27:26.740
And we're actually the
very first stage show

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.950
to be accredited by Got Your 6
as an accurate representation

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.110
of a veteran's story.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.490
So they came and saw our show.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.948
And they actually consulted on
the script with our writers,

00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:38.710
and gave us feedback,
and have been with us

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.747
and guiding us for almost our
entire Broadway-- certainly

00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:43.830
our Broadway experience
even before Broadway, too.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.760
And so we had a
two-hour sit-down

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.980
where we, as the cast,
the Donny Nova Band,

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.490
got to talk with them and just
ask them anything we wanted to,

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.770
and they just gave us--
there was about 10 vets or so

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.897
from all different branches,
and gave us their thoughts

00:27:56.897 --> 00:27:59.230
and insight, and were very
honest and vulnerable with us

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.690
about their experiences in
combat and losing friends,

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.440
and how they deal with that.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.880
And that by far-- that
took our entire experience

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.910
in show and script to
a whole other level.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.800
But paired with
that, we've also done

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.170
our own individual research
by reading many memoirs

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.830
and watching endless
documentaries in everything

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.287
from "Band of Brothers" to
"Patton," everything out there.

00:28:22.287 --> 00:28:24.370
I mean, there's so many
resources on World War II,

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.900
especially.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.150
But veterans today have
been a huge resource for us.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.650
LAURA OSNES: And
just last night, we

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:35.020
had a group of Gold Star women,
wives and sisters and mothers

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.900
who have lost men in battle.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.400
It was just women
last night, right?

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.420
There weren't the guys then.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.030
Formed this organization
called taps.org,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.640
which stands for
Tragedy Assistance--

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.167
COREY COTT: Survive--

00:28:47.167 --> 00:28:48.250
LAURA OSNES: What's the P?

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.032
Tragedy Assistant--
yeah, it says on there.

00:28:51.032 --> 00:28:51.865
Tragedy Assistance--

00:28:51.865 --> 00:28:54.010
COREY COTT: I've
got it right here.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.290
Tragedy Assistance
Program for Survivors.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:00.160
LAURA OSNES: Program for
Survivors, so family members

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.510
who have survived and had
family members that died

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.820
in having to do with the war.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.940
And we had just an amazing
little reception with them

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.480
last night.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.480
And it was incredible
to hear their stories.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.210
And they were in
awe of the show.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.820
And we were just talking
about how they made a point

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.999
to say how truthful it was.

00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:22.290
They could relate so much to
so many of the characters,

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.680
and to my character, especially,
because she's a widow,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.930
and just how they felt safe, and
that they could laugh with us

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:31.860
and cry with us.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.960
And that was really
an incredible honor.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.240
And I'm fueled to do
the show again tonight,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.560
because we had, again,
one-on-one firsthand

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.720
interactions with people
who have gone through what

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.980
our characters
have gone through,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.885
and that's the really
special thing about it.

00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:47.551
GEOFF PACKARD: And
the interesting thing

00:29:47.551 --> 00:29:50.010
about the research,
for me, was that you

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.280
get cast in a show where you
get to play a combat veteran who

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.050
just comes back from the war.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.050
In particular, my
character has struggles

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.090
with obsessive
compulsive disorder

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.370
and is a germaphobe,
and really interesting

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.840
things you get to
take on as an actor.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.330
So you focus on that.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.030
And for the first part of my
experience with "Bandstand,"

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.030
I focused on what
those differences were.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.267
Then we met with these
veterans, and they all

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:17.100
told us their story.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.710
And it was an overwhelming
idea that they

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:25.020
wanted to be portrayed as human
and not victims or heroes,

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.910
that they really
wanted us to focus

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.640
on what the human
aspect of these people

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:36.090
were-- they were fathers and
sons and lovers and humorists.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.561
And we found it--

00:30:37.561 --> 00:30:39.310
with this interesting
thing with our show,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.268
it takes place in 1945.

00:30:40.268 --> 00:30:43.350
And we have this great
device of swing music

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.780
to really represent that.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.600
So a lot of research,
also, with learning

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.230
how to play the instruments.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.590
We also had to learn
what swing music

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.630
meant to that time period.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:31:00.060
And it, in a lot of
ways, helped these people

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.540
get through these
horrible things,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.300
but also let them release
all the fun stuff.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.390
And let them act out,
a lot like hip hop

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.870
does now, or real rock and roll.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.290
So there was just
as much research

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:21.022
done on how to be authentic
to the swing music, as well.

00:31:21.022 --> 00:31:22.480
ALAN SEALES: One of the most--

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:22.980
go ahead.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.021
BRANDON ELLIS: Well, I
was going to say something

00:31:25.021 --> 00:31:27.720
that I think is important to
talk about the story, where

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.120
all of these, like you
said, they overwhelmingly

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.910
want to be portrayed
as human beings.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.690
And while this subject
matter, it's heavy,

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.630
and these people are going
through some heavy stuff.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.440
Humans, in general, are
always reaching for light.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.290
And this story is about
redemption and joy.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.190
And while it may--

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.600
this stuff is a heavy
material to be responsible

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.090
for, the show is very joyful.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.730
It's very much, everyone
is like reaching for light,

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.980
reaching for joy
the entire show.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.470
And yeah, we have moments
where things catch up with us,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.890
but in general, we're
trying to stay ahead of it.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.490
So although it may
sound heavy, it's

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.770
actually a very joyful show.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.496
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, that's what
I was going to lead into was,

00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:12.914
Andy Blankenbuehler, the
director-choreographer--

00:32:12.914 --> 00:32:15.330
choreographer for "Hamilton,"
"In the Heights," the "Cats"

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.410
revival that's on
right now-- he's

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.610
just an amazing choreographer.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.026
Of course, he won
the Tony for it.

00:32:19.026 --> 00:32:21.090
Congrats again.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.700
One of the most touching
moments, I think,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.630
was there's this part in--

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.030
I think it's an intro to a song.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.540
I don't know if you're
actually singing at the time.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.970
But everybody comes in,
the lights are down,

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.350
and everyone's got weight.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.470
There's another body hanging
on them, literally, on stage.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.274
And you use the singing,
you use the songs to--

00:32:38.274 --> 00:32:39.690
RICHARD OBERACKER:
They're playing

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.856
their instruments, actually.

00:32:40.856 --> 00:32:42.200
It's a counterpoint, yeah.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.280
RICHARD OBERACKER: Yeah,
it's a counterpoint

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.560
that leads into a
rehearsal sequence which

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.150
leads into a church service.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.600
And Andy physicalized each line.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.540
A counterpoint is
basically lines

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.202
that intersect and become
a piece of composition.

00:32:58.202 --> 00:32:59.910
And so he physicalized
that on the stage,

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:04.080
but each body is
attached to other bodies.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.090
And the visual
image is, you just

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.977
see the weight, the
psychological weight,

00:33:07.977 --> 00:33:09.810
that each one of these
band members carries.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.170
ROBERT TAYLOR: Of the
men men they left behind.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.371
RICHARD OBERACKER: The men
they left behind, yeah.

00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:14.870
You guys could speak
to that moment.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:15.453
It's stunning.

00:33:15.453 --> 00:33:17.220
It's part of why
he won the Tony.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.720
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, it's one of
the most beautiful parts that

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.520
sticks out in my mind.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.186
GEOFF PACKARD: Well,
it was interesting.

00:33:21.186 --> 00:33:24.690
It was created-- that
part, it was hit upon,

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.420
touched upon at Paper
Mill, but fully realized

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.597
for the Broadway production.

00:33:28.597 --> 00:33:30.180
And we were already
deep in rehearsals

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.810
when we had this moment with
these veterans from Got Your 6.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:38.790
And one of the
first men who spoke

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:44.280
talked about never really
recovering from the combat

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.439
that they went through.

00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:46.980
But they definitely
remember a moment

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.370
where the weight that they
were carrying was lifted.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:54.500
And we all went, wait,
that's what Andy was doing.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.850
Not only, actually,
because they, I guess,

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.970
wore flak jackets,
a lot of them.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.190
And so they had to deal with
the idea of being lighter,

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.680
actually.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.270
But it's a huge part of the
show is weight being lifted.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:12.886
Some of us find our weight--

00:34:12.886 --> 00:34:14.719
we hold onto that for
longer periods of time

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:15.885
than other guys in the band.

00:34:15.885 --> 00:34:18.509
But yeah, it's a big part
of "Bandstand" is weight.

00:34:18.509 --> 00:34:21.050
BRANDON ELLIS: And one of the
interesting things that he does

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.050
through counterpoint-- not to
ruin anything when you come see

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.400
the show-- but they're
on us, and as we are--

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.040
we all have vices
that we've turned

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.159
to deal with what is happening
to us in terms of what we're

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.150
carrying back from conflict.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.690
And as the show goes along, and
as we're seeking and finding

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.774
redemption, those vices
switch to the music,

00:34:41.774 --> 00:34:43.940
which is another thing that
the show is really about

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.050
is the redemptive and
healing quality of music.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.909
And a lot of veterans turn
to art for that reason.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.330
And as the show-- for instance,
myself, the show starts,

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.320
my vice is alcohol.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.719
That's what I'm using
to deal with the pain.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.840
And by the end of the
show, it's the music

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.492
that I'm using to temporarily
give me some relief.

00:35:04.492 --> 00:35:06.200
GEOFF PACKARD: I swear
I'll stop talking.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.510
But if Andy was
here, he would say

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.890
that it's difficult in a
musical, in particular,

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.130
to tell a story about a
generation of men and women

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.820
who didn't talk about
what they went through.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.380
So we're telling
a story about guys

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.610
who didn't talk about combat.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.450
And Andy, geniusly,
uses movement

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:34.160
to tell that story
while we play.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.495
I don't know how else we would
tell that story without--

00:35:36.495 --> 00:35:38.870
ALAN SEALES: Well, I have a
video that I'm going to show,

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.040
so I can tell it that way.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.100
So if any of you guys
have any questions,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.990
there's two mics in the aisles.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.430
Start lining up
during this thing,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.350
and then we can cut to you
guys as soon as we're done.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.599
How many of you have been
staring at Brandon's tattoo,

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:51.190
by the way?

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.689
Yeah?

00:35:51.689 --> 00:35:53.100
How many hours did that take?

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.250
How much pain was that?

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:54.720
GEOFF PACKARD: It's fake.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.107
LAURA OSNES: It's
fake for the show.

00:35:56.107 --> 00:35:56.310
JOE CARROLL: It's totally fake.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.518
BRANDON ELLIS: Dammit, Geoff.

00:35:57.518 --> 00:35:58.421
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:58.421 --> 00:35:59.960
ALAN SEALES: It's for the show.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.822
All right, roll the
Tony video, please.

00:36:01.822 --> 00:36:02.697
PRESENTER: Thank you.

00:36:02.697 --> 00:36:04.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:04.744 --> 00:36:05.619

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.930
PRESENTER: In the armed
forces, Got Your 6 means

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.970
I've got your back.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.240
I'm proud to say that
the organization Got

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.900
Your 6, which works
to empower veterans,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.890
has partnered with the
thrilling musical, "Bandstand"

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.570
to highlight the experiences and
talents of America's veterans.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:31.896
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:37.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.340
PRESENTER: As the daughter
of a World War II signalmen

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.550
and the mother of
an army major, I've

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.700
seen how the scars of
service can haunt, even

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.400
in the best of situations.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.890
Too many of America's
veterans are struggling

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.500
to find a new mission in life.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.010
Their stories need to be told.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.100
"Bandstand" is set just
after World War II.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.050
As a group of veterans cope
with returning to civilian life,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.130
they form a band unlike
any the nation has ever

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.850
seen and discover
the power of music

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:20.280
to find their voice, their
purpose, and redemption.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.280
I'm honored to say to our
veterans, on behalf of Joe,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.210
myself, the company of
"Bandstand," and everybody

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.150
here tonight, we've Got Your 6.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.587

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.050
Now, featuring the
heart-stopping, Tony-winning

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.650
choreography of
Andy Blankenbuehler,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.010
please welcome the
company of "Bandstand."

[APPLAUSE]

00:40:37.881 --> 00:40:40.130
ALAN SEALES: I love it when
the people in the pictures

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.510
and on the TV are also on stage.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.090
That's very cool.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.180
I've always wondered about this,
for the Tony's, specifically--

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.280
I mean, that must been
phenomenal for you guys.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.240
A couple of you--

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.060
Laura-- have been there a couple
of times, which is amazing.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.455
What's the process
for the Tony's?

00:40:55.455 --> 00:40:57.830
Do they actually bring set
pieces in, or do they recreate

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.770
them just for the Tony's?

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.170
LAURA OSNES: That set is
actually a projection,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.540
believe it or not.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.330
ALAN SEALES: What?

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.205
LAURA OSNES: The back
of it was a projection,

00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:10.489
and we brought in, literally,
the step, the platform step

00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:11.780
that we brought from our stage.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.613
ALAN SEALES: So after
the final Sunday show,

00:41:13.613 --> 00:41:17.051
Broadway just brings a bunch
of set pieces to Radio City.

00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:19.300
COREY COTT: Most of it,
actually, is projection, yeah.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.000
ALAN SEALES: Huh.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.780
COREY COTT: There's very few--

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.238
I mean, we brought
our instruments.

00:41:22.238 --> 00:41:24.950
And they replicated those steps
that we had, the platforms.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.116
But besides that, most
of it actually is--

00:41:27.116 --> 00:41:29.240
I mean, if you go back and
look at the performances

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.520
from this year, you'll notice
that a lot of it is projection.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.690
ALAN SEALES: You just
ruined everything.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.523
LAURA OSNES: I know.

00:41:33.523 --> 00:41:34.107
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:34.107 --> 00:41:34.940
But it's incredible.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:40.790
They verbatim made a real
projection of our set--

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.679
every picture that's
on there, every detail.

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:43.220
I don't know.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.220
They must take a photo of
it, and then they legit--

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.540
GEOFF PACKARD: They
know how it worked.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.456
LAURA OSNES: Oh, yeah.

00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:48.738
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:48.738 --> 00:41:49.714
LAURA OSNES: We're amazed
at that sort of thing.

00:41:49.714 --> 00:41:50.971
You guys are like, yeah.

00:41:50.971 --> 00:41:51.430
ALAN SEALES: You're the ones
who designed it, probably.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.555
LAURA OSNES: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:52.555 --> 00:41:53.297
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.297 --> 00:41:54.880
ALAN SEALES: How
does projection work?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:57.262
I get too--

00:41:57.262 --> 00:41:59.220
LAURA OSNES: But we all
had a matinee that day.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.710
So what happens
on Tony Sunday is

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.530
that you go to Radio City in
the morning in your costume.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.988
You go to the theater and get
in costume, go to Radio City,

00:42:05.988 --> 00:42:10.120
have dress rehearsal, go back
to the theater, do a matinee.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.870
And then we hung
out at the theater,

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.230
and streamed the beginning of
the Tony's, and then got back

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.540
in costume, and got on
a bus to Radio City,

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.089
and got off the number before
ours, and hung out backstage,

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:22.130
and then go, do your
number, get back on the bus,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.088
go back to the theater.

00:42:23.088 --> 00:42:24.240
It's a crazy day.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.740
GEOFF PACKARD: The
interesting thing

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.280
is that the majority of the
cast that you see perform

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.220
spent most of the
actual broadcast

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.840
on a bus on, like, 50th
Street waiting to go on.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.161
So the stage manager comes
out to your boss and goes,

00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:38.660
you're on.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.260
And then you go
backstage, then you go on,

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.650
and you go back to the bus.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.280
It's not a--

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:43.970
COREY COTT: It's crazy.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.386
GEOFF PACKARD: You
do get to see--

00:42:45.386 --> 00:42:47.130
I shook hands with
Stephen Colbert.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.630
And--

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.130
COREY COTT: Backstage
is crazy at the Tony's.

shook Stephen Colbert's hand

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.510
with his pants
around his ankles.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.605
He was getting his microphone
off, and I was standing--

00:42:57.605 --> 00:42:59.330
we were getting our
microphones off,

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.630
and Geoff literally
says to Stephen Colbert,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.072
can I shake my
hand even though--

00:43:04.072 --> 00:43:04.780
what did you say?

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.170
GEOFF PACKARD: No, I said,
well, my pants are down,

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.128
I guess this is a good
time to shake your hand.

00:43:08.128 --> 00:43:09.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.722 --> 00:43:12.180
JOE CARROLL: Colbert looked at
him like he had three heads.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.290
GEOFF PACKARD: He shook my hand.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.456
ALAN SEALES: He's probably
heard that a lot, though.

00:43:17.456 --> 00:43:18.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.290
ALAN SEALES: I didn't mean
it like that, come one.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.180
So going back to the
military association,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.120
I mean, it's such
a strong theme,

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.810
of course, with the
show and everything.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.600
Have you, other than I've
Got Your 6 organization,

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.660
has there been any
audience feedback?

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.240
Have people come up after
the show and hung around?

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.887
I mean, what have you-- what
stood out for all of you?

00:43:37.887 --> 00:43:39.720
JOE CARROLL: There's a
ton of those stories.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.180
But one-- I mean, you can
speak more specifically to it.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.720
But one of the
coolest ones, there

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.670
was a guy in the front row who
we-- we got to curtain call,

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.404
and he stood up.

00:43:51.404 --> 00:43:53.570
And he was by himself, and
he just started clapping,

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.120
and he started mouthing to
Corey, he's like, I'm a vet,

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.460
I'm a vet.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.260
And I think that you
just took his hand

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.610
and brought him backstage.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.430
And he was a Vietnam veteran.

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.950
And he was like,
the post-Vietnam era

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.922
was so anti-military.

00:44:09.922 --> 00:44:11.630
And he said something
along the lines of,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.450
this is the first time
I've felt truly free of--

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.700
truly proud of being a
veteran, that was what he said.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.280
This is the first time I've felt
truly proud of being a veteran.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.210
There's a bunch
of those stories.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.200
Fleet Week was amazing.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.574
When Fleet Week
was happening, we

00:44:22.574 --> 00:44:24.572
had tons of vets
in all the time.

00:44:24.572 --> 00:44:25.280
COREY COTT: Yeah.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.710
And even people that
didn't specifically serve,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.450
there's so many
stories of them either

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.570
being related to their
grandfathers, or their uncles,

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:34.730
or dads, or
brothers, or sisters,

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.670
or moms who have
served in some way.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.090
And in a lot of
ways, I think there's

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:44.720
been an expectation
to come see our show

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.070
with this idea of swing music.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.590
And "Bandstand," you
have a certain idea

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.906
of what this could be.

00:44:49.906 --> 00:44:51.530
And then you come--
and a lot of people

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.510
have said they've
come and been taken

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.330
to an experience, an
emotional journey,

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.067
that they didn't expect, and
felt that not only did they

00:45:01.067 --> 00:45:03.650
have a good time and felt like
they experienced a great story,

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.150
but that they felt
like they honored

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:09.410
their relatives, that they were
taken to a place that respected

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.800
them.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.300
GEOFF PACKARD: We
also got to meet--

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.580
he wasn't a veteran,
but he was one

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.913
of the most interesting people
I've ever met in my life.

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:18.290
There's a 19-year-old guy
named-- what's his name, Rob?

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:19.153
LAURA OSNES: Rishi.

00:45:19.153 --> 00:45:20.060
ROBERT TAYLOR: Rishi Sharma.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.226
GEOFF PACKARD: Rishi Sharma.

00:45:21.226 --> 00:45:25.130
And he was from California,
graduated high school,

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.650
and was obsessed
with this mission

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:32.930
to meet and record all of
the living American World War

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.007
II veterans that
are still present.

00:45:35.007 --> 00:45:35.840
And he did the math.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.330
There's something like
however many die every day.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.762
So he mapped out that there's
four years until they all die.

00:45:41.762 --> 00:45:42.470
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.095
GEOFF PACKARD: And so he's been,
for the past year and a half--

00:45:45.095 --> 00:45:46.636
RICHARD OBERACKER:
He's been doing it

00:45:46.636 --> 00:45:47.762
about two and a half years.

00:45:47.762 --> 00:45:49.636
GEOFF PACKARD: He goes
throughout the country

00:45:49.636 --> 00:45:50.700
and contacts these men--

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.630
combat veterans, in particular--
and sits down with them,

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:56.180
and talks and interviews
them for about--

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.970
ROBERT TAYLOR: And gets their
actual stories, their combat

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.870
stories, on camera.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.730
It's really--

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.080
RICHARD OBERACKER: It's
like the Shoah Foundation

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.559
for the Holocaust that Spielberg
was heavily involved with.

00:46:05.559 --> 00:46:07.100
And so he's archiving
all this stuff.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.475
And he's really the only one
in the world who's doing it.

00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:10.400
He's 19 years old.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.320
GEOFF PACKARD: And
immediately after the show,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.220
we're like, well,
are you going to make

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.282
a documentary about this?

00:46:14.282 --> 00:46:16.490
And he's like, no, no, no,
I give it to the veterans.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.950
It's not really about what
goes into the footage,

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.470
it's about these guys
getting it off their chest.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.610
And so immediately,
Corey and I were like,

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:27.190
yeah, man, I was feeling good
about the story we were telling

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.970
until we meet this 19-year-old.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.460
But that's the best
part about this show

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.080
is that there are a lot of--

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.910
hopefully, when they
come and see it,

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:38.810
somebody asks a family
member, wasn't uncle so-and-so

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:39.380
in the war?

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.280
What was his story?

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.410
And that happened to each of us.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.450
On some level, we
go, yeah, tell me

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.822
about Uncle Morty's
time in the--

00:46:46.822 --> 00:46:48.780
and all of a sudden, you
get these new stories,

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.380
or these old stories
come out anew.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.520
Our director, Andy,
came backstage

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.370
after the Tony's and said--

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:00.714
was it his uncle
or his grandfather?

00:47:00.714 --> 00:47:02.630
COREY COTT: Grandfather
was in the 4th Marines

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.869
and had fought in the
Pacific, at Iwo Jima, and all

00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:05.660
these other places.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.350
GEOFF PACKARD: That's
the most common thing

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:08.900
is that, I didn't know,
but so-and-so did this,

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.760
or I didn't know, but my
next-door neighbor was a Gold

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.710
Star member, whatever.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.751
LAURA OSNES: Yeah, right.

00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:17.090
ROBERT TAYLOR: And my dad
is a World War II vet.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:20.900
And all of the dads of the
kids I grew up with were.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.080
And there were so
many things about them

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.060
that I couldn't explain why they
were these incredible people

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.710
that had explosive tempers
and that were, very often,

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.210
in fights and self-medicating.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:42.000
And it's been really--

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.340
it's opened up, for me,
just a window into what they

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.540
were going through, writing the
show and working on the show.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.410
And that's what I've seen--

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.300
other people who haven't
served themselves.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:56.650
But it's opened up such a window
of understanding into relatives

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:01.200
and family members that--

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.910
it's just amazing that they're
suddenly realizing, oh,

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:09.360
that's probably why this man
has been so distant all my life,

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:15.480
or that's probably
why just the slightest

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.312
thing can trigger a response
I would not have expected.

00:48:19.312 --> 00:48:21.270
ALAN SEALES: Well, we're
running short of time.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.859
We do have one more
performance from you guys

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:24.900
I hope that you can give.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.000
But I want to take one question
over here before we're done.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.500
AUDIENCE: So I know you guys
talked a lot about the research

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.375
that you're doing to
develop your characters,

00:48:32.375 --> 00:48:34.000
so I guess my
question is in regards

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.750
to an understudy or a
swing, how much flexibility

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.250
do you guys have to
make your own choices

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.584
versus taking what the, I
guess, original actor has done?

00:48:43.584 --> 00:48:44.750
LAURA OSNES: Great question.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:45.920
ALAN SEALES: Great
question, yeah.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.640
ANDREW LEGGIERI: Good que--

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.848
I'll figure that out tonight.

00:48:47.848 --> 00:48:51.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:56.930
Yeah, it would be my
first time doing this part

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:58.761
with these guys.

00:48:58.761 --> 00:49:00.510
And I've been with the
show for two years,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.260
so this is going to be a
whole whirlwind of emotions

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.580
and a whole whirlwind of,
am I in the right spot?

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.290
Am I saying the right line?

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:10.570
What's my next prop?

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.010
What's my next costume change?

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.850
So yeah, it's going
to be a lot of--

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:19.280
I think tonight is going
to be a lot of, just,

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.080
what I've worked on and what--

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.371
LAURA OSNES: Hitting the notes.

00:49:22.371 --> 00:49:26.720
ANDREW LEGGIERI: --and going
to be as close to the show

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.340
as they know it,
because otherwise,

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.150
for me, I don't know, my mind
will be in a million places.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:37.070
So yeah, I think the
first time I went on

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:42.480
for one of the other tracks, it
was very much saying the words,

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.940
making sure I have a character.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.890
And then as I kept doing it--

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.746
I did it four times so far--

00:49:47.746 --> 00:49:49.370
I felt like I was
able to flesh it out.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.060
I was living in it more.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.040
And it's not that I was
making different choices

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.810
from the other actor, but
we're just different people.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:02.780
So it felt like when I
was living in it more,

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.260
I was bringing something to
it that only I can bring,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:07.580
where I'm only me.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.670
I can't really
replicate anything.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:14.765
But the more comfortable
I feel, then I

00:50:14.765 --> 00:50:15.890
feel like I can live in it.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.630
And it's probably going
to be different, for sure.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:22.220
But yeah, I hope that
answered your question.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that was good.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:25.550
ALAN SEALES: You should get
it fake tattooed on your arm.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.350
You can just look at
your arm the whole time

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:28.940
with the big wings
on it or something.

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.800
Well, cool.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.690
Thank you all so
much for coming in.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.760
Hopefully there's one
more song you can all

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.410
sing for us as a group, yes?

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.110

Please help me give them
a round of applause,

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:55.536
and we'll get one
more song out of them.

00:50:55.536 --> 00:50:57.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:57.802 --> 00:50:59.408
RICHARD OBERACKER:
[INAUDIBLE] are

00:50:59.408 --> 00:51:03.104
moving these chairs is this
last song is the end of act one.

00:51:03.104 --> 00:51:05.630
And you've been hearing
about this radio contest

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.480
that they all enter.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.455
It's states, and then nationals.

00:51:08.455 --> 00:51:09.830
So at the end of
act one, they've

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.480
won the state competition.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.150
They've believed all
along that NBC and MGM was

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.612
going to treat them like stars
and take them to New York

00:51:16.612 --> 00:51:18.320
and their dreams were
going to come true.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.940
And right before
the song happens,

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.414
they find out that, no, you
have to pay your own way.

00:51:22.414 --> 00:51:24.080
And in fact, when you
get there, there's

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.020
another preliminary
off-air because the contest

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.290
is only two hours.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.100
So in other words, they're
screwed and they can't go.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.700
And so this song is
really about Donny

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.027
realizing this dream of riding
this first-class train that

00:51:38.027 --> 00:51:40.610
got him through the war-- it's
what got him through the battle

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.550
is dreaming that he gets to take
this train, and go to New York,

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.070
and be a star, and play
on the greatest bandstand

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.955
that New York has to
offer is just smashed.

00:51:57.757 --> 00:52:01.685
[MUSIC - "BANDSTAND" COMPANY,
 "RIGHT THIS WAY"]

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:38.614
