This is a stick insect.
It may look fairly conspicuous on my hand

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.340
although I've made an effort to
make it feel at home with my shirt.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.200
But you'd have to see it in its really natural
surroundings in order to see it at its best.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.120
There it would blend in almost totally.
The attention to detail

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.080
is astonishing, you can even see little
marks suggesting bark on its back.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.400
You could almost say that it fits its
environment like a key fits a lock.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.860
And I've got something else under my hat.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.840
This is a different kind of stick insect,
a leaf insect, it mainly resembles leaves

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.010
dead leaves. You see how it rocks like
that I suspect that it's got a second

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.110
line of defense which is that when it's
when it's startled and when a bird might

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.820
almost have got it it then I suspect
mimics a scorpion. You see how the tail

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.160
has looped over the back there if I saw
that I might be momentarily startled

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.080
thinking that it was a scorpion.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Now lets put these away.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.060
And they have to call for a volunteer
 who's not frightened of stick insects.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.060
There we are.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.340
Thank you very much.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:46.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.700
Brice and I are always doing 
double acts like this.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:05.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.860
[APPLAUSE]
