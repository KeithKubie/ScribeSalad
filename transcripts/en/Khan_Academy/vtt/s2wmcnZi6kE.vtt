00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:01.969
- [Voiceover] So I've copied
and pasted this question

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.628
from the exercises on Khan Academy.

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.588
It says, "Sort the following expressions

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.468
"from least to greatest
based on the coordinates

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:09.385
"of the rectangle below."

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.313
So we need to figure out
would y, z and x are.

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:12.695
Then we assort them.

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:14.448
So let's first look at,

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.514
well let's look at y.

00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.779
And this is a little bit counter intuitive

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.138
because they're using the variable y

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:21.204
to represent the x-coordinate,

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.839
to represent the x
coordinate of this point.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:24.814
So let's see if we can figure out

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.800
what the x-coordinate of this point is.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.042
Well it's a rectangle.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:30.921
The x-coordinate of this
point right over here,

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.399
it's going to be the same as
the x-coordinate of this point.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.899
They sit on the same vertical line

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.072
the way that it is drawn.

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:41.392
So if this has an
x-coordinate of x equals four,

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:43.656
then this is going to have
an x-coordinate of four.

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.361
And now we use a variable
y for the x-coordinate

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.417
which is a little strange

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.935
but this is going to be
the point four comma seven.

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.999
So y is equal to four.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.935
Now let's see what we
can figure out about z.

00:00:56.935 --> 00:01:00.814
Well, z is the y coordinate for,

00:01:00.814 --> 00:01:02.230
let me use another color here,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.582
z is the y coordinate for this point.

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:08.093
Now, what other point has
the same y-coordinate?

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:10.031
Well, it's going to be at the same level,

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.053
I guess you could say,

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:12.609
in the vertical direction.

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.780
It's going to sit on the
same horizontal line.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.357
So it's going to have the same
y-coordinate as this point.

00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:19.272
Now this point has a
y-coordinate of three.

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:21.315
So this point, it's y-coordinate
is going to be three

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:25.135
or we could say that z is equal to three.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.410
So this is going to be equal to three.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.593
And then last but not least,

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:31.972
we need to figure out what x is.

00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:33.971
And x is the x-coordinate.

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.153
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.789
X is the x-coordinate for this point.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.994
Well, this x-coordinate is
going to be the same thing

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:42.351
as the x-coordinate for this point up here

00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.709
which is equal to two.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.253
They sit on the same vertical line.

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:46.635
They both sit on the line,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.411
x equals two.

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.696
And so x is going to be two.

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.796
It is the x-coordinate and
it's also the variable x.

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:56.595
So this is going to be two.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.525
So if we want to sort them
from least to greatest,

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.551
x is the least.

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.219
Then we would go, it's
actually the exact opposite

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.924
of what we have here.

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:09.086
The x then z, then y.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.665
Two then three, then four.

00:02:10.665 --> 00:02:12.024
So actually, let me get the exercise out

00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:13.614
and just check our answer.

00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:15.007
So x is the least

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:16.249
then z is in the middle

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.910
and then y is the largest.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.163
We can check our answer.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.562
We got it right.
