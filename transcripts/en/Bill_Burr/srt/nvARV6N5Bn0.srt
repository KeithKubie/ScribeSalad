1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,440
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,590
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:12,060
June 4th, 2018. What's going on?

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,840
How are you? Hi, adorne.
Lattie I'm in Dublin,

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,700
Dublin, Ireland. Um,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,310
I've been on a fucking plane
for, I don't know how long. Uh,

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,270
we left to lax and uh,

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,000
what were you supposed to leave
in the afternoon? And then, uh,

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:34,440
there was some problem
with the hydraulics. They
back the fucking thing up.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,350
They pulled it forward to back that up.
They pulled it forward like, you know,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,670
two and a half hours later we finally
left, which is all good because, you know,

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,160
it's Don Rickles says in
casino rather, it's, you know,

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,350
spread it down here then you
know, up there. Right. Um,

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,930
so I was just sitting on the fucking plane
and uh, they didn't give us any food.

15
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,840
They get a little cup of water. That was
in two and a half hour delay. Nothing,

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,950
no food, no drinks or anything at all. I
was thinking I was on Air France there.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,480
I was like, oh, this is how these
fucking people stay so skinny. You know,

18
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,790
they just leave you on there.
They don't feed you or nothing.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,443
MMM.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,960
So anyways, but I kept my mind occupied.
I was transcribing a pan terrorist song.

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,930
I find get into shit. You know, I,

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,300
I can eats up all the time.
Um,

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,940
rather than sitting there either do
that or a police solitaire on my phone.

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,790
It's somebody get me a deck of
cards, they're like, you know,

25
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,600
you can just get an app for that. And
like that is really a lot easier isn't it?

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,250
Plus I feel you win a lot
more with the APP, you know,

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,340
cause it wants you to keep playing or a
deck of cards. They don't give a shit.

28
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,980
They just want it done.
They got your money that don't,

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,180
that fucking solitaire game
though. Don't get it. Don't get it.

30
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,900
Because they've got like 50 fucking
ads every time they shuffle the cards.

31
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:59,010
Every time you win a game,
be time you move your hand.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,160
They got like another ad and they put
the acts in a different spot every time.

33
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:07,420
If you don't really hit the acts and it
goes to another fucking page, you know.

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,540
So somebody gets credit for a look
of viewing a click and analyze.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,610
I don't, I don't pretend to
understand these things. So anyways.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,783
MMM.

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,760
This podcast is going to
be all over the place.

38
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm going to tell you that
right now because I was
debating whether or not to do

39
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:30,820
it, uh, before I left. And I was like,
well don't do it before you leave.

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,210
It'd be more exciting if people hear you
talk to yourself in a different country

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,600
that allowed a new fucking flavor.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,353
MMM.

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,050
The gaming this crazy room. Oh Shit.
My Room Service. Hang on a second.

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,310
Jesus Christ.
All right.

45
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,730
It just ate my fucking room service
and I put it on the news over here.

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,850
It's just like the news back home.
All depressing.

47
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,860
Shit I got with a gun though.

48
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,440
But this is the difference
between the U S in Ireland.

49
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:07,441
It was a 38 Smith and Wesson with five
rounds of ammunition when they said what

50
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,530
kind of gun? It wasn't how much
ammunition was area almost went aw.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,730
Fucking hilarious. Is that um, yeah.

52
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:23,590
Not about gloom and doom charity
one people were Hitler killed today.

53
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,810
When a tractor went off, it's
fucking railroaded. Hash hate hard.

54
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,580
I fucking four key to what are up to
you down in Guatemala and she bites,

55
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,160
have a hood and habits,
you know,

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,430
great accents that everything
but just all depressing shit

57
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,770
at grandmother was later yesterday

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,410
when she was found half eaten by her cat

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,240
ff weekend of Irish store.
I'm

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,610
sorry, I'm fucking punch drunk. I
fucking just ordered this shit on a BLT.

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,770
Not the most healthiest thing.
There was no bacon in it.

62
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:03,070
It's that rest of the world vacant.
You know where it looks like Ham,

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,080
but it has the consistency
of fucking Lod was delicious.

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,700
And I ordered the side salad.
I specifically said side salad,

65
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,960
no fucking potato teach. Right? And
they still brought me French fries.

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,350
I have the side salad. But you now it
is. If you see fucking French fries,

67
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,340
sit there and there's a
salad, right? The Salad.

68
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,350
That's the plain Jane girl next door.

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,010
You want to fuck that big tinted
horror up the street. Right?

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,680
You're going to go after
that cup of potato dish.

71
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,720
Some fucking man. Is he
Manet's over here? He can't.

72
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,300
He can't have the ketchup over here,
although they brought up some Heinz,

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,880
European ketchup sucks. It's all
natural there. Yogurts sucks.

74
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,020
It's also all natural. You know, I
can't even get through a cup of it.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,010
All right. If I'm not
like got it. You know,

76
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:58,090
at least four cups of sugar in
an eight ounce thing of yogurt.

77
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,280
Like that's not yoga to me.
Um,

78
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,630
I charity one year old retired harbor.
Tell you do we eat it up?

79
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,660
History would five pounds of aviation.

80
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,670
The town will show shaken up. They talk
tonight, optical out and go drink. Um,

81
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,620
this has been the Aa additionals um,
any ways where the fuck am I here?

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,470
I'm in Dublin. What did I just
write? Berlin is my password.

83
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,230
Fucking idiot. I really am done. What
do you guys listen to this? I mean,

84
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:33,340
I appreciate that you listen to it, but
I really question you sometimes. Um,

85
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,410
gray sing about Ireland by the way.
It's going through customs now. Granted,

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,360
I looked like a fucking leprechaun.
You know, an older one. Who's kidding?

87
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,240
Who a bald or it looked like
a leprechaun uncle. Okay.

88
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,570
Um, they just let shit,
no work papers. No,

89
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,290
not that guys. Like, what are you
doing here lady? And I was like,

90
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:04,730
I'm doing a show all by yourself.
I was like,

91
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,360
Yep. He's like, all right.
They have a good one

92
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,460
stamp. Welcome to the country. You know

93
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,290
where the place you go to.

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,740
You get that fucking guy who looks like
he's in the Bourne identity looking you

95
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:21,660
up and down and you just start thinking,

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,040
why you making me feel like I
have drugs in my ass right now?

97
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,320
You know,
like I'm a mule.

98
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,990
Um, anyways, so I'm here
David. Hang on a second.

99
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,100
All right. Sorry. Look ingested
from the Goddamn flight. Okay.

100
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,380
You know,
sleeping in that recliner.

101
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,273
MMM.

102
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,270
Never. You fall asleep on a, on
an airplane. You're always like,

103
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:55,140
this is what it must be. What it's like
to be in a loveless marriage. You know,

104
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:59,070
we just don't want to go upstairs because
your wife's in bed and you just watch

105
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,730
TV to you fall asleep and your full,

106
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,110
you just lay in there and that
fucking lazy boy, you know,

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,820
or you've been married so long that like,
oh, I don't want to go up the stairs.

108
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,590
You just sleep right on the couch

109
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,863
doing that shit all night.

110
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,700
Um, I actually had a dream.
I couldn't fucking breathe.

111
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,903
I have that dream.

112
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,520
I don't know.
I don't do well on airplanes.

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I watched the 250 greatest
goals in soccer and uh,

114
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,980
you know, there was some nice ones.
There was some pretty pedestrian once,

115
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,740
but I think it was also because
it's so fucking hard to score.

116
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,800
And he also said the top 250,
250.

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,993
Yeah,

118
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,210
like who has the fucking time? I'm glad
somebody did it. It took like it was,

119
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,840
it was the perfect soccer
highlight reel for an American.

120
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,900
I got to sit there for like 24
minutes and watch nothing but goals,

121
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,133
you know.

122
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,110
I bet goalies hate that
fucking highlight reel.

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,530
It's like a fucking snuff film to
them. You know, you don't scrape.

124
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:10,060
I have noticed about soccer is when you
score and your blasted by the goalie

125
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,190
high on either side,

126
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,480
it's e f they jump out of the
water like a fucking sword fish.

127
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,860
It looks like, you know, not at all.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,950
What are they jump up like
like a swordfish coming
out of the water and what's

129
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:28,210
amazing is rather than just jumping
up and fucking trying to block it,

130
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,420
they always have to turn around and
watch it go in the net. You know,

131
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,350
it's like the Matrix. Don't you
think you could jump a little higher?

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,340
If you want some God damn concerned,
you know where the fuck is going.

133
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,140
If it got buyer,
you know where it is.

134
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,590
You know you can hear the crowd,
you fucking piece of shit. Right.

135
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:50,424
You know when it,

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,340
you're always fucking look at
goddamn soccer goalies there, there,

137
00:08:57,341 --> 00:09:02,280
there were no nosy group of people.
I missed it.

138
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,490
Where's it going?
Right in the back of the net

139
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,470
know. And it actually,
it didn't even look.

140
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,500
Are there like safety
nets or anything behind?

141
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,950
Has anybody ever died.

142
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,300
Somebody blasts the ball misses than
that and then hit some fucking kid in the

143
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,134
face.

144
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,950
That's the only thing that was missing
from the Irish News. Oh, we legendary.

145
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,870
Went down to the pitch, took a focus
on soccer ball. So you don't know organ

146
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,990
here. They lay late, harassed
half six tomorrow morning.

147
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,050
That'd be really early fucking
funeral. Um, get it over with.

148
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,880
We're all fucking pasty over here.

149
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,290
The only thing worse than battery in
your son after he got hit in the face and

150
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:55,280
the pitch is getting a fucking sunburn.
My accident,

151
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,750
I can't do the Irish accent.

152
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,460
My wife reminded me of that guy that
met me at the airport when I was in

153
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:05,810
Scotland. Remember that? That story
I get off. And the guy who the sign

154
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,260
you had my name on, I came walking up
on my hay and he just goes below wall.

155
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,310
I'm like, what your
preferred bottle? A wall.

156
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,910
You saying do you prefer bill or
William Bull Bull.

157
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,923
Um,

158
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,413
how much

159
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,700
Jesus Christ is the only been 10 minutes.
Fuck.

160
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,230
Oh Man, I should have called in sick. Um,

161
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,410
you know what I always mean to do when
I go to Dublin is to take a tour of the

162
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,853
Guinness Factory.

163
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,013
You know,

164
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,820
I'm not, I am not big on Gordon to fuck
on tours. I don't want to hear about it.

165
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:53,450
Oh they get his family.
They fuck it. You know,

166
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,060
they first made their first battle care.

167
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,910
Just get to the part where I get my pint,

168
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,703
you know,

169
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,280
over here is where we put the hops and
the hops score and a big hopper Robert

170
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,690
Hanna at and they stood them up all shame.
It's gets on a bicycle.

171
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,710
It's got some paddles on it and he go,
he wheels around.

172
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,450
I would keep my voice or dumb people
think I'm really disrespect them.

173
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,163
MMM.

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,090
This giant fucking Queen Elizabeth
fuck is setting in a big room.

175
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:25,470
Like this ceilings are like,
this is like for shack or something.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,750
Um, but I never ended up
fucking getting down there.

177
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,793
Um,

178
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,950
it's kind of stupid though, right? I mean,

179
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,430
I bet I could go online and just see
a video. I know what it tastes like.

180
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,170
Kind of a degenerate alcoholic.
Are you that you know,

181
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,520
there's a bunch of booze I like,

182
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:50,521
I'm not going to go there and see how
they make it salivating the whole tour.

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,340
Getting the fucking shakes.
Oh Man.

184
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,900
Would you want to just dive in there?

185
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,930
A 17 year old fell into a vat of Guinness.

186
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,133
Yeah.

187
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,850
Hey, cause he was burned
from a volcano and Guatemala.

188
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,990
He got to jump in the ocean in Guatemala,
but he was Irish.

189
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,290
So we took the pain all the way back
to London because he didn't want to

190
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,590
inconvenience anybody
with his own emotions. Um,

191
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,240
uh, I'm going to fucking new
phone over your mouth. Oh,

192
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,040
this is going to be a good time. My Show's
tomorrow night at the, the three arena.

193
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,790
I don't know what that stands for.
It sounds like some Illuminati shit to me.

194
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,940
Was it the three banks that
are left in all of Europe?

195
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,930
Are they part of the European Union here?
Who decided to leave?

196
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,260
Was it Brussels? No. Was it Berlin? Nope.

197
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,850
Was it Great Britain?
I knew it was Brexit,

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,060
so I try to guess all the Br.
Once I spelled Berlin,

199
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,290
I preempt the are Brelyn.
Um,

200
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,880
just to be interesting, you know, just,
just to try to keep it fresh globally,

201
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,970
you know? Um, anyways, uh,

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,280
how about those fucking Washington
capitals? I'll say it again.

203
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,910
How about those fucking
Washington capitals?

204
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,950
Tell you right now, if I'm a fan of
the Vegas Knights, I gotta be thinking,

205
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:34,780
what is my, what is our adjustment
to their adjustment going to happen?

206
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,750
All right, I'm going to go out and
this waste of what happened. Okay.

207
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,700
The capital's whatever the Fuck Vegas
was doing a game one at the capital's

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,790
adjusted to it and game three,

209
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:49,780
I did not see an answer by
the Vegas Knights. Okay. It,

210
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,480
uh, as far as my limited
knowledge of math goes,

211
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:57,220
they better fucking respond in game
four or this series going to be fucking,

212
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,170
oh, Ba, no, vet skin's going to be
on the cup. It's going to be great.

213
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:05,980
Either way. It's, it's a,
it's an incredible, it's
going to be great. I mean,

214
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:10,981
I'm rooting for the capitalist as a
Josh Adam Meyers and I'm [inaudible],

215
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,920
you know,
and then plus everybody down there,

216
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,810
they'd been waiting since 1974 the
Redskins suck the nationals, you know,

217
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:24,460
I don't, uh, you know these to be, the
senators in the Senate is twice they left.

218
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,330
One time they became the fucking Texas
rangers and other time they became the

219
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,350
Minnesota twins.

220
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,830
Then the fucking expos came down as a
nationals and they still haven't won a

221
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:37,230
title. You know, they're on
their third fucking marriage.

222
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,040
Actually, the senator's did want
a title in like the 1920s, I think

223
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,320
you don't think went to the
fucking White House. Thank George.

224
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:52,220
Washington was still there on it
showed up. It's fucking wooden teeth.

225
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,350
You have to sit there and
listen to some boring story.

226
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:57,190
How he said they made a bet on me.

227
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,990
It makes the teeth of his
fucking Betsy had as a kid,

228
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,270
I'm going to shoot the guy lied his ass
off that they had to come up with that

229
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,820
dumb ass story about I can't, I
can't, I can't, I can't tell a lie.

230
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,130
I chopped down the cherry tree.

231
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,090
What kind of ass kicking do you
think he got over that? You know,

232
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,710
when you really think about it,

233
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:20,100
back then there was no supermarkets and
this guy just chopped down a fucking

234
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:23,980
tree that actually had edible fruit on it.
You know,

235
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,560
I'd probably beat him with the ax handle,

236
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,670
knock that fucking powdered
wig right off his head.

237
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,150
Did rich kids wear
powdered wigs back then?

238
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,123
You know,

239
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,970
people would come up with key their horse

240
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,470
a shit. Fuck you guys. I've
been on a plane for 12 hours.

241
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,620
I don't give a fuck if this is funny
or not. I mean I do, I do care.

242
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,690
But uh, anyways, um, anyways, so, uh,

243
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,550
I watch game one of the NBA finals.

244
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,073
Uh Huh.

245
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,330
And I have to tell you when they fucking
reversed that offensive foul call that

246
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:11,530
basically every summit Jr Smith and I
can't get mad at Jr Smith cause I didn't

247
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:15,710
know what the score was either when he was
dribbling it out. I was going, yes, yes.

248
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,860
It was a lot of other people too that
thought that thought they were up by one.

249
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,293
MMM.

250
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,470
The game was over on that
offensive file. And, uh, you know,

251
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,710
I've never seen them have a little POW
wow in reverse a call. It's he, I mean,

252
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,163
I just,

253
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,600
I had like Tourette's when that
happened and I was so fucking upset.

254
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,550
And so once again,

255
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,960
disappointed by the NBA and the way
that they fucking run their league,

256
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,990
I was so mad. I walked to
my show that night. I just,

257
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:52,790
I didn't want to get in the fucking car.

258
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,180
I knew I had to go for a fucking why
didn't watch the overtime because I knew,

259
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,010
I knew the warriors are going to win it.
I've watched enough games that went up,

260
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,250
fucking want to kick in the
balls with a call like that.

261
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,950
And then the rain man,
dude,

262
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,180
and your team doesn't know
that you fucking tongue
tied and he runs out the, I,

263
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,890
you know what's going to happen.
So Lebron knew,

264
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,340
that's why he went back to the bench
and he didn't talk to anybody. Um, I,

265
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,100
I fucking, I had two shows in
La and I walked to both of them

266
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,120
at one in a dive bar.

267
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,090
And then another one at a little more
upscale place that wasn't quite a comedy

268
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:35,960
club. And I just, I just walked to both of
them. And I can tell you this right now.

269
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,450
La has an unbelievable homeless problem.
Holy Shit.

270
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,800
I mean, they are fucking
everywhere. Every doorway,

271
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:47,980
every nook and cranny.
There's somebody, you know,

272
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:50,910
wrapped up in a like a fucking cocoon,

273
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,020
a lot of mental illness out there.
It's unreal. It's really unreal how

274
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,200
we just fucking leave those people on the
street. You know, mentally ill people.

275
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,760
No, they used to have those as
silence. She can't. Yeah. I don't know.

276
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,970
That didn't work.
I Dunno.

277
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,200
I just need to try to take care of him.
It was really fucking depressing.

278
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,170
Then I was sitting there walking
down the street going like,

279
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,070
did I really leave the
safety of my car to fucking

280
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,680
walk amongst all these fucking people
who got God knows what kind of issues.

281
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:33,514
Right?

282
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,320
And I was standing there and this guy
with this really dirty shirt was just

283
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:42,970
staring at me and I'm waiting for the
light to say walk. You know, it's La,

284
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:46,560
you can't Jay walk. You'll get
killed, right? And then I feel him,

285
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,260
he's just staring right at me. I'm like,
half the fuck. Here we go. Here we go.

286
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh, freckles. Couldn't take your car.

287
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,470
Could yet get all mad about
a basketball game. Right.

288
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,530
The guy looks at me and he
goes, hey. And I ignore it

289
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,830
because hey,
I ignore him again.

290
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,070
And then he sorta like walked around,
sue in my vision. He goes, Hey,

291
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,650
I looked at him, I go, what? And he goes,

292
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,720
are you Joel Mchale?

293
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,670
I just go,
no.

294
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,850
Then that said walk and I walked
away from and I felt him behind me

295
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,990
and I just kept walking.
Then I was walking too fast.

296
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,080
So then there was somebody in front of
me and then he's doing this whole kind of

297
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,560
looking back like, why is this
guy walking so quick? You know?

298
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,850
And I wanted to say that. Yeah, the guy,
hey, you don't need to worry about me.

299
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:53,080
It's the guy I'm walking away from.
Um,

300
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,170
anyways, so that's what the fuck I
did after game one. Jesus Christ.

301
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,220
But worries have to be the most hateable
fucking team I've ever seen in my life.

302
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,640
You don't get enough stars on your team.
You got to poke Lebron in the eye.

303
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,010
Jesus fucking Christ.

304
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,700
That's some shit I've
fucking girl would do.

305
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,200
Plan nerf basketball,
fucking disgrace.

306
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,970
And then Lebron gets out there with his
old ass body, takes a fucking charge.

307
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,290
I know his foot was work was moving and
I know that after they looked at it,

308
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,680
you know, they did get the call.
Right? But what the fuck they,

309
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:33,070
they've never reversed
something like that ever.

310
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,430
So like they were looking for a way for
the warriors to fuck it when it was just,

311
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:43,930
it just, uh, I don't, I don't
know why I give a shit so much.

312
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,560
What do I give a fuck about
either one of these teams? I,

313
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,420
cause what I'm rooting for is just for
sports to go back to the way they used to

314
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,540
be, where, uh, there was still
free agency. I'm not that
old when I was growing up,

315
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,030
but there wasn't these
pylons fucking teams,

316
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,450
you know, I dunno, somebody
sent me a thing about Lebron.

317
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:08,240
Could possibly go to the Celtics.
He better not,

318
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,220
I don't want that title.
You know,

319
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,870
I don't know, Bill, you just old and all
you do is complain. I know, I'm sorry.

320
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,011
I can't,

321
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:26,030
I just realize that the game isn't what
it was when I was a kid and this new

322
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:30,290
game, young people seem to be enjoying
it. Don't have a problem with it.

323
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,860
Should be the way where they had it.
When I was a kid,

324
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,450
there was an old man playing an organ.
Um,

325
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,570
anyways, uh, let me do a little bit
advertising rates. There's this podcast.

326
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:47,330
I'm not going gonna make an hour.
People, you know, by the way,

327
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:50,960
this is my last week of my forties.

328
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,600
This is it, man. I turned
50 years old on Sunday.

329
00:21:56,601 --> 00:22:00,880
Can you believe that?
I was 39 when I started this podcast.

330
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:04,360
Way back when,
way back in 2007 man,

331
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,460
when a guy named George W. Bush was
president and he was a son of a guy,

332
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,110
George Herbert Walker Bush,
and he,

333
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
he was the vice president of a
guy named Ronald Reagan who who,

334
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:15,850
who used to be an actor

335
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,800
mean you fast forward look good thing
about everything that has happened since

336
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,470
I've started since I was 39 years old.
Huh?

337
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,200
Robots are gonna take over the world.
Miami's is going to be under Miami.

338
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,390
Miami's going to be underwater
reality TV show star

339
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,680
became fucking president.

340
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,840
We're still fighting the same fucking war.
That's the one constant.

341
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,810
That's the one thing you can hang
your hat on and be like, oh, okay.

342
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,790
There's something I'm comfortable with.

343
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,490
There's something I'm used to who
says you can never go home. Yeah.

344
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,550
Long was it before I understood that.
I've talked about that before. Right.

345
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,760
When they say you never can go home
with the fuck you talking about a book,

346
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,050
a flight right now and go,
Huh,

347
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,110
I never understood that they meant you're
going to go and it's not gonna be the

348
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:10,160
same people and it's just going to
be overwhelmingly fucking depressing.

349
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,640
Well, anyways, yeah, I'm turning
50 and actually feel good about it.

350
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,530
Ben got 50 push ups the other day. Right.
That means I'm not going to die. Right.

351
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,163
Um,

352
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,870

decade as far as my life,

assholes in my life. Cleaned house,

355
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,380

was a fucking bigger content. Me,

356
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,210

short list. Sorry. Easy joke. What do you,

357
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,240

Huh?

358
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,200
What do you want to have it on a fucking
plane for the last fucking 12 hours? Um,

359
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,340

of experiences and knowledge gaining,

360
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,110

You want to look the best you can,
but you don't want to be.

382
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,240
You don't have to be a pain in the ass.
That's where the black tux comes in.

383
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,083

And you might only wear it once.

389

That's what I love about simply safe.

432
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,160
They obsess over details like
no other home security company.

433
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,990
Here's an example. Simply safe has a
camera you can control from your phone,

434
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,050
but they want to protect
your home and your privacy.

435
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:39,890
So they came up with this brilliant idea
of private shutter for their camera.

436
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,410
Now simply safe wanted you to be
able to hear the shutter. Click. See,

437
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,580
no,
it's closed.

438
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,620
They wanted to have a light on it so you
could easily tell when it's on and they

439
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:54,500
needed to work for the entire
lifespan of the system.

440
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,790
I don't know what I'm talking about
right now. So simply safe. Got To work.

441
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,090
Testing different metals and hinge
designs for months and months.

442
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,820
The result in effective home
security camera with a thin,

443
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,510
lightweight aluminum privacy
shutter that will work every time.

444
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,500
It's the kind of attention to detail that
sets simply safe apart and keeps your

445
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,610
family safe. Simply safe isn't just home
security. It's home security done right.

I don't look like any of these people.
Well that's nice.

539
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,180
That's not really accurate.
I mean they,

540
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,670
they should have at least one really pasty

541
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,980
couple of people of color in
there. And then they got some, no,

542
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:29,450
nobody with blue eyes.

543
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,970
Couple of Simpson's colored
people or Emoji colored now.

544
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,100
Well that's nice.
It's nice that they're doing that.

545
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,480
I better meet who at my
age sends out an Emoji.

546
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,150
Do you know you don't have emojis?

547
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:44,180
I use I all the one that
I used the most thumbs up.

548
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:45,770
Yeah.

549
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,640
Thumbs up. See what I love
about thumbs up is it means, uh,

550
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,430
yes I definitely want to do that.
Or it means like fucking whatever.

551
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,850
We got to get together sometime
man. Hang out, thumbs up,

552
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,070
not fucking hanging out with you.
Right. Or it could be like, fuck yeah,

553
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,630
get out there fucking drank.
Um,

554
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,720
all right. I should have made a top
10 lists of what I could do. What am,

555
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:20,470
what am I going to do here
to make my fifties you know,

556
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,580
the best me
lived your truth.

557
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,090
Do you realize like the amount of shit
that's going on in the world right now.

558
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,133
Okay.

559
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,250
And just to how self involved myself
and club and literally doing a podcast,

560
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:36,730
just talking to myself,
how's fucking self involved?

561
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,530
The world is right now,
you know, live your truth.

562
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,660
Be the best.
You've fifty's the new 40

563
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:53,280
you know, everything has to be
like, I'm on. That's, that's,

564
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,100
that's why you got those fucking assholes
who work out in the garage and then

565
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:00,340
they start running down the
streets. Everybody knows
the crossfit people. Right?

566
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:03,820
Everybody knows they're working out.
It's like we get it, Yo, I work out too.

567
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:07,360
I don't get to fucking start yelling
at people who haven't brunch.

568
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,200
I don't know if you know something that,
that right there,

569
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,030
you remember a few years ago they
decided to do away with bullying.

570
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,250
All right. Which you
know, is a great thing,

571
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,210
but I think you should be able to bully
adults because the fact that that's,

572
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,060
you know, it's not, it's out
of style to bully people.

573
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah.

574
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,590
I think is how crossfit actually exists.
You know,

575
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,620
if you basically categorize any sort
of criticism is bullying, you know,

576
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,590
how do you gonna know when you're acting
like a complete fucking tool shed? I,

577
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,580
I just don't understand.

578
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:46,970
I don't find those crossfit people to
be in any better shape than anybody else

579
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,290
doing any other workout.

580
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,890
And they had just parading up
and down the fucking street.

581
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,600
Like, I don't know what,
like, they're inspirational.

582
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,690
I Dunno. I've never liked, you know,

583
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,560
I don't like people that
do end zone dances. I just
don't like any of that shit.

584
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,580
It's just fucking,
and it's just,

585
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:15,250
it gives me Douche chills to look at
it. I Dunno. Maybe it's a good workout.

586
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,300
I'm going to start doing that,
you know,

587
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,790
through pull ups in my garage and then
run up and down my driveway yelling shit.

588
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,220
So my neighbors know that I just
did a set of 10 fucking pullups.

589
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,450
Yeah. Fill in the pan. Um,

590
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,650
Lebron is Celtic here. Kay has
a question. Hey there, Billy.

591
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,590
Not Quite from Boston. Uh,
what if Lebron went to Boston?

592
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,930
Kind of goes without saying that winning
with Lebron wouldn't feel as good as

593
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,900
winning without Lebron thoughts.

594
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,030
Oh, Jesus Christ. What am I the president?

595
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,210
You just fucking give me a half ass
fucking question. I gotta answer.

596
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,150
I don't know. Yeah, obviously,
obviously I'm a, yeah,

597
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:04,200
I would rather beat Lebron and fucking
have him just joined my team and then

598
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,100
everybody be like, well,
it's a fucking pile on team,

599
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,170
but gives a shit about your
championship. Yeah, obviously.

600
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,550
Thank you, sir. Those are my thoughts.
I have the obvious thought on that. Now.

601
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,670
I don't want that to happen. I would like
us to continue doing what we're doing.

602
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,010
We already signed a big free agent with a,

603
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:24,030
what's his face there that hurt his knee?
Uh,

604
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,390
ginger Vitus what the fuck is
his name? I Dunno. I'm not,

605
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:31,690
I'm on a selfie. I'm not, not a sound
something. I'm just not a basketball guy.

606
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,730
Um, and I missed all the games this
year. All right. I got a kid, man.

607
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,520
I got a kid in. I, I miss a lot of stuff.

608
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,210
The guy with the beard who
thinks the world is flat, right?

609
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,530
Is that the guy that's the guy that
go, I just want to see, you know,

610
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,930
it's like the New York Yankees, New York
Yankees, you know, they, they, they,

611
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,920
they built off of their farm team and
drafting and all that fucking shit.

612
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:58,700
And then they added one that, that's
fucking stud from the Marlin's there.

613
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,960
Can't get mad at that.

614
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,733
MMM.

615
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,390
Wait,
a couple of shrewd trades.

616
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,070
We did give up Isaiah Thomas stuff,
who I swear to God,

617
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,490
if he's still was still with the Celtics,
he would've got his own. He was like,

618
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:18,150
he's going to be a big Papi of the
Celtics a way I love a tail bill.

619
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:22,720
Did you hear this?
Did you hear about this whale?

620
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,560
MMM.

621
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,380
By the way,
has anybody seen that fucking

622
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,100
video, that poor girl calling up
her ex boyfriend crying? It's,

623
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,300
she literally sounds like the
impression me and Paul do when we,

624
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,380
when we do the crying thing,
poo or

625
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,120
she'd be like, hello, I'm
sorry I missed your call.

626
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,320
I really hope you call me back.

627
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,990
I love you and I do want to say
that I love you and I miss you.

628
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,930
[inaudible]

629
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,430
I'm not even,
I'm not even exaggerating.

630
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,290
I'm really sad that I missed your call.

631
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,350
[inaudible]

632
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,290
you fucking unbelievable. All right.

633
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:18,291
Pilot whale dies in Thailand after being
found with 17 pounds of plastic bags

634
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,000
and its stomach.
Yeah.

635
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,330
And also so get excited because
they have fucking ginger emojis.

636
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,423
Oh my God.

637
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,290
This is just what? What
are we, what are we doing?

638
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,890
Oh Man.
A male pilot.

639
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,660
Whales struggled for five days to stay
alive and Thailand near the Malaysian

640
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:43,690
border. I'll tell you, it's fucking crazy,

641
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,370
is those ocean currents of everyone. They
think, oh, it's from their, their plot,

642
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,260
Malaysian plastic bags.
It's probably, you know,

643
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:54,430
from fucking big fives sports in La.
Um,

644
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,960
Thailand near Malaysian
border after rescues found
17 pounds of plastic bags and

645
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,470
its stomach. Yeah, you can't
just eat one. They like Doritos.

646
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,660
The Washington Post reported on a Sunday,

647
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:07,870
but it ultimately succumb to its illness.
The whale died on Friday,

648
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,030
the post road in and I tossed it.

649
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,090
We discovered that Thailand's department
of Marine and coastal resource said,

650
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,360
we're 80 plastic bags
lodged in his stomach.

651
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,150
It's far from the first time whales have
turned up sick or dead from ingesting

652
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:23,984
trash

653
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,940
experts say that the whale likely
believed the bags for food.

654
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,993
Uh,
God.

655
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,760
So what are we gonna do about it?
What is the solution?

656
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,700
Plastic pollution throughout the region
is, okay, wait a minute. Let's see this.

657
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,600
Is there anything positive here?
According to another report by the nation.

658
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,370
A 2015 study by the Ocean Conservatory
and Mckinsey Center for Business and

659
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:58,660
environment found that Thailand was the
world's six worst offender for dumping

660
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,550
plastics into the sea.

661
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:06,420
So who's number one violence pollution
control department says plastic waste is

662
00:43:06,701 --> 00:43:11,290
increasing by roughly 12% annual
with only 25% being reused.

663
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,100
The v,

664
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,460
that's pretty good that we were used 25%
that's better than what we used to do.

665
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:17,560
The vast majority of it is plastic bags.

666
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,000
The Bangkok Post writes that the 23
we're never going to get that shit out of

667
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:26,560
the ocean by the way.
It's like we just switched the cloth bags.

668
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,510
Oh my God,

669
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,010
we are a fucking plague with shoes.

670
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,300
Bill Hicks said that fucking 25 years ago,

671
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,940
the Bangkok Post writes that the 23
coastal provinces in Thailand generate

672
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:49,011
around 11 million tons of garbage
daily at those would be a year of which

673
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:53,070
approximately 1.1 million tons ends
up being dumped directly into the sea.

674
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,780
Plastic pollution throughout the region
is expected to remain a significant

675
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:58,081
issue.

676
00:43:58,081 --> 00:44:02,130
As many Asian countries are experiencing
economic growth that is outpacing waste

677
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:06,120
management infrastructure. Here's the
thing. When the fuck do you put it?

678
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,993
You know what I mean?

679
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,900
I Dunno.
This is when you,

680
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,450
this is when you need hipsters
because they're going to go,

681
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,110
go back to biodegradable shit.

682
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,600
Just trying to be cool, but they're
actually going to create a, hopefully,

683
00:44:25,601 --> 00:44:30,470
I don't know. Oh boy. What
the fuck are we doing?

684
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,850
These fucking corporations,
what are they doing?

685
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,420
Which is all about the fucking money.
They don't give a fuck wars pollution.

686
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:42,090
They don't kill kids.
They don't give a fuck,

687
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,630
and none of these fucking politicians
as a goddamn thing about it.

688
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,240
It's just fucking unreal because they
need the corporations money. It's just,

689
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,950
it's literally, it's like a suicide pact.
How the fuck do you get out of that? Ah,

690
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:59,400
this is the press like the Irish
News. It's depressing. All right.

691
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,140
Massachusetts male mentality.
All right,

692
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,670
here we go. Hey Bill. I'm
excited to be going to show, uh,

693
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,310
your Boston show in the
fall, by the way, man.

694
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,220
I transcribed that fucking Metallica
song and it might double Bass player is

695
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,030
finally coming together.
I've just been sticking with it.

696
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,950
Now of course we're going to be
on the road for a couple of weeks,

697
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,630
but I'll get it back up
to speed. Um, you know,

698
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:29,670
Lars has like these four or five signature
licks and once you get those things

699
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:33,720
down you can kind of do a real
shitty version of all of their songs.

700
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,050
I still suck, but like I can actually see
I'm starting to be able to play along.

701
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,820
Um, I can definitely do like the 16th
note thing, but he does that little,

702
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,950
that triplet before the snare with a
crash, uh, China that he always does

703
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,680
that. Yeah, that one's a little
tough. Uh, love your podcast.

704
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,390
It's one of the things that
keeps me saying. All right,

705
00:45:54,391 --> 00:45:57,990
I appreciate when you say positive things
about your relationship with your wife

706
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,570
and now you're so glad
to be on the other side.

707
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,380
I'm a 42 year old single female and
it's downright depressing around here.

708
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,560
I've been married so don't
need to do that again.

709
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,490
We just like to meet someone who wants
a steady monogamous relationship.

710
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,571
Unfortunately,

711
00:46:12,571 --> 00:46:17,571
the guys around here seem to obtain their
intimacy from their relationship with

712
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:23,880
their male friends. Women are
viewed as an afterthought at best,

713
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,680
but usually as a nuisance or a threat or
you're in Massachusetts. I, this is easy.

714
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,780
It's an easy fix.
Get into sports,

715
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,780
get into sports,
start watching sports,

716
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,550
increase your alcohol intake and your
guy will be your best friend you ever had

717
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,690
a, why do guys have a mob
mentality when it comes to women?

718
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,170
They seem to think it's
giving up to settle down,

719
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,220
but don't they fear being
alone later in life?

720
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,660
Why grown men care what their friends
think and why wouldn't they be happy?

721
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,400
They are. Boy is living with
living a fulfilling life.

722
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,350
I'm cute in decent shape.

723
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,050
I'd say I'm a seven and a half in the
looks department and you're humble and

724
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:13,590
being serious. Yeah, decent
shape. You know, you're
honest. Have a fun personality,

725
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:17,130
can support myself.
I don't care about having kids,

726
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,940
but the schmucks I've been dealing
with lately make me feel like giving up

727
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,430
altogether and another mystery to solve.

728
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,550
Why do my friends and I
frequently see good looking?

729
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,230
Why do my friends and I pregnancy
good looking guys with women who look

730
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,093
miserable?

731
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,160
If you would mind taking a few minutes
to wax philosophical on the benefits of

732
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:41,080
relationship with the opposite sex,
that would be great.

733
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,250
Happy Birthday from a fellow
Gemini. Um, all right.

734
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,750
Why they got wire guys afraid
to settle down? Well, uh,

735
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,900
because women take guys for everything
they've got in divorce court all the

736
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,810
fucking time.
All right.

737
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,680
And like there's only so many of
those fucking nightmares that you can,

738
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,450
you can watch, um, before you're like,

739
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,700
why the fuck would I want to do that?
I mean,

740
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,250
that was my attitudes for
the longest God damn time.

741
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,540
And um,
when you get into a relationship,

742
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:21,541
a lot of times you are at the
mercy of the females moods

743
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,450
and you know, there's, you know,

744
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:28,090
there's all this shit out here right now
talking about all this shit that guy's

745
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,670
do to women. All this horrible
shit, but, uh, I went and
put the, you know, the winds,

746
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,710
the turn and pull back a little
bit and talk about, you know,

747
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:41,320
just this constant fucking like,
you know,

748
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:46,270
keeping you on eggshells. You
know, keep it happy, keep it happy,

749
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:50,170
keep her happy, you know, that happy,
happy wife. Happy life is what they say.

750
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,490
There's no rhyme for the
debt. There isn't. So,

751
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:00,250
you know, and everything is about
you guys. I'm just being honest.

752
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,570
You know the weddings all about you.
Valentine's Day is all about you,

753
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,440
the anniversaries, all about you. It's all
the guy. What are you going to get her?

754
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,333
And it's like,

755
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,500
it's all geared that you are so fucking
privileged and lucky to have this person,

756
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,690
but there's really not that sort
of reciprocal mentality. So,

757
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,650
um, but when you're a single guy, you
know, you got the world by the balls,

758
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,880
we make more, more money an
hour at dairy queen evidently,

759
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:32,080
or whatever the fuck it is that you guys
are saying. It's happens in, you know,

760
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,140
you hang out, you watch sports, you go
down in the bar, you talk some shit.

761
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,780
Maybe get laid, get up fucking blow
job, and you wake up the next day,

762
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:41,290
not in a relationship that's
really appealing and you
still have all your money

763
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,190
or a lot of it, it's appealing. Um,

764
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,890
I would also, you know, so I
don't know. I'm not, I'm not,

765
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,450
I know you want me to
say something positive.

766
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:56,050
I'm just answering that first thing.
Um,

767
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,410
you guys are terrifying and you act like
you're not when you're talking to men,

768
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:06,520
but amongst yourselves,
you know, amongst yourself.

769
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,520
I'm sure you're a little more
honest about like, you know,

770
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:17,380
the sanity of, uh, you know,

771
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:24,210
so many women out there. Yes. There's
just fucking nuts. The fuck them.

772
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,560
They'll get pregnant on purpose.
I mean, that they're fucking,

773
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:28,850
they'll bring a into the fucking world.
I mean,

774
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,700
crazy fucking crazy.

775
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,983
MMM.

776
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,920
God, I got to try to see something
positive here. Jesus Christ. Uh,

777
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,680
why you haven't Prob, well, you know,
you're also like, you're like me.

778
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:45,180
You waited a while.

779
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,283
MMM.

780
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,680
All those people that are like want
to find love and all that. You know,

781
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:55,250
you got a draft in the earlier
rounds when you're in your 20s,

782
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,570
there was a bunch of blue chip
prospects there. Now you're in your 42.

783
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,930
You got to try to find your
six round draft. Tom Brady,

784
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,310
that's what you have to do. So
it's going to be more work. Um,

785
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,500
but I somehow pulled it off.

786
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,113
MMM.

787
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,780
Grant, but I was 35. She was 25.

788
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,153
I Dunno,

789
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,160
I moved up in the draft. That's what I
did. Maybe you want to date a younger guy.

790
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,600
I Dunno, but I always looked at it this
way that you know, you're, you know,

791
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,250
if you're out there and you
seem cool, you're out there,
there's going to be your,

792
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:33,820
your match is going to be out there.
But like it's,

793
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,880
it's dangerous as I just trashed women
to go down that road to say they're all

794
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:43,310
like this or why do so many
people, blah, blah, blah.

795
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,020
You start getting fucking jaded.

796
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,200
And the reality is you could
do that about anything.

797
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:50,030
Why are most people fucking inconsiderate?

798
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:54,140
Why are most people fucking morons white?
Most people stand in a security line.

799
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:57,080
At the airport, rolling their eyes,
looking at you bonding at like,

800
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:58,550
can you believe how long this is taking?

801
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,270
And then they do nothing to be
prepared for when it's their time,

802
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,190
when it's show time,

803
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,010
they just start to take the fucking belt
off and all that and they become the

804
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:10,940
fucking problem. They don't notice it.
Okay. That's why I'm meeting somebody.

805
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,180
Awesome. It's so fucking special cause
there's not a lot of them out there.

806
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:18,770
So you hang in there and I think you're
going to find the person that wants to

807
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:20,390
have the relationship you want,
that you want.

808
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:26,050
And I think the relationship you're
looking for is what a lot of guys are

809
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:29,660
probably looking for around your age.
Right.

810
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,470
If I was you,
I'd get a divorce seat.

811
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,190
They're already had his fucking
kids already did that bullshit.

812
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,620
And then he can just fucking,
you know, hang with you.

813
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,920
You're not looking to get married and
you're looking at have any fucking kids

814
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:45,920
you can just fucking hang out and drink.
Cape Cod is and watch the pets.

815
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,050
Then you go bang, Bang,
boom. I solve your problem.

816
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,540
Probably not.
A wife wants to use my computer.

817
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,380
Oh Jesus. What? He got a bunch of
porn on there. Hey, Billy Bob Burton.

818
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,360
I've been with my girl for five years
and married for one and I refuse to let

819
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:10,280
her use my computer isn't because of porn
or cheating is because my PC is worth

820
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:11,750
close to 20 grand.

821
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:18,910
I used to work for graphic
designer animator and gaming a.

822
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:23,000
I didn't know they made laptops worth
that much. I even had it set up.

823
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,750
So I am not.
So if I'm not within three feet of it,

824
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,970
it is locked.

825
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:34,030
I have a piece of jewelry with an RF ID
chip that unlocks my PC when I'm near

826
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,970
it. Well, I got news for you.
Do it. Anybody who wants,

827
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:42,400
who knows anything about computers
can turn that fucking thing on from a

828
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:45,440
different computer when they're not even
in the fucking room. I guarantee, uh,

829
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:49,090
I told her even before we were married
that she will never use my computer.

830
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,410
She has never had a phone that wasn't
cracked or broken in the last time she

831
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:57,820
brought up my computer, I bought her
a thousand dollars PC of her own,

832
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,680
which she lost within a week.
Am I being too unreasonable or am I right?

833
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,240
Not Wanting to ruin my computer. Do
you let Nia use your computer? Uh,

834
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,190
yes I do, but like my computer's a fucking
mess. Um, no, I don't think, you know,

835
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:17,140
she hasn't demonstrated that she is,
you can take care of shit.

836
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,360
Here's the thing. If she, if she
was saying you couldn't use hers,

837
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,230
if my wife was like, you can't use
my computer, this is super expensive.

838
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:29,080
I do graphic designer ivy.
I don't want to use your fucking computer.

839
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,510
I hate computers. Have Fun with
your computer, you know, but um,

840
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,193
you know,

841
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,150
it probably makes her insecure because
that is where porn and cheating and all

842
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:46,170
that shit fucking happens.
So I'm choosing to believe you when this,

843
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,850
if you're not doing that shit,

844
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:53,640
and if it truly is because you have
this awesome fucking $20,000 fucking

845
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:54,474
computer,

846
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,493
uh,

847
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,780
then yeah, I, I don't, I don't
know what the problem is.

848
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,220
I would just sit there. You know what
I would do? I would take her phone.

849
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,980
Yeah. I would open my laptop and then
I'd have her phone right next to it,

850
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,700
you know, with the cracked screen. I go,
look at your phone, look at my computer.

851
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,480
What's the difference? Oh, get your PC
to honey. Oh, that's right. You lost it.

852
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,590
You lost it. That's right.
So now what have we learned
here? And this is the thing.

853
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,730
Let her get mad.

854
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:32,560
She's going to fucking storm away and
be all fucking mad. And then once again,

855
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:35,770
like I was talking about in that
previous one, she's gonna, you know,

856
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,970
do that whole thing where I'm, you know,
I'm saying the cal Dunnigan are mad at.

857
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:41,350
Yeah.
Um,

858
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,313
yeah,

859
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,580
she's just going to do that shit.
And you know what letter

860
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,420
you just, you just, you said
over that power all you want.

861
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,200
You know I'm right, and then
they'll get mad. They'll,

862
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,750
they'll switch out of the pouty thing.
Then they get fucking mad.

863
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:03,740
It's a whole goddamn process.
Just be like, no, you can't. You.

864
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:08,710
I would hold my ground on that one.
Just say, listen. Over the next year,

865
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:13,330
if you demonstrate that you can actually
be around computers without breaking

866
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:16,090
them or losing them,
you know,

867
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,180
maybe in 12 months I'll let
you look over my shoulder.

868
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,393
Yeah,

869
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,980
just tell her that's not how life works.

870
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,930
You have to earn things. All
right? Most of us do anyways,

871
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,360
but you wouldn't know that. Listen to
all these fucking feminists out there.

872
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:37,540
I think if you're a guy, you just
fucking show up. People give you shit.

873
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:42,850
I'm so hoping it becomes a level
playing field. I can't wait.

874
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,810
I cannot wait. That's going to be
the greatest fucking thing ever.

875
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,860
When they realize what a giant shit
sandwich, they still have to eat.

876
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,110
Oh, it looked appetizing when
you were peeking over the fence,

877
00:56:56,111 --> 00:57:00,520
didn't it sweetheart? All
right, that's it. Everybody.
That's the podcast here. Uh,

878
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,810
thank you to everybody over here in
Ireland. Even before I do the show.

879
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,660
Thank you for everybody for a buying
tickets to come out to the show.

880
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:12,120
It's an honor and a privilege to be here
and you beautiful and reliable. And uh,

881
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:16,300
I hope we give you monies worth tomorrow
night. Uh, go capitols and eight.

882
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:20,230
I also like the Vegas Knights to their
coach gave a speech or something,

883
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,730
but GM at the beginning of the year
and an expansion franchise if you don't

884
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:26,020
watch hockey.
And he said,

885
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,710
all you guys in this locker room
are here for the exact same reason.

886
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,970
The last team you played for didn't think
you are worth being protected me right

887
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,960
there. They got the chip on their shoulder
and they'd been fucking mowing every,

888
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,070
everybody, everybody down ever since until
they ran into the Washington capitals.

889
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,880
Um, I'm going to try to find a
way to somehow watch that game,

890
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,820
although I think tonight comes
on at like two in the morning,

891
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:49,810
so I might be fucked.

892
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,733
MMM.

893
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,640
And I dunno if I can't,
I can't watch the fucking NBA

894
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:02,210
Huda fuck reviews a charging call.
The final few.

895
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:06,650
I've never seen that before.
My fuck. Oh my God. You know,

896
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:09,050
but thank God they did.
Thank God they did because I was able to,

897
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:12,650
I didn't have to waste time watching the
rest of the fucking game. And then I,

898
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:13,680
you know, I, you know,

899
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,500
went for a nice brisk
walk is good for my hat.

900
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,670
Um, that's it. Guess what
people were into June,

901
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,360
which means we are only two months
away from the start of football season

902
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,480
preseason just like that. It's coming
around again and the God knows the way.

903
00:58:32,481 --> 00:58:35,510
There's like four days off
between every fucking NBA game.

904
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,450
You're probably just going
to have to do a, you know,

905
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,930
the last week of June and July and
then you're going to be right there and

906
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,610
you're going to be right there.
Although I've gotten back into baseball,

907
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,060
some back corner that giants game and
keeping score, eating the peanuts,

908
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:54,700
drinking that pocket course.
I liked it. You know,

909
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,640
I went down and bought some cigars
the other day. Right? Oh, Bill. Yeah.

910
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,470
Eat French fries, you smoking cigars
and drinking beer, what are you doing?

911
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,530
But joy myself,
um,

912
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:07,690
I walked into this cigar shop and I can
be honest with, and I walked in there,

913
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,800
you know, it's also a lounge
where people could smoke and shit.

914
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,920
And I have never seen anybody smoking a
cigar who did not look like they would

915
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:19,740
just totally fucking relaxed.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

916
00:59:19,741 --> 00:59:24,530
In heaven, you know, like true
cigar smokers. I walk in no time.

917
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,360
I walk in, I have to go look
at that guy just sitting there

918
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,620
because I always have shit to do. So I
run in and I buy them and then I run out.

919
00:59:30,621 --> 00:59:32,720
But I would see people just sitting
there and I think that's what the,

920
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,260
that's how you do it. Come down
in the middle of the day, honey,

921
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:40,840
I'm going out for a minute. Where
are you going? Not your person is.

922
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,650
Who is she? Her name is low. Uh,

923
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,000
Aurora emeralds. Lao, Aurora, Emerald.

924
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,950
All right, that's it. Everybody.

925
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:56,310
I will see you tomorrow night if
you're here in Dublin. If not,

926
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,410
I'll check it on your,
on Thursday.
