to this interview I'd like to start by

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040
to this interview I'd like to start by
 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.570
to this interview I'd like to start by
just exploring a few general themes when

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
just exploring a few general themes when
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.940

I say the word mentorship what does that

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950
I say the word mentorship what does that

conjure up for me it was very important

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
conjure up for me it was very important
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050
conjure up for me it was very important
in particular because in my case at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
in particular because in my case at
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240
in particular because in my case at
least I share the prize with my own

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
least I share the prize with my own
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.729
least I share the prize with my own
supervisor and so it means a lot I was

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
supervisor and so it means a lot I was
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.900
supervisor and so it means a lot I was
lucky to have an excellent mentor and I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
lucky to have an excellent mentor and I
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.870
lucky to have an excellent mentor and I
don't know if the word luck is proper

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880
don't know if the word luck is proper
 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.960
don't know if the word luck is proper
here because I picked him by purpose but

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970
here because I picked him by purpose but
 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.360
here because I picked him by purpose but
because I knew that one day both of us

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
because I knew that one day both of us
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.860
because I knew that one day both of us
are going to show the Nobel Prize but I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
are going to show the Nobel Prize but I
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.920
are going to show the Nobel Prize but I
really searched around and I had the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
really searched around and I had the
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.709
really searched around and I had the
privilege of searching around because I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
privilege of searching around because I
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.450

physician and I had my own career
basically paved or at least I could see

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
basically paved or at least I could see
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.059
basically paved or at least I could see
where I'm heading and but then I decided

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069
where I'm heading and but then I decided
 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.289
where I'm heading and but then I decided
to change direction and to go to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
to change direction and to go to
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179
to change direction and to go to
research I did it already in medical

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
research I did it already in medical
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.620
research I did it already in medical
school but then I went back to medicine

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
school but then I went back to medicine
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.629
school but then I went back to medicine
and I kind of flick back and forth back

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639
and I kind of flick back and forth back
 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.809
and I kind of flick back and forth back
and forth and I haven't made my mind yet

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819
and forth and I haven't made my mind yet
 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.069
and forth and I haven't made my mind yet
and then I decided nevertheless try

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079
and then I decided nevertheless try
 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.059
and then I decided nevertheless try
science and I went around and explore

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069
science and I went around and explore
 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.859
science and I went around and explore
the possibilities with several potential

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
the possibilities with several potential
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.029
the possibilities with several potential
mentors and each of them was very clear

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039
mentors and each of them was very clear
 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.789
mentors and each of them was very clear
about his ideas I mean let's do that and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
about his ideas I mean let's do that and
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.769
about his ideas I mean let's do that and
that's the debt and I did that and you

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779
that's the debt and I did that and you
 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.649
that's the debt and I did that and you
know whatever is left here and Avram was

the young investigator just came back
 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.510
the young investigator just came back
from a postdoctoral fellowship I mean he

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
from a postdoctoral fellowship I mean he
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.199
from a postdoctoral fellowship I mean he
himself and there he started to work on

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209
himself and there he started to work on
 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.089

high-energy compounds and degrade them

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789
high-energy compounds and degrade them
 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.399
high-energy compounds and degrade them
into low energy ingredients which are

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
into low energy ingredients which are
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.609
into low energy ingredients which are
amino acids and Adam told me I don't

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
amino acids and Adam told me I don't
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.750
amino acids and Adam told me I don't
know what I'm going to do all I know

know what I'm going to do all I know
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.250
know what I'm going to do all I know
that I want to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
that I want to
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.770
that I want to
identify the system that degrades

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
identify the system that degrades
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.110

don't know how it's going to look like
 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.809
don't know how it's going to look like
so he had some ideas and for me I said

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819
so he had some ideas and for me I said
 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.399
so he had some ideas and for me I said
wow that's wonderful this risky way and

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409
wow that's wonderful this risky way and
 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.220
wow that's wonderful this risky way and
I said let's take it for 23 years and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230
I said let's take it for 23 years and
 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.979
I said let's take it for 23 years and
see you know if we are going to bump the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
see you know if we are going to bump the
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.809
see you know if we are going to bump the
wall I'll go back to the o.r to the

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819
wall I'll go back to the o.r to the
 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.970

operation theatre I had in my mind to be
 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.000
operation theatre I had in my mind to be
a surgeon and if I get excited if even

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
a surgeon and if I get excited if even
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220
a surgeon and if I get excited if even
if we don't get results i mean if i get

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
if we don't get results i mean if i get
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.190
if we don't get results i mean if i get
excited about it I stay and it was

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
excited about it I stay and it was

wonderful labrum is an excellent
 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.580
wonderful labrum is an excellent
biochemist and after a short time we

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
biochemist and after a short time we
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.520
biochemist and after a short time we
realized that we have something very

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530
realized that we have something very
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.589
realized that we have something very
unusual at hands and and then it

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599
unusual at hands and and then it
 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.500
unusual at hands and and then it
continued I learned a lot from him but

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
continued I learned a lot from him but

you know it was kind of a dialogue of an

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
you know it was kind of a dialogue of an
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.539
you know it was kind of a dialogue of an
active dialogue I thought that good

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549
active dialogue I thought that good
 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.789
