00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.730
In this course, you'll learn to use Git, which is a version control system, and

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.610
GitHub, a code sharing and collaboration platform.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.430
You'll need to use a Unix-style command line, so if you haven't used that

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.210
before, then check out one of the tutorials in the instructor's notes.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.440
You'll also be looking at some code in this course, so experience reading and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.000
writing code will be useful, but

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.489
it doesn't matter which particular programming languages you know.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.220
To give you a better sense of what you'll learn if

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.170
you stick with us through this course, here's the rough breakdown.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.610
We'll have three lessons.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.260
In this first lesson, we'll focus on how version control can be useful and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.270
what different forms it might take.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.570
You'll also install Git and start using it to explore some existing code.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.940
Then, in lesson two, you'll learn more about Git and start using it on your own.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200
Finally, in lesson three, you'll get some practice sharing code and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.520
collaborating with others using GitHub.
