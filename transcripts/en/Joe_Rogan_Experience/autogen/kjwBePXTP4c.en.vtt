let's<00:03:03.360><c> think</c><00:03:03.480><c> about</c><00:03:03.600><c> crack</c><00:03:03.900><c> let</c><00:03:04.140><c> me</c><00:03:04.200><c> not</c><00:03:04.350><c> not</c>

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
let's think about crack let me not not
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.590 align:start position:0%
let's think about crack let me not not
here<00:03:04.709><c> on</c><00:03:04.800><c> rather</c><00:03:04.980><c> how</c><00:03:05.760><c> to</c><00:03:05.820><c> conquer</c><00:03:06.120><c> powder</c>

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
here on rather how to conquer powder
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
here on rather how to conquer powder
yeah<00:03:06.810><c> let's</c><00:03:06.989><c> think</c><00:03:07.110><c> about</c><00:03:07.260><c> crack</c><00:03:07.530><c> cocaine</c><00:03:07.709><c> and</c>

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 align:start position:0%
yeah let's think about crack cocaine and
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.050 align:start position:0%
yeah let's think about crack cocaine and
powder<00:03:08.070><c> cocaine</c><00:03:08.520><c> let's</c><00:03:08.700><c> just</c><00:03:08.880><c> think</c><00:03:08.940><c> about</c>

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
powder cocaine let's just think about
 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.940 align:start position:0%
powder cocaine let's just think about
the<00:03:09.239><c> chemical</c><00:03:09.390><c> structure</c><00:03:10.080><c> the</c><00:03:10.680><c> only</c>

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 align:start position:0%
the chemical structure the only
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
the chemical structure the only

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 align:start position:0%
difference between crack cocaine and
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
difference between crack cocaine and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 align:start position:0%
powder cocaine is that the powder
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.380 align:start position:0%
powder cocaine is that the powder
cocaine<00:03:14.280><c> has</c><00:03:14.550><c> this</c><00:03:14.790><c> thing</c><00:03:15.000><c> called</c><00:03:15.060><c> the</c>

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 align:start position:0%
cocaine has this thing called the
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.570 align:start position:0%
cocaine has this thing called the
hydrochloride<00:03:15.989><c> salt</c><00:03:16.170><c> attached</c><00:03:16.980><c> to</c><00:03:17.250><c> it</c><00:03:17.430><c> that</c>

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
hydrochloride salt attached to it that
 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
hydrochloride salt attached to it that
salt<00:03:18.390><c> prevents</c><00:03:18.900><c> it</c><00:03:19.019><c> from</c><00:03:19.170><c> being</c><00:03:19.410><c> smoked</c>

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 align:start position:0%
salt prevents it from being smoked
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.340 align:start position:0%
salt prevents it from being smoked
now<00:03:20.549><c> you</c><00:03:20.610><c> can</c><00:03:20.970><c> dissolve</c><00:03:21.330><c> the</c><00:03:21.690><c> powder</c><00:03:21.900><c> cocaine</c>

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 align:start position:0%
now you can dissolve the powder cocaine
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.770 align:start position:0%
now you can dissolve the powder cocaine
and<00:03:22.680><c> in</c><00:03:23.130><c> water</c><00:03:23.430><c> and</c><00:03:23.730><c> in</c><00:03:23.850><c> shooting</c><00:03:24.209><c> in</c><00:03:24.330><c> your</c><00:03:24.510><c> arm</c>

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
and in water and in shooting in your arm
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410 align:start position:0%
and in water and in shooting in your arm
and<00:03:25.110><c> so</c><00:03:26.040><c> you</c><00:03:26.100><c> have</c><00:03:26.400><c> the</c><00:03:26.580><c> effects</c><00:03:26.910><c> of</c><00:03:27.030><c> cocaine</c>

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
and so you have the effects of cocaine
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.350 align:start position:0%
and so you have the effects of cocaine
the<00:03:28.140><c> onset</c><00:03:28.950><c> of</c><00:03:28.980><c> the</c><00:03:29.220><c> effects</c><00:03:29.549><c> within</c><00:03:29.880><c> seconds</c>

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
the onset of the effects within seconds
 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.229 align:start position:0%
the onset of the effects within seconds

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
the same is true with crack cocaine the
 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
the same is true with crack cocaine the
effects<00:03:33.510><c> are</c><00:03:33.720><c> onset</c><00:03:34.500><c> of</c><00:03:34.590><c> a</c><00:03:34.680><c> sex</c><00:03:34.890><c> effects</c><00:03:35.580><c> are</c>

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 align:start position:0%
effects are onset of a sex effects are
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
