00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.730
I you know I I'd be guessing to answer

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
I you know I I'd be guessing to answer
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.140
I you know I I'd be guessing to answer
that question and um it's a confluence

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
that question and um it's a confluence
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.050
that question and um it's a confluence
of a bunch of things I mean first off I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
of a bunch of things I mean first off I
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.010
of a bunch of things I mean first off I
guess is that we we like fads I mean we

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
guess is that we we like fads I mean we
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780
guess is that we we like fads I mean we
like trends so here's one that hadn't

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
like trends so here's one that hadn't
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660
like trends so here's one that hadn't
been fully exploited secondly food

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
been fully exploited secondly food
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.440
been fully exploited secondly food
television really had it has had a huge

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
television really had it has had a huge
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.720
television really had it has had a huge
impact I mean cooking and eating as a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730
impact I mean cooking and eating as a
 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.330

spectator sport never before in history
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940
spectator sport never before in history
so that's had a huge impact third I

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
so that's had a huge impact third I
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.360
so that's had a huge impact third I
think is the kind of

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370
think is the kind of
 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.620
think is the kind of
internationalization of food people not

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
internationalization of food people not
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510

unprecedented numbers so I think you
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.130
unprecedented numbers so I think you
know I guess the short answer is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.090
know I guess the short answer is
exposure but it still doesn't explain

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100
