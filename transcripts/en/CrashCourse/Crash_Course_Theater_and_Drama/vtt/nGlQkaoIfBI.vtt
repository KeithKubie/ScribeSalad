00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.679
Hey there.

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:08.130
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today is going to be a tragedy.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.370
A Greek tragedy.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.980
Which is a lot like a regular tragedy, only
older and with more stuffed grape leaves.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.710
We’ll be exploring Aristotle’s theories
on this artform, written more than a century

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.740
after the golden age of Athenian drama.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.190
Then we’ll apply them retrospectively to
the only surviving tragic trilogy we have,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.250
the “Oresteia” of Aeschylus.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.280
Get ready for some husband-killing, some mother-killing
and, maybe unsurprisingly, the invention of

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.000
the jury trial!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.850
INTRO
Meet Aristotle.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.850
Just Aristotle.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.850
No last name.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
Like Cher!

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.850
But older.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.890
Also believes in life after love, though!

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.140
He was born in 384 BCE and lived in Greece
and Macedonia.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.840
He spent many years studying with Plato, a
philosopher who wasn’t a big fan of drama

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.840
or poetry.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.740
Plato wrote that poets encourage a false vision
of reality and should all be excluded from

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.150
the ideal state.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.150
Wow.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.150
Harsh, dude.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.670
Luckily for us his pupil Aristotle was more
open-minded.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.690
In 335 BCE, a little while after he’d finished
tutoring Alexander the Great, Aristotle sat

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.130
down to write The Poetics, the first substantial
work of literary criticism.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.210
Originally The Poetics was in two parts, a
section on tragedy and a section on comedy,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330
but only the tragedy part survives.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.960
Aristotle was writing 200 years after the
City Dionysia really got going and 150 years

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.260
after the beginning of the golden age of Greek
drama.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.650
So the Poetics isn’t really about analyzing
contemporary work, it’s about looking at

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.360
the work that came before Aristotle, deciding
what’s great about it, and providing a handbook

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.590
for future playwrights and audiences.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.880
Aristotle was trying to stick it to Plato
by proving poetry (and theatre) could be useful

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.050
to society.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.209
He was a big fan of Sophocles and the rules
Aristotle set out apply most closely to Sophocles’s

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.840
own “Oedipus Rex”, which you might remember
from Crash Course Literature.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.239
Club foot, murder, incest, stabbing out the
eyes—it’s memorable stuff.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.510
But Aristotle’s theories apply, in many
ways, to all of the works of Greek tragedy.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.050
And often, we can gain a lot of insight through
how ancient plays do or do not tick the boxes

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.739
that Aristotle set up.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.280
And in fact, Aristotle’s theories continue
to influence how we write and think about

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280
modern plays.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.870
First off, the tragedy portion of Aristotle’s
Poetics considers several forms of poetry,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.740
including the tragedy, and the epic, which
is different in that it’s mostly descriptive,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.400
rather than imitative.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.370
It tells rather than shows, like the dithyrambs
we discussed last episode.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.370
But!

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.580
We’re here to talk tragedy which, Aristotle
defines as:

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.780
“An imitation of an action that is serious,
complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.780
embellished with each kind of artistic ornament,
the several kinds being found in separate

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.209
parts of the play; in the form of action,
not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.500
the proper purgation of these emotions.”

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.640
So, Okay, a lot of this language is ambiguous,
but there are some conclusions we can draw.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.800
We’re gonna go bit by bit: What does serious
mean?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.040
Well, there probably aren’t a lot of satyrs
and phalluses.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040
Complete?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.060
Each play in a tragedy has to stand independent
from other works in its trilogy.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.840
That’s lucky for us because as we discussed
last time, invading .hordes have a bad habit

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.870
of burning libraries and we’ve lost a lot
of plays.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.120
Of a certain magnitude?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.599
That’s trickier, but if you read Greek tragedies
you’ll notice they deal with legendary heroes

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.319
or royal families, characters whose lives
will have a sizable impact.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.010
Also their difficulties are not minor—these
are stories about murder, vengeance, betrayal…

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.970
again: memorable stuff!

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.770
By language embellished, Aristotle means not
only poetry, but also song.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.770
In the form of action, not of narrative, means
showing rather than telling.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.770
And through pity and fear effecting the proper
purgation of those emotions - that’s catharsis,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.389
and as we suggested last episode, it’s kept
scholars fearful and pitious for centuries.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.139
We offered one explanation last time, that
plays help make people better citizens by

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.669
purging them of emotions unhelpful to the
city-state—you have a good cry at the theater

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.580
so that you’re not crying when it comes
to making political decisions.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.589
But scholars have argued that this catharsis
is actually supposed to happen for the characters

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:45.110
onstage; there’s been a lot of debate about
whether the goal of catharsis is an emotional

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.919
purgation or an intellectual clarification.

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.809
Is catharsis supposed to awaken your emotions,
or trigger some deeply rational thoughts?

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.080
Shockingly: EXPERTS DISAGREE.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.199
Aristotle also said tragedy is composed of
six parts: Plot, Character, Diction, Thought,

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.810
Spectacle, and Song.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.180
They’re important pretty much in that order,
although he says that song matters more than

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.180
spectacle.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.210
Take that, projection designers.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.210
Wait…

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.860
I’ve designed projections!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.509
You don’t want too much spectacle he says,
because that’s cheap and tragedy should

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.690
be enjoyable, but not, like, too enjoyable.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.839
And Aristotle argues that even though it’s
characters we care about, it’s actually

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.520
the plot—the tragic action—that’s most
important.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.879
You could have a character just like Oedipus,
for instance, who doesn’t kill his father

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.259
or marry his mother, but … well, that’s
not really much of a tragedy.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.720
Aristotle believes that in order for a tragedy
to really work, it needs to focus on a mostly

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.039
good character who–through the tragic action–is
then brought low.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:56.199
If you have a mostly bad character brought
low: Big whoop, they had it coming, no tragedy.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:01.599
Same goes for a mostly good character who
stays good: No pity, no fear, no catharsis.

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.520
An unimpeachably good character brought low
doesn’t work either, because the tragic

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.189
action has to be their fault, at least a little.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:15.050
Aristotle writes that the ideal is to have
a mostly noble and illustrious character “whose

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.710
misfortune is brought about not by vice or
depravity, but by some error or frailty.”

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.699
The word for frailty in Greek is hamartia.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.229
It’s a term that comes from archery and
it means missing the mark.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:34.499
Our tragic character doesn’t have some horrible
inborn flaw, but more like ... tries to do

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:37.180
a good job, and whiffs it.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.419
Aristotle thought that a tragic plot needed
to have three main elements: reversal, recognition

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:43.900
and a scene of suffering.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.999
The Greek word for reversal is peripeteia;
you might recognize it from the English word

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:51.599
peripatetic, which means walking back and
forth.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.449
Reversal means just when you think something’s
going okay, there’s a change, usually signaled

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.400
by the arrival of a messenger, and then everything
gets terrible again.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.569
Someone’s gotta start shooting these messengers!

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:09.839
Recognition, known as anagnorisis, is what
happens when a character finally recognizes

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.839
something.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.839
That was my mother!

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:12.839
That was my son!

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.439
I shouldn’t have eaten that second piece
of cake!

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.439
Oops.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.029
Recognition combined with a reversal is best,
Aristotle says: it automatically produces

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.560
pity or fear.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.659
Maybe both!

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:29.830
Shortly after recognition comes the scene
of suffering—exile, suicide, huge psychological

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.830
trauma.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.830
It’s fun stuff?

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.039
And just the kind of thing a healthy city-state
would want to sponsor for the good of its

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.039
people!

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.300
To get a feel for some of these elements,
let’s take a quick look at “The Oresteia,”

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.379
the only surviving Greek tragic trilogy, which
won first prize in 458 BCE.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:51.319
It retells a mythical story, one covered,
at least in part in “The Odyssey.”

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:55.929
Its three plays are: Agamemnon, The Libation
Bearers and The Eumenides.

00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:58.970
We’ll look at the first two in the Thoughtbubble:
Thoughtbubble

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.490
In the first play, the general Agamemnon returns
to Argos from the Trojan War.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.979
His wife, Clytemnestra, only pretends to greet
him happily.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:09.360
Why is she mad?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.972
Because he sacrificed their daughter to make
some winds blow, that’s why.

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:12.972
(Does that sound like a similar plot point
from an episode of Game of Thrones?

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:13.972
That show steals from the best!).

00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:17.569
To make matters worse, Agamemnon has brought
home his concubine, Cassandra.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:23.300
Clytemnestra’s lover, Aegisthus, is also
ticked because–get ready–his father, once

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.089
king, raped his daughter because an oracle
said an incest son would get revenge on his

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:31.899
uncle who tricked his father into eating his
now deceased half siblings.

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:36.640
His sister-mom, ashamed, disowns him so he's
gotta work his way from GOAT FARMER back up

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.979
to royalty, which he DOES, but then is ousted
by Meneleaus who installs ... AGAMEMNON as

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:43.979
king.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.430
So, long story medium-short, Clytemnestra
convinces Agamemnon to walk all on some TAPESTRIES,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.490
which is a sacrilegious act, a sign that he's
prideful–which he sorta is–thus by ancient

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.250
tradition justifying his murder.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.089
In some versions Aegisthus kills Agamemnon,
in others it’s Clytemnestra, but either

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:01.269
way he gets it ... in the bath no less!

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:03.770
In the second play, things go bad in Argos.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.680
Electra, Agamemnon and Clytemnestra’s daughter,
is miserable.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.550
Orestes, her brother, arrives in disguise
and together they plot to murder their mother.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.639
Which is usually frowned upon, but the chorus
is all: Right.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.639
On.

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:23.940
So, giving into their worst impulses, they
kill Clytemnestra and Aegisthus.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.110
Just when it seems like things might get back
to normal, the furies, aka the Erinyes arrive.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.810
The furies are scary snake-haired women who
terrorize you when you’ve spilled family

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.810
blood.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.709
They chase Orestes out of the palace.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:41.920
Thanks Thoughtbubble, but the tragedy doesn’t
stop there.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.600
In the third play, Orestes seeks shelter with
the god Apollo, then heads to Athens.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.839
He appeals to the goddess Athena and she arranges
a trial for him, drafting twelve citizens

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.839
for the jury.

00:09:54.839 --> 00:10:01.550
Orestes and the furies present their cases,
the jury deadlocks, and Athena acts as tiebreaker.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:06.129
The case comes down to whether it’s worse
to kill a mother or a husband.

00:10:06.129 --> 00:10:11.000
Apollo argues that mothers aren’t really
parents, they’re just hosts for the father’s

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
seed.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.160
I’M SORRY WHAT?

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.310
And then Athena is all like, “I was born
from my father’s forehead so I can totally

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.310
get behind that.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.310
Orestes, you’re free.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:23.160
Furies, I’m changing your name to the Eumenides,
the Kindly Ones, and making you the patron

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.199
goddesses of marriage and children.

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:26.199
Libations all around!”

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:30.839
So that’s how we get the jury trial and
some messed up ideas about parentage.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.610
As you probably noticed, each of these three
plays don’t tick every Aristotle Box.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.140
The third play has a non-tragic ending.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.170
But we can see how the engines of Aristotelian
tragedy drive these works: in each play, the

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.439
action is more important than the characters,
who can seem somewhat flat and unconvincing.

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:53.459
Clytemnestra offers about six different motivations
for her dastardly deeds, including that she

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:57.889
finds murder sexually arousing … which is
troubling.

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:00.660
But in every play, there’s plenty of action.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.960
In the first two plays, we can see mostly
noble characters missing the mark.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.779
Agamemnon agrees to walk on tapestries, Orestes
decides to resort to violence.

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:12.139
There’s suffering aplenty.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:16.310
Taking the three plays as a whole, they show
that the only thing to break the tragic cycle

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.480
of bloodguilt and vengeance is literal divine
intervention.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.930
Divine intervention, and jury duty--which
was a pretty convincing way to remind the

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.870
audience of the importance of the city’s
democratic institutions!

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.709
Do these plays offer catharsis?

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:33.980
Well, that’s gonna depend on how we interpret
catharsis.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.470
And of course it’s also going to depend
on how the plays are performed.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.690
But in a strong production I’d say chances
are good that you feel pity.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.790
Or fear.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.230
Or both.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.380
Enjoy your purgation.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.699
And then go vote with a clear head!

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:49.810
We’ll see you next time for Greek comedy.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.140
Yup.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:12:18.139
All 

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:23.639
the phalluses.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:29.069
And…curtain!
