00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's consider the first one, two fish of type 1 die.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This expression pretty much looks like it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but then again it appears here with a plus sign for fâ‚‚,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so this rather models that fish of type 1 become fish of type 2 after a certain time.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Remember the SIR model for contagious diseases

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where a person is moved from one compartment to another compartment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
No, fish of type 1 don't die. It's rather that we have two types of fish.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The first type becomes the second type after a while--young fish and mature fish.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This growth rate can model both births and deaths.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It takes care of the difference, so in a way

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we have taken care of deaths and births from the beginning.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What about our fish of type 2--harvested or not?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We've already explained the first term. What about the second one?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
At least, this is not constant harvesting.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For constant harvesting, we should be subtracting constant rate so and so many tons per year.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This could be, however, harvesting that's proportional to the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
actual amount of fish, maybe just every second fishes being harvested,

00:01:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
All in all, however, the second term looks like that fish of type 2 died of old age.
