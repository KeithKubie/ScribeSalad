00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.200
Merry Christmas, everybody!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.320
In honor of the occasion, I'm gonna take a little break from the Disney sequels

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.200
and instead look at something a bit more Christmas oriented but is still a direct-to-DVD movie.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.600
That's "Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas".

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.560
Every year, I see this brought out, and I've never really seen it before

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.840
because I think it came out a little past my time

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.900
in that I love Disney, but it's kinda the basic Disney cartoons.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.340
It's Mickey, Donald, Goofy... all learning about the meaning of Christmas while hijinks ensue.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.180
I kind of assumed there wasn't that much adult stuff in it, and, yeah, it does seem mainly for kids,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.720
but for a Christmas movie aimed mainly at kids, I think it's done pretty good.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.780
It's an anthology of stories, each dealing with the holiday.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.920
The first one centers around Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and them all wishing that Christmas could be every day.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.360
Yeah, you now this tale, and you kinda know what comes of it.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.420
They get Christmas every day! At first, they love it, but then they find they don't,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.320
and, eventually, a lesson is learned.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.400
It's pretty standard until they throw in a little bit of a twist

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.280
where, once the boys get sick of it, they start to act up and make things worse.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.900
This results in them seeing the consequences of their actions on the rest of the family,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.940
and I don't know. I thought that added a little bit more.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.520
At least from what you usually expect of this story, it's kinda nice,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.940
and there's a nice little bit about a Christmas card that you think is the throwaway joke,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.500
but it makes a return, too, and I don't know, it was actually pretty emotional at the end. I liked it.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.000
The second centers around Goofy and his son, Max.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
Actually, a much younger version of Max, which I really like.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480
I kind of like the idea of seeing him at a different age.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.700
But, then again, they probably did that because it's about his belief in Santa Claus in that he's starting to doubt.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.540
Next door neighbor, Pete, tells him that there's not a Santa Claus,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.100
so Max is bound to find out if that's true or not.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
The one bizarre twist is that Goofy believes there's a Santa Claus, too,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.020
and actually ends up staying out all night until he comes.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.040
This one is mostly pretty good, but I don't know. I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.720
Not to give anything away, but they do reveal whether he exists in this world or not,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
and I don't know. I thought you could've done this without a definitive answer.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.640
Like, maybe they go to bed, they wake up in the morning, and find the gifts,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.280
and then you don't really know if Goofy did it or if it was just an act. I don't know.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.580
I felt there was a really smart, good ending to this, and they just kinda do the traditional route.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.520
But, honestly, the rest is so good,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.700
especially with Max trying to make his father feel better, that I think it's fine.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.640
The third and final one stars Mickey and Minnie reenacting "The Gift of the Magi".

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.440
Yeah. They actually call it that. I really think that's cool.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.560
I usually don't care for Mickey Mouse stories, but, honestly, Mickey and Minnie are kinda the perfect people to tell this story.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.600
You all know this tale. Mickey wants to get a gift for Minnie, Minnie wants to get a gift for Mickey, but neither of them have a lot of money.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.140
So Mickey has a plan involving his harmonica, and Minnie has a plan involving her watch, and--

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.260
Alright, I won't give it away in case you haven't seen it, but it's a very decent telling of the story.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.140
Mickey and Minnie are the epitome of wide-eyed innocence that it really does make sense to do this story with them.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.900
It's a good, humble telling.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.180
All the stories are tied together with a narration from Kelsey Grammer.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.940
The minute you hear his voice doing the whimsical, inspiring thing,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.860
you just kinda laugh and giggle at how corny it is, but you also kind of admire how sweet it is.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.140
And that's the best way to describe this movie: corny but sweet.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.500
The animation is really good, especially considering it's just kind of a Disney cartoon.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.240
I mean, they didn't have to throw all this money into it,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.660
but they did, and they really tried to make it look nice and Christmas-y.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.600
There's a lot of nice, little touches, too, if you know the Disney universe.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.920
For example, one of these ornaments is from the second "Beauty and the Beast" movie.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.420
Minnie works for Mortimer's, which is this classic Disney villain.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.040
And even all the characters are kinda tied into each other,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.020
like one person in one story might be the neighbor to another person in another story.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.560
It's kinda clever that way.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.360
There's even a couple laughs in there.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:05.540
There's one involving Goofy finally spotting Santa Claus that literally made me laugh so hard and so loud, I think my neighbors walking by heard me.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.480
I won't give it away, but it was a really funny scene.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.280
So, yeah. This is obviously something meant for little, little kids, but as something for little, little kids goes,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.400
it has a lot of charm and delight to it.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.900
It's probably not something I would put on a lot around Christmas time,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.200
but I think it's great to show your kids and kinda get 'em the culture in some of these classic stories

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.380
and some new stories as well with your favorite Disney characters.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.580
There's clearly effort that went into it, and the effort pays off.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.040
You get three nice, gentle stories that aren't phenomenal, but are effective.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.140
Each one has a legitimately emotional moment, and each one has one or two laughs in it as well.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.540
Definitely a nice one to check out around the holidays.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.680
There's plenty more Disney sequels along the way, but until then,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.780
Merry Christmas and enjoy the best day of the year!
