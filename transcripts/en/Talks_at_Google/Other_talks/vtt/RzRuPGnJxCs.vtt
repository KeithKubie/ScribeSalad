00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.199
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: My name's Brad Templeton.

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.509
I'm director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.360
And also professor at the new Singularity
University that Google co-founded which is

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.890
just down the street at NASA.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.670
And that word "singularity" is a word you’re
gonna hear a little bit in this talk.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
But I'm also working at Google X right now.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.590
And I've been wanting for some time to invite
up Vernor Vinge to come and speak to Google.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
Now, Vernor as hopefully many of you know
is really one of the most decorated science

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.660
fiction authors of our time.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.990
I'm gonna make you blush.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.470
And say I would suggest you are the greatest
computer related science fiction writer that

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.400
there is alive today.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.710
He has won five Hugo awards.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.130
Three of them in a row for Best Novel.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.640
And I think the only person who's won three
in a row for Best Novel is Lois Bujold

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640
&gt;&gt;Vernor Vinge: hmmm.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.051
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think that's the other
person who's done that.

00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.480
So it's a very rare distinction.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.410
Five Hugo awards is a rare distinction.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.540
And hers were for three in the same series.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.430
You had two different series in the three
awards you won in a row.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.739
Vernor is also the creator of, or coiner at
least of the term, "the singularity" to refer

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.250
to an incredible explosion of intelligence
and exponential technology changing the world.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.280
And the difficulty of predicting beyond it.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.970
That has become an entire movement.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.930
Including the Singularity University that
I just referred to.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.110
He was also, until recently, a professor of
computer science at San Diego State University.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.740
So he's not just a writer.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.500
[chuckles] And so he's got a real career.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.010
So many of his books have touched on things
that relate to Google as well.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.700
Which is why I think that people here will
be interested in hearing what Vernor has to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
say.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.710
Why don't we start though by going way back
and I can't believe this.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.810
It's like 46, 47 years ago.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.780
That you published Bookworm Run.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.479
Bookworm Run was the, I was gonna put that
up on the slide.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.510
I don't have that here.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.159
It's a little reminder of it.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.110
Bookworm Run was a story about intelligence
applications.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.310
And you use

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.630
A clever technique of saying, I don't know
how to understand enhancing a human beyond

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.630
what a human is.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.810
'Cause that's smarter than me.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.990
So you came with a clever technique.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.590
Why don't you talk about the beginning of
that and reflect on what's happened in the

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.160
almost 50 years since you wrote that story?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.070
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Um, that was a story that was part
of a sort of continuing conversation I had

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.319
with John W. Campbell.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.670
I'll, as, the best editor of all time in science
fiction.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.220
I remember I sent him a story once in which
I had a, an adult human.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.420
Or who, who, that was super intelligent.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.630
And he wrote, he rejected it.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.630
And he wrote me back "I'm sorry Mr. Vinge.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.370
You can't write this story.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.860
And neither can anyone else."

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.650
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.670
&gt;&gt;Vernor: So that should have given me a clue.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.390
And the, the, the real clincher on the case
was that I showed such a story to my kid sister.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.190
And, and, and, I told her that actually this
is about a superhuman, a human that was made

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.920
superhuman by being connected to a computer.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
And then I said offhandedly, of course they
would try it out on animal models first.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.880
And she looked at the story for a while and
said, "You know, this is really pretty boring.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.970
Except for the part about the chimpanzee.”

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.650
And between John W. Campbell and my sister,
you know [sound of knocking head] it finally

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.310
got through to me that that's what I should
do.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.760
So it was about a chimpanzee that then escaped.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.770
And I, I, really wasn't thinking about it
of course in the context of the years that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.770
followed.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.131
But in the years that followed, I've gone
back and looked at it.

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:55.930
And actually, the last couple paragraphs,
is really kind of a, a summary of the to me,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.330
the most important issues about the singularity.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.720
The un knowability.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:08.630
And the fact that it's, it's an intrinsically
different form of technological progress.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:16.150
And it's essential, and it's qualitatively
different form of uncontrollability.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.150
From the past.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.900
So actually I'm very proud of that story.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.210
It was the first story that I ever wrote that
sold.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.410
And it started as an illustration I think
of having grown up to all, all the years of

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.210
reading science fiction and being exposed
to the early writing.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.680
I don't mean the technical writing.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.259
But the early popular writing of, of the founders
of the artificial intelligence field.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.809
Like McCarthy and Minsky.

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:50.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I mean, I think the question
of intelligence application versus artificial

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.629
intelligence as a means of building a super
intelligence is a very interesting one.

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.789
And you certainly dug into it a long time
before most people did.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.029
I wanna go away from the singularity bit though
and talk about cyber space.

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.270
Because this was another one of your novels
which I'm sorry to tell you is also, or this

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.129
was a novella about 30, over 30 years ago.

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.550
That you wrote this story.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.830
How many of you have read True Names.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.529
I think, great Google fans here.

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:15.940
For the rest of you I recommend going back.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.830
We don't have free copies of it for you hear.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.110
But first of all you came up with this marvelously
clever trope of taking the idea from magic

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.419
and fantasy stories that if a wizard knew
your true name, that gave them power over

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.430
you.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.409
And you explored it by in many ways creating,
although you weren't the very first writer

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.409
to write it.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.409
The concept of a cyberspace.

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.059
An immersive reality.

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:39.490
So since you wrote that story.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.439
And at the time nothing existed except for
bulletin boards and a few mailing lists.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.569
Since you wrote that story of course there
are a million attempts at cyberspace and virtual

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:48.569
reality.

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.710
Would you be, do you have any thoughts about
the past 30 years and where this story came

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.400
from and where you think it's going?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.349
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ah, the story, it came from several
things that were in my idea box.

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.800
And of those things of course came from stories
that I was reading.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.210
And from things I was seeing in the real world.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.810
What one was Ursula Le Guin's Wizard of Earthsea
trilogy.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:21.150
In which she makes a big deal of, and of course
this goes back to Rumpelstiltskin, of, if

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.569
you know something is true you have power
over it.

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.569
And in reading Wizard of Earthsea which is
frankly a fantasy.

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.619
She, uh, no bones about it.

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:35.129
But it occurred to me when I was reading The
Lord of the Rings, uh, The Hobbit.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:40.029
That really this is all a science fiction
story in shallow disguise.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.779
And the shallow disguise in the case of Wizard
of Earthsea is that there was some big database

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:53.520
that, that had deep information about things
keyed off their serial number.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.800
And that was what the True Name was.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.789
So that was a major, major issue that has
sort of been hanging fire in the idea box

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.550
for several years.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:13.809
And then we just were beginning to get dial-up
access to San Diego State's time shared computer

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:22.999
in the late '70s. and you could check out
one of the two or three portable terminals

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.520
we had and take it home and you could actually
dial up from home.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.479
And get on the, on the, on one of the two
dial in lines that we had to the time shared

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:32.849
computer.

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:42.389
And actually, that, of a, [pause] that was
enough of an experience that you, a person

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:47.120
could get a little bit of the flavor of what
it would be like to be floating around in

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.179
a space where you don't know everybody that
you're dealing with.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:08:00.189
And in, in my collected stories anthology
I tell the, the, the, to me, this an awesome

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:06.559
true story about how I was, I had dialed in
and I was trying to do something on this rest,

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:10.080
uh, Dak system, and um

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.900
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You're old.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.900
[feedback]

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.759
&gt;&gt;Vernor: And something, and I apparently
had left a talk program enabled.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:21.810
And some guy started chatting me up.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.240
And, you know, or you know, wanting to talk
to me.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.270
And he didn't know who I was, I don't think.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.009
And I didn't know who he was.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:29.749
And so we just chatted for a while.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:35.450
And then finally I said that, that, I had
other things to do.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.960
But what I said was that I was going to have
to terminate the chat at this point.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.080
Because actually I was a simulator, a simulated
personality.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.620
Simulated program.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.350
And if I kept talking for much longer that
would become obvious.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.050
[laughter]

00:08:53.050 --> 00:09:00.430
And so I cut the chat and, and then I just
sat back and I just realized that by the standard

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.540
of my whole life up till that point, I had
just lived a science fiction story.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.750
[laughter]

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:15.920
And was very easy, it, it really True Names,
um, I think is by far the easiest science

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.270
fiction that I ever, ever wrote.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.270
Easiest for me to write.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.680
I just sat down and I wrote it.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.000
And everything came out smoothly.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.660
Using the magical tropes.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.580
Which I think is, has been captured, well,
the statement that sufficiently, Clarke's

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.390
statement that sufficiently advanced science
is indistinguishable from magic.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.830
That's actually, that's a great and a very
important point.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.190
But it's not really the central thing about
True Names.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:50.240
I think the central thing about True Names
is the usefulness of magical metaphors in

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.510
programming.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:58.571
And I had enough exposure to that at that
time that it just made everything very, very

00:09:58.571 --> 00:09:59.571
easy to do.

00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:06.320
And every time I needed an action thing, all
I had to do was, was, was resort to mapping

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.250
software concepts across into the real world.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.300
And I don't think I used this in the story,
but it illustrates the point.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:25.030
The, in, in, when you talk about processes
that you have zombies and uh, and, and child

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.930
processes and things like that.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:32.330
And almost, this is sort of the reverse of
using magical metaphors to do things in the

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.330
computer world.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:39.450
Almost everything that we do in the computer
world and in operating systems inspires an

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.120
application in the real world.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.760
It doesn't just inspire an analogy in the
real world.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.210
If there isn't already an application corresponding
to something in the software realm, it means

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.590
that somebody is missing a bet.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.590
[pause]

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.590
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: hmmm.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.090
Well I think you’re selling yourself short.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.430
Because there were things in True Names that
came through into the future.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.080
You know gangs of hackers hiding out in cyberspace.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.080
Hanging out.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.640
People pretending to be bots, and having contests
about who can be a bot.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.750
One that didn't come through was the idea
of a complete immersive reality over a very

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.750
small bandwidth.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:18.580
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Right, there's also that is teetering
on the edge of coming true or not.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:24.080
And that is the notion that the military is
exceptionally good at this.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
[laughter]

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: True.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.050
I mean, we have ourselves at DFF fought a
number of cases now over defending the anonymity

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.750
of people acting online.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.310
Getting their, so I mean, it all comes in
many ways right out of True Names.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.070
So that story deserves to be read by all of
you who haven’t' read it.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.070
Now.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.320
I've put up the cover of Marooned in Realtime.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.200
We're not actually gonna talk about Marooned
in Realtime unless you'd like to.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.240
But this was the first novel in which the
singularity had occurred already by the time

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.650
that you wrote the book.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.890
And I remember your early essays on the subject.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.180
When you started talking about it was impossible
to write stories about these kind of beings

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.600
that we certainly had no ability to understand.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.840
And the singularity was, to me it seemed you
were using a metaphor in mathematics of course.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
It's a discontinuity.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.230
And a function or a derivative of a function.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.300
And you used that discontinuity as a metaphor
for unpredictability.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.310
For being undefined.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.291
Is that a pretty good description of what
you meant by the term?

00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:19.291
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Right.

00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:22.910
In, in math, you know a place where you have
a description that breaks.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.530
And you put it well.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:30.010
In that it's not, it, it, it's not necessarily
that anything is becoming infinite.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:37.870
And in fact, something becoming infinite is
sort of a, a, a symptom in your model.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.200
That the model is gonna break there.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.540
Something else is gonna happen.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:50.710
For instance, Shock Waves are an example of,
uh, a singularity in the equations for um,

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.730
incompressible flow.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:58.220
And the shock wave, in partial differential
equation models for highway traffic is simply

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.790
a chain reaction from a rear end collision.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.670
So a different model takes over.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:10.630
So it, it, that was one reason why the term
"singularity" is, I think, very appropriate

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.900
term.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:17.340
Another thing is my analogy with the most
famous example of a singularity in physics

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.500
models, which is in general relativity.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.450
And that is with the black hole.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:26.250
That there’s very little information that
you can extract from inside the black hole.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.060
If you're outside the black hole.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:35.160
And that, as a metaphor, I think is very appropriate
for looking at what things would be like if

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.640
there were superhuman intelligent critters
running around.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.550
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So you wrote the essay "The
coming technological singularity" which gelled

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.690
your ideas together and got the word out in
front of people.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.980
But you were thinking about it for a while
before then.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:53.880
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Uh, basically as a child, I was
immersed in science fiction and the beginnings

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.530
of people talking about AI.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:03.310
And in that era and in the first part of the
20th century, there were people writing about

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:09.790
some sort of transformative era of superhuman
beings thousands of years from now.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:15.160
Uh, so, um, that was, that was common.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.200
Then in the, around 1960, you began to get
people--.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.771
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you want something to
drink by the way?

00:14:20.771 --> 00:14:21.771
&gt;&gt;Vernor: No, I'm fine.

00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:25.460
You began to get people who were talking about
hit happening a lot sooner than thousands

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.890
of years from now.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:35.980
And so that's what, that's what really was
inspiring me when I wrote Bookworm Run.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:44.750
Then in 1982, I was, I was both lucky and,
and, mainly lucky.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.779
My, I'd, come out with True Names.

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:56.480
And Marvin Minsky invited me to be on a panel
with him and um, um, Jim Hogan.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480
And Bob Sheckley.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.870
Two science fiction writers.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.630
At a Triple AI '82.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.660
At Carnegie Mellon.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:11.500
And so we're sitting at this panel and talking
about these things, and, um, and, and I trotted

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.620
out this metaphor with the singularity and
how in my opinion

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.830
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [inaudible]

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:21.410
&gt;&gt;Vernor: the really significant thing would
not be human equivalent intelligence but what

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.740
would happen shortly after that.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:31.670
And of course, the, the maximum proponents
of AI research, were you know, this is very,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.350
this is something they certainly were thinking
about and talking about.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:42.110
But for me, it just sort of popped out and
it was the, it, on the panel and, and the

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.980
strength of the metaphor really impressed
me and I was very, very proud of myself.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.750
And I, and afterwards there, one of the editors
at Omni was there.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.710
And he came up and wanted me to do an op ed
piece.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.050
So that was the first time I had written about
it.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:03.150
Then Marooned in Realtime was, came out, a
couple of years after that.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.770
And I, and I think you mentioned I didn't
write about the singularity itself.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.410
Marooned in Realtime is a perfect example
of writing around the edges of it.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.730
In the case of Marooned in Realtime, it takes
place 50 million years from now.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.140
And it's after the singularity.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:27.300
And basically it, I don't know how many people
here have read or looked at Dougal Dixon's

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.330
book, After Man.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:38.000
It's a little bit like After People except
I think much, ah, well it's a different focus.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It's 50 million years.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.339
It's not pretending everybody went away tomorrow.

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:49.529
But 50 million years from now gave me a wonderful
opportunity to do what Dougal Dixon did in

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:50.529
pictures.

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:54.730
But also do it with the issue of what got
rid of the human race?

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.300
And I think very few rationalists would figure
that the human race is gonna be around in

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.709
a recognizable form on earth 50 million years
from now.

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:13.539
But their, their reasons for explaining why
we're not around would essentially range the

00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:17.620
gamut of human fears and dreams.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.439
And the fun thing about writing Marooned in
Realtime is, I have a small number of humans

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:26.589
who essentially have using that spherical
thing you see there.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.062
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: A little bit of magic in
science fiction.

00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:29.429
&gt;&gt;Vernor: A little bit of magic.

00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:34.240
Have stopped time for themselves inside the
bauble.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:40.320
And when it, when it bursts, they are alive
again, and it's 50 million years later.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.890
And there's about 200 humans.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:47.260
So you know, two or three times as many people
that are, that are here.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.260
It's a whole human race.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.690
And they're looking around.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.929
And they have the range of theories that you
could imagine.

00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:56.960
I have, I did it as a detective story.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.110
Which by the way, for those of you who are
into writing, detective stories have one awesome

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.330
virtue.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:11.370
And that is that it allows you to go around
and sample diverse opinions.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:18.480
Strung together with the overt excuse that
you're solving a mystery.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.460
A murder mystery.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.789
But I, I had one green.

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:23.789
Monica Raines.

00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:30.559
She was convinced that we had all done ourselves
in because of our, of our, terrible attitude

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.929
towards the environment.

00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:37.000
And there was, it's 50 million years in the
future, there actually was supporting evidence

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
for this.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.010
You could see all this incredible extinction
that happened if you were drawing species.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.419
Species population plots.

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:47.419
They go like this.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:52.929
And then decrease to zero in the anthropocene,
or whatever they call it now is this incredibly

00:18:52.929 --> 00:18:57.009
narrow line across the sedimentary horizon.

00:18:57.009 --> 00:18:59.389
And then after that, there's no people.

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:03.480
And the largest mammals are rats.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.159
Which then radiatively adapt into all the
slots.

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:11.649
Essentially all the slots that we have large
mammals in nowadays.

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:15.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That actually brings me
to another question I wanted to ask about.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.519
'Cause you gave a talk that Stewart Brand
asked you to do.

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.429
What if the singularity doesn't happen.

00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:24.220
And you they, so um, I mean can you continue
talking about Marooned in Realtime as well,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.420
but I'd be kind of interested to think about
the theories about where there wasn't any

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.100
kind of massive human improvement and, what
are the opponents to your ideas?

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.100
And how do they work out.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.100
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Right.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.100
Right.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100
Ahh.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.100
Let me just say a little bit more

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.100
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: No.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.100
Go ahead.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.100
&gt;&gt;Vernor: about Marooned in Realtime.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.100
So Monica Raines had that idea.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.110
Then there was a group that figured that some
space aliens had finally detected that humans

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.110
had attained intelligence.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.889
And they had come and exterminated us all.

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:53.110
And there was hard evidence for that actually
in the story.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:20:00.950
There were surviving if you can imagine how
you could write records that would survive

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.269
on earth for 50 million years.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:11.509
But there were some very fragmentary evidence
of massive kinetic attack.

00:20:11.509 --> 00:20:16.669
And then there were people who were peddling
the singularity as the explanation.

00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:21.769
And so I was able to do my little editorializing
about the singularity and how that was a lot

00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:24.019
of fun.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:32.169
And one of the chief engineers of making this
meeting happen at 50 million years got herself

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:33.590
murdered.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:39.860
So there really was there really was some
reason to to try to solve both the large scale

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.809
mystery of what had happened to the human
race and the small scale.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:50.309
So, in the event, I didn't have to actually
say what the singularity really was.

00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:54.980
One thing about the singularity is that it's
a scenario.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.700
And I am actually a very big fan of scenario
based planning.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:04.440
And I partly of course it fits the way that
science fiction writer's head works.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:14.210
But also because I think, in a world as uncertain
as our world, and still being a world that

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:19.490
we do have to live in and we do have to try
to plan around, scenarios are by far the best

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.289
way of attacking that.

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:29.570
So with scenarios you basically, and, this
is done a lot outside of science fiction now.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.340
Like with global business network.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.590
You identify major parameters.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.850
You try to identify major parameters of change.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:54.110
And then you use those parameters to assert
extremely different possible futures.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:59.590
And those futures should be as extremely unlikely
as your sponsoring entity can tolerate before

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.549
they kick you out the door and cut all your
funding off.

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:04.769
[laughter]

00:22:04.769 --> 00:22:09.309
Once you've identified those extreme possibilities.

00:22:09.309 --> 00:22:15.040
Say four, five of these scenarios, try to
flesh them out.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.919
And typically the way you flesh them out is
you pretend it's 2050 or 2070 or whatever

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:26.399
and write an essay about why, in retrospect,
it was obvious that this particular scenario

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:28.169
was inevitable.

00:22:28.169 --> 00:22:29.769
[laughter]

00:22:29.769 --> 00:22:35.070
In doing that, you generate a, a series of
symptoms.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.820
And then you're in a situation where in the
real world, you can look at all of those symptoms,

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.059
you can organize them.

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:43.879
And they are things to watch for.

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:49.340
And there are, is at least one very famous
example of, of a group that did this.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.269
And managed to avoid extreme disaster because
what the rest of the world was looking at

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:59.899
and thought was just a statistical blip, they
were looking at and saying, oh, that's a little

00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:04.980
bit like that wild-ass scenario on oil prices
that we had in our scenario-based planning

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.779
session last year.

00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:12.299
And were able to keep their options open just
long enough, or well enough, so that they

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:18.169
were able to avoid the catastrophe that befell
the people who were depending merely on trend

00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:22.389
lines and forecast uncertainties.

00:23:22.389 --> 00:23:31.139
So the thing with the singularity is a scenario
certainly a person should be imagining scenarios

00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:33.690
where the singularity doesn't happen.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:40.059
And if you Google on what if the singularity
does not happen, the first hit, the last time

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:44.659
I looked, was this talk that I gave at Long
Now, for Stewart Brand.

00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:47.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: If it drops down, we can
fix that for you.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.990
[laughter]

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:55.210
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ah, the god-like power of, uh.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:02.929
And in that, in, there are obvious ways actually
that the singularity wouldn't happen.

00:24:02.929 --> 00:24:07.389
And in my talk I, I pretty much kept those
off the table.

00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:13.980
The easiest way for the singularity to, not
to happen is if the world gets blown up.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.490
Everybody dies before it happens.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.480
The machine should keep this in mind, by the
way.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:28.480
Because if something happened to all the machines,
some rainy night, we humans would get, would

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.179
put them back at least in the present situation,
in a very short time.

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:34.450
We just can't help ourselves.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:35.450
You know?

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.820
That's what we do.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.779
We build and we build machines.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:44.919
On the other hand.

00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:51.929
If before, if, if human kind actually something
very bad happened to it and it, it was destroyed,

00:24:51.929 --> 00:25:01.460
and the machines had not reached whatever
they're gonna reach, it's very possible that

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.029
that the machines would never be built.

00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:07.730
In other words, those machines don't build
themselves before they exist.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:14.429
But we have a proof of principle here that
humans actually have a sort of durability

00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:15.429
in the natural world.

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:18.889
They can arise in the natural world.

00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:19.889
So that's actually

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:20.889
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But you haven't seen Prometheus
yet.

00:25:20.889 --> 00:25:21.889
I mean.

00:25:21.889 --> 00:25:22.889
[laughter]

00:25:22.889 --> 00:25:23.889
&gt;&gt;Vernor: You're right.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:24.889
I haven't seen Prometheus.

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:25.889
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's OK.

00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:28.029
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Imagine a better [inaudible]

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:29.649
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's right.

00:25:29.649 --> 00:25:30.649
Absolutely.

00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:31.649
[laughter]

00:25:31.649 --> 00:25:40.679
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Paul Anderson actually wrote a story
where in which the human race went extinct

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:44.789
at some point, and there was no singularity
before they went extinct.

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:49.720
But they in Australia or something like that,
they had an experiment and they actually built

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:55.570
very simple Von Neumann mach—you know the
alleged machines that can make more of themselves.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:01.830
And they could just barely do it with natural,
with the natural things that are in the environment.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:07.289
And after four or five billion years they
did evolve into a machine-based life form.

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:12.279
I think that's a much harder thing to happen
than biological life.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:15.619
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Alright.

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.970
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible]

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:27.450
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh, the story I heard was that an
intelligence unit at Royal Dutch/Shell in

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:33.249
the early '80s. the people that were working
there were using scenario based planning.

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:36.559
And in fact some of them went on to found
Global Business Network.

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:39.659
This story by the way is just me talking off
the top of my head.

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:46.090
I make no claims about how well you can verify
this.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:53.639
But at that time, and this was at the time
of the say the first oil shock, and so there

00:26:53.639 --> 00:26:58.549
were estimates being done of future prices
on oil.

00:26:58.549 --> 00:27:06.239
And so 100 dollar a barrel oil was essentially
accepted by everybody as on the near horizon.

00:27:06.239 --> 00:27:09.669
The only question is, what were the error
bars.

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:10.669
Around it.

00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:17.480
And a terrific opportunity to invest enormous
amounts of money in exploration.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480
And a lot of people did.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.129
And I imagine that Royal Dutch/Shell did,
too.

00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:27.399
But they had a, when they did their scenario
based planning, one of their scenarios was,

00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:29.440
"What if the price of oil stays."

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.100
I don't know if the word low is the right
word.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.759
But relatively low.

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:36.690
Crazy crazy assumption or scenario.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.049
But they had, you know they had done some
detail work and what the thing would look

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:42.450
like and that sorta stuff.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:49.620
And then as the decade, as the decade progressed
and the prices did not explode, the people

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.179
who didn't have that contrarian possibility
in their head along with the presumably the

00:27:55.179 --> 00:28:00.370
symptoms were just not in the position to
do the pattern matching on it.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.440
That the people who had done the scenario.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.149
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I know we're not gonna have
all the time to cover all the topics.

00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:09.740
We could do a couple of hours talking about
what you wrote about in this book.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.979
So I wanted to ask you about a couple of them.

00:28:12.979 --> 00:28:17.979
My favorite phrase from this book and I've
told you before, is "applied theology".

00:28:17.979 --> 00:28:19.850
Which was a study that was out there.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:23.629
Because in A Fire Upon The Deep, there is
a post-singularity zone outside the galaxy

00:28:23.629 --> 00:28:26.909
and through a little magical maguffin it doesn't
happen inside the galaxy.

00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:27.909
&gt;&gt;Vernor: It's impossible.

00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:28.909
It's a slow zone.

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:29.909
Right.

00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:30.909
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's right.

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:34.049
But so the beings who live outside the galaxy
are as gods.

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:35.200
They're not real gods.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.129
They don't have superpowers of gods.

00:28:37.129 --> 00:28:40.479
But they are as gods to the, compared to us.

00:28:40.479 --> 00:28:45.539
And so one thing I was interested in is that
there sometimes seems to be a mixing of questions

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:46.749
that come from religion.

00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:50.989
And questions that come related to the singularity
and advanced AI and so on.

00:28:50.989 --> 00:28:53.279
And I wondered if you had more thoughts on
that.

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:58.330
&gt;&gt;Vernor: The term "applied theology" is,
I'm sitting there writing this story.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:05.559
It's a magic term because it actually invokes
so many different things in the minds of,

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.919
a, a lot of readers.

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:19.080
And in my case, and in that story, the notion
was simply that, that, not right where we

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.370
are talking, but within distances that you
could communicate across, there were things

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.989
that were pretty demonstrably god-like.

00:29:28.989 --> 00:29:36.509
And there also was, because of artificial
intelligence studies and things like that,

00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:41.710
there was deep understanding of the sorts
of things you could do to make that happen.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.609
Unlike our universe where I suspect that that
deep understanding will quickly lead to being

00:29:46.609 --> 00:29:48.350
able to do it.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:55.220
In this situation, they knew as long as they
stay inside the safe zone, that all that the

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.870
gods can do to them is play with their heads.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.629
Which is bad enough.

00:29:59.629 --> 00:30:06.750
But you know it's not quite the same as them
being able to, able to arrive and mess around

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.909
otherwise.

00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:15.539
And so you get universities that their version
of computer science they might have computer

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:16.539
science.

00:30:16.539 --> 00:30:23.520
But the, the more serious and also driftier
subject was applied theology.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.889
Which was how to deal with these beings on
the outside.

00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:37.919
And it was, it sort of varied between being
totally inane and bogus, and being much, much

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:41.299
too dangerous to deal with.

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:48.629
And some of the characters in the story for
instance, the, a major character in this story

00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:49.629
is an RV.

00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:53.759
A [chuckles] controlled by the gods.

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:55.379
A god.

00:30:55.379 --> 00:31:01.349
So this remotely piloted vehicle just looks
like a person.

00:31:01.349 --> 00:31:08.990
And he is actually under the control you know
as a remote device, of, of by a god.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:14.739
And he is capable of causing an enormous amount
of, an enormous amount of trouble.

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:19.340
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, yeah, the other thing
of course that you developed wonderfully here

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.460
was the idea of an intergalactic social network.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.099
Online bulletin board.

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:28.940
Which you based in part on some of the networks
that existed in that day.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.350
Now we have a lot more bandwidth.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.350
So it's not quite the same.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.669
But you were looking at this low bandwidth.

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:33.669
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh.

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:34.669
Oh yeah.

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:36.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I don't know if you have
any thoughts about that.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.690
I think we're going to, you said something
to me earlier on which I think we'll get to,

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.809
your most recent book hadn't really thought
of.

00:31:43.809 --> 00:31:47.899
That you thought The Tines were an example
of extreme social networking.

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:51.669
And if you’ve read The Tines, which begin
in actually they begin in a story called The

00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:52.669
Blabber.

00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:56.239
But there's they're seen in their full form
in this book for the first time.

00:31:56.239 --> 00:31:57.519
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yeah.

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:04.009
A Fire Upon The Deep was written probably
the late '80s early '90s. came out around

00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:15.389
'92 and so we were in one of the early popularity
blushes of the internet so you had Usenet.

00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:18.779
And you had these other low bandwidth things.

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:25.549
So a big component of the story is, imagine
a galactic internet.

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:28.340
An, where you have millions of worlds.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:34.479
In, in fact, there was actually a posting
on Usenet at the time.

00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:41.669
I think where someone sneered that the, if
there were such a, if there were such an internet,

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:48.340
it would be so expensive that you know, you
wouldn't just bust your parents budget for

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:54.830
a month if you overused it, you'd be selling
your home race into slavery for 1000 years

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.650
just to pay the Telco fees.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.080
[laughter]

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.080
I had

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: YouTube is basically like
that.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080
So.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.080
[laughter]

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:09.850
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I had great fun with writing that,
that part actually went very smoothly although

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:16.499
in the back of my mind, you know, was the
notion that this is going to look so lame

00:33:16.499 --> 00:33:18.820
in 10 years.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.869
Probably in one year.

00:33:19.869 --> 00:33:25.200
In fact, if it looks lame before it even gets
published, it's really gonna be an embarrassment.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:32.609
So there's little things throughout the story
where I tried to make, to make the point that,

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:36.279
this is not what planetary networks looked
like.

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:38.820
A network on the surface of a planet.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:47.720
And in fact, I felt totally excused and I
would use this argument if a fan came up and

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.239
beat me over the head with it in 1995.

00:33:51.239 --> 00:33:59.799
I felt totally excused by the fact that 50,000
bits per second superluminal is not something

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:03.470
that anybody has any business complaining
about in the year 1995.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.470
[laughter]

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.871
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'll take it.

00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:07.229
I'll even take the thing in The Blabber with

00:34:07.229 --> 00:34:08.229
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh, in The Blabber!

00:34:08.229 --> 00:34:09.229
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: half a bit per second.

00:34:09.229 --> 00:34:13.860
&gt;&gt;Vernor: In The Blabber they're just inside
the slow zone by six light years.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.070
Can you imagine what that would be like if
the, super, if faster than light travel that

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:26.260
was another thing that happened when you went
across from the slow zone to the beyond.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.830
And go further, you'd get super intelligence.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:33.669
They were so close and they knew that if they
just settled the planet a little bit further

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:35.659
on they’d' have faster than light travel.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.120
So they're stuck there.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.520
And it turns out that actually you can get
superluminal communication at, in that position.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:48.140
If you're willing to dim the sun a little
bit for your power.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.490
[laughter]

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:53.409
And so they actually have what Ursula Le Guin
called an ansible.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:58.570
This ansible can do something like six bits
an hour.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.710
[pause]

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.270
And so if you wait for a day or so, you can
actually communicate simple messages onto

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.700
the real internet.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.580
The, what I call the Known Net.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.770
Which was.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.500
And I never used this in a class at school.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:23.880
But in a CS class, that would be a good example
between the, for the difference between bit-rates

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.280
and bit-rate speed, and speed of propagation.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.550
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Although it's kind a like
when my phone goes to GPRS.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.860
It's very similar.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.140
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.650
Yeah except the person you're talking about
is still on earth.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.170
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's right.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.540
You know we have so many topics so I don't
know if I'm gonna let you pick which things

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.600
you're most interest to go on about.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.020
In this novel you of course went into the
regular laws of physics for your space colonization

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.020
and that was great.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.240
But there were a couple of really cool things
in here.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.710
Aside from that the smart dust that you developed.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:02.670
And the second thing, something that's now
become a theme with you, which is mind control.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.480
The bad guys in this novel are really bad.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.470
And one of the things they do is they have
a little virus they can use to turn you into

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:14.260
this totally focused person as sort of a mental
slave that will work very hard on a problem

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:19.620
and so you can do things that are, that a
human can do that an AI can't do.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.300
But the funny thing is I know many people
who said they wanna get your

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.300
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh yeah!

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.390
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: focus virus when they have
a deadline, they would love to have it.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.311
So if you wanna talk about altering the mind
and your thoughts on that.

00:36:30.311 --> 00:36:32.130
That would be cool.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:36.480
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I do distinguish between what amphetamines
would do and what focus would do.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.480
To me they are two different things.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:50.200
The idea of focus was it could make you seriously
and monomaniacally interested in a topic.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.720
Presumably a topic that you already had spent
years learning about.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.950
And in a certain ghastly way I was proud of
this invention.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:04.070
I actually have a mechanism for doing it in
the story.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:16.310
And it is a solution to the, solution or response
to those optimists among us, including me,

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:25.600
who hope and believe that slavery is not economically
feasible in a high tech civilization.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.710
And I have a high tech a moderately high tech
civilization in The Deepness In The Sky.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.780
And they are, they are for sure a slave-owning
society.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:41.150
And what they do is they have the ability
to convert specialists into focused specialists.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:47.360
Who then really have not very much interest
in anything except their specialty.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:53.480
And they can be driven, can be driven to extremes
on that.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.470
And this is actually a way that they actually
can do things.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.750
This is in a part of the universe where the
singularity is not possible.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:09.980
They can actually do things that nowadays
we would expect automation to be able to do.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:14.400
For instance in the story, one of the normal
humans, a citizen of this tyranny, he's called

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.410
a pilot-manager.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:21.500
Because basically he has a team of these people
who actually do the piloting.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:27.880
And they do a very good job except at one
point they encounter a vehicle that actually

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.090
has anti-gravity.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.280
Which no one knows anything about.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:39.480
And so it doesn't, it doesn't behave according
to the laws of celestial mechanics.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:46.860
And the actual pilots, these focused persons,
they just you know, it takes, it they essentially

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.340
go to pieces.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.610
As you can imagine somebody who had a, Isaac
Newton if he had a great deal of intuition,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:58.980
and he did of course, about, about central
force problems.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:07.390
He probably would have been driven to distraction
if he had encountered an apple that fell upwards.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.770
Actually, Schmitt did that in Analog many
years ago.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:12.770
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Oh did he?

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:13.770
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yeah.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:17.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now you return to the slaves
actually in a story recently where you suggested

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.330
that if you ever find yourself working at
a company with really great working conditions

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.330
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ha.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.330
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Unlimited free foods

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.330
&gt;&gt;Vernor: [laughs]

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You know, nice views and
games and sports.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.400
The only

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.400
&gt;&gt;Vernor: He's very scared.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: The only explanation is
you're actually an uploaded slave.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.930
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Right

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.930
[laughter]

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm spoiling that story
a little bit.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:35.930
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yes, you will spoil the story.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.670
That story is called The Cookie Monster.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:42.270
And actually, and actually the title gives
the story away.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:51.350
And it gives a counter measure that the people
who are trapped in the story undertake to

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:56.680
you know, outwit the, once they figure out
what's going on, to outwit the guy who's resetting

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.940
them at the end of each day.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now to continue on that
theme.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:05.390
Why would someone write a story with something
like self-driving cars, automatic reality

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:10.360
tools that you wear all the time, a big giant
company that's scanning all the books in some

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.590
cavalier way.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.590
[laughter]

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.200
Who were you thinking about when you wrote
this novel.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.800
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:24.770
I, there was a moment writing this novel that
was even worse than my fears about the internet

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:26.020
in Fire Upon The Deep.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:32.270
And that was, it became, it, you know I hadn't
been paying too, I hadn't been paying enough

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.390
attention to what was going on.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:41.700
And I realized that there were things I was
writing about that you know, were probably

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.280
gonna be done and they were gonna be done
better than I was doing them before my book

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280
could come out.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.580
I mean, it's bad enough to be scooped after
your book comes out.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:54.070
But this it was very clear that this was going
on an arguably it had already happened with

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:58.660
some of the things that Google was doing.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.200
So if you're reading this book, there's this
little paragraph, but didn't Google do that

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.660
back in 2006?

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.390
And there's some discussion of what is different.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:16.580
And actually the discussion, some of the discussion
comes down to the very legal issues that are

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.650
dragging all of this out.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I can't yet tell you what
other things in Rainbow's End are under development

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:23.490
at Google.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:24.490
[laughter]

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.300
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yes, you tantalized me with that
by email.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.230
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But I am going to take you
for a ride in a chauffeured car tomorrow.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.230
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.230
Excellent.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.230
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So that'll be something
good.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.930
But no, this book again, it's a fabulous book.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:39.500
I think one of the best of the first decade
of our new century.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.890
In terms of going forward with that.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.890
But you brought, you had the mind control
in here as well.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:45.710
The you gotta believe me or whatever it was
called.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.900
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh yes.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.980
Oh, it was sort of a maguffin.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.980
It was a threat.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.681
The way you know, the way in the 20th century
there were, and now I suppose, there are certain

00:41:56.681 --> 00:42:00.120
technologies that haven't happened but we're
afraid they're going to happen.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:05.320
And you gotta, YGBM, you gotta believe me.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.600
That was the new maximum fear.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:17.720
And in, in the story there actually is a technology
where you, where first of all you infect everybody.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720
Biologically.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:23.300
With something that is mellow and is not really
recognized by the public health authorities.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:29.290
However it is something that certain visual
stimuli can cause to activate.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:34.350
So at that point you've melded biowarfare
with information warfare.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:39.420
To the extent that you can target individuals
or you can target whole populations like,

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.090
you gotta see this latest viral, you know

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: In the book it's a good
way to get people to click on ads, basically

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.800
right?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.860
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Uh.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.210
In the book actually it never happens.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.210
It's something that.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.420
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's right.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.130
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I have a vil-, the villain in the
story is a guy who is so upset about that

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:02.850
he's essentially decided that he has to take
over the world and prevent it from happening.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.850
[chuckles]

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's right.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:05.850
No, no we're not.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.460
This is not one of the things we're working
on.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.460
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ah, that's good.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.760
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I will make an official
denial of that.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:16.060
So since I wanna leave some times for questions,
let's go to your most recent novel.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.120
And you obviously were very fascinated by
the characters you created earlier on which

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.990
were hive minds.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.870
Which were the individual members were not
themselves sentient.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.340
Fully sentient or conscious.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.180
Sort of a grand social network.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:33.020
So tell us what's fascinated you so much about
The Tines and why you came back to them for

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.170
this novel.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.090
And what else you wanna explore in that.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.630
&gt;&gt;Vernor: The Tines were extremely easy to
write about.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:46.710
In fact The Tines, which are these dog-like
packs of, individually smarter than dogs but

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:49.350
not as smart as humans.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:55.270
And a pack of four to eight of them is humanly
intelligent.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.300
And they're, they really, the analog really
is a local area network.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:06.940
They are local area networks and they use
sound actually, ultrasonic bands, in order

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.490
to transmit their information.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:13.320
If you think about the bit-rates involved
and if you know anything about attenuation

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.980
of stuff over 100,000 hertz, sound over 100,000
hertz.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.450
There are really some constraints that this
implies.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.430
And it just drove the story.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:28.110
It just was so, that part of the story was
even easier to write than True Names.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.580
And I could just sit there writing one cliché
after another.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.080
And every cliché took on a new meaning.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.830
Like, I'm of two minds on that issue.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:37.830
[laughter]

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.840
Or you know I may be a little bit pregnant.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.840
[laughter]

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.880
Or why don't you have your conscience go for
a walk?

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.880
[laughter]

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.570
It just streamed out.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.490
It was just so wonderful.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:55.921
And that part of the story, unlike the space
part of the story, was very easy to, easy

00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:57.550
to write.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:45:02.080
Now, the social network issue.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:10.810
It didn't arise among The Tines in my opinion
in A Fire Upon The Deep.

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:19.290
However in The Deepness In The Sky, I come
perilously close to breaking one of my background

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:24.140
assumptions which is that you can't have super
human intelligence in this part of the universe.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:29.360
And that is the question of what happens when
you get, when you put large numbers of these

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.210
doggy creatures together in one room.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:38.570
Like if you replaced all of you with individual
Tine members, that's called a choir, by the

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.400
way, among The Tines.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:49.290
And it's generally regarded as a form of self-abuse
in the same way that that means, [chuckles]

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:53.810
same way what that means in American English.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:46:01.220
And in other words, a choir maybe having a
good time, but it's not doing anything constructive

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:08.600
and it's not much smarter, it's not as smart
as an individual pack, certainly.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.680
And it turns out that that's a little bit
of a cultural bias in that.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:22.150
On the part of the Tines who keep themselves
whole, hold their minds more closely.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:29.570
And large, large groups like that are sort
of smart but in a kind of an odd way.

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:33.820
And they, and in the tropics they, they congregate
by the millions.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:38.701
And so there is some stuff in the story where
they’re flying along in a dirigible and

00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:43.210
they're looking down at this city slum that
goes on forever.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:44.210
That's just Tines.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.580
And they're so crowded that they can't form
individual minds.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:53.840
And you look down and you can actually see
compressional, things that look like compressional

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.840
waves.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:01.540
In other words, you can see ideas percolating
across the, across the face of the public.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.290
In the positioning of--.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:05.900
We're not seeing the sound.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:13.050
We’re just seeing small behavioral changes
that happen as some particular idea sweeps

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:15.700
through the population.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.260
And it's sort of striking at least to the
people who are watching because they finally

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:25.270
get an idea that although it's, although it's
only going at the speed of sound, which means

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:34.170
there's some real issues, you can actually
see the spread of memes in the body politic.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:38.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, if some folks in the
audience would like to come up and ask questions,

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.090
come to the microphone so the people on VC
can hear you.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:46.940
And then if there's some VC folks we'll let
you sort of interrupt after one or two here.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:51.200
And I'll just finally end up with, or we can
go directly to them just to ask you about

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.000
where, what in the future you'd like to talk
about.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.420
What books are you working on?

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.830
What ideas are really exciting you about the
future of the internet and communications

00:47:58.830 --> 00:47:59.830
and so on?

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:00.830
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.270
So thanks for coming.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:08.300
So a while back I was having a conversation
at a party with a friend of a friend, who

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.300
worked at a rival company's operating system.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.900
And of course it was good natured ribbing.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.650
Because he told me sort of the elaborate steps
he'd taken to run the soft, run the operating

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.090
system in a stable fashion.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.570
And you know we were talking about what makes
for good software design and things like that.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.731
And I said "Well, you know, have you ever
considered that there might be, you know,

00:48:23.731 --> 00:48:28.340
an upper limit to the size of the software
project that not just any one person but any

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.990
group of people can manage."

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:32.691
And I jokingly said "Well, why don't we call
that limit, like One Vista?"

00:48:32.691 --> 00:48:34.780
It was just a suggestion.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.820
But somebody who works

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.650
Question or long polemics in the form of a
question or both

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:43.650
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Sorry.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.650
It's leading to a question.

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.650
It's leading to a question.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:50.670
The, issue is that like, it seems like to
me that I see a lot of limitations to software

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:52.960
design because I work in computer security.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.870
I see bugs, I see things failing.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:59.000
And I see a lot of people being very optimistic
and sort of lots of "this time it's different."

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Right?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.180
The question for me is, it seems like a lot
of the arguments about the singularity seem

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:09.730
rooted in another set of biases that I also
share, Cause I grew up in a period of accelerating

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.730
change.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.980
And it seems like to me that some of our thinking
on the issue of the singularity, the fact

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.860
that we have university people devoted to
studying it and things like that, might be

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.810
biased by the fact, by the particular historical
epoch we exist in.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.810
Right?

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:22.990
Which is one of accelerating change.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:26.610
And sort of the neuro types that people who
are good at computer science.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:32.260
How much are you worried about that as sort
of a concern about the likelihood of the singularity?

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.200
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Single most likely reason that there
is such a limit is certainly, the software

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.520
does not seem to be going as well as the hardware.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.550
I think that's really, if you were gonna write
that scenario, that would be near the top

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:46.550
of the list.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:51.770
I must say also though that one of the few
times that I dabbled in the real world, was

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:57.511
a programming job and I remember being on
the customer site and we had some bug, you

00:49:57.511 --> 00:50:02.480
know, they made us come out because the stuff
we were selling them wasn't working.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.120
In some particular situation.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.120
Turned out to be a bug.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.120
Our bug.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.270
It actually turned out to be my bug.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.830
But I didn't know that at the time.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:15.010
And so we were sitting there and one of the
customers, engineer sticks his head in the

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:16.010
door.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:22.790
He says "Hey, you know, I just came across,
I heard this thing that really it's impossible

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.070
to write programs longer than 50,000 lines.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.390
Because there will be enough bugs that they
can't work."

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:31.940
And we had just broken through the 50,000
line limit.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.280
So you know, "Go away!" you know?

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.060
I think you guys are beyond 50,000 lines

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.280
[laughter]

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.640
And so, I, I, think there probably isn't an
upper limit.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.760
Although what they call programming in the
grand new era may not look at all like what

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.700
we call programming now.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:57.520
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, I promise this will be shorter.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.580
[laughter]

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:03.180
In The Deepness In The Sky you use possibly
my favorite phrase of all time which is "Tyranny

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:07.970
is when a government controlled code has to
run on every node in the network."

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.970
[laughter]

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:13.030
And I wonder how close you think we are to
that or whether it'll be entertainment industry

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.640
code has to run on every node?

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.640
[laughter]

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.910
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I think the first is more likely
than the, attempts at the first are more likely

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.470
than the second.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:33.030
And I don't think that the enforcement of
government, I think the enforcement of government

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:39.710
code is definitely something that countries
will attempt.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:45.390
I think it would break but it could be, the
way it breaks could be a nightmare.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:49.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: When I see the movie industry
I just say, I see dead people and they don't

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:50.920
know they're dead.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.920
So.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.920
Steal their metaphors.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.920
Come ahead.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.400
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So other than the singularity and
group minds, two of your really consistent

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.370
themes are betrayals, a lot of your conflicts
come out in betrayal.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:09.560
And also anarcho-libertarian utopias.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.140
So those seem to me to be kind of at odds
with each other.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.980
Uh, are those coming out of the same place?

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.080
Or how do those interact for you.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.011
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I wasn’t' aware of the betrayal
theme although if you have through about it,

00:52:23.011 --> 00:52:25.300
I actually, I'm willing to buy it.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.790
If a person goes back and looks.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:32.460
Certainly I'm aware of the libertarian-anarcho
capitalist thing.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:42.850
I regard the, the, the libertarian-anarcho
capitalist thing as you really kind of, um,

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:47.500
the progression of all sorts of good things
that have happened.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.710
If you go back.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.130
If you go back to the year 1200.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:53:01.300
And you try to, a time machine, and you try
to explain to some, um, noble lord why democracy

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.100
actually works better.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:09.270
And freedom and intellectual freedom works
better, he might be the rare sort of person

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.270
who would listen to you.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.270
That's possible.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.550
That he would listen to you.

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:17.120
But would be quite right to laugh in your
face and say "You know what would happen?

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:23.040
If I tried to, if I tried to open myself up
to that, tomorrow, I would be dead.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.720
There would be another clown up here on the
hill.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.280
And he would be doing the same thing that
I'm doing.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.820
What you're talking about is anarchy.

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.730
And it is impossible."

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:36.900
What happened in those 800 years between then
and now?

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.240
It's actually very hard, thinking about it,
I would, it would be hard for me to construct

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:45.390
a fantasy science fiction story to say how
we got from there to now.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.250
I'd almost have to point at the real world
as my only example.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:53.580
And to me the stuff that, like if you read
The Ungoverned.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:54:02.860
Which is my sort of purist take on anarcho-capitalism,
if you, look at that, I think you, I deliberately

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.680
try to underplay that.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.300
Except for the nuclear weapons.

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.300
And

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.160
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Minor exception

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.360
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yeah.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:19.050
I, I think actually if a libertarian-anarcho
capitalist world was not quieter and more

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.940
peaceful than now, it wouldn't work.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:26.640
It would, actually there's a difference between
me and some I think, and some advocates.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.990
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Hi.

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:34.010
First, I wanna say that A Fire Upon The Deep
and your other books are among my favorites

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.010
of all time.

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.010
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Thank you.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.010
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Thank you for bringing them to
me.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.790
As somebody who used to toil away in the gloom
behind the fence at Lawrence Livermore Lab,

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:44.340
I was very amused by the role of the lab played
in the Peace War.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.340
[laughter]

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.110
I'm wondering about your thoughts and how
the lab came, how did the lab come to feature

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.610
in that role in your book?

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:58.010
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I had friends up at Lawrence Livermore.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:02.990
And it was, it geographically a well placed.

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:08.370
I that, I think that is close, and to me a
beautiful, a beautiful area.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:13.280
I had visited Poul Anderson has, uh, used
to live in Orinda.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.230
I visited him there and I looked around.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:19.650
And then I also, I also visited the place.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:22.870
Very unofficially I discovered some things
about their security.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:24.100
[laughter]

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.970
I don't mean I got through their security.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:30.600
I mean I discovered things about their security
when it worked on me.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:36.680
But one thing I did try to make it clear that
this was a civilian subcontractor who did

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.720
these terrible things.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.920
That brought it into the world as we knew
it.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:48.520
So yeah, I, right now off the top of my head,
I can't point to anything, any other you know

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.760
significant thing that I knew about what was
happening there.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.290
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Well, it put the [inaudible], you
know an all new, whole new life.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:56.290
Thanks.

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:57.290
&gt;&gt;Vernor: [laughs]

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:00.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm sure that San Diego
State university library enjoyed your

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:01.240
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh, UCSD.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Oh, UCSD library.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.180
Sorry that's write.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.750
Enjoyed being featured even more.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.910
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Actually, they enjoyed being featured
more.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.490
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Would you say the Tines are more
Google plus or Facebook?

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:13.490
[laughter]

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.240
No, no, no, uh.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:22.430
&gt;&gt;Vernor: The Tines, as in a Fire Upon The
Deep, I would say are really not social networks.

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:25.220
&gt;&gt;Male #6: We're talking here about like,
the singularity.

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.220
If it happened.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.220
Would you be able to tell?

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.870
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Would you be able to die?

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:30.630
&gt;&gt;Male #6: To tell.

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.810
That it had happened.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.130
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Oh.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:42.930
That's a very important question on I've fairly
extensive rant on it.

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:50.630
I think the answer is probably, and if you
could, it would be very spectacularly evident.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:57:01.640
On the other hand, a person can make up scenarios,
you know, where it wouldn't and there is this.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:07.390
You know the singularity stuff, has, by, to
some of its critics, it's been mocked as a

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.390
digital rapture.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.390
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Yeah.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:17.480
&gt;&gt;Vernor: That it's isomorphic to talking
about apocalyptic issues.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.890
I'll tell you one thing.

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:24.430
If there are people that predict that the
singularity will happen on a particular date,

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.400
and if it doesn't happen, I think you're likely
to

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.400
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Isn't that kind of Kurzweil?

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.400
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Pardon?

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.400
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Isn't that kind of Kurzweil?

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.400
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Um.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yes, it's May 14th, 2045
at 4:62 pm.

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:36.280
&gt;&gt;Male #6: You know what.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You notice the hours are
longer.

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:44.290
&gt;&gt;Vernor: And I said, I'd be happy, if if
can happen I'd be surprised if it hasn't happened

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.290
by 2030.

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:46.290
So, there's

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.240
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now, Charlie, who's one
of the people who uses that 'rapture of the

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:55.840
nerds' term, Charlie Stross, has a story in
which some characters are running as digitally

00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.760
uploaded minds inside a space capsule the
size of a coke can, on their way to another

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.010
star, debating whether the singularity has
happened or not.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.010
[laughter]

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.010
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Well yeah.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.010
An exponent.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:07.750
I mean using the classic thing an exponential
curve is self-similar.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:13.980
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ah, yes, and that's a good point
that is often ignored by people who talk about

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.090
exponential curves.

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:20.040
The, actually the importance of the exponential
curve is not the curve so much as the fact

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:25.780
that if a certain scale or, in many cases
if a certain scalar gets larger than a certain

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:30.720
size, other things happen that are very spectacular.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:37.460
And so the exponential curve itself is you
know, uh, is, just a part of that.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:43.730
But what, I think that there is a possibility
that if very hard predictions are made and

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:49.380
then it doesn’t happen, you will see people
come out and say, "It happened but you didn't

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.420
notice."

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.990
I promise not to do that.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.990
[laughter]

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:59.140
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now from the other side
of the singularity, here's Thad.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:00.140
[laughter]

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.640
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So one of your big themes in Rainbow's
End was education.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.020
And as a professor, it was particularly scary,
that vision.

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.780
First of all do you think it's actually viable?

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:11.180
Do you think it's desirable?

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.200
And if it is desirable, how do we take our
traditional institutions like say Georgia

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.070
Tech and get them ready for such a event?

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.930
&gt;&gt;Vernor: So when you say desirable you're
talking about the singularity right?

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.960
&gt;&gt;Male #7: No, I'm not talking about the singularity
at all.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:30.550
I'm talking simply about how you do education
in Rainbow's End.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:32.570
Where people are, facilitators are the--

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:34.910
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Right.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:40.390
Actually, at least in the run up to the singularity,
avoiding talking about the singularity itself.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:46.500
But in the run-up to the singularity, I think
major features are going to be drastic decline

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.960
in the price of effective education.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.990
Say, a factor of 10 or 100.

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:55.540
In a dollar cost.

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:59.160
Not necessarily in the mind cost of the person
trying to learn.

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.030
And I think that is going to have a devastating
effect on the, large classes of people that

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.920
are trying to make money out of education.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:17.360
On the other hand, freeing up the mechanisms
for assigning credit, that is, you have a

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.660
diploma now, making that a more flexible process,
and making the process of delivering the information

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:29.630
10 to 100 times cheaper, I think that's going
to happen and I think the economic demand

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.630
for it is going to be very, very high.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:35.740
And like everything else that's happening,
it's gonna be great for everybody except for

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:41.420
certain people who are actually embedded in
the old way of doing things.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:45.710
As a person who is a writer, who is trying
to cope with eBooks and is trying to cope

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:51.610
with e-duplication, that's my red queen's
race.

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:55.610
Well, you guys in education have your own
red queen's race, too.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:01:01.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Just, Vernor of course was
an eBook pioneer of this is where I actually

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.180
first worked with you.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.180
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Along with Brad.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.760
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, I published this anthology
of science fiction works back in 1993 and

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760
the Fire Upon The Deep.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.760
&gt;&gt;Vernor: That's the reader.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.760
No, that's the disk?

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:10.760
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's the disk.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.290
A Fire Upon The Deep is on here by the way.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:16.520
And it's actually done as a hypertext book
because Vernor gave me all of his notes.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.330
He is an old time programmer.

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.860
So when he writes his text he puts hash tag
comments

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.660
[laughter]

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.070
I can't remember what character you use as
the first character.

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:26.120
In all those.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.880
It was an explanation point.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880
&gt;&gt;Vernor: No.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880
Carrot.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Carrot.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.390
So, he put all his comments in so you could
actually see how he wrote the book which was

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.390
cool.

01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:37.380
And unfortunately I don't have the rights
to sell this anymore.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.030
I do sometimes auction them for charity.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.810
One of the things though that his helped contribute
is it added the phrase Hexapodian as a key

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.210
insight to the nerd vernacular.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:48.230
Now you'll hear that from people from time
to time.

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:49.230
Go ahead.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:52.020
&gt;&gt;Male # 8: Yeah, my comment on can we tell
the singularity.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:56.410
It sounds like the singularity is just the
marching morons with the numbers reversed.

01:01:56.410 --> 01:02:00.030
You know the intelligent people have gone
off and left the ones who couldn't keep up

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.030
behind.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:02.030
But that's not my question.

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:06.480
Question is, in Fire Upon The Deep, you know
some really intelligent people went and poked

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.620
at stuff they shouldn't and woke up a scary
thing.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:13.010
And then they were saved at the last minute
by another scary thing that no one understood.

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:19.750
So now in Children of the Sky, the Tines'
world has gone through its, or started its

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.610
industrial revolution.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.210
But yet the scary things are still out there.

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.020
Are we gonna have to wait another 20 years
to see what comes next?

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.020
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yeah.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020
Yeah.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.020
Yeah.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020
[laughter]

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:33.530
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Certainly I think the most trenchant
criticism of The Children of the Sky is that

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:35.160
it doesn't bring completion.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:41.130
Or, or, and arguably it doesn't bring enough
semi-completion.

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:45.600
And it seems to me that it would take at least
two novels to bring this thing in for a landing.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.080
&gt;&gt;Male #8: [inaudible]

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.570
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Yeah, right.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.030
I actually had a chat with him about that
once.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.280
"Well, how long is it gonna be, Mr. Jordan?"

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.990
He was, a book, about book eight or book nine.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.750
He says, "Oh, two more books.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:59.750
Well, maybe three.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.210
Four at the outside."

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.210
[laughter]

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Hey.

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:05.190
It's workin' OK for George.

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.930
With the Game of Thrones thing.

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.730
He's making a lot of money from it.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.180
&gt;&gt;Vernor: So, have you read the Blabber?

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.400
&gt;&gt;Male #8: I hope to now.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.881
&gt;&gt;Vernor: The Blabber, actually, I'm going
to try, I'm still going to try to fit the

01:03:18.881 --> 01:03:21.590
trajectory so it will fit The Blabber.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:25.850
'Cause The Blabber takes place thousands of
years later.

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:28.250
So I don't have an answer to your question.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.990
I'm currently trying to figure out what my
next book is going to be.

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:37.900
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So, as an aside I find out that
I was extremely angry with you when I finished

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.900
this book.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.810
So please make the next one be [inaudible]

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:41.810
[laughter]

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:43.820
Um, I'm going to annoy everybody else here,
has

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm holding you back from
attacking the

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.920
&gt;&gt;Male #9: I'm annoying everybody else here
by asking a fiction question instead of a

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.070
science question.

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:55.940
Which is in Fire in the Deep, in the no net
sequences in particular.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940
Which were fantastic.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.660
You know you, what you're seeing there is
like some member of an alien race typing on

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.190
a keyboard and hitting send and so on.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:07.100
But what it feels like and especially what
the labeling makes it looks like is that the

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.690
character is the race itself.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.020
Like the race is an aggregate.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.260
And this works really well in the story but
kind of the first logic breaks down.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.320
Because I can imagine myself sitting at a
computer somewhere and flaming someone and

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.710
someone thinking I am humanity.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.890
&gt;&gt;Vernor [inaudible]

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.650
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Yeah.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.270
And it seems a little atypical.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:28.950
Especially for you since as you pointed out
earlier you seem to have a very individualistic

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.540
idea of where things are going.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.940
And anarchists where government doesn't represent
everything.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.670
I was wondering if you could say anything
about the race and its characters.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:39.160
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I think you're right about the tone
and the implication.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.790
And at the time my excuse was, this is more
or less an internal excuse.

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:47.320
I tried to reflect this in facts that were
in the story.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:54.440
Is that it was so expensive to get an interstellar
link.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:01.140
That really only large institutions or, and
could afford to do it.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.720
And so you would not see the sort of person
that you would sort of, sender that you would

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.220
see on a planetary, or a planetary system.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.370
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So it's actually MIT community
that's sending these messages.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.980
&gt;&gt;Vernor: At least, right.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.510
Now the question then is, why is it so informal.

01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:24.490
And I blame that on the, on the final step
of the interface software.

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.490
[laughter]

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.930
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Alright, so one last one.

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:31.650
We'll give you some closing comments and then
we can sign books and so on.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:36.460
&gt;&gt;Male #10: So I think science fiction fans
in general and especially those who are also

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.580
computer scientists have a real interest in
what the idea of a communicating galactic

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.360
civilization looks like and what that network
looks like.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:52.500
You talk a lot about, OK, how do you have
this system where the bandwidth is very low,

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.040
it, the bandwidth is very low, but so is the
latency.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.090
So you can essentially like get around the
speed of light, but messages are very expensive

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.600
to send and slow to send.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.640
I'm wondering if you thought about, OK, what
if, you know you thought about what if the

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640
singularity doesn't happen.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.200
But what if special relativity, there's no
cheats?

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.020
What if you know we are restricted to the
speed of light to send messages.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.460
But on the other hand, the bandwidth can actually
be relatively large.

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:20.460
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Ah.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.460
Right.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.460
Right.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.230
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Can there be a communicating galactic
civilization that way?

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:26.960
And have you thought about what that would
look like?

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.391
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Actually that was one thing that
I tried to look at some in A Deepness In the

01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:32.990
Sky.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:40.210
And in that situation I think I make a comment
that, what happens when it takes a century

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:44.070
to do a three-way handshake?

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:45.070
And

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:46.070
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Use EDP.

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.070
[laughter]

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.070
&gt;&gt;Vernor: It wouldn't be, well, yes.

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.740
But I think that this came after my teaching
times.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.050
But you know Vince Surf's Interplanetary Oracle?

01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:59.990
That would have made such a great project
in a network class.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:04.380
Because nowadays when you, when a student
takes a network class, you have the, one of

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.490
the seven lay, the ISO layers.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:14.119
It's given by God, and all the different design
decisions are written there in stone.

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:18.450
And if you are, if you're actually going to
be a protocol person, that, I think that's

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:21.000
a very bad and dangerous way to look at it.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.761
Because you don't know what the axioms are.

01:07:22.761 --> 01:07:24.410
You don't know what the assumptions were.

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:26.540
You don't know what the problems are that
are being solved.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.360
There's just all these things you have to
do to make it work right.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:35.830
The wonderful thing about Surf's, a wonderful
thing about Vint Cerf's interplanetary network

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:39.650
is that there were some really different ground
assumptions.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:40.920
Now this isn't what you were talking about.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.630
It's still within the solar system.

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:48.480
Latency and availability that made all sorts
of decisions work out differently.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.890
And you essentially have to recapitulate the
sort of creativity that went into designing

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:57.730
the original NCP and TCP.

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:02.850
So, if you step that up to the interstellar
thing, where you're talking about years between,

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:07.030
that I think is still an open, not that I'm
predicting we're gonna get interstellar travel

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:10.940
in the next 30 years.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.940
But I am.

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.940
[laughter]

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:19.460
But that would actually make a cool, a cool
sort of toy project for a course in protocol

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.460
design.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:25.190
Because you would be forcing people to look
at things for, in a way that they haven't

01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:28.480
had to look at things in, since 1960s.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.290
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now, is there anyone on
VC with a burning question?

01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:34.370
No.

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.440
OK.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.180
So, to close up, what's gonna be in A Fire
Upon The Children In The Deepness Of The Sky.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.280
[laughter]

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.830
Since you do seem to try and mold words from
old book titles into the sentences of your

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:47.830
new book titles.

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:49.070
Or maybe your editors do.

01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:52.500
What are you looking at for the future?

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.630
And then we'll get to signing and lunch.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:59.731
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Charlie Stross, once had an interview
with Locus, where he was talking about the

01:08:59.731 --> 01:09:05.620
singularity and his book, The Accelerando,
did what I never dared to do.

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:10.370
Which was to try to traipse through a singularity
scenario.

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:15.800
But he made the statement that I think he
said, I agree with these assertions that you

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.620
know we can't really know what it would be
like.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.560
But then he said, you know, time passes.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.850
And I'll bet you as we go through the next
10 or 15 years, not having gotten to the singularity,

01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.180
that our understanding of what it would be
like will get to be better.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:40.109
And actually I have some ideas for writing
a story that would be inside the singularity

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:44.239
and still with obviously with human sized
characters.

01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:47.720
Partly because of what has happened in the
last 10 or 12 years.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.210
And seeing how things are going.

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:53.720
I think there really are some novel things
that I could say.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:59.000
So that's a chief competitor against immediately
doing another zone story.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.590
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and the fans won't strangle
you.

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:01.590
So.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:04.860
&gt;&gt;Vernor: I have to have, I have a hiding
place in the 20th century that I repair to.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.860
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Excellent.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.580
Well ,thanks very much for coming here, Vernor.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580
&gt;&gt;Vernor: Thank you.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:08.581
[applause]
