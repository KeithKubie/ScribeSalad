00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Instructor] What would
a piece of cheese say

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.940
if you took its picture.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.270
Well this right over here is a question.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.220
What would a piece of cheese
say if you took its picture?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.080
Which is an interesting question.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.190
So we need to put a
question mark at the end.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.290
So we need to put a
question mark at the end

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.020
and out of all of these choices,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.250
the second one right over here

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.683
has a question mark at the end,
so definitely go with that.
