00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.340
My Aunt Sally is on line two.
Aunt Sal, what up?

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.180
Hey, you did okay
the other night.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.880
Yeah.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.670
Just okay?

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.700
You did great, babe.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.360
Thank you Aunt Sal.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.440
Yeah, you did real good.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.780
What was your favorite part,
any ...

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.140
The end of it.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.960
The end of it?
Oh. You old bitch.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.200
Good morning squirt nation.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.620
It's You Up with Nikki Glaser.
This is Nikki Glaser.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.320
I am in New York City because
I am no longer in Los Angeles

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.669
because I was voted off
Dancing With the Stars.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.170
Two nights ago.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.480
I can't even believe it was
just so like two nights ago.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.240
It was so recent.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.630
I'm in studio today
in New York City.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.620
Tom Thakkar is not here today,
he is in Toronto

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.020
all weekend performing at the
Just for Laughs Festival,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.320
but today to fill in
for him we've got

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.670
Puddle Boy Andrew Collin.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.000
Puddle, puddle, squirt, squirt.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.210
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.590
Yup. All right.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.550
All right. And then, this show's
off to a great start.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.460
I thought you were going to
come in with like a Tom song.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.664
I'm never good at the beginning
or the end.

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:20.420
Okay.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.730
In the middle, though,
I'm great.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.990
Listen and that's what
anyone remembers

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.220
is the beginning and the end.
And that's why you're ...

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.530
A star.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.800
Immemborable.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.760
That's why I used
to walk your dogs.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.020
For free.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.280
For free?

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.630
Huh? You paid me?

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.240
Yes I did. Don't make it sound
like you ever walked my ...

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.520
I paid you well.
Do I owe you money still?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.900
Is that what this is about?

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.530
I mean I didn't want to
do it on air, but ...

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.770
Do I owe you money still?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.320
Just $50,000.
No way though.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.740
No, you honestly, I counted,
it's three walks you still ...

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.190
I still owe you for three walks?
Are you serious?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.340
Do I literally owe you
for three walks?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.570
I will Venmo you right now.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.830
Pay $60 please. I'll send it
right back because I'm lying.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.180
Are you ... do I owe you?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.070
No. What kind of monster
would I be?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.270
But you do owe me

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.050
for carrying that bag
up the stairs last night.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.710
I do, I do.
Andrew came over last night.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.860
Ian Fidance is here by the way,
everyone. How's it going, Ian?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.500
Hey. I loved you on Dancing
With the Stars.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.720
Thank you.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.440
Yeah, it was amazing and I was
wondering,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.420
you were dancing so well
and the judges were terrible.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.750
I thought one of them-

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.080
Yeah, it's like what is your
pressing question for me.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.030
Well, I just thought
one of the judges,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.180
they had all this time
to critique you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180
but none of them asked
how's your butt hole.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.470
And you know what I had so much
to say about that.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.980
Can we clear up all Dancing
With the Stars ...

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.960
can I just, I'll just say
Cheryl Burke

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.990
who's been on the show
since, for 21 seasons,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.840
says they've never had to do
this much work on a show,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.100
on the first two weeks
of a show.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.300
We had to learn three dances,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630
usually you do one dance
a week in the beginning

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.280
and then it gets more intense.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.690
This was I had to learn
four dances

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.200
but I never got to the fourth
but I learned three.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.820
You'll see, I'll post videos
from my rehearsals

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.530
because I do some
pretty impressive stuff

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.230
in the third dance, I gotta say.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.790
But I got injured from working
on the third dance,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.190
which I never got to perform,
and then ...

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.660
so I was just, I was bummed man.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.740
I was really sad and Gleb and I
weren't really getting along.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.940
Not that I wasn't getting along,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.280
but I was just so disappointed
in myself for him

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.680
because he's such a good dancer
and I want him to be on the show

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.800
and when your eliminated
you don't ...

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.750
he's still going to be featured
on the show but I was,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.730
I just felt like such a failure
for him and he was mad

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.580
that I was injured
but not mad at me.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.490
We just, it's such a weird
relationship with your dancer.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.260
It's like a relationship
and I was like, I feel like Gleb

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.310
has filed for divorce
and hasn't told me yet.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.000
Like that's kind of
the sense I got,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.750
like he's already checked out
and then I eventually ...

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.660
we kind of connected
and had a good moment

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.060
before our first dance
where he was like,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.710
"You got this,
believe in yourself."

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.950
And everything.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.700
And I also got a couple emails
from people being like,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.260
mind over matter,
we know you're injured.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.260
This one friend wrote and email
that said she coaches gymnastics

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.710
and when her gymnasts
get injured

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.610
she tells them to repeat
the mantra,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.000
"I'm strong, I'm prepared,
and this is easy."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.250
So I just started saying,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.350
"I'm strong,
I'm prepared, this is easy."

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.050
From the moment I was in that
makeup chair crying

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.550
until show time I must have said
it 2,000 times out loud

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.410
and just walking around.
People thought I was crazy

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.600
but then I went to camera
blocking an hour after makeup

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.280
and I was like about to watch
the girl do my dance again

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.090
and I started kind of ...

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.530
I watched her video from the day
before

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.210
and I was like teach me
how you looked at the camera,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.630
I was asking her
to do simple things

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.610
where I could actually
maybe move and get my ...

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.780
and then I started moving and I
was like I think I can do this.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.840
And then I went out and did
the camera blocking

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.160
and Tom Bergeron,
the host, was watching was like

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.070
I thought you were injured
and I was like, "I did too."

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.860
It literally like, my mind ...
and I am because afterwards

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.890
it really hurt
and then I got ...

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.600
but I was able
to get through the pain

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.960
by just changing my mindset,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.420
so I've
always been someone who's like,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.010
oh you can meditate
your way out of pain,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.140
a lot of our physical ailments,
our back pain, is just mental.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.340
And people always go,
"No, I actually have a tear."

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.390
Well I did too
but it can be made worse,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.620
an actual physical tear,
the pain can be made worse

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.330
by the way you
mentally think about it.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.900
I know there's an injury there

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.730
but you got to change the way
you think about your pain

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.860
because you really
can overcome it.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.080
It still hurt because there was
an injury there,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.870
but when you're going through
a lot of stress

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.400
and you're down on yourself,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400
your brain needs a place
to go put that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.390
and it finds the weakness
in your body,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.790
which is wherever
you have a tear,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.040
and it fucking beats
the shit out of it

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.110
until you release that stress
and so that's what ...

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.880
when I was able to
just like wrap my head around

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.030
you're strong,
you're prepared, you're ready.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.250
It's easy.
It was crazy how it worked.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.780
So I was able to dance.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.330
I don't know where
I'm going with this.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.770
No, but like your actual dance,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.340
like when you were dancing,
did you have to think about it?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.600
Yes, yes, yes.
Did the practice-

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.410
Yes, that was the problem,
because I didn't have practices

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.700
going in it was not like
second nature to me.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.480
So like I wasn't ...
when I do The Tonight Show

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.170
I don't have to think about
what step is next

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.690
because yes it is a set
that I've constructed

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.520
and I'm not used to saying it
in this order,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.390
but there's a cue card
in front of me

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.010
with the jokes listed
in case I forget.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.680
Which I don't because
I've said this ...

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.150
I know how to do comedy.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.420
But when you're doing a step

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.360
and you're like there's
another step to come.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.060
The step is coming, you don't
get to make a pause and go,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.880
"So what else am I talking
about?" Like there's ...

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.810
And it's loud in there
and it's like-

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.480
And if you don't know the step
you just don't know

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.560
and you do have someone
to lead you.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.680
I wish I would have,
in retrospect,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.250
I wish I would have thought
about dancing

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.290
as less of a me on my own

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.570
and Gleb kind of just guiding me
and

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.520
that I would have looked at it
as we were both one entity,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.330
and I think that's really hard
for me as a comic who's been ...

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.440
you're so solitary up there.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.940
I really thought
about my performance

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.080
and if you look at us,
I was dancing like by myself.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.310
I wasn't dancing with him,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.530
and I wish I would have thought
of it more as a unit,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.980
which he tried to get through
to me so many times.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.720
I really love dancing now.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.970
I'm going
to do hip hop dance classes.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.620
I know that I can learn steps.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.270
I wish I would have stayed
in the competition

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.210
because I would have been
such a more fast learner.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.500
It took me a month
to learn two dances

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.200
that were very similar

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.850
but then the third dance
I got so much quicker.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.310
And then different styles
of dances,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.290
I would have been so good
at the fox trot,

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.140
like where it's like
you just are ...

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.160
it's a slower dance.
I would have been so good at it.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.280
I kind of got screwed
with my dance style up top,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.720
I'm not a sexy salsa mama.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.000
That's a little intimidating
coming into the box with.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.260
That's how I always
thought of you.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.470
Yeah.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.130
That's how you're in my phone.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.450
A little Latin fox.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.150
But let me just tell you,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.930
being eliminated
from a reality show

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.210
where it's like ...
and the next to go ...

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.510
like I was on that show,
I've been on that show before

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.170
because I've been
on Last Comic Standing twice

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.240
and been eliminated
where they go "moving on".

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.500
But I've never had my name said
as the eliminated.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.450
You know what I mean?
Like it's usually and moving on,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.680
and then your name
doesn't get said,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.570
but I've never heard
who won't be ...

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.000
Do they pause for
like 20 minutes.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.700
... and I knew,
I knew I was going.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.550
I was staring down at the ground
and I knew

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.540
they were going to say
Nikki and Gleb. I just knew it.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.040
I knew it ...
I had so much fun after I danced

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.730
because I just wanted
to have a good showing,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.570
I wanted to have
a good talk time with the judges

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.520
and with Tom
and with Aaron Anders.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.790
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.400
I wanted that all to go well
and when that was done

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.930
there was like a live
performance from this girl

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:38.810
whose song Mackenzie Ziegler,
she sang the song "Wonderful",

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.060
which we have to bump in and out
of break the rest of the show

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.290
with the song "Wonderful",

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.790
it just came out,
I'm obsessed with it.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.730
She played it so many times
in rehearsals

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.060
that I learned the song and so

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.150
by the time she played it
for the first time on air,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.670
Sia wrote the song
so it's amazing

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.140
and she's so good,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.900
but I just like
danced by myself,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.750
not by myself but we were all up
in the sky box

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.360
which is like the balcony
where all the dancers,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.190
like the little bullpen,
and we were all up there

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.990
and I just like danced
during her performance

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.770
and was like this
is my last time

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.570
to like be on the show,
have fun, no cameras were on me,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.230
and I just had the greatest time
at this

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.380
like McKenzie Ziegler concert
is how I treated it.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.480
And then I went downstairs
and got eliminated.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.820
And it felt, I just felt bad
because I wanted Gleb

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.890
to like have his showing on TV.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.610
And he will,
like he'll go on and ...

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.960
I think Gleb will be fine.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.570
He's going to be fine
but he really is so hot.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.860
I met him yesterday.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:40.440
So yesterday, so I flew to
New York immediately with Gleb

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.570
and then I go, you know what,
I'm going to spin this bitch.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.270
Tomorrow I'm going on
Good Morning America,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.250
who has that opportunity
that often.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.770
This is still part of the show.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.820
I'm going to kill it on
Good Morning America.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.200
So I started writing jokes,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.590
I started
strategizing with Gleb,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.800
what are we going to talk about,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.150
how are we going
to do the segment,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.880
and I was like we have one more
performance, let's nail it.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.170
And we went into
Good Morning America

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.410
with one hour of sleep,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.236
we both got on the plane,
we watched I Feel Pretty

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:05.280
together, I fell asleep,
he loved it.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.440
And he's like,
"You should do more acting."

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.860
Like he was trying to push me
into the thing

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.560
that I'm actually good at.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.100
And we went on
Good Morning America,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.090
we killed,
we had the best morning

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.880
because whenever Gleb
and I dance

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.770
it's always a struggle because
I'm so bad at it

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.010
and he gets frustrated.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.340
And eventually we have fun
and we had good rehearsals,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.880
but whenever
we would go do press

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.950
together, it was so much fun

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.310
because I got to shine
and show what I'm good at

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.730
and I got to teach him
a thing or two

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.080
because he wants to be better
about being on the mic

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.900
because English
is his second language

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.440
and he's like so hot
that he like

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.780
doesn't have to talk
for people to want to like him.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.390
Kevin Hart's going to be in here
in a second.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.910
Should we talk to him
about having resentments

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.250
because I'm sure he has some.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.470
Yeah, for sure.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.150
Oh look it he's getting
all ready to come in here.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.650
I'm sure he still hates
a lot of people.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.920
Yeah.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.620
He's about to hate one more.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.519
Don't tell him about my teeth.
Don't open with the teeth.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.250
He's walking into studio now.
I ...

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.720
You have poodles?
... what'd you say?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.760
You have poodles I can walk?

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.010
Kevin Hart.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.310
Hello.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.580
Hi, I'm Nikki, nice to meet you.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.790
Good to meet you.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.020
This is Ian and Andrew.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.280
Hey Ian.
Hey, what's up man.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.500
Let me shake your hand.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.820
They're anticipating that
you'll see something in them

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.280
and produce something for them.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.560
Yeah, yeah.
We were talking.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.600
So you just want to really take
in their comedic talent.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.310
No, this is great,
I'm looking at them right now.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.540
Yeah, we get it.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.090
Got anything, got it.
It's pretty ...

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.440
I started at The Laugh House.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.710
Oh get outta here, Philadelphia?

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wow.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.270
In Philly.
From Philadelphia?

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.510
Yeah.
Get outta here.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.740
I'm from Wilmington, Delaware,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.390
I drive up to Philly
every night.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.390
Were you in the Mr. Rod Money
years or before then?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.670
Mr. Rod.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.930
Mr. Rod Money years, okay, good.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.130
What does that mean?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.360
That was one of the owners.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.560
Oh, okay, all right.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.790
Just testing to make sure
that he ain't lying.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.520
He would have agreed
to anything you said, though.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He was great.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.420
You there when Derek Jeter
had it?

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.100
Yeah, yeah.
Number two, number two.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.450
Yeah.
That's when he was great.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.740
So, Kevin, you just came
into a conversation.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.600
We were talking about
holding onto resentments.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.880
People in the business early on

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.880
who tried to like
hold you back as a comedian.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.710
I had a female comic
who just hated me

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.160
and spread lies about me
and rumors to hold me back.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.630
And letting go
of those eventually

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.890
and I just talked myself
through it

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.040
and realized I'm still very mad
at this person.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.590
I still wish her the worst.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.250
As you kept talking
about it you realized that?

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.510
Yeah, I just realized.
Still festering.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.750
You know I think
I'm still angry.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.960
Yeah.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.160
I don't think I've really
gotten past it.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.710
What about you?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.580
I'm a different breed.
I don't let much bother me.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.140
It's hard to poke a hole
in my armor.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.380
Yeah.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.930
The reason why is because and
this is going to help you a lot,

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.620
it takes so much energy
to be negative.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.420
You waste so much energy
holding a grudge

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.180
or figuring out ways
to maintain anger.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.040
Because you got to create it
everyday or every time you see

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.780
that person you got
to conjure up more anger.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.610
Like I was happy
but now let me be mad.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.810
Yes.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.600
And that energy is energy
that's being misused.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.140
You know, so if you're true
to your craft,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.310
you're true
to what you really do,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.770
that's energy
that should be placed

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:13.420
and put into what you love.
If you choose not to do that,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.860
then ultimately
you're cheating yourself.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.780
So what I understood
at a young age,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.440
and I got tons of rejection,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.539
is that this is
what's supposed to happen.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.440
I'm supposed to go through this

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.750
because ultimately
it's going to stop

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.730
and when it stops I'm supposed
to be okay and ready

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.390
for whatever opportunities
that are coming my way.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.870
So instead of looking down
on the hate

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.260
or the negativity
or the nose, I embraced it.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.120
I love that and I was voted off

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.720
Dancing With the Stars
two nights ago.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.120
I was the first
contestant eliminated.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.670
Big story around here, actually.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.620
Huge. Sweeping the hallways,
this is Sirius XM.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.710
Very, very huge story
as I was walking up they said

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.720
are you going to go on the air
just know

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.410
that she just got voted
off of Dancing With the Stars

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.530
so don't say nothing about that.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.280
TMZ is in the hallway.
I wasn't ...

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.880
She'd have a lot of resentment
towards you.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.270
That's the last thing
that I was going to say

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.500
but now that you bring it up,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.130
you made it
an interesting topic.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.010
Have you ever done anything
where you've agreed to it

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.010
and it's been something
that is ...

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.460
what's been
the scariest endeavor

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.000
you've taken
on professionally I guess.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.250
Scariest endeavor?

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.130
Where you've had the most fear,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.960
because I've never
danced before in my life

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.580
and I was like I'm about
to do something

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.360
I know I'm terrible at
on national television.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.630
Have you ever ...

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.850
have you done
something like that

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.260
and how did you feel
on the other side of it?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.230
Tons. There's tons.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.520
Yeah.
Tons of things.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.110
What's the most nervous
you've been,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.230
or the most oh shit do I have
this moment in your career?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.190
The most nervous?
It's going to sound crazy

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.170
but I'm probably the most
confident person in the world

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.550
so even when I've been
like holy cow,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.450
there's now way, I still would
put on a face like I'm okay.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.360
Like I did Fool's Gold, it was
a movie called Fool's Gold

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.980
that we had to film
in Australia.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.870
And I lied. They were like,
"Are you okay with water?

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.280
Are you okay
to get in the water?"

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.670
Yes, like I'm actually
an excellent swimmer,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.090
you know like this
is a true story.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.320
Yeah.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.520
Made it to the junior Olympics.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.220
Yes.
Fucking excellent swimmer.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.470
What was your stroke?

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.880
100 meter backstroke,
50 meter freestyle.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.170
Nice.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.550
My prime for a minute
went between my ages of like 12

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.760
and 15 was individual medley,
100 meter IM,

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.860
that's when I was like really,
really moving.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.100
That was the real deal.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.560
Swam like a 20,
20.2 50 meter freestyle.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.770
Yards. 100 meter backstroke
I was probably like the 53,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.070
54 range.
I was pretty good.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.280
Real good.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.900
This is all, you can go find
this information.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.190
It's online.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.680
I don't know what any
of that means

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.970
but that sounds really good.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.300
Swim talk.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.540
Swim talk.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.240
That's why my back
is so amazing.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.130
But in the movie Fool's Gold,
I don't like the ocean.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.230
Like unless I know like
where I am in the ocean

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.650
and what is in here
and I've heard it specifically,

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.980
I don't like the ocean.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.620
Australia is
a different ballgame

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.920
when it comes to the ocean.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.240
Because everything is there.
Everything is in Australia.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.490
Great white sharks.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.710
So, you know, they're like
are you okay

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:59.920
with getting in the ocean?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.520
I was like yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just wanted the job.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.740
Yeah.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.820
Man this scene came up
and they're like, all right,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.150
this is where you fall
in the water.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.850
And I was like, "Huh?"

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.950
It was like these Irukandjis
that we kept hearing

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.090
about that was the most
deadliest jellyfish in the world

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.880
but we had heard rumors
that they were in the water.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.990
Man, I said guys,
"I don't know."

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.850
And he was like, "What do
you mean you don't know?"

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.130
I was like,
"I just don't know,

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.680
I feel like
it's Irukandji in there."

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.560
They were like, "But you said
you were okay with the ocean."

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.970
I was like,
"Nah, I know I said that,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.540
I definitely said that,
I definitely said."

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.190
He was like,
"Well, you gotta get in."

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.860
I was like, "I just want
to take to y'all about it,

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.270
I just don't ... I don't know
if we need this moment.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.640
Do we really need ..."
I like tried to back track

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.160
and instantly I said,
"Okay, let's do it."

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.120
And I did about 13 of the worst
takes that you've ever seen.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.300
Like they edited it
out of the movie it was so bad.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.680
But I knew it.
Like as I'm doing it,

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.410
I was like oh this isn't
going to see the light of day,

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.630
I'm not even acting.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.840
Yes.
This is complete fear.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.530
I was supposed to be
the tough guy in this situation,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.810
I'm not pulling it off at all.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.500
That was the most uncomfortable
I've ever been,

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.720
but afterwards I was like it
is what it is, shoulder shrug.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.940
Can't change it.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.140
You can't change it.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.860
You can't change it, they saw
it, all right.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.320
I know, onto the next thing.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.590
Gotta put that in your back
pocket.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.260
Yeah, I mean,
but what is the ...

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.550
because getting voted off
a reality show,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.700
being the first one voted off,
like I lost.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.930
Gotta be somebody.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.640
Like I lost the most.
It's gotta be somebody, right?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.900
It's gotta be somebody.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.130
What's the most rejection ...

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.400
what do you do when you feel
that level of rejection

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.000
which is like this
is the worst I could do

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.600
and it happened,
my biggest fear happened.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.800
Which, I mean, what level.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.899
I've experienced
every level of rejection.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.270
Has it ever got you down
in a way

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.490
where you really
had to overcome it?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.860
I'll give you two good ones.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.100
Yeah.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.910
Comic Strip, Lucien,
what's the last name, Holt?

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.120
Was it Holts or Hold?

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.880
I wasn't around for that,
but yeah.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.470
Lucien ... legend
for picking talent.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.700
Yeah.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.200
He's the man that discovered
Eddie Murphy.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.650
Lucien.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.480
Kevin, you got an audition
at the Comic Strip.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.420
Oh my god.
I been killing all around town.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.520
I got into every comedy club.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.280
Comic Strip was last.
They saved the best for last.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.600
I'm going here
and I'm going to kill.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.240
I go perform. Crowd goes crazy.
I can admit that my jokes back

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.510
then weren't
that ground breaking,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.510
this wasn't cutting edge
material, but it was good.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.190
It was good enough.
Yeah.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.620
I'm a young comic, I'm 24.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.830
Oh my god.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.060
After you get off stage,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.270
Lucien calls you
in the back room

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.780
and he sits you down
so you can find out if you pass.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.560
Oh my, I've never been
more confident in my life.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.840
Mm-hmm.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.490
This is it. Lucien had a disease

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.750
and I remember his hands
and stuff were taped up.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.320
I forgot what disease were,
but things would fall off.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.280
Like limbs were falling off,
this isn't making a joke.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.540
Leprosy?

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.350
Yes. Like this was real.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.680
Right.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.860
So bandages and stuff on but
it didn't matter,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.620
like this guy's a legend.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.870
Yeah.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.840
In his most vulnerable state

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.850
of the last stages
of the disease

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.400
that he was dealing with,
this man told me,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.850
he said,
"Comedy isn't for you."

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.110
I'm like what, huh?
I'm waiting for the ha-ha.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.620
The punchline.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.940
He said, "Maybe you should
pursue something else.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.800
Maybe find a job,
but I don't see ..."

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.050
Swimming?

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.980
And so calm, I just don't see
you doing this long.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.070
And I'm like, "What?
What are you talking ...

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.330
I don't understand."

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:41.860
And you just killed.
I just killed.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.780
He's like, that's not,
I just don't see talent.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.210
I'm not going to pass you.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.940
And I sat there for a second
and I remember his hands

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.270
were like up in the air,
they had tape on them.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.620
I could have said mean things,
I could have been like you ...

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.320
I could have said
a lot of stuff.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.680
I stared at him for a minute
and he was like, "Thank you."

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.090
He kicked me out, like within
this condition, "thank you".

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.040
And I was like, "That's it?"
He was like, "Yes, that's it."

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.860
I get up, I walk out, my friend
Keith Robinson is outside,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.370
Keith's like,
"What'd he say, Stupid?"

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:23.550
And I was like, "He told me
I should get a regular job.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.960
He told me
that this isn't for me.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.340
This is not a good job."

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.400
Like I should find
something else.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.930
And Keith's honest reaction,
he was like, "Fuck him."

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.030
I was like, "Huh?"

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.270
"Fuck him. So what, Stupid,
let's get something to eat."

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.770
And Keith is,
this is my mentor,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.370
this is like the guy who's been
giving me advice or whatever.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.570
He didn't blink two eyes.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.790
Yeah, he knew.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.440
He wasn't devastated at all.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.020
And he said let's get
something to eat

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.720
and it was like
nothing happened.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:01.380
And instantly I processed that
moment as like what is that ...

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.100
am I going to stop
because of that information?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.350
So what am I holding onto?

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.570
Right.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.130
I immediately let it go
and we ate. And I was fine.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.210
We went up at a spot
later that day

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.960
and I just went
to the comedy clubs

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.140
that accepted me
and worked those

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.670
and the Comic Strip
eventually found out

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.920
and they called me later on,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.340
but I'd learned at the young age
of 23, 24 to say, "Fuck it."

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.840
So many people can't say,
"Fuck it."

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.940
So many people allow emotion
to overtake reality.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.910
Fuck it is reality.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.500
What just happened
30 seconds ago

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.860
I cannot change.
I don't have that power.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.390
I don't know
how to go back in time.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.720
You'll figure it out.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.380
If anyone can figure out
the power to go back and change-

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.830
If I could I would, but I can't
you know wave my hands

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.680
and take that time back.
It happened.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.750
That's why I address things
the way that I do.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.340
That's why I have no problem
with admitting right from wrong.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.680
I have no problem
with being real and authentic.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.240
I'm a person.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.900
Are you an apologizer?
Does that come easy to you?

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.190
An apologizer.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.400
Like if you ...

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.050
If I'm wrong?
... if you're wrong.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.849
They say never apologize
for a joke.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.669
Are you good at being
able to be like,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.750
even in interactions
with your kids or your wife

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.740
or just saying, "I'm sorry",
are you a good apologizer?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.320
Because some people
struggle with that.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.470
The older you get,
the more mature you get.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.860
That should happen.
If it's not happening,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.650
then I suggest you sit yourself
down and ask yourself why.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.900
You're supposed
to get more mature.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.130
Yeah.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.200
I've fucked up a lot.
I've done a lot of wrong.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.520
And me doing wrong,

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.180
I've realized
it's not just wrong it's stupid.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.020
Okay, Kev,
how do you grow from stupid?

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.050
How do you grow?

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.990
You embrace what you did,
you own it,

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.560
because you made that bed
so you lay in it.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.200
After you lay in it,
you get out that bed

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.480
and you say, you know what,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.120
I don't want to make this bed
again for a long time.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.320
Yes.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.060
I don't want to make it again.
So I'm now aware. I'm conscious.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.830
So when you say jokes
or apologize

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.820
for things you say on stage,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.600
I don't say things that are
going to put me in a position

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.550
to have to apologize
because I'm aware.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.110
So the lesson taught to myself,
be aware.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.770
Don't be ignorant to what can

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.460
because you can always
prevent it before it happens.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.640
So before you put yourself
in a position to apologize

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.720
there's a beat where you get
to make a decision,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.350
do I want to throw this shit.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:25.660
Yes.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.760
Do I want to say this, do I want
to call them this name,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.440
do I want to use this term
at this moment,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.650
is there another route

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.700
that I can take
to get the same message across?

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.250
There always is.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.690
Do you still make those
mistakes though?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.530
And are you still willing
to make those mistakes?

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.700
Because I hear what
you're saying but I ...

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.970
when I mess up

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.220
it's sometimes hard
to acknowledge it and apologize

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.540
because then I feel like
an essentially flawed person,

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.440
but what you're saying
is like you can acknowledge that

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.860
and say no I'm going
to be better from now.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.910
What's wrong with being flawed?

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.110
That's a great point.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.420
What's wrong with being flawed?

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.440
So many people want
to live a perfect life

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.910
and I hate that, I'm coming off
like such a motivational speaker

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.480
but I'm just saying real shit.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.920
So many people want
to live a perfect life

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.200
but you have no idea
what perfection is

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.690
unless you've
experienced imperfection.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.900
Yeah.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.140
You don't know what perfect

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.239
is unless
you've experienced imperfection.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.430
In other words, embrace your
flaws, embrace your fuck ups,

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.990
they help make you ultimately

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.950
become the perfect person
you want to be.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.190
Yup.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.800
What individual do you believe
that's perfect?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.310
Sometimes you look and you go,
they are perfect,

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.640
but it's all just ...

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.970
I don't really know what's
going on with them, you know?

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.810
You don't ...
what does it matter?

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.990
So if you're saying
I don't want to be flawed,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.650
why, what's my question to you.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.230
Because I don't want to hurt
other people,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.300
I don't want
to be misinterpreted

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.710
and thought of as a bad person.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.560
Like I think there's
a fundamental part

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.040
of a lot of us that just thinks
secretly I'm a bad person,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.260
people are going to find out.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.480
You know what I think?
What?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.760
I think you think too much.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.990
Yeah, I do do that.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.540
I think you overthink a thought

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.270
before it becomes
a real thought.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.820
You're thinking about
the thought behind a thought

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.020
that maybe

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.310
because I think
that this could.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.600
Yeah.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.070
It's a bunch of shit
that makes no sense.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.290
Like you ...
It's a waste of time.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.370
... you have no action yet.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.670
You're thinking about
all this stuff

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.569
before an action
has even taken place.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.650
Kevin Hart is here.
He has a new movie out,

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.600
Night School, which I haven't
had a chance to see yet.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.980
Ian, you saw it.
I saw it, yeah.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.210
You loved it.
Yeah.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.410
Did you like it, Ian?
Yeah, I liked it a lot man.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:21.190
It's coming out tonight.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.390
There's some funny parts
in there, man.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.630
Yeah.
Laugh out loud moments.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.860
Yes.
I'm so excited about this movie.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.110
Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart,
what more could you ask for?

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.560
And this is a movie
about second chances.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.780
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Is what I've heard.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.010
Yeah, just what
we were talking about.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.560
That's crazy that it's honestly
right on par

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.760
with this conversation.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.680
Well tell me how so.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.320
So, back to the point
of what we were discussing,

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.520
it's a movie about people
that feel like

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.810
because they didn't get it right
the first time

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.000
that there's no reason
to go back and try again

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.950
because they don't want
to be perceived

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.350
as a person that failed.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.690
I don't want to look like
I failed,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.340
I don't want to look stupid,
I don't want to look like

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.090
I couldn't do it
so I'm just going to not do it.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:01.360
Yes.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.810
Or trying to lie to make it
seem like you're not.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.070
You're trying to create
a false presentation

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.720
of who you are based

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.170
on what you think
the opinions of others will be.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.930
So in this movie
it basically shines a light

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.630
on those type of individuals

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.130
by looking through a lens
of a character

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.060
I play named Teddy Walker
who's putting on a façade

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.630
to a woman that
he's very much in love with

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.479
and making it seem like he's
in a position that he's not.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.800
And when his charm and wit
and personality runs out

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.010
and he's in a situation where
his back's against the wall,

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.230
he's forced to get his

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.430
GED, he doesn't have a GED
but nobody knows.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.600
He has to for the first time
apply himself

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.200
like he's never had
while trying to hide it

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.099
ultimately he comes across
other people like himself

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.600
and they band together
and realize

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.250
it's okay to be who we are.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.640
Yeah.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.330
And the piece of paper
that we look at that

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.420
can be sort of the diploma
has a much bigger meaning,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.980
that piece of paper
makes you feel like hey

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.090
I'm making steps in the right
direction to succeed in life.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.750
This makes me feel like I can.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.500
That piece of paper,
at the older age that he was at,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.360
put him in position
to feel like now can.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.060
So this movie is
about doing things

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.380
that you think
you've already ...

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.590
it's too late to do them.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.880
Yeah.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.610
But putting on an effort
to do that and by doing that ...

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.000
by putting in the effort maybe

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.590
if you don't even get
the piece of paper.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.150
It's still the effort.
It's still the effort.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.440
Keep going back.
My guy does that ...

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.660
That's what I like.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.270
... he doesn't get the piece
of paper right away.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's failing.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.810
It's the fine beat
of how he's failing.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.010
The GED is a tough test.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.260
Oh no, 100%.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.750
It's a tough test.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.740
It's just saying there's
nothing wrong with failing.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.660
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.930
Especially later in life, too.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.450
Kevin Hart though,
you think Kevin Hart

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.930
and you go this guy
doesn't fail.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.460
It's so nice to hear
that from you

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.790
because the reason you seem
like someone who doesn't fail

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.220
is because you've failed so much

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.070
and you have the attitude
of someone that says

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.270
there's nothing wrong with that.
Failure isn't failure.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.780
It's not failure.
It grooms you for the wins.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.640
Right now
I'm so determined to do so much

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.939
because I know what
the other side looks like.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.340
Now I know I can't lose.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.730
Because I have so much
information on how to lose.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.000
Yes.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.280
So if I didn't
take those losses,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.630
then I don't know how to
properly take the wins.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.660
And some people take the losses
and then they just stop.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.890
Oh fuck that.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.100
Yeah. I'm not doing it again.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.850
There's an analogy my friend
Scooter,

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.420
Scooter Braun,
very, very good dude.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.580
Scooter Braun told me something
one day and it stuck with me.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.130
He said, "if I were to tell you
that right now I'm giving out

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:49.570
$5,000,000
to the first average individual

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.390
that can hit a home run
with a pitch

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.190
through by
a major league pitcher.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.660
He said,
there's going to be a line

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:04.270
that probably is the length
of the entire city.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.400
There's going to be a line.
Crazy people lined up.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.530
The wait in that line
could be days

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.230
before you get
to get up to bat."

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.300
He said, "So many people
want to get in that line

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.500
and they're going to strike out

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.000
because this is
a major league pitcher.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.330
And when they strike out
they have the opportunity

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.970
to go back
to the end of that line

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.590
and wait again if they want to,
or not, or they can go 'no way

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.280
I'm going to hit this pitch'."
Scooter said,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.230
"The difference between me
and everybody else in the world,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.270
I'm going to keep
getting back in that line

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.830
until they stop doing
whatever it is they're doing."

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.290
Whoa.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.050
He said, "I'm going to get back
in that line and wait."

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.750
He said because that line's
going to get shorter and shorter

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.950
because nobody else
is going to want to wait.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.430
When he said that,
I immediately said to myself,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.060
I would be
getting back in the line

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.550
because that's the type
of person I am.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.780
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.540
So with that analogy
it's a great moment for you

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.460
to ask yourself who are you,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.300
do you wait in a line
for three days

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.980
to take three swings at a ball

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.380
that's being thrown
at 105 miles per hour,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.700
or do you get up there
for the first time and go,

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.799
"Oh there's no way
I'm hitting that shit."

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.350
It could all be based upon
how many people quit

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.800
and then the last three people

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.240
they could get lobs
thrown at them.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.450
Yeah.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.900
Because they want to give
the money away.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.880
You would never know because
you turned your back away

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.090
before you got to that point.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.130
I'd be the person that pays
someone to wait in line for me.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.470
And then just shows.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.760
And then shows.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.650
That's not a bad idea.
Not a bad idea.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.960
Kevin Hart.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.500
How many times are you
going to pay them?

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.450
I knew I'd come out of this
conversation

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.060
with you feeling better
about just everything.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.300
You're so inspirational.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.500
Thank you.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.290
You're so incredible, I can't
wait to see Night School.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.530
Thank you.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.180
My mom I thought went
to night school for year,

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.430
I was like my mom
went to night school

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.120
because we'd always drop her
off at night school.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.570
Turns out she got a DUI
and had to go get classes

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.720
and just told me that
she was going to night school.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.500
I always go, "Mom, but you went
to night school right?"

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.850
She'd be like, "No I didn't."

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.380
And I go, "I remember
dropping you off there."

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.630
DUI.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.860
DUI.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.110
Kevin Hart, thank you
so much for being here.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.350
Thank you.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.080
Thank you for all your wisdom
and, god,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.370
I just love you so much.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.170
See Night School,
it is in theaters everywhere.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.130
Let's make this
a huge box office hit.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.970
Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart.
I can't wait.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.890
Night School is the movie,
Kevin Hart, thank you so much.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:35.090
Thank you. Piece of good gym
dropping for you before I go.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.650
Dancing With the Stars
was dope simply

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.060
because you got a platform
to show

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.840
that I'm okay
with not being comfortable.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.090
Yes.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.310
And now that you did that,

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.590
now you're back
to being comfortable.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.800
Move on.
Yes.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.000
It's over.
I love you Kevin.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.230
Love you guys,
appreciate you all.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.480
Thank you so much.
Take it easy.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.910
All right, we'll see you guys
next week on the show,

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.560
thanks for hanging out
with us this week.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.260
Squirt, squirt.
