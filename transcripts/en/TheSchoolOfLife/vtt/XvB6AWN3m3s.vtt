00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.450
If we’re alive and more or less functioning,
if we’re capable of taking joy in things

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.100
occasionally, if we can be kind and grateful
to others, if we’re not addicted or very

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.109
drawn to killing ourselves, then it’s likely
that someone somewhere, early on, loved us

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.390
very much. They may live quite far away from
us now, they might share none of our interests

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.669
and could in many ways be a little boring
to spend time with – and yet we will continue

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.700
to be deeply loyal to them and know in our
hearts that we owe them everything. When we

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.550
say that someone ‘loved’ us, what we’re
really referring to is the acquisition of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.600
a set of skills. These were not transferred
in any formal way, we imbibed them in the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.220
ordinary bustle of daily life. It might have
been in the kitchen, on a walk out in the

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.480
woods or at night-time in the bedroom after
a story. It would have been easy to miss what

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.970
was really going on, the vital nectar that
was being imparted, all the life-sustaining

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.430
goodness we received when it looked like it
was just another conversation about homework

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.930
or the plans for the weekend. But in the course
of being loved, we got an encyclopedic emotional

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.820
education nevertheless, in which some of the
following was learnt: – Endurance Sometimes,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.130
it all looked very bad indeed. We were in
a state, soaked in tears, or red with fury.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.400
We felt the world was coming apart and that
we would not survive. But they kept the tragedy

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.220
at bay until we could breathe calmly once
again. They may not have had all the answers,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.341
but they promised us – and they were right
– that a few would eventually emerge. They

00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:51.160
held us through the night and guaranteed that
there would be a dawn. And ever since then,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.780
it’s become just a little easier to keep
catastrophic dread at bay. – Self-Love They

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.970
lent us a sense that we were of value to them
and therefore could one day be to ourselves

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.120
as well. If we made something or had an idea,
we could share it with them – and though

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.570
it wasn’t perhaps entirely accomplished
already, they were guided by our underlying

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.770
intentions and promise. When we entered the
kitchen, not every time, but enough times

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.920
to form a protective layer over our ego, they
looked up and lit up. They might have had

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.590
a name for us: little champion, button chops
or sweet sheep. At one point in adolescence,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.980
we certainly didn’t want that name used
any more, and it would be mortifying if colleagues

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.470
knew it today, but it remains a secret symbol
of an emotional bedrock upon which all our

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.800
later poise and confidence was able to emerge.
– Forgiveness At points, we did something

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.680
very wrong: we forgot a book, we scratched
a table, we were nasty to someone or exploded

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.819
in fury. The punishment could have been very
strong, and yet it wasn’t. They came up

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.630
with reasons that cast our misdeeds in a generous
light: we were tired, everyone does that,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.319
no one is perfect. They taught us about mercy,
towards others and ourselves. They let us

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:21.849
know that we would not have to be perfect
to deserve to exist. – Patience We didn’t

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.230
master much immediately. It took us a while
to get long division, it was ages till we

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.599
found our way with the piano or learnt to
make biscuits. But they didn’t shout or

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.910
mock or get irritated. They taught us the
art of waiting till the good could emerge.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.599
They didn’t demand immediate results – and
so spared us the need to panic or bluster

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.290
our way through life. – Repair There were
some very bad scenes. They said nasty things

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.589
and we did too. We felt we hated them a lot.
But they stuck around. They took the anger

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:04.190
– and thereby taught us about repair: how
things can go very wrong and yet can be fixed,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.130
how resilient people can be, how many second
chances there are when love is involved. With

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.799
some of these lessons and more, we grew up
into people who could be kind to ourselves,

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.990
tolerant of our faults, sympathetic to others
and capable of keeping going. We weren’t

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.150
just ‘loved’, we got an education, whose
presence we can feel every time we can care

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.210
for someone else, address a kind word to ourselves
or feel strong enough to face a difficult

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.400
tomorrow.
