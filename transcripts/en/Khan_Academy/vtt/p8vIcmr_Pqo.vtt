00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:02.050
- The first time you're
exposed to permutations

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.809
and combinations it takes a little bit

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:06.110
to get your brain around it,
so I think it never hurts

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.163
to do as many examples.

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:09.778
But each incremental
example I'm gonna review

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:11.055
what we've done before, but hopefully go

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:12.634
a little bit further.

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:13.876
So let's just take another example.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:15.744
This is in the same vein.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.742
In videos after this I'll
start using other examples,

00:00:17.742 --> 00:00:19.472
other than just people sitting in chairs,

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:20.911
but let's just stick with it for now.

00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.641
Let's say we have six people again.

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:25.408
Person A, B, C,

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.221
D, E, and F,

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:29.467
so we have six people.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.362
Now let's put them into four chairs.

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:32.811
We can go through this fairly quickly,

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:37.048
one, two, three, four chairs.

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:39.022
We've seen this show multiple times.

00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:41.367
How many ways, how many
permutations are there

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.549
of putting these six
people into four chairs?

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.341
Well the first chair, if
we seat them in order,

00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:47.043
we might as well, we
can say well there'd be

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:48.587
six possibilities here.

00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:50.294
For each of those six possibilities

00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:52.569
there would be five possibilities
of who we'd put here,

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.531
because one person's already sitting down.

00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:56.307
For each of these 30 possibilities

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.933
of seating these first two people,

00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.428
there'd be four possibilities

00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:02.495
of who we put in chair number three.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.629
Then for each of these, what
is this, 120 possibilities

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.614
there would be three possibilities

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:09.855
of who we put in chair four.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:14.109
This six times five times four times three

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.012
is the number of permutations.

00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:19.212
We've seen in one of the
early videos on permutations

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.390
that, when we talk about
the permutation formula,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.924
one way to write this, if we
wanted to write in terms of

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:28.151
factorial, we could write this as

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:32.214
six factorial, six factorial
which is going to be equal to

00:01:32.214 --> 00:01:35.557
six times five times four times

00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:38.933
three times two times one,

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.336
but we wanna get rid of the two times one.

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.076
We're gonna divide that,

00:01:43.076 --> 00:01:44.184
we're gonna divide that.

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:45.616
Now what's two times one?

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.422
Two times one is two factorial.

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:48.664
Where do we get that?

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:50.459
We wanted the first four,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.223
the first four factors of six factorial.

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:55.944
That's where the four came from.

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:59.379
We wanted the first four
factors, so the way we got two

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.233
is we said six minus four.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.590
Six minus four,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.353
that's gonna give us the number

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:10.361
that we wanna get rid of.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:11.522
We wanted to get rid of two

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:13.484
or the factors we wanna get rid of.

00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:15.376
That's going to give us two factorial.

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:18.174
If we do six minus four factorial.

00:02:18.174 --> 00:02:20.774
That's going to give us two factorial,

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:23.677
which is two times one.

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:27.357
Then these cancel out, and we are all set.

00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:31.443
This is one way, I put in
the particular numbers here,

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.752
but this is a review of
the permutations formula,

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:38.475
where people say, "Hey, if I'm saying n,

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:40.777
"if I'm taking n things,
then I want to figure out

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.298
"how many permutations are there

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:45.258
"of putting them into let's say k spots,

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:48.590
"it's going to be equal to n factorial

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.398
"over n minus k factorial."

00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:54.459
That's exactly what we did over here,

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.317
where six is n

00:02:57.317 --> 00:03:00.361
and k, or four is k.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:01.512
Four is k.

00:03:01.512 --> 00:03:03.658
Actually let me color code the whole thing

00:03:06.873 --> 00:03:09.218
so that we see the parallel.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.879
All of that is review.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.166
Then we went into the
world of combinations.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.768
In the world of combinations,

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.868
we said permutations make a difference

00:03:17.868 --> 00:03:19.539
between who's sitting in what chair.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.118
For example, in the permutations world,

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:22.373
and this is all review, we've covered this

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:26.133
in the combinations video,
in the permutations world

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:29.127
A, B, C, D,

00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:33.156
and D, A, B, C,

00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.489
these would be two different permutations

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.406
that's being counted in
whatever number this is.

00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:37.959
This is what?

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.831
This is 30 times twelve.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:44.720
This is equal to 360.

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.236
Each of these, this is one permutation,

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:50.521
this is another permutation,

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.495
and if we keep doing it
we would count up to 360.

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:54.923
But we learned in combinations,

00:03:54.923 --> 00:03:56.031
when we're thinking about combinations,

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.353
let me write combinations.

00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:00.905
If we're saying n choose,

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:03.195
n choose k,

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:06.010
or how many combinations are there?

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.770
If we take k things, and
we just wanna figure out

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.203
how many combinatio-

00:04:09.203 --> 00:04:11.384
If we start with n, if
we have pool of n things,

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.557
and we wanna say how many combinations

00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:15.122
of k things are there,
then we would count these

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.363
as the same combination.

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:20.102
What we really wanna do is we wanna take

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:22.598
the number of permutations there are.

00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:25.909
We wanna take the number
of permutations there are,

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:30.909
which is equal to n factorial over

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:34.042
n minus k factorial,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.520
over n minus k factorial,

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:41.324
and we wanna divide by the number of ways

00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:43.065
that you can arrange four people.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:44.354
Once again, this takes-

00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:45.151
I remember the first time I learned

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.432
it took my brain a little while.

00:04:46.432 --> 00:04:48.080
If it's taking you a little
while to think about it,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.079
not a big deal.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:51.342
It can be confusing at first,

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:53.339
but hopefully if you
keep thinking about it

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.880
hopefully you will see
clarity at some moment.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.492
What we wanna do is we wanna
divide by all of the ways

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:01.303
that you can arrange four things.

00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:03.265
Cuz once again, in the permutations

00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:05.250
it's counting all of the
different arrangements

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.328
of four things, but we don't wanna count

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:09.661
all of those different
arrangements of four things.

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:13.040
We wanna just say they're
all one combination.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.338
We wanna divide by the number of ways

00:05:15.338 --> 00:05:17.219
to arrange four things.

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.514
Or the number of ways to arrange k things.

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:21.806
Let me write this down.

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:23.395
What is the number of ways,

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:25.670
number of ways,

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.746
to arrange

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.383
k things,

00:05:31.968 --> 00:05:33.415
k things,

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:34.593
in k spots.

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:36.374
I encourage you to pause the video,

00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:37.535
because this actually a review

00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:40.053
from the first permutation video.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.793
If you have k spots, let me do it

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.974
so if this is the first
spot, the second spot,

00:05:45.974 --> 00:05:49.439
third spot, and then
you're gonna go all the way

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.178
to the kth spot.

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:53.581
For the first spot

00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:55.877
there could be k possibilities.

00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:58.291
There's k things that
could take the first spot.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.975
For each of those k possibilities,

00:05:59.975 --> 00:06:02.378
how many things can be in the second spot?

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:04.785
It's gonna be k minus one,
because you already put,

00:06:04.785 --> 00:06:06.839
you already put something
in the first spot.

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.977
Then over here, what's it gonna be?

00:06:07.977 --> 00:06:09.657
K minus two

00:06:09.963 --> 00:06:11.247
all the way to the last spot,

00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:14.002
there's only one thing that
can be put in the last spot.

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:14.826
What is this thing here?

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:16.765
K times k minus one times k minus two

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:20.445
times k minus three all
the way down to one.

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.776
This is just equal to k factorial.

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.843
The number of ways to
arrange k things in k spots,

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:26.690
k factorial.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.395
The number of ways to arrange
four things in four spots,

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:30.811
that's four factorial.

00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:32.634
The number of ways to arrange three things

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:35.107
in three spots, it's three factorial.

00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:36.879
We could just divide this.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.515
We could just divide this by k factorial.

00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:44.980
This would get us, this would get us,

00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:47.183
n factorial

00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.080
divided by k factorial,

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.088
k factorial

00:06:54.088 --> 00:06:55.768
times,

00:06:55.768 --> 00:07:00.125
times n minus k factorial,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.492
n minus k,

00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:05.474
n minus k,

00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:07.798
I'll put the factorial right over there.

00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:10.447
This right over here is the formula.

00:07:10.447 --> 00:07:14.234
This right over here is the
formula for combinations.

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:17.236
Sometimes this is also called
the binomial coefficient.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.838
People always call this n choose k.

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.394
They'll also write it like this,

00:07:20.394 --> 00:07:22.797
n choose k, especially
when they're thinking

00:07:22.797 --> 00:07:24.840
in terms of binomial coefficients.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.939
I got into kind of an
abstract tangent here,

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:30.935
when I started getting
into the general formula.

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:32.754
Let's go back to our example.

00:07:32.754 --> 00:07:36.112
In our example we saw
that there was 360 ways

00:07:36.112 --> 00:07:40.361
of seating six people into four chairs.

00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:42.625
What if we didn't care about
who's sitting in which chairs

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.947
and just wanna say,
"How many ways are there

00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:47.283
"to choose four people

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:50.312
"from a pool of six?"

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:51.652
That would be

00:07:51.652 --> 00:07:53.516
that would be how many ways are there.

00:07:53.516 --> 00:07:55.120
That would be six.

00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:57.942
How many combinations

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.143
if I'm starting with a pool of six,

00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:02.403
how many combinations are there?

00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:04.426
How many combinations are there

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:06.888
for selecting four?

00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:08.966
Another way of thinking about it is

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:11.667
how many ways are there to,

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:14.768
from a pool of six items,

00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:16.330
people in this example,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.634
how many ways are there
to choose four of them.

00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:23.972
That is going to be, we could do it-

00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:25.439
I'll apply the formula first,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.299
and then I'll reason through it.

00:08:26.299 --> 00:08:27.591
And like I always say,

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.713
I'm not a huge fan of the formula.

00:08:28.713 --> 00:08:31.380
Every time I revisit it after a few years,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.295
actually just rethink about it,
as opposed to memorizing it,

00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.837
because memorizing is a
good way to not understand

00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:40.264
what's actually going on,

00:08:40.264 --> 00:08:42.086
but if we just apply the formula here,

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:43.619
I really want you to understand

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:45.139
what's happening in the formula,

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:49.222
it would be six factorial
over four factorial,

00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:51.469
over four factorial,

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:55.164
times six minus four factorial,

00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:58.135
six, oops let me just,

00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:00.888
This is six minus four factorial,

00:09:00.888 --> 00:09:03.156
so this part right over here,

00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:04.348
six minus four fa-

00:09:04.348 --> 00:09:05.403
Let me write it out because I know

00:09:05.403 --> 00:09:07.572
this can be a little bit confusing

00:09:07.572 --> 00:09:09.020
the first time you see it.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.480
So six minus four factorial,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.102
factorial, which is equal to,

00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:21.082
which is equal to six
factorial over four factorial,

00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:25.296
over four factorial, times
this thing right over here

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:28.523
is two factorial, times two factorial,

00:09:28.523 --> 00:09:31.169
which is going to be equal to, we can just

00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:34.907
write out the factorials,
six times five times four

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:38.484
times three times two times one,

00:09:38.484 --> 00:09:41.142
over four.

00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:45.449
Four time three times two times one

00:09:45.449 --> 00:09:47.172
times,

00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:50.171
times two times one.

00:09:50.171 --> 00:09:53.018
Of course that's going
to cancel with that.

00:09:53.018 --> 00:09:55.340
Then the one doesn't
really change the value,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.906
so let me get rid of this one here.

00:09:57.906 --> 00:10:02.526
Let's see, this three can
cancel with this three.

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:05.301
This four could cancel with this four.

00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:09.004
Then it's six divided by
two is going to be three.

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:13.044
So we are just left with three times five.

00:10:13.044 --> 00:10:14.463
We are left with,

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:18.176
we are left with, there's
fifteen combinations.

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:21.275
There's 360 permutations for putting

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:23.771
six people into four chairs,

00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:25.454
but there's only 15 combinations,

00:10:25.454 --> 00:10:26.870
because we're no longer counting

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.391
all of the different arrangements

00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:30.794
for the same four people
in the four chairs.

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.396
We're saying, "Hey if
it's the same four people,

00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:34.892
"that is now one combination."

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:36.216
You can see how many ways are there

00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:38.270
to arrange four people into four chairs?

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.755
That's the four factorial
part right over here.

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:42.508
The four factorial part right over here,

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.435
which is four times three
times two times one,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.607
which is 24.

00:10:45.607 --> 00:10:47.337
We essentially just took the 360

00:10:47.337 --> 00:10:50.309
divided by 24 to get 15.

00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:54.093
Once again, I don't think
I can stress this enough.

00:10:54.093 --> 00:10:56.206
I wanna make it clear
where this is coming from.

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:58.532
This right over here,

00:10:58.532 --> 00:10:59.672
let me circle,

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:02.969
this piece right over here is
the number of permutations.

00:11:02.969 --> 00:11:04.548
This is really just so you can get to

00:11:04.548 --> 00:11:06.742
six times five times four times three,

00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:08.623
which is exactly what we did up here,

00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:09.970
where we reasoned through it.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.071
Then we just wanna divide
by the number of ways

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:15.383
you can arrange four items in four spaces.
