1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.830
Let's now take a look at what happens when hundreds,

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.081
thousands,

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:12.030
and millions of people make decisions that have medical consequences and those

4
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.510
add up to have impacted the level of the entire population.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.660
This exposes the issue of morality and the way that individual behavior impacts

6
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:26.054
public.
Good.

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
<v 0>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.970
<v 1>We'll explore that with the examples of vaccination and antibiotic therapy.</v>

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.740
However,
to begin with,
let's look first at medical intervention.

10
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:42.570
In human evolution,
physicians normally focus on individual patients,

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.520
whereas epidemiologists,

12
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.020
public health workers and evolutionary biologists focus on populations.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.500
<v 1>The chain of causes that links individual decisions by physicians to population</v>

15
00:00:56.261 --> 00:01:00.220
level consequences is real and it is not sufficiently appreciated.

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.390
<v 1>Medical decisions are now driving human evolution.</v>

18
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.610
It's a striking case of cultural intervention in a biological process.

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
This is a nexus where we encounter the issue of individual where welfare in

20
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.760
conflict with group welfare,

21
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.240
that welfare of individuals comes into conflict with the welfare of groups when

22
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:32.241
the costs of private decisions are externalized and when public goods are

23
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:34.920
exploited by private interests.

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.560
Those are really two ways of saying the same thing.

25
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.100
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.020
<v 1>In the medical arena.
Such conflicts have moral as well as economic dimensions.</v>

27
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.963
<v 0>The</v>

28
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.190
<v 1>probably best way to introduce this is the debate in the United States over how</v>

29
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:58.810
to finance health care.
It exemplifies the complexities of these conflicts.

30
00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.040
<v 1>A single payer plan,</v>

32
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.050
we're almost participate provides the greatest coverage at the lowest cost to

33
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:07.190
the society as a whole.

34
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.990
<v 1>But such plans do not give individuals the freedom to decide whether they want</v>

36
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.110
to be insured at all and if so,
by whom?

37
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.420
<v 1>From the point of view of the population,</v>

39
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.910
someone who does not join is a cheater parasitizing a public good who is

40
00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:29.290
increasing the cost of health care from the point of view of a young healthy

41
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.710
person.
That decision is justified by short term self interest.

42
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.890
<v 1>Such conflicts of money and values arise repeatedly at the intersection of</v>

44
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.720
individuals and populations.

45
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.960
We can see them quite well in the problem of vaccination and herd immunity,

46
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.170
the great vaccine sterilized,
so measles,
mumps,
rubella,
pertussis,
diphtheria,

47
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.390
smallpox,
TB,
polio.

48
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.020
Those are all vaccines that sterilize the population and do not allow the

49
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:08.080
pathogen to replicate in any vaccinated individual.

50
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.050
They protect people for life.

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.280
They removed them from the pool of susceptibles who might be able to transmit

52
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.570
the disease.
When the proportion of immune people is high enough,

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.750
that figure is about 90% for measles.

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.940
The disease can no longer spread and the population is protected by herd

55
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.930
immunity.
So in that case,
even those who are not vaccinated are protected.

56
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.650
They're protected by the high frequency of people who are vaccinated.

57
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.820
Herd immunity is a public good created by those who have been vaccinated that

58
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.370
protects those who decide not to be vaccinated.

59
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.680
That leads us to raise this question is refusal to have your child vaccinated a

60
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:58.700
crime when enough people refuse vaccination,

61
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.680
the disease can break out and those who suffer and sometimes die or usually the

62
00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.900
youngest.
For example,

63
00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:10.100
in the California pertussis outbreak in 2010 all of the deaths occurred in

64
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:13.880
infants who were less than three months old.
The young and the innocent.

65
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.290
The false claim that measles vaccination causes autism caused immunization rates

66
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:23.270
to drop.
Measles,
which can be deadly,

67
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:27.950
has broken out several times and children have died as a result of this

68
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:28.784
reaction.

69
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.350
Are those who promote such false hoods indirectly guilty of murder or perhaps of

70
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:37.874
manslaughter?

71
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.950
Do we need laws that address crimes committed against populations rather than

72
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:47.180
individuals or legal system is not particularly well constructed to deal with

73
00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:48.014
this?

74
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.220
Another issue that arises is that of imperfect vaccines and pathogen virulence

75
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.290
imperfect vaccines can drive the evolution of increased very lynch and target

76
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:04.340
pathogen by allowing patients to survive longer and by giving more virulent

77
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:08.840
strains,
more time to transmit.
This has been confirmed in Meissen and chickens

78
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.150
vaccinated individuals benefit,
but the indirect costs have increased.

79
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:17.060
Very Lens is externalized to the whole population.

80
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.280
Individuals in which the vaccine is ineffective and those who have not yet been

81
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:27.281
vaccinated are then exposed to pathogens that have higher virulence.

82
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.710
The HPV vaccine and all Kennedy Malaria vaccines are imperfect.

83
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.270
They do not sterilize.
We should still vaccinate.

84
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.430
There's no question about that.
Even with imperfect vaccines because many,

85
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.780
many lives will be saved,

86
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.530
but we should also be aware of the consequences and prepare for them.

87
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.210
Another place where the conflict between individual interest in group interest

88
00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:59.090
is striking concerns.
Antibiotic therapy,

89
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500
antibiotic therapy benefits the individual patient who does incur some costs for

90
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.060
because of local resistance evolution.

91
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.940
That means in the in that own patient's body,

92
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.120
but most of the cost is externalized.
In diffuse,

93
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.040
it's borne by the population as a whole.

94
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.080
Agricultural use of antibiotics has a similar kind of logical structure.

95
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.730
The individual farmer benefits and the cost of resistance is externalized.

96
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.940
That's not something that the farm usually sees himself.

97
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.320
The externalized cost is the global spread of resistance and that is something

98
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.750
to which millions of individuals decisions have contributed

99
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.990
those externalized costs of accumulated and they now pose mortal threats to

100
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:45.950
millions of patients.

101
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.840
The health of everyone on the planet is now directly or indirectly threatened by

102
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.830
the spread of antibiotic resistance,

103
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.760
so there are three lessons from this.

104
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.450
The first is that the conflict between individual and group interest is real.

105
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.960
It's not going away.
It can be mitigated but not eliminated.

106
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.630
The second is that medicine and public health have changed the human environment

107
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:16.070
radically and are now major drivers of natural selection on traits of medical

108
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:16.904
importance.

109
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.140
And the third is that sometimes when medicine solves old problems,

110
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.960
it creates new ones.
To summarize,

111
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.970
private decisions about medical treatment accumulate to have serious public

112
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.810
consequences.
The exhibit bounded rationality,

113
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.100
they seem to make sense,

114
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.930
but they are ultimately irrational at both individual and population levels.

115
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.370
We need an open conversation about the health consequences of the tensions

116
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.860
between individual liberty and social responsibility.
