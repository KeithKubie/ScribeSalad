fully emerged so it's your job now to
 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.540
fully emerged so it's your job now to
evaluate the consequences of that that

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550
evaluate the consequences of that that
 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.430
evaluate the consequences of that that

effort to with Enrique to try to to to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390
effort to with Enrique to try to to to
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.160
effort to with Enrique to try to to to
stage a discussion a debate maybe even

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170
stage a discussion a debate maybe even
 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.540
stage a discussion a debate maybe even
an argument in the spirit of the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550
an argument in the spirit of the
 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.540
an argument in the spirit of the
arguments series that the ad program has

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550
arguments series that the ad program has
 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.959
arguments series that the ad program has
been running to tease out some of the

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969
been running to tease out some of the
 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.150
been running to tease out some of the
undercurrents if you'll pardon the usage

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160
undercurrents if you'll pardon the usage
 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.980
undercurrents if you'll pardon the usage
of not so much the tea i mean there will

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
of not so much the tea i mean there will
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.389
of not so much the tea i mean there will
be of course a lot of discussion about

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399
be of course a lot of discussion about
 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.580
be of course a lot of discussion about
the particular do those are the projects

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590
the particular do those are the projects
 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.070
the particular do those are the projects
but but the stakes of the the work and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080
but but the stakes of the the work and
 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.530
but but the stakes of the the work and
and particularly how it articulates

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540
and particularly how it articulates
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.200
and particularly how it articulates
itself in the broader field so so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210
itself in the broader field so so
 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.870
itself in the broader field so so
towards that end I before introducing

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
towards that end I before introducing
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.850
towards that end I before introducing
our panelists that the setup will be

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860
our panelists that the setup will be
 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.920
our panelists that the setup will be
this I will introduce everybody right

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930
this I will introduce everybody right
 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.490
this I will introduce everybody right
now so we can and we have three of the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
now so we can and we have three of the
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.620
now so we can and we have three of the
five teams represented here we've

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630
five teams represented here we've
 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.600
five teams represented here we've
limited this to current Columbia faculty

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610
limited this to current Columbia faculty
 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.429
limited this to current Columbia faculty
partly also i should say as a way to to

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439
partly also i should say as a way to to
 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.410
partly also i should say as a way to to
you know look in the mirror a little bit

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
you know look in the mirror a little bit
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.210
you know look in the mirror a little bit
and get have some sense and maybe

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220
and get have some sense and maybe
 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.980
and get have some sense and maybe
introduce you to some of the work and

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990
introduce you to some of the work and
 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.600
introduce you to some of the work and
discussions that that you're likely to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
discussions that that you're likely to
 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.039
discussions that that you're likely to
encounter here columbia so so so i will

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049
encounter here columbia so so so i will
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.870
encounter here columbia so so so i will
introduce our speakers and

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880
introduce our speakers and
 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820
introduce our speakers and
who each will present about 10 minutes

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
who each will present about 10 minutes
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250
who each will present about 10 minutes
basically will present there are

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
basically will present there are
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.820
basically will present there are
projects to you and after which Enrique

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
projects to you and after which Enrique
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.050
projects to you and after which Enrique
and I will pose to each of us we will

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060
and I will pose to each of us we will
 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.670
and I will pose to each of us we will
pose questions that we've actually

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
pose questions that we've actually
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120
pose questions that we've actually
discussed a little bit in advance so we

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130
discussed a little bit in advance so we
 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.090
discussed a little bit in advance so we
we've prepared this in order to try to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
we've prepared this in order to try to
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.780
we've prepared this in order to try to
to to steer the discussion in a specific

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
to to steer the discussion in a specific
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.350
to to steer the discussion in a specific
direction we'll see if it complies and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
direction we'll see if it complies and
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.160
direction we'll see if it complies and
so I'll give it just also to our

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170
so I'll give it just also to our
 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.710
so I'll give it just also to our
colleagues a little bit of a advanced

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720
colleagues a little bit of a advanced
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.300
colleagues a little bit of a advanced
hint as the kinds of questions that we

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310
hint as the kinds of questions that we
 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.010
hint as the kinds of questions that we
had in mind for my part I was interested

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020
had in mind for my part I was interested
 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.870
had in mind for my part I was interested
in given the nature of this this project

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880
in given the nature of this this project
 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.490
in given the nature of this this project
you know this is the hypothetical

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
you know this is the hypothetical
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.260
you know this is the hypothetical
project maybe I should give a little bit

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270
project maybe I should give a little bit
 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.880
project maybe I should give a little bit
of background so that way these guys

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890
of background so that way these guys
 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.880
of background so that way these guys
don't have to give you every detail but

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890
don't have to give you every detail but
 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.890
don't have to give you every detail but
that there's very very unusual for moma

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
that there's very very unusual for moma
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.600
that there's very very unusual for moma
I mean I must say although it is very

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610
I mean I must say although it is very
 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.430
I mean I must say although it is very
much in the in a tradition and older

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440
much in the in a tradition and older
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.820
much in the in a tradition and older
tradition of workshop type exhibitions

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830
tradition of workshop type exhibitions
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.920
tradition of workshop type exhibitions
that MoMA has hosted there were a number

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
that MoMA has hosted there were a number
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.040
that MoMA has hosted there were a number
of such exhibitions in the 60s and early

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050
of such exhibitions in the 60s and early
 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:26.080
of such exhibitions in the 60s and early
70s and so the the idea was I'll speak

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
70s and so the the idea was I'll speak
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.360
70s and so the the idea was I'll speak
on behalf of my colleague Mary Bergdahl

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370
on behalf of my colleague Mary Bergdahl
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.870
on behalf of my colleague Mary Bergdahl
who was the curator of the exhibition

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880
who was the curator of the exhibition
 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
who was the curator of the exhibition
that that there was an issue the issue

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040
that that there was an issue the issue
 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.330
that that there was an issue the issue
of the rise rise of the water level in

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
of the rise rise of the water level in
 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.240
of the rise rise of the water level in
New York Harbor there was a site the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
New York Harbor there was a site the
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.940
New York Harbor there was a site the
harbor itself and they were a series of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
harbor itself and they were a series of
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.449
harbor itself and they were a series of
of architects who threw a fairly

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
of architects who threw a fairly
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.089
of architects who threw a fairly
elaborate process we're invited to

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099
elaborate process we're invited to
 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.130
elaborate process we're invited to
address that issue on that site really

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
address that issue on that site really
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.500
address that issue on that site really
on five different sites around the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510
on five different sites around the
 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.809
on five different sites around the
harbor what's interesting to me about

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819
harbor what's interesting to me about
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.670
harbor what's interesting to me about
about that setup and and what I had you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
about that setup and and what I had you
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.440
about that setup and and what I had you
know would like to ask in more detail

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
know would like to ask in more detail
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.949
know would like to ask in more detail
later is is is that this the nature of

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959
later is is is that this the nature of
 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.280
later is is is that this the nature of
that narrative presupposes something

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
that narrative presupposes something
 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.900
that narrative presupposes something
like a long-term future it's almost a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910
like a long-term future it's almost a
 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.750
like a long-term future it's almost a
kind of science fiction exercise and and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
kind of science fiction exercise and and
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.460
kind of science fiction exercise and and
and that was certainly the first

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470
and that was certainly the first
 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.140
and that was certainly the first
impression I had been entering the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150
impression I had been entering the
 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.129
impression I had been entering the
exhibition that basically you're

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139
exhibition that basically you're
 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.620
exhibition that basically you're
entering a science fiction show but it's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630
entering a science fiction show but it's
 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.960
entering a science fiction show but it's
the science part and the fiction part

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970
the science part and the fiction part
 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.879
the science part and the fiction part
are in a sort of complicated than maybe

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889
are in a sort of complicated than maybe
 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.270
are in a sort of complicated than maybe
interesting dialogue it's science

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280
interesting dialogue it's science
 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.260
interesting dialogue it's science
fiction in the sense that it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270
fiction in the sense that it
 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.210
fiction in the sense that it
extrapolates out of present conditions a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
extrapolates out of present conditions a
 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.580
extrapolates out of present conditions a
future a long-term future we're talking

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590
future a long-term future we're talking
 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.920
future a long-term future we're talking
about these projects are basically you

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930
about these projects are basically you
 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.379
about these projects are basically you
know 50 80 years you know addressing

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389
know 50 80 years you know addressing
 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.150
know 50 80 years you know addressing
conditions that are expected 50 or 80

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160
conditions that are expected 50 or 80
 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.320
conditions that are expected 50 or 80
years down the road and the scientists

so the resulting plan which you see here

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:03.470
so the resulting plan which you see here
 

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.200
so the resulting plan which you see here
is really a sort of new form of

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.210
is really a sort of new form of

so we are interested in the idea that

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:15.629
so we are interested in the idea that
 

00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:18.169
so we are interested in the idea that
this site is not an either a wholly

this site is not an either a wholly
 

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.360
this site is not an either a wholly

and that the kind of resulting condition
 

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.169
and that the kind of resulting condition
of the design really seeks to merge

of the design really seeks to merge
 

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.610
of the design really seeks to merge
these properties and to kind of take

these properties and to kind of take
 

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.250
these properties and to kind of take
advantage of them both the other is that

00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:51.910
and so one of the first things we did
actually was to take a boat ride with

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920
actually was to take a boat ride with
 

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.490
actually was to take a boat ride with

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:58.190
school out to the the Bay Bridge flats
 

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.359
school out to the the Bay Bridge flats
and sort of check out the water another

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:01.369
and sort of check out the water another
 

00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:03.970
and sort of check out the water another
thing we did was really to sort of look

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:03.980
thing we did was really to sort of look
 

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.920
thing we did was really to sort of look
back at the history of the site because

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:05.930
back at the history of the site because
 

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.990
back at the history of the site because
for me coming coming out of them a

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000
for me coming coming out of them a

and history I really feel like history

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:11.780
and history I really feel like history
 

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.710

interaction with the harbor so we did it

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:25.250
interaction with the harbor so we did it
 

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.849
interaction with the harbor so we did it
sort of history of our site and you can

00:44:27.849 --> 00:44:27.859
sort of history of our site and you can
 

00:44:27.859 --> 00:44:30.250
sort of history of our site and you can
see that you know it was really is kind

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:30.260
see that you know it was really is kind

arcing ring of islands that served as a
 

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.920
arcing ring of islands that served as a
kind of a natural breakwater for upland

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:40.930
kind of a natural breakwater for upland

Gowanus actually had you know Auster's

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:49.460
Gowanus actually had you know Auster's
 

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.270

the size of dinner plates and you know

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280
the size of dinner plates and you know
 

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.950
the size of dinner plates and you know
it was a very different kind of

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960
it was a very different kind of
 

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.109
it was a very different kind of
topographical signature so he learned a

00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119
topographical signature so he learned a
 

00:44:56.119 --> 00:44:57.280
topographical signature so he learned a
lot from just this typographical

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:57.290
lot from just this typographical
 

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.079
lot from just this typographical
signature and how the lowlands were

00:44:59.079 --> 00:44:59.089

incredibly productive settlement occurs

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520
incredibly productive settlement occurs
 

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.829
incredibly productive settlement occurs
on the upland and and that this creates

00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839
on the upland and and that this creates
 

00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:08.380
on the upland and and that this creates
a sort of a very positive dynamic

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:08.390
a sort of a very positive dynamic
 

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.230
a sort of a very positive dynamic
between settlement and water so the

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240
between settlement and water so the
 

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.420
between settlement and water so the
situation of the the Gowanus now is

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:13.430
situation of the the Gowanus now is
 

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:14.859
situation of the the Gowanus now is
quite different course in the sort of

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:14.869
quite different course in the sort of
 

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:17.170
quite different course in the sort of

these and marshy areas were dredged and
 

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.829
these and marshy areas were dredged and
catalyzed to uniform width and were in

so for us sea level rise and this is you

00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:36.109
so for us sea level rise and this is you
 

00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:40.039
so for us sea level rise and this is you
know our 2080 line here is is

incredibly important from a public
health standpoint because you have these

00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339
health standpoint because you have these
 

00:45:44.339 --> 00:45:46.789
health standpoint because you have these
active communities which would be

00:45:46.789 --> 00:45:46.799
active communities which would be
 

00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:49.489
active communities which would be
essentially affected by the further

just after we completed the project the

00:45:56.079 --> 00:45:56.089
just after we completed the project the

just after we completed the project the
Gowanus was listed as an EPA Superfund

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:58.890
Gowanus was listed as an EPA Superfund
 

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.870
Gowanus was listed as an EPA Superfund
site so I really felt like not just the

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880
site so I really felt like not just the
 

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.239

key here isn't just to address rising

00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:05.249
key here isn't just to address rising
 

00:46:05.249 --> 00:46:07.459
key here isn't just to address rising
currents but really to start to address

00:46:07.459 --> 00:46:07.469
currents but really to start to address
 

00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:09.979
currents but really to start to address
three things first is water quality

00:46:09.979 --> 00:46:09.989
three things first is water quality
 

00:46:09.989 --> 00:46:12.859
three things first is water quality
because if you know Vietnam right

00:46:12.859 --> 00:46:12.869

because if you know Vietnam right
there's the way that the sort of

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:15.390
there's the way that the sort of

certain level it's a relatively good
 

00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:22.640
certain level it's a relatively good
water quality so it's not catastrophic

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:22.650
water quality so it's not catastrophic
 

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.669
water quality so it's not catastrophic
if the floods occur it's actually quite

00:46:25.669 --> 00:46:25.679
if the floods occur it's actually quite
 

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:29.989
if the floods occur it's actually quite
a positive thing so water quality is a

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:29.999
a positive thing so water quality is a
 

00:46:29.999 --> 00:46:31.579
a positive thing so water quality is a
sort of a key piece that's missing here

00:46:31.579 --> 00:46:31.589
sort of a key piece that's missing here

thought to address water quality with

00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:42.089
thought to address water quality with
 

00:46:42.089 --> 00:46:44.689
thought to address water quality with
the sort of a biotic component with

this notion of water quality New York

00:47:20.719 --> 00:47:20.729
this notion of water quality New York
 

00:47:20.729 --> 00:47:23.719
this notion of water quality New York
used to be a slow harbor with clean

00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:23.729
used to be a slow harbor with clean
 

00:47:23.729 --> 00:47:26.179
used to be a slow harbor with clean
water and and it was a very active

00:47:26.179 --> 00:47:26.189
water and and it was a very active
 

00:47:26.189 --> 00:47:29.269
water and and it was a very active
Harbor so what happened I mean oysters

00:47:29.269 --> 00:47:29.279
Harbor so what happened I mean oysters
 

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:31.249
Harbor so what happened I mean oysters
used to actually cover about twenty-five

00:47:31.249 --> 00:47:31.259
used to actually cover about twenty-five
 

00:47:31.259 --> 00:47:33.709
used to actually cover about twenty-five
percent I'm sorry osters used to cover

00:47:33.709 --> 00:47:33.719
percent I'm sorry osters used to cover
 

00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:35.299
percent I'm sorry osters used to cover
yeah at least twenty-five percent of the

00:47:35.299 --> 00:47:35.309
yeah at least twenty-five percent of the
 

00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:37.130
yeah at least twenty-five percent of the
entire Bay and are now one percent of

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140
entire Bay and are now one percent of
 

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.140
entire Bay and are now one percent of
their former levels but this oyster is

an amazing animal because it's you know

00:47:41.419 --> 00:47:41.429
an amazing animal because it's you know
 

00:47:41.429 --> 00:47:44.299
an amazing animal because it's you know
through through its kind of marvel of

00:47:44.299 --> 00:47:44.309
through through its kind of marvel of
 

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:46.099
through through its kind of marvel of
this beautiful digestive tract it can

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:46.109
this beautiful digestive tract it can
 

00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:48.109
this beautiful digestive tract it can
accept algae detritus and pollutants and

00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119
accept algae detritus and pollutants and
 

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.209
accept algae detritus and pollutants and
outside the other end comes clean or

water you can literally dip a tray

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:52.210
water you can literally dip a tray
 

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.420

moist earth in an algae filled tank and

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:54.430
moist earth in an algae filled tank and
 

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.370
moist earth in an algae filled tank and
half an hour later remove that and the

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:56.380
half an hour later remove that and the
 

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.970
half an hour later remove that and the
tank is clear so all these oysters were

00:47:59.970 --> 00:47:59.980
tank is clear so all these oysters were
 

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.380
tank is clear so all these oysters were
actually capable of filtering the water

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:01.390
actually capable of filtering the water
 

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.200
actually capable of filtering the water
in the harbor in a matter of days we're

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:04.210
in the harbor in a matter of days we're
 

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.820
in the harbor in a matter of days we're
also interested in the sort of culture

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:05.830
also interested in the sort of culture
 

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.010
also interested in the sort of culture
of oysters because for me I was

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:08.020
of oysters because for me I was
 

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.349
of oysters because for me I was
particularly focused on the format of

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:10.359
particularly focused on the format of
 

00:48:10.359 --> 00:48:12.750
particularly focused on the format of

that now but but but it was very

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:19.660
that now but but but it was very
 

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.870
that now but but but it was very
exciting to me to kind of start to try

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880
exciting to me to kind of start to try
 

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.940
exciting to me to kind of start to try
to use history to reach a broader

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:23.950
to use history to reach a broader
 

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.030
to use history to reach a broader

really people sort of focus on the

00:48:33.359 --> 00:48:33.369
really people sort of focus on the
 

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:34.950
really people sort of focus on the
situation now and what it is that they

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960
situation now and what it is that they
 

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.320
situation now and what it is that they
can do so royster carts were actually

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:37.330
can do so royster carts were actually
 

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.140
can do so royster carts were actually
once as popular as the hotdog carts are

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:40.150
once as popular as the hotdog carts are
 

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.410
once as popular as the hotdog carts are
today and the second thing that oysters

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:43.420
today and the second thing that oysters
 

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.660
today and the second thing that oysters
do is they can agglomerate and to form

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:47.670
do is they can agglomerate and to form
 

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.300
do is they can agglomerate and to form
barriers and natural seed see barriers

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:51.310
barriers and natural seed see barriers
 

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.220
barriers and natural seed see barriers
and reefs are the number one kind of

and reefs are the number one kind of
 

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:57.810
and reefs are the number one kind of
barrier that creates the most effective

00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:57.820

wave attenuation because it reaches it

00:48:59.640 --> 00:48:59.650
wave attenuation because it reaches it
 

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:01.380
wave attenuation because it reaches it
starts deep in the water column and it

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:01.390
starts deep in the water column and it
 

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.630
starts deep in the water column and it
reaches up and so that velocity which

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640
reaches up and so that velocity which
 

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.250
reaches up and so that velocity which
starts deep in the water column is then

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:05.260
starts deep in the water column is then
 

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.040
starts deep in the water column is then
attenuated and finally with sea level

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.050
attenuated and finally with sea level
 

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.990

we were inspired by like this Easter

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:32.710
we were inspired by like this Easter
 

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.620
we were inspired by like this Easter

inspired by actually the life cycle of
 

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.780
inspired by actually the life cycle of
the oyster because what we learned was

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:42.790
the oyster because what we learned was
 

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:44.820
the oyster because what we learned was
that only a very short amount of time

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:44.830
that only a very short amount of time
 

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.800
that only a very short amount of time
and you know there's this you know you

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:46.810
and you know there's this you know you
 

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:47.849
and you know there's this you know you
don't need or stirs in the summer

00:49:47.849 --> 00:49:47.859
don't need or stirs in the summer
 

00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:51.300
don't need or stirs in the summer
they're all these kind of months with

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.310
they're all these kind of months with
 

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:54.780
they're all these kind of months with
our they're all these kind of rules that

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:54.790
our they're all these kind of rules that
 

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.760
our they're all these kind of rules that
that we know when we not to eat oysters

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:56.770
that we know when we not to eat oysters
 

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.020
that we know when we not to eat oysters
and that's because they're in the sort

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:58.030
and that's because they're in the sort
 

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:59.640
and that's because they're in the sort
of reproductive phase but it's a good a

00:49:59.640 --> 00:49:59.650
of reproductive phase but it's a good a
 

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.579
of reproductive phase but it's a good a
constant reproductive phase and they

00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:02.589
constant reproductive phase and they
 

00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:04.800
constant reproductive phase and they
move from a sort of a fertilized egg to

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:04.810
move from a sort of a fertilized egg to
 

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.680
move from a sort of a fertilized egg to
a free swimming

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:05.690

a free swimming
lar vie to a spat which is the moment in

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:08.180
lar vie to a spat which is the moment in
 

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.880
lar vie to a spat which is the moment in
the oysters lifecycle when it kind of is

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:09.890
the oysters lifecycle when it kind of is
 

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.170
the oysters lifecycle when it kind of is
swimming around and looking for

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.180
swimming around and looking for
 

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.440
swimming around and looking for
something to attach to to an adult male

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:14.450
something to attach to to an adult male
 

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.300
something to attach to to an adult male
and female in a very short amount of

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.310
and female in a very short amount of
 

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.630
and female in a very short amount of
time so we looked at this life cycle as

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640
time so we looked at this life cycle as
 

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.030
time so we looked at this life cycle as
being kind of you know an inspiration at

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040
being kind of you know an inspiration at
 

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.250
being kind of you know an inspiration at
this larger site scale and we thought

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:24.260
this larger site scale and we thought
 

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.040
this larger site scale and we thought
about our whole site as being this cycle

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:27.050
about our whole site as being this cycle
 

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.140
about our whole site as being this cycle
of regeneration based on this life cycle

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:29.150
of regeneration based on this life cycle
 

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.350
of regeneration based on this life cycle
that could continue to build and grow

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:31.360
that could continue to build and grow
 

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.320
that could continue to build and grow
this kind of new community-based sort of

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:35.330
this kind of new community-based sort of
 

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.260
this kind of new community-based sort of
involvement and also a renewed sort of

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:38.270
involvement and also a renewed sort of
 

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.950
involvement and also a renewed sort of
ecosystem here so we have our shell

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960
ecosystem here so we have our shell
 

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.900
ecosystem here so we have our shell
recycling the flushing the flushing

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:43.910
recycling the flushing the flushing
 

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.190
recycling the flushing the flushing
tunnel becomes the beginning of our

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200
tunnel becomes the beginning of our
 

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.270
tunnel becomes the beginning of our
flexi process and I'll talk about that

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280
flexi process and I'll talk about that
 

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.160
flexi process and I'll talk about that
in a minute flushing cleaner water

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:51.170
in a minute flushing cleaner water
 

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:53.170
in a minute flushing cleaner water
through the gowanus canal where we have

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:53.180
through the gowanus canal where we have
 

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.750
through the gowanus canal where we have
our nursery and then those oysters fat

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760
our nursery and then those oysters fat
 

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.190
our nursery and then those oysters fat
are then paraded down the gowanus canal

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200
are then paraded down the gowanus canal
 

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.110
are then paraded down the gowanus canal
in these low low bottom boats and then

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.120
in these low low bottom boats and then
 

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.780
in these low low bottom boats and then
seated out in the reef so you have kind

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:04.790
seated out in the reef so you have kind
 

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.180
seated out in the reef so you have kind
of a cycle of regenerating life and you

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:07.190
of a cycle of regenerating life and you
 

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.370
of a cycle of regenerating life and you
also have the opposite happening which

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:09.380
also have the opposite happening which
 

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.680
also have the opposite happening which
is that the reef then in turn protects

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:11.690
is that the reef then in turn protects
 

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:18.490
is that the reef then in turn protects
the inland Gowanus community so so

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:18.500
the inland Gowanus community so so
 

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:23.560
the inland Gowanus community so so
that's the results really and so we

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:23.570
that's the results really and so we
 

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.870
that's the results really and so we
started to develop this reef structure

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880
started to develop this reef structure
 

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.240
started to develop this reef structure
because the the hardware as you also

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:28.250
because the the hardware as you also
 

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.610
because the the hardware as you also
know has been dredged and catalyzed

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:30.620
know has been dredged and catalyzed
 

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.900
know has been dredged and catalyzed
within an inch of its sort of life and

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:33.910
within an inch of its sort of life and
 

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:37.150
within an inch of its sort of life and
one of the things we did was work with

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160
one of the things we did was work with
 

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.790
one of the things we did was work with
Paul Mike Witts to try to visualize what

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:39.800
Paul Mike Witts to try to visualize what
 

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.350
Paul Mike Witts to try to visualize what
the structure could be and so one day he

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:41.360
the structure could be and so one day he
 

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.660
the structure could be and so one day he
came into my studio and dropped and you

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:43.670
came into my studio and dropped and you
 

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.150
came into my studio and dropped and you
know a big a ton of this fuzzy rope on

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160
know a big a ton of this fuzzy rope on
 

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.240
know a big a ton of this fuzzy rope on
my floor and we realized that this rope

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:49.250
my floor and we realized that this rope
 

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.010
my floor and we realized that this rope
could actually be woven together and

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020
could actually be woven together and
 

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.800
could actually be woven together and
make kind of a soft infrastructure that

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:53.810
make kind of a soft infrastructure that
 

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.200
make kind of a soft infrastructure that
would help spur the the development of

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:56.210
would help spur the the development of
 

00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.020
would help spur the the development of
this reef and so we began to think about

00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.030
this reef and so we began to think about
 

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.980
this reef and so we began to think about
knitting this fabric and within a sea of

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:01.990
knitting this fabric and within a sea of
 

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.470
knitting this fabric and within a sea of
piles that could be able to create this

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480
piles that could be able to create this
 

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.690
piles that could be able to create this
kind of sort of semi soft heart

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:07.700
kind of sort of semi soft heart
 

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.270
kind of sort of semi soft heart
infrastructure so and you know just as

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280
infrastructure so and you know just as
 

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.010
infrastructure so and you know just as
an aside we all learned how to actually

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:12.020
an aside we all learned how to actually
 

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.190
an aside we all learned how to actually
knit because we we needed our

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200
knit because we we needed our
 

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.230
knit because we we needed our
so this is how the wave attenuation

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240
so this is how the wave attenuation
 

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.080
so this is how the wave attenuation
barrier works with a sort of a grid of

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:23.090
barrier works with a sort of a grid of
 

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.170
barrier works with a sort of a grid of
marine piles and and bring this sort of

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180
marine piles and and bring this sort of
 

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.580
marine piles and and bring this sort of
woven fabric from low in the water

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:28.590
woven fabric from low in the water
 

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.430
woven fabric from low in the water
column up to the surface and and

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440
column up to the surface and and
 

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.170
column up to the surface and and
basically working with piles of rocks

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180
basically working with piles of rocks
 

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.260
basically working with piles of rocks
and Shoals to fully dissipate the wave

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:39.270
and Shoals to fully dissipate the wave
 

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.630
and Shoals to fully dissipate the wave
energy before it hits go on us and

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640
energy before it hits go on us and
 

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.150
energy before it hits go on us and
that's what it it looks like and a key

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160
that's what it it looks like and a key
 

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.120
that's what it it looks like and a key
part of this is because the harbor has

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:47.130
part of this is because the harbor has
 

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.900
part of this is because the harbor has
been so decimated by dredging that

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:49.910
been so decimated by dredging that
 

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:54.230
been so decimated by dredging that
oysters when they do actually find

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240
oysters when they do actually find
 

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.270
oysters when they do actually find
something to an attached to they become

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280
something to an attached to they become
 

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.760
something to an attached to they become
sedimented out and covered with silt so

00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:58.770
sedimented out and covered with silt so
 

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.370
sedimented out and covered with silt so
that's a key physical aspect of what our

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380
that's a key physical aspect of what our
 

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.830
that's a key physical aspect of what our
fabric does is it holds the oysters

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:03.840
fabric does is it holds the oysters
 

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.070
fabric does is it holds the oysters
above this sediment zone and our idea to

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:07.080
above this sediment zone and our idea to
 

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.830
above this sediment zone and our idea to
was that this oyster oyster texture

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:09.840
was that this oyster oyster texture
 

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.440
was that this oyster oyster texture
would then grow and evolve with

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:12.450
would then grow and evolve with
 

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:15.430
would then grow and evolve with
alongside the threat of climate change

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440
alongside the threat of climate change
 

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.170
alongside the threat of climate change
so here's a kind of diagram of this glom

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180
so here's a kind of diagram of this glom
 

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.070
so here's a kind of diagram of this glom
eration of the reef and the sort of

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:22.080
eration of the reef and the sort of
 

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.600
eration of the reef and the sort of
development of new public space because

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:23.610
development of new public space because
 

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.580
development of new public space because
of course on the other hand what I'm

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:25.590
of course on the other hand what I'm
 

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:27.230
of course on the other hand what I'm
really most interested in is this notion

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240
really most interested in is this notion
 

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.350
really most interested in is this notion
of this kind of new watery public space

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:30.360
of this kind of new watery public space
 

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.390
of this kind of new watery public space
that's created this for blue network of

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400
that's created this for blue network of
 

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.430
that's created this for blue network of
sort of the the this is my sort of back

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440
sort of the the this is my sort of back
 

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.490
sort of the the this is my sort of back
to the future moment of how we used to

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500
to the future moment of how we used to
 

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.370
to the future moment of how we used to
sort of interact with the harbor and so

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380
sort of interact with the harbor and so
 

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.050
sort of interact with the harbor and so
you basically creating this sort of

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:45.060
you basically creating this sort of
 

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.890
you basically creating this sort of
water / land zone of boats people

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900
water / land zone of boats people
 

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.160
water / land zone of boats people
animals this is a view of our model and

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:52.170
animals this is a view of our model and
 

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:53.900
animals this is a view of our model and
one of the sort of research and dive

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:53.910
one of the sort of research and dive
 

00:53:53.910 --> 00:54:00.160
one of the sort of research and dive
stations there

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:00.170
 
 

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.710
 
so the main thing that that this does

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720
so the main thing that that this does
 

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.770
so the main thing that that this does
also is create a new kind of central

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:05.780
also is create a new kind of central
 

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.530
also is create a new kind of central
green lanten blue landscape which is

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:08.540
green lanten blue landscape which is
 

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.690
green lanten blue landscape which is
really you know the the kind of

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:10.700
really you know the the kind of

our exhibit was really we basically just

00:54:23.049 --> 00:54:23.059
our exhibit was really we basically just
 

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.670
our exhibit was really we basically just
said we're just going to do a section so

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680
said we're just going to do a section so
 

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.520
said we're just going to do a section so
we because this section as you heard me

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:27.530
we because this section as you heard me
 

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.930
we because this section as you heard me
explain is really the part of the key

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:28.940
explain is really the part of the key
 

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.030
explain is really the part of the key
idea that the this interactivity between

upland and inland in water and upland so
 

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.940
upland and inland in water and upland so
here's a section showing this wave

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:36.950
here's a section showing this wave
 

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:40.329
here's a section showing this wave

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:46.490
calmer water in the Red Hook canal now
 

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.180
calmer water in the Red Hook canal now
and then finally to the Gowanus so I'm

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:49.190
and then finally to the Gowanus so I'm
 

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.620
and then finally to the Gowanus so I'm
going to talk a little bit about to go

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:50.630
going to talk a little bit about to go
 

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:52.480
going to talk a little bit about to go
on as canal now this is what it looks

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:52.490
on as canal now this is what it looks
 

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.640
on as canal now this is what it looks
like today with these semi viable

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:54.650
like today with these semi viable
 

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.890
like today with these semi viable

its edges with sewage dumping regularly
into the canal at CSO events and so

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:03.950
into the canal at CSO events and so
 

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:05.740
into the canal at CSO events and so
we're really just Reese Culp ting that

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:05.750
we're really just Reese Culp ting that
 

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:08.170
we're really just Reese Culp ting that

Gowanus is that you cannot access it

00:55:12.819 --> 00:55:12.829
Gowanus is that you cannot access it
 

00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:14.440
Gowanus is that you cannot access it
right there's no right way along the

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:14.450
right there's no right way along the
 

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.120
right there's no right way along the
edge so we're creating kind of a right

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.130
edge so we're creating kind of a right
 

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.400
edge so we're creating kind of a right
away within the water productive right

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:18.410

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:28.180
it first and you need it last is this
fluff SI system which is called a

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:28.190
fluff SI system which is called a
 

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:30.160
fluff SI system which is called a
floating upwelling system it's really a

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.170
floating upwelling system it's really a
 

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:34.440
floating upwelling system it's really a
sort of a nursery oyster nursery where

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:34.450
sort of a nursery oyster nursery where
 

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:36.970
sort of a nursery oyster nursery where
little baby oysters are contained in

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:36.980
little baby oysters are contained in
 

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.490
little baby oysters are contained in
these chambers water is pumped through

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:39.500
these chambers water is pumped through
 

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.380
these chambers water is pumped through
so it's like force feeding the oysters

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:41.390
so it's like force feeding the oysters
 

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.420
so it's like force feeding the oysters
and thousands and thousands and

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:43.430
and thousands and thousands and
 

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.370
and thousands and thousands and
thousands of baby oysters are produced

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:45.380
thousands of baby oysters are produced
 

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.870
thousands of baby oysters are produced
and then are protected from predators so

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880
and then are protected from predators so
 

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.849
and then are protected from predators so
that's our thought was that basically we

00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:51.859
that's our thought was that basically we
 

00:55:51.859 --> 00:55:54.099
that's our thought was that basically we
re envisioned this entire Gowanus as a

00:55:54.099 --> 00:55:54.109
re envisioned this entire Gowanus as a
 

00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:56.349
re envisioned this entire Gowanus as a
as a fluff see with the sort of turbine

00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359
as a fluff see with the sort of turbine
 

00:55:56.359 --> 00:55:58.900
as a fluff see with the sort of turbine

that exists now water through and that

questions so it sounds but but taking

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760
questions so it sounds but but taking

project and and and what I really kind

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:04.430
project and and and what I really kind
 

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.550
project and and and what I really kind
of took out of it was this idea of scale

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:06.560
of took out of it was this idea of scale
 

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.040
of took out of it was this idea of scale
as a strategy and I don't know because

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:09.050
as a strategy and I don't know because
 

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:11.140
as a strategy and I don't know because
because I feel like we all struggled

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.150
because I feel like we all struggled
 

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.910
because I feel like we all struggled
with this notion of being given a site

scaled up I think the question is very

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:47.890
scaled up I think the question is very
 

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:50.040
scaled up I think the question is very
difficult because it puts us in the

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:56.980
issues that we were trying to address
 

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.130
issues that we were trying to address
right but it also can be seen as a set

01:03:59.130 --> 01:03:59.140
right but it also can be seen as a set
 

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.569
right but it also can be seen as a set
of intentions I mean I think all three

01:04:00.569 --> 01:04:00.579
of intentions I mean I think all three
 

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:03.030
of intentions I mean I think all three
projects we've seen are attempting

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:03.040
projects we've seen are attempting
 

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.500
projects we've seen are attempting
through the specific you know

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:04.510
through the specific you know
 

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.540
through the specific you know
understanding of the site you know to

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:06.550
understanding of the site you know to
 

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:09.089
understanding of the site you know to
solve or address issues that are global

01:04:09.089 --> 01:04:09.099
solve or address issues that are global
 

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.740
solve or address issues that are global
or at least have larger scale

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:10.750
or at least have larger scale
 

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:12.780
or at least have larger scale
ramifications or that could be systemic

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:12.790
ramifications or that could be systemic
 

01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:15.180
ramifications or that could be systemic
and so therefore maybe the project is

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:15.190
and so therefore maybe the project is
 

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:16.950
and so therefore maybe the project is
either capital P or small pee in your

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960
either capital P or small pee in your
 

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.480
either capital P or small pee in your
question larger project of architecture

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.490
question larger project of architecture
 

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.309
question larger project of architecture
yeah but I mean it's you know you can't

01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319
yeah but I mean it's you know you can't
 

01:04:23.319 --> 01:04:24.900
yeah but I mean it's you know you can't
get to a systemic or general idea

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:24.910
get to a systemic or general idea
 

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:26.040
get to a systemic or general idea
without looking something very closely

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:26.050
without looking something very closely
 

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.829
without looking something very closely
specifically but an architect's our

01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839
specifically but an architect's our
 

01:04:28.839 --> 01:04:31.410
specifically but an architect's our
approach was from the beginning just not

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:31.420
approach was from the beginning just not
 

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.410
approach was from the beginning just not
really well and I think I should say

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:34.420
really well and I think I should say
 

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:36.030
really well and I think I should say
that each of our sites certainly

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:36.040
that each of our sites certainly
 

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.500
that each of our sites certainly
influenced the trajectory of each of our

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:37.510
influenced the trajectory of each of our
 

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.230
influenced the trajectory of each of our
projects I mean if ltl had had our site

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240
projects I mean if ltl had had our site
 

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.700
projects I mean if ltl had had our site
what they have you know looked at the

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:41.710
what they have you know looked at the
 

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.770
what they have you know looked at the
sectional variation is not necessarily

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:43.780
sectional variation is not necessarily
 

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.620
sectional variation is not necessarily
and similarly the case but our site was

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:46.630
and similarly the case but our site was
 

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:48.359
and similarly the case but our site was
very large the largest one we had a

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:48.369
very large the largest one we had a
 

01:04:48.369 --> 01:04:49.890
very large the largest one we had a
large variety of conditions and it

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:49.900
large variety of conditions and it
 

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.599
large variety of conditions and it
clearly we're inclined to look at it as

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:51.609
clearly we're inclined to look at it as
 

01:04:51.609 --> 01:04:53.339
clearly we're inclined to look at it as
sort of urban systemic set of conditions

01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:53.349
sort of urban systemic set of conditions
 

01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:54.960
sort of urban systemic set of conditions
we might have been inclined to think of

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:54.970
we might have been inclined to think of
 

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.670
we might have been inclined to think of
a zoning resolution but I think the

01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680
a zoning resolution but I think the
 

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.829
a zoning resolution but I think the
scale of it definitely influenced you

01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839
scale of it definitely influenced you
 

01:04:58.839 --> 01:05:05.599
scale of it definitely influenced you
know Babs over

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:05.609
 
 

01:05:05.609 --> 01:05:09.319
 
I can go to the second okay yeah i mean

01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:09.329
I can go to the second okay yeah i mean
 

01:05:09.329 --> 01:05:12.279
I can go to the second okay yeah i mean
the second question has to do basically

01:05:12.279 --> 01:05:12.289
the second question has to do basically
 

01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:15.769
the second question has to do basically
it's bigger yeah the second question has

01:05:15.769 --> 01:05:15.779
it's bigger yeah the second question has
 

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:16.999
it's bigger yeah the second question has
to do basically with the question of the

01:05:16.999 --> 01:05:17.009
to do basically with the question of the
 

01:05:17.009 --> 01:05:18.890
to do basically with the question of the
edge and and i basically as far as i

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900
edge and and i basically as far as i
 

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.019
edge and and i basically as far as i
understand the problem was post in such

01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:21.029
understand the problem was post in such
 

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:23.779
understand the problem was post in such
a way that you had to rethink the edge

01:05:23.779 --> 01:05:23.789
a way that you had to rethink the edge
 

01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:25.339
a way that you had to rethink the edge
but basically looking outwards it's

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:25.349
but basically looking outwards it's
 

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:26.989
but basically looking outwards it's
basically the heir to the relation of

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:26.999
basically the heir to the relation of
 

01:05:26.999 --> 01:05:28.579
basically the heir to the relation of
the city the edge of the city with the

01:05:28.579 --> 01:05:28.589
the city the edge of the city with the
 

01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:30.529
the city the edge of the city with the
water and potentially there the idea of

01:05:30.529 --> 01:05:30.539
water and potentially there the idea of
 

01:05:30.539 --> 01:05:32.870
water and potentially there the idea of
envisaging a new for public space by

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880
envisaging a new for public space by
 

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.400
envisaging a new for public space by
embracing the water i thought there was

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:34.410
embracing the water i thought there was
 

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:37.069
embracing the water i thought there was
a kind of a kind of open reference to

01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079
a kind of a kind of open reference to
 

01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:38.599
a kind of a kind of open reference to
venice at some point i remember from

01:05:38.599 --> 01:05:38.609
venice at some point i remember from
 

01:05:38.609 --> 01:05:42.739
venice at some point i remember from
previous presentation so the question I

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:42.749
previous presentation so the question I
 

01:05:42.749 --> 01:05:46.009
previous presentation so the question I
have basically since you you can of all

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:46.019
have basically since you you can of all
 

01:05:46.019 --> 01:05:48.259
have basically since you you can of all
work with with edges which are kind of

01:05:48.259 --> 01:05:48.269
work with with edges which are kind of
 

01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:50.479
work with with edges which are kind of
diluted were basically that welcome the

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:50.489
diluted were basically that welcome the
 

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:52.700
diluted were basically that welcome the
water in all three projects what is the

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:52.710
water in all three projects what is the
 

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:54.109
water in all three projects what is the
relationship you establish between the

01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119
relationship you establish between the
 

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:56.359
relationship you establish between the
edge and the inside in other words the

01:05:56.359 --> 01:05:56.369
edge and the inside in other words the
 

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.190
edge and the inside in other words the
the language the edge defines a known

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200
the language the edge defines a known
 

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.470
the language the edge defines a known
its relation to the water but its

01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480
its relation to the water but its
 

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.809
its relation to the water but its
relation to the city and in so doing

01:06:01.809 --> 01:06:01.819
relation to the city and in so doing
 

01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:05.799
relation to the city and in so doing
what kind of urbanism do you propose

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:05.809
what kind of urbanism do you propose
 

01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:08.390
what kind of urbanism do you propose
it's a crucial question if I could take

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400
it's a crucial question if I could take
 

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.749
it's a crucial question if I could take
it first our collaborators mathura

01:06:11.749 --> 01:06:11.759
it first our collaborators mathura
 

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:13.309
it first our collaborators mathura
takuna have spent a lot of time looking

01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319
takuna have spent a lot of time looking
 

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:16.249
takuna have spent a lot of time looking
at the kind of extensive gradient of

01:06:16.249 --> 01:06:16.259
at the kind of extensive gradient of
 

01:06:16.259 --> 01:06:18.499
at the kind of extensive gradient of
what we now call the edge that really

01:06:18.499 --> 01:06:18.509
what we now call the edge that really
 

01:06:18.509 --> 01:06:20.299
what we now call the edge that really
there isn't a single edge it's dynamic

01:06:20.299 --> 01:06:20.309
there isn't a single edge it's dynamic
 

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.999
there isn't a single edge it's dynamic
it's shifting and it's something in our

01:06:22.999 --> 01:06:23.009
it's shifting and it's something in our
 

01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:24.859
it's shifting and it's something in our
thinking that's been produced by the

01:06:24.859 --> 01:06:24.869
thinking that's been produced by the
 

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:27.140
thinking that's been produced by the
evolution of planning of the plan and

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:27.150
evolution of planning of the plan and
 

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.569
evolution of planning of the plan and
the map right but in fact if we think of

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579
the map right but in fact if we think of
 

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:31.819
the map right but in fact if we think of
it as a continuous at europe after ariel

01:06:31.819 --> 01:06:31.829
it as a continuous at europe after ariel
 

01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:33.529
it as a continuous at europe after ariel
condition this possibly changing there

01:06:33.529 --> 01:06:33.539
condition this possibly changing there
 

01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:35.870
condition this possibly changing there
is no single edge but ultimately you

01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880
is no single edge but ultimately you
 

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.309
is no single edge but ultimately you
know we tried to address this issue

01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319
know we tried to address this issue
 

01:06:37.319 --> 01:06:39.109
know we tried to address this issue
through a dynamic condition and a

01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119
through a dynamic condition and a
 

01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:40.309
through a dynamic condition and a
multiple condition in other words there

01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319
multiple condition in other words there
 

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:42.470
multiple condition in other words there
are many edges is you know can a

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480
are many edges is you know can a
 

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.390
are many edges is you know can a
pervious network that extends all the

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400
pervious network that extends all the
 

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.819
pervious network that extends all the
way into the city so if i try to trying

01:06:46.819 --> 01:06:46.829
way into the city so if i try to trying
 

01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:48.349
way into the city so if i try to trying
to bring the city to the water in the

01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359
to bring the city to the water in the
 

01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:50.029
to bring the city to the water in the
water into the city we try to confound

01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039
water into the city we try to confound
 

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.309
water into the city we try to confound
that very very issue but the edge also i

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319
that very very issue but the edge also i
 

01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:54.140
that very very issue but the edge also i
think is a disciplinary edge that is

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:54.150
think is a disciplinary edge that is
 

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.700
think is a disciplinary edge that is
brought up here and there what are the

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:55.710
brought up here and there what are the
 

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:58.039
brought up here and there what are the
tools and you know histories and so on

01:06:58.039 --> 01:06:58.049
tools and you know histories and so on
 

01:06:58.049 --> 01:06:59.900
tools and you know histories and so on
we need to corral to address address

01:06:59.900 --> 01:06:59.910
we need to corral to address address
 

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:01.250
we need to corral to address address
this issue and clearly

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260
this issue and clearly
 

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.950
this issue and clearly
each project has exposed so I'm thinking

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960
each project has exposed so I'm thinking
 

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.530
each project has exposed so I'm thinking
that you know transcends or transgresses

01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:06.540
that you know transcends or transgresses
 

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.230
that you know transcends or transgresses
I think that kind of us too i would say

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240
I think that kind of us too i would say
 

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:13.220
I think that kind of us too i would say
that maybe the edge is problematic as a

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:13.230
that maybe the edge is problematic as a
 

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:17.420
that maybe the edge is problematic as a
starting point because of the the edges

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:17.430
starting point because of the the edges
 

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.880
starting point because of the the edges
is the battleground to some degree but

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:19.890
is the battleground to some degree but
 

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:23.380
is the battleground to some degree but
but it assumes some sort of adaptive

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:23.390
but it assumes some sort of adaptive
 

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.940

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.620

so on so so clearly the edge has a role

01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620

so on so so clearly the edge has a role

obviously it immediately provokes the
 

01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:15.590
obviously it immediately provokes the
limits of discussion of the limits of

01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600
limits of discussion of the limits of
 

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.630
limits of discussion of the limits of
architecture right and like the limits

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640
architecture right and like the limits
 

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.400

architecture where you see a painting by
 

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.930
architecture where you see a painting by
zaha hadid in a frame and you kind of

01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940
zaha hadid in a frame and you kind of
 

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.550
zaha hadid in a frame and you kind of
get it or you don't get it and you move

01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560
get it or you don't get it and you move
 

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.430

today because of the fact that women

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860
today because of the fact that women
 

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.589
today because of the fact that women
hadn't exactly becoming Venice itself

that of that condition so the question

01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:58.590
that of that condition so the question
 

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.229
that of that condition so the question
would be to what extent do you celebrate

01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239
would be to what extent do you celebrate
 

01:24:00.239 --> 01:24:02.830
would be to what extent do you celebrate
them to what extent do you kind of

inverting that condition so Venice is as

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:39.610
inverting that condition so Venice is as

01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:53.980
wonderful city but sometimes let's think
 

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.500
wonderful city but sometimes let's think
of it as a regional condition that's

I don't I mean I think what in talking
 

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:19.130
I don't I mean I think what in talking
about the broader audience for the

about the broader audience for the
 

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.680
about the broader audience for the

you know below at sea level or within
 

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:39.050
you know below at sea level or within
sort of the threat of the sort of you

01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060
sort of the threat of the sort of you
 

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.630
sort of the threat of the sort of you
know 50 year inundation period Delta

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:41.640
know 50 year inundation period Delta
 

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.709
know 50 year inundation period Delta
cities that but maybe that you know the

01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719
cities that but maybe that you know the
 

01:26:45.719 --> 01:26:48.380
cities that but maybe that you know the
projects could be powerful relative to

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:48.390
projects could be powerful relative to
 

01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:49.850
projects could be powerful relative to
some of these other global cities that

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860
some of these other global cities that
 

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.439
some of these other global cities that
are going to be facing some of the same

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:51.449
are going to be facing some of the same
 

01:26:51.449 --> 01:26:54.470
are going to be facing some of the same
issues and I think ideally that one

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480
issues and I think ideally that one
 

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.150
issues and I think ideally that one
could you know go through the exhibit

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:32.790
will be out there to be kind of called
 

01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:34.820
will be out there to be kind of called
from to be taken advantage of and that

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:34.830
from to be taken advantage of and that
 

01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:36.800
from to be taken advantage of and that
the thinking already may be somewhat

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:36.810
the thinking already may be somewhat
 

01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:39.020
the thinking already may be somewhat
changed and in terms of the way people

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:39.030
changed and in terms of the way people
 

01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:40.430
changed and in terms of the way people
might approach these but there are

01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440
might approach these but there are
 

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.800
might approach these but there are
incredible bureaucratic and and kind of

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:42.810
incredible bureaucratic and and kind of
 

01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:45.229
incredible bureaucratic and and kind of
structural barriers to that and i think

01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239
structural barriers to that and i think
 

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:47.000
structural barriers to that and i think
that the hope is that this begins to

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:47.010
that the hope is that this begins to
 

01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:50.180
that the hope is that this begins to
make inroads i would put a question back

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:50.190
make inroads i would put a question back
 

01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:52.459
make inroads i would put a question back
to Reinhold and that was your your

01:30:52.459 --> 01:30:52.469
to Reinhold and that was your your
 

01:30:52.469 --> 01:30:55.520
to Reinhold and that was your your
premise on what the projects are and

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:55.530
premise on what the projects are and
 

01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:58.129
premise on what the projects are and
this notion of you know they're never

01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139
this notion of you know they're never
 

01:30:58.139 --> 01:30:59.839
this notion of you know they're never
going to get bill to do that like it's a

01:30:59.839 --> 01:30:59.849
going to get bill to do that like it's a
 

01:30:59.849 --> 01:31:04.040
going to get bill to do that like it's a
lot of crews why why is that I mean this

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:04.050
lot of crews why why is that I mean this
 

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:05.689
lot of crews why why is that I mean this
is I don't want to be critical but this

01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699
is I don't want to be critical but this
 

01:31:05.699 --> 01:31:07.399
is I don't want to be critical but this
is like Mickey Mouse stuff I mean we've

01:31:07.399 --> 01:31:07.409
is like Mickey Mouse stuff I mean we've
 

01:31:07.409 --> 01:31:09.229
is like Mickey Mouse stuff I mean we've
all been doing this in graduate schools

01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239
all been doing this in graduate schools
 

01:31:09.239 --> 01:31:12.350
all been doing this in graduate schools
for the last 15 years in my Studios and

01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360
for the last 15 years in my Studios and
 

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.899
for the last 15 years in my Studios and
all of our studios so I mean what is the

01:31:14.899 --> 01:31:14.909
all of our studios so I mean what is the
 

01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:18.830
all of our studios so I mean what is the
trope of this kind of thinking that we

01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840
trope of this kind of thinking that we
 

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.229
trope of this kind of thinking that we
that this is somehow like oh you know

01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239
that this is somehow like oh you know
 

01:31:21.239 --> 01:31:23.810
that this is somehow like oh you know
it's a museum project I mean what what

01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820
it's a museum project I mean what what
 

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.939
it's a museum project I mean what what
is that saying I mean even this notion

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:25.949
is that saying I mean even this notion
 

01:31:25.949 --> 01:31:28.729
is that saying I mean even this notion

01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739
of the the Mississippi which you know
 

01:31:28.739 --> 01:31:31.250
of the the Mississippi which you know
has been on the board for for 20 years I

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260
has been on the board for for 20 years I
 

01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.629

mean the second that the Mississippi

01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639
mean the second that the Mississippi
 

01:31:32.639 --> 01:31:35.450

because I mean that's that's all so I'm
kind of falling back to the thesis of

01:32:10.169 --> 01:32:10.179
kind of falling back to the thesis of
 

01:32:10.179 --> 01:32:12.240
kind of falling back to the thesis of
the oyster textured project but there

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:12.250
the oyster textured project but there
 

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:14.490

construction projects with the exception
 

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.629
construction projects with the exception
of bridges and roads and and you know

projects that are somehow subsidized by
 

01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:27.780
projects that are somehow subsidized by
by big industry so so the fact that that

01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:27.790
by big industry so so the fact that that
 

01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:30.540
by big industry so so the fact that that
the presumption is that these projects

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:30.550
the presumption is that these projects
 

01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:32.520
the presumption is that these projects

know provoking on that score is is to
 

01:32:52.929 --> 01:32:55.830
know provoking on that score is is to

and probably there are more

01:33:09.919 --> 01:33:09.929
and probably there are more
 

01:33:09.929 --> 01:33:11.850

that's the other conclusion you can

01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440
that's the other conclusion you can
 

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.890
that's the other conclusion you can
arrive at and functionalism speaks about

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:22.900
arrive at and functionalism speaks about
 

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.470
arrive at and functionalism speaks about

to get at the question we have to ask

to get at the question we have to ask
 

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.220
to get at the question we have to ask
you know exactly what you asked why is

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:19.230
you know exactly what you asked why is
 

01:34:19.230 --> 01:34:21.169
you know exactly what you asked why is
that and I don't think there's a
