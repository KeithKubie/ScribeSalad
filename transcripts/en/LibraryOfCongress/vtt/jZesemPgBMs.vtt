00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Hi,
I'm Mark Horowitz.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.820
I'm a Music Specialist in the Music
Division at The Library of Congress

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.330
and I'm currently the Archivist for
the Leonard Bernstein Collection,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.780
but with me is, among other
things, the previous Archivist

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.750
for the Bernstein Collection,
Charlie Harmon,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.400
and thank you for coming.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.700
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
You're very welcome.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And I just wanted
to start with some information

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270 position:56%
about you, what was your background,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.920
your educational experience before
you became involved in all of this?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.110
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Yeah, I have a degree

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.370
in Music Composition
from Carnegie Mellon.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.990
I left, I graduated in 1973.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.150
I had gone to Carnegie
Mellon in architecture,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.370
really couldn't get my brain around
the profession of architecture,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.980
it just it's really hard.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.100
Music was a lot easier.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.580
And the important thing in the 60s
was to, the late 60s was to stay

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.680
in school and not be drafted.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.050
So I dropped into the Music
Department, which was one floor

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.030
down at Carnegie Mellon
at that point.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.240
So when I, as a grownup
I was a computer operator

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.950
for a little company in Boston.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.550
And a friend, one of my
roommates from Carnegie Mellon,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.330
was living in New York doing
his postdoctoral research

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.740 position:56%
at the Rockefeller University, and
he said you need to move to New York

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.690
because the opportunities are here.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.180
And I did and I worked at a
company called Tams-Witmark,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.600
which licenses Broadway material.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.580
I liked it very much.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.420
It paid very well.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.040
And I met Dale Kugel, who
became a mentor to me.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.740
It was the first time I'd thought
of someone as a real mentor.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.400
And he wanted to hire me to
be his copyist assistant,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.440
assistant librarian, and
that wasn't in the cards.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.440
So I was looking at the
classified section every Sunday

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.950
in the New York Times, back when
it was 100 pages every week.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.110
It was pretty impressive.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.870
And there was always something
under music in the New York Times,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.940
even though obviously to
get into the music business

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.180
in New York you had
to know somebody.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.200
It was all about who knew
talent that was in the city.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.330
But there was this one
ad that said, musician,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:15.310
world class needs assistant,
must be free to travel,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.330
familiar with European
languages, super organized --

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.530
it didn't say super, but it had
to be very well organized --

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.770
and be able to read
music, and that was it.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.080
And then a box so you
could send your resume.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.710
And I thought, huh.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.640
I've lived overseas when
my father was in the Army.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.030
We lived in Germany and Italy.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.090
I could still read
German and Italian,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.240 position:56%
but at that point I had let it lapse

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.720
and I couldn't really
have a conversation.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.150
I could certainly read music.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.740
I was very organized.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:01.030
I mean everything, I've always
when I receive letters I file them

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.580
in boxes, I mean it's just, but
I do, I just organize stuff.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.500
All my books and music
were always alphabetized.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.790
So I sent off my resume,
which was about this long.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.900
And I got a call and it was from
Mimsy Gill, who was secretary

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.460
to someone named Harry Kraut.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.260
Not a clue who the world
class musician was.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.520
And they asked me to
come in for an interview,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.120
and the interview went
on for three hours.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.420
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Just with Harry?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.720
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Just with Harry.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.860
First thing he said was,
it's Leonard Bernstein.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.440
And I said, oh.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.350
That's, let me think,
Leonard Bernstein.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.550
I'd never seen Bernstein conduct
except on young people's concerts.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.720
I hadn't read any of his books.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.190
I had two recordings that I
liked, the Bartok Concerto

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.590
for Orchestra and, oh,
Robert Schumann Symphony No.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.080 position:56%
3. And what I remembered, I remember
sitting there talking to Harry

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.160
and thinking of that
Robert Schumann recording

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.390
and the cover had the Cathedral
of Cologne and a portrait

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.180
of Leonard Bernstein and
they were the same size.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.540
And I remember just sitting
there thinking, yes, okay,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.960
Leonard Bernstein has an ego as big

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.180
as the Cathedral of
Cologne [laughter].

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.020
Harry didn't tell me much more
than that, and so I prodded him

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:55.180 position:56%
and I said, this was in October of
1981, and I said what's the schedule

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.540
in 1982, you know,
what's he doing in 1982?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.690
And Harry talked for 45 minutes
without pause, without any notes,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:14.400
a week-by-week summary of what
the maestro was doing in 1982.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.970
And at the end of 45
minutes I was stunned.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.920
I mean he began by -- I mean
he would mention the orchestras

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.100
and where we would be and if an
orchestra was being taken on tour.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.800
And at that point I had
crossed the Atlantic six times

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.010
in my life and I was 31 years old.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.750
And in the first six months
there were about eight crossings

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.040
of the Atlantic, and I
thought this is just insane,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.510
this is an insane schedule.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:55.080
So after the 45 minutes I said,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.920
I think you need a very high
energy person for this job

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.770
and I've never been high energy.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.230
And I said, I think you need
someone about half my age.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.080
And Harry let me talk
about myself for awhile.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.170
And one of the things I had -- I
was doing, I shared an apartment

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.230
in Brooklyn Heights and I
and my neighbors had decided

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.590
to have a New Year's Eve party.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.830
We just decided, we were happy
in New York and we were going

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.370
to invite all our friends.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.850
We I think invited 250 people
and they all showed up.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.710
And we decided to cater
it ourselves.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.040 position:56%
And so what I did was I made all the
cookies and I made 80 dozen cookies.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.460
And Harry said, oh, yeah,
a party for 200 people,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.310
I know exactly the
caterer I would call.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.810
And I said, well, we don't
have that kind of budget,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.930
so I made 80 dozen cookies.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.880
And Harry was completely
taken aback.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.280
He'd never met anybody who
would just nonchalantly turn

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.020
out 80 dozen cookies
and throw a party.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.320
I mean it was ...

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.620
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Still
have them ...

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.920
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
It's not hard to do

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.090
because once you start
baking it's just a, you know,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.280
you just have to have the
space to let them cool

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.010
and the tins to put them in.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.680
He was wildly impressed.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.220
He told me this later after I
was hired, he said the two things

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.930 position:56%
that really impressed him was the 80
dozen cookies and that at the bottom

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.070
of my resume I had listed the
three high schools that I went to

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.480
and the first one was in
Naples, Italy run by the US Navy

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.410
and he had never met anyone who
went to high school in Naples,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.090
and he thought this
is exactly the person.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.900
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Do you have any
idea how many people they actually

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.200
interviewed for the job?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.580
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, he told
me, this was years later he told me

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:04.130 position:56%
that they usually got 200 responses
and they would throw out 190 of them

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.810
because they were on the ad in
the Times and the Village Voice.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.140
And you can imagine the
responses they got from the ad

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.390
in the Village Voice, especially
since it didn't say who it was,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.670
it just said world class musician.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.990
Well, you know, what,
Bob Dillon, who is it?

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:26.950
And he said they just, they
knew instantly which ones,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.930
which applications to throw out.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:37.350
But he liked what I had listed,
you know, the green composition,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.810
the languages, the ability
to travel and the --

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.450
well, he didn't know
how organized I was.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.410
So I, when I left the
interview I said,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.300
I don't think I can
do this, and I left.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.980
And I had some other
interviews that fall.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.200 position:56%
I can't remember now what they were.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:09.360
And I think around Thanksgiving I
called, it was the Amberson office

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.310
at that point, and I
called the office and talked

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.750
to Mimsy Gill, Harry's secretary.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.630
And said, look, just
keep my name in the mix,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.890
I'm sure you're still
having interviews.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.250
Well, they weren't.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.770
And just let me know, you know,
if something falls into place.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.860
So the first working day after
New Year's in 1982 Harry called me

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:38.820
at Tams and said, you can have
it, we're going to hire you,

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.120
you have to fly to Bloomington,
Indiana this Friday --

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:48.330
this was a Tuesday -- and you'll
meet Lenny in Bloomington.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.310
And I said, I can't
talk on the phone,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.240
because personal calls were
not allowed at Tams-Witmark.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.470
I said, I'll come to your office
this afternoon, this evening.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.260
When I walked into the Amberson
offices Harry was on the phone

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.560
with the Student Union

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.490
in Bloomington making my
accommodation reservation.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:13.320 position:56%
And I said, well, if you really
think I can do it, okay, I'll do it.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.640
We hadn't talked about a
salary or anything like that.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And it didn't need
Lenny's approval, the hiring of you?

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.670
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Lenny, Lenny trusted Harry

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.810
with a lot of those details.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.650
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was Jack
Gottlieb the person before you

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.970
or was there somebody else ...

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.940
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, Daryl
Bornstein came before me,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:38.460
and I don't know why he -- I can't
remember how long he stuck with it,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.220
but I think it was
less than two years.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.510
And there was an interim assistant,
Richard Nelson, wonderful actor.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.090
He's out in LA.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.010
And I don't remember how
he came into the picture,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.970
but he was doing some
travel with Bernstein

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.620
and I think maybe helping
out Daryl for awhile.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.430
Before Daryl there was
a string of assistants.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.490
Lenny told me at one point, well,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.200
one of them lasted
for only four days.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.000
He'd show up, you know,
someone would show up,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.150
see how overwhelming the
position was and then just leave.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.840
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: What
was your title?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.940
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Assistant,
Assistant to Leonard Bernstein.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.650
But I never had a business
card or anything like that.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.950
There wasn't anything like that.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.250
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And in addition

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.430
to your salary they covered all
your travel costs and hotels?

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Right,
and when I talked to Harry

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:42.040
about salary I had never
bartered for a salary in my life,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.670
Harry offered -- he asked me how
much I was being paid at Tams

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.560
and I told him, I was
way too honest.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.310
And he offered about,
it was about 20% more.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:01.410
And I didn't know what to
do, so there was a pause

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.050
and Harry assumed that I agreed.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.500
[laughter] And it really
should have been

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.230
about three times what
he offered me.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.720
It wasn't really enough
to live on in New York.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.800
I mean I was really scrambling.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.570
And New York was cheap in
1981, I mean relatively cheap.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.250
But I mean for a dollar you
could get a newspaper and get

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.040
on the subway, it was ...

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.970
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Were you
able to negotiate raises?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.100
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No,
and that was something --

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.360
I just didn't have it in
me, and there were times

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.950
when over the four years
of being the Assistant

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.340
that I would ask Harry, how do I --

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.470
I really need to be paid more
for working 80 hours a week.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.780
And he said, it'll just put
you in a higher tax bracket.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.530
[laughter] And I just, I ...

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So you worked
for four years in this position?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.940
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: So I flew out
to Indiana that Friday with Harry.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.830
Harry said he'd tell me everything
I needed to know on the flight.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.180
He promptly fell asleep.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.510
No conversation at
all on the flight,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.590
and I still hadn't met Bernstein.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.600
And it wasn't until
the next day in Indiana

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.330
that Bernstein arrived
and I met him.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:28.700
And I thought this derelict, this
decrepit geriatric who was drunk,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.620
this -- he hadn't slept,
he hadn't shaved that day.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.310
He obviously had not showered.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:41.800
And I thought he was nuts, I
thought he was completely nuts.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.270
He was very lively, but when --

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:53.460
after this condo outside of
Bloomington, after he arrived

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.690
with this barrage of
university people behind him,

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:02.060
and Richard Nelson and
Harry and Stephen Zinzer,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.840
Stephen Wadsworth Zinzer, who
was collaborating on what turned

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.740
into A Quiet Place, and Ann Dedman,
who was the chef and also sort

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:16.220
of a traveling household manager.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.630
So all these people arrived,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.480
and I mean I wasn't
even introduced to him.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.450
Harry said my name, and
Bernstein didn't even --

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.040
he couldn't really focus, he
was just manic at that moment.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.600
So I took, he had this huge parka,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.290
I took the parka off his
shoulders and hung it up.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.950
And I asked him if
he wanted a drink?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.850
And he said, well,
what are you drinking?

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.470
And I had poured about a
tablespoon of gin into a glass

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.280
because I thought I might need it,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.160
my nerves were a little
up at that point.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.820
And he grabbed the glass
out of my hand and drank it.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.200
And I said, that's my drink.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.020
And he said, you don't
talk that way to the rabbi.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:08.570
And I didn't know what to do, I
mean I didn't think he was a rabbi

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.020
and I thought he was really
angry, I thought he was, you know,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.900
I wasn't so fine and
maybe I was fired already.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:22.020
And I just kind of
stood around mopey.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.130
[laughter] He was talking to
everybody else individually,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.630
all these people that
he obviously knew.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:37.200 position:56%
And after about a half hour he said,
well, I want to see the bedroom.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.570
Because the piano, there was an
upstairs with a huge master suite,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.860
there was a desk in there
and there was a piano.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.010 position:56%
It overlooked, there was a wall of
windows that overlooked Lake Monroe.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.830
It was frozen, of course,
in January.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:00.040
It was a nice room, but that's
basically where he was going

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.020
to sleep and work for six weeks.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.840
And my concern was is
this a workable space,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.770
can you write an opera here?

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.220
And instead he wanted to
see how I had unpacked.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:20.410
I mean the luggage came from New
York and I unpacked underwear

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.860
for someone I'd never met and ...

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.990
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So as Assistant
it wasn't just musical things,

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.290
it was everything.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.590
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: It was
picking up the laundry,

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.520
it was answering the phone.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.740
But Harry did say that I was
hired because there is a deadline

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.690 position:56%
for this opera, a three-part
commission from Houston Grand Opera,

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:46.520
La Scala in the Kennedy Center, and
the premiere was June 17th, 1983,

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.000 position:56%
so the opera had to be done on time.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.410
And I said, well, fine, June -- at
this interview in October of '81,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.130
I said June of '83,
that's plenty of time.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.540
Well, I didn't know what was
going to get in the way ...

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.360
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Sort of corral
Bernstein and say you need

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.800
to work now or try and ...

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.830
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, he, you
know, he also was super organized

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.130
and he understood what --

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.140
at that point in his life certainly
understood how a collaboration

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.440
would work.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.840
I think Steve Wadsworth had to
corral Bernstein quite a bit,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.860
especially once they
got some momentum going,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.800 position:56%
Lenny would just find other things
to do, you know, the social calendar

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.630
for instance, that would
just take over in New York.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.380
And Stephen would call
and say, well,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.010 position:56%
I really need to see him three
times this week and I need two hours

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.570
on this day and I need
two hours on this day.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.330
And that was part of my job,

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.430
to make sure that those
meetings actually happened.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.850
And that they wouldn't
be interrupted, you know,

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.070
if Adolph Green called in the
middle of one of those sessions

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.280
that the two collaborators were
having I would just take a message

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.230
or I'd talk to Adolph for
an hour, that was okay.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.530
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: In
the four years you were

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.150
with Lenny what were the
major projects that happened?

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.940
A Quiet Place.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.120
What other works did he work on?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.580
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, A
Quiet Place was really it.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.200
He -- there wasn't that much music.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:39.950 position:56%
I think he was a little disappointed
how he didn't have the time

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.890
in those years to collaborate more.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:50.480
He did write Arias and Barcarolles,
but that was completely on his own,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.270
and some little pieces, but other

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.390
than A Quiet Place
there was nothing major.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So he
was mostly conducting?

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.920
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes, it
was a lot of conducting.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.240
He finished the Brahms Cycle
with the Vienna Philharmonic

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.430
and a Schumann Cycle, and then
started a new Moller Cycle

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.840
for Deutsche Grammophon,
which didn't get completed,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.400
the 8th never go recorded.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.820
And, oh, he did an All
American album in 1982

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.210
and he did an English album.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.650
It was an enormous
amount of recording,

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.970
and that actually took
a lot of attention.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.310
I mean when he looked at the Elgar
enigma variations in the spring

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:44.450
of 1982, I remember looking through
his score and thinking, well,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.740
you know, there's nothing more
he needs to mark in this piece.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.590
And then he looked at it as though
he'd never looked at it before

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.870
and changed all kinds of
things, not so much change

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:03.020
but not changing dynamics for
instance but adding articulation

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.020
so that everything would be there
in the parts and he wouldn't have

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.570
to explain so much from the podium.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.200
Of course, when you're conducting
an English orchestra in a piece

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.740 position:56%
by Elgar there's already a tradition
that that orchestra brings to it,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.630
but he really put his
own stamp on it.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.200
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So somebody would
actually go to the musicians' parts

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.180
and mark them up based on his
annotations on the full score?

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.270
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes,
I ended up doing that.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.040
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Is
that typical, or?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.340
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: That's --

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.010
yes, absolutely, that's what
orchestra librarians do constantly

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:40.770
for -- and a great thing
about the job for me was

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:47.090
that wherever we would go usually
there wasn't enough advanced time

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.080
to go to Larry Taro [Assumed
Spelling] at the Philharmonic

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.150
and say, here are all
these markings,

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.870
transfer them into the parts.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.110
But since we were traveling with
Bernstein's own set of materials,

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:04.370
it was the first time I'd met a
conductor who had his own library,

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.430 position:56%
basically his performance library
came from the New York Philharmonic.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:13.860
When he left the Philharmonic --
what year was that, '72 I think --

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.880
Carlos Moseley [Assumed
Spelling] hadn't really promised,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.240
but somehow said to Bernstein,
well, you can take anything

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.990
from the library that you
conducted at the Philharmonic.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.930
And so Bernstein took everything, I
mean all the Beethoven symphonies,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.660
all the Mozart and Haydn,
Stravinsky, everything,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.490
and he just took everything.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.120
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: The
already marked up scores?

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.300
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Right, scores and parts.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.590
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Were
they horrified, or?

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.170
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, it was a
big loss, but things got replaced.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.570
But there were some things he
should not have taken, but he did.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:59.630
Toscanini's set of parts
for the Leonore No.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:05.470
3 Overture of Beethoven, in which
Toscanini changed the orchestration

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:12.890
on the last page of the score,
added brass, just re-voiced chords

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.230
and things like that in red pencil.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.670
I mean it's Toscanini's marking
in that score and so they're

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.550
in the parts, and that became
Bernstein's set of materials.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:26.680
All that stuff, you know, it
was all stamped on the front,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.620
Property of the New York
Philharmonic Symphony Association,

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.960
or whatever they used
to call themselves.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:38.430
All that stuff went back to
the Philharmonic archive,

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.950
when I became Bernstein's archivist
and catalogued everything that was,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.740
well, existed at that point.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.760
Barbara Haws [Assumed
Spelling] had been --

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.290
had created an archive for the New
York Philharmonic and she said,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.580
we think we would like
this stuff returned.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.880
[laughter]

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did he do the
Norton lectures while you were

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.900
with him, or?

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, that was
'72, I think, so it was 10 years ...

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:10.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So there were no
major lecture series, talking's,

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.130
anything like that during
the time you were with him?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.430
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
There really wasn't,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.060
it was an enormous
amount of conducting.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.570
And then that first year we
were on the road from, well,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:28.650
from Bloomington all the way
through the end of September,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.760
there was really no pause.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.960
Sometimes we would be in Los
Angeles, we were in Los Angeles

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.060
for about a month that summer,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.030
but there was something
every single day.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:47.020
And then after September
he had nine empty months

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.300
in which he was supposed
to write the opera.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.470
So he started it in Bloomington.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:57.180
They got the first act
basically done, not orchestrated,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.830
he wrote in a short
score so it was somewhere

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.280
between four and six
staves of music.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.460
And one of the first
things he asked me to do,

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.000 position:56%
I was picking up his laundry in that
room with the piano and the desk

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.350
and the bed, he said, don't you
have a degree in composition,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.230
why are you picking up my laundry?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.760
And I said, well, you know, the
laundry has to be picked up.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.810
And he said, well, here, see
what you can do with this,

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.480
I need a piano reduction.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.710
And he handed me the scene that
he had finished the night before.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:40.520
And one of the things that the
Indiana University Jacobs School

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.890
of Music, I have to
remember to say that,

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:51.070
offered to do was a readthrough
of each scene as it was completed.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:56.370
And Stephen Wadsworth
corralled a bunch of singers,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:04.480
some really marvelous singers, and
some pianists and it got taped,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.530
audiotape, scene by scene, but
they needed something to play from.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.910
And no one, they were not going
to be able to play from, you know,

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:14.450
a Leonard Bernstein
manuscript in short score.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.840
So I started making
a piano reduction,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.110
and it's something I've
always enjoyed doing.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.860
In fact, I used to do
it as an undergraduate,

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.710
I would do it just for
fun just for myself.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.820
It was a great way to
learn to read a score

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.120
and to see what was important

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.610
and it also improved my
music copying skills.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:39.490
And I did the entire first act.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was he impressed?

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.000
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
No, he said you need

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.100
to be more forceful on the page.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.340
[laughter] I said, I'm
just trying to be accurate.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.080
And he said, no, there's more
to it than just being accurate.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.840
And then he would change things.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.740
It was really interesting
because, you know, I'd present him

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:06.550
with a piano reduction, everything
lined up, all the lyrics, you know,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:11.170
just as clear as could be, always
giving enough horizontal space

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:18.330
for all the lyrics and the vocal
lines always in the same order and,

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.220
you know, all that
stuff is important.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.140
And then if he made a
change, and he was --

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.230
he really looked at
every single note

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.180
that I had copied in
my piano reduction.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:36.180
He liked that I made
it playable, but he --

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:43.360 position:56%
and he was very generous with his
praise, but he did say it has to be,

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.380
there has to be more
presence on the page.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.160
I was just using Alpheus music
writer pencils, but he wanted me

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.740
to press into the paper a lot more.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.630
And I was using a ruler,
which helped.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:28:02.100
But it just had to be, it just
had to look more forceful.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.980
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did this
change your relationship?

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.640
Did he start of start thinking
of you in a different way?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.050
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I don't know
how, well, the working relationship

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.990
at the beginning I just
thought was kind of odd

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.240
because I didn't know
anything about him.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.950
I didn't know that
he smoked cigarettes.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.400
I didn't know he had been
married and had kids.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.710
And I remember one day somebody
named Alexander called and I said,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.970 position:56%
well, you know, I'll take a message.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.650
And Lenny screamed at me, he said,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.140
that's my son, don't
you know anything?

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.700
And I said, I didn't
know you had a son.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.820
So after that when Alexander called
I said, yeah, well, here's your son

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.840
on the phone, but I
didn't know that.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.510
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did
you call him Lenny?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.810
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No,

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.720
I never called him Lenny
until after he died.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.220
I always called him Maestro or LB.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And he
never encouraged you to?

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.920
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, and it's
funny because when I worked

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:08.470 position:56%
for Lorin Maiazel as a freelance
editor, he liked to be called Lorin,

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.600
but I mean talk about
a grand personality,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.070
I mean the opposite of Bernstein.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.370
But I also ...

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.670
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Which was grand?

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.970
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Oh, Lorin Maiazel.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.270
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Really?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: But he liked
to be called Lorin, he liked to be

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.470
on a first name basis
with everybody.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:31.400
Yeah, it was -- he
was very different

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.760
from Bernstein, that's for sure.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.300
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: One thing,
it had never occurred to me

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.890
when you were talking about
the conducting it seemed most

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.290
of it was focused on
recording and I'd sort

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.960
of assumed it was mostly
focused on concerts

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.950
for audiences and that's ...

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.740
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, but
all his recordings were live,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.170
always does ...

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Studio recordings?

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.490
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, the West
Side Story album with Te Kanawa,

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.190
Jose Carreras, and Tatiana.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.490
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: For that?

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes, and actually
that had an unforeseen benefit.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.470
It was kind of a disaster.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.950
I mean it wasn't --
Carreras was not the tenor

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:22.650
that Bernstein had requested, and
I guess, was it Neil Rosenshein --

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:27.810
I can't remember who was the
tenor -- wasn't available.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.760
And so a little committee was put
together, and I was not involved

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.940
in this at all, and they had to
find a tenor and they latched

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.460
on to Carreras, who said yes.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.410
But nobody sent him any music,

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.670
and then his luggage
went somewhere else.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.750
So he arrived in New York
completely unprepared and kind

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.400
of upset that he had no clothes.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.110
Meanwhile, I was a little
concerned about the music copying

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:00.120
because it was the original
materials being used

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.060
for this recording.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:07.790
And the crew, the editorial crew
that was put together wanted

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:12.650 position:56%
to come meet with Bernstein and talk
about the discrepancies they found.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.770
And I think they said they
found 1,500 errors in the parts

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.930
and another 1,500 in the score.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.760
And what Bernstein did,
they came to the Dakota

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.690
and I showed them into the study.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:30.560
Bernstein put some ice in some
glasses and Ballantine's on the ice

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.390
and handed each of the guys
a drink, and then he talked

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.440
and he wouldn't let
them ask any questions.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:43.020
So nothing got fixed, and it was a
mess, it was really, really a mess.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.830
And at one point in that film
by Humphrey Burton of the making

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.780 position:56%
of this recording, he turns around
and he chews out the editorial crew.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.380
And there was nothing
that they could do,

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.680
he wouldn't answer their questions.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.840
I read a book, I sat in
the back and read a book.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.730
It was an awful three
days, it was really no fun.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:10.120
But the good thing about that
is that Candide was going

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.520 position:56%
to be the next project, which we
did with the London Symphony in '89,

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:20.990
actually almost a year
before Bernstein died.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.730
And Bernstein said, well, there
needs to be just one person

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.050
in charge of putting
the music together.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:33.310
And he said, Charlie
has to do it, so I did.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:38.640
Harry was very skeptical
that I could handle that,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.160
and it took me about six months.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.050
I worked with the Hershy
Kay orchestration pages

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:50.840
that are now here at the library
because that was all that existed.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.950
I didn't so much erase anything,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:59.180
except if Hershy Kay had written
say the second violins doubled the

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:05.100
second clarinet, for awhile he
would just write call clarinet 2,

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.520
so I would erase that
and write the notes in.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.960
Because what I had to --

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.810
oh, and there were no lyrics in
the Hershy Kay orchestration pages.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.790
So I put in all the lyrics, I made
the dynamics match up and down,

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.740
and occasionally there
would be just a blank bar

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.530
and I figured Hershy Kay had gone
to get a sandwich or something

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.850 position:56%
and come back and forgotten, you
know, that the tuba would just be --

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.810
the first part of the page
the tuba would be playing

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:38.680
and then it would be blank, and
obviously was supposed to play.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.090 position:56%
When I -- and the harp in Bon
Voyage plays for the first four bars

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.700
and then is tacit for
something like 390 bars,

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.580
and I forgot to bring
that up with Bernstein.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.190
There really should be
a harp in that number.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:34:00.920
But then Bernstein reviewed
with me page by page the score

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.430
that I had put together,
and then I produced a set

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.730
of hand copied parts for it.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.700
And then we had a full day
with the London Symphony.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.850
Justin Brown was hired to
be Assistant Conductor.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.850
Running through all the material
with just the orchestra to see

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.360
if there were any problems, and
there were a couple wrong notes

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.320
but it worked, it was great.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.840
I also made sure all the singers
had their, you know, every,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.850
every number including the
26 additional bars he put,

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.720
he reinstated into the
Odudifey [Assumed Spelling],

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:43.280
excellent chorus, the London
Voices, beautifully prepared.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.610
And it worked, it came
together really well.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.920
And it was a year after that
Candide that he asked me

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.670
to be his Music Editor,
but he said that was ...

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Your
title changed at that point?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.900
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes, and ...

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.990
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And how long
were you then Music Editor?

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.690
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Then, well, he
died, so I did it for nine years.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.700
So I worked for him for
a total of 18 years,

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:10.850
four years as his Assistant,
three basically to be,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:15.760
to put that archive together,
which was really more

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.120
of an appraisal than
making an archive.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.930
We just, we didn't know what was
in that apartment in the Osborne.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:30.330
And then a year as working
on Candide, basically,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.830
and then nine years
as his Music Editor.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.390
After his death.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:42.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Again, I thought
a lot about him editing his scores,

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.840
but I don't know in terms of
the recordings, themselves,

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.530
how involved he was with listening
to them, editing the recordings,

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:55.210
approving things there, what was
that like, how did that work?

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.220
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: That,
for me that was an education

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:04.090
because I had never
attended a recording session.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:10.130
And it was always the same
crew, headed by Hans Weber

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.620
from Deutsche Grammophon.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:19.470
And the technicians, there was kind
of a rotating group of technicians,

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:25.000
but it was basically six
or seven guys who were --

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.420
I mean and Lenny loved them,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.370
I mean he just absolutely adored
this crew, especially Hans Weber.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:39.070
But then there were these approval
sessions in which the edited tapes,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.130
you know, they'd have to splice out
a really bad cough from somewhere

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.090
in the audience or let's say, well,

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:52.480
with the Vienna Philharmonic
there were some recordings

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.320
that were just one take
because they play perfectly.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.330
And, you know, that happened
with other orchestras, too,

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:05.980
the New York Philharmonic did that.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.490 position:56%
But, in fact, the first recording
session I went to with Bernstein was

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.150
at Watford [Assumed
Spelling] Town Hall,

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:20.540
the BBC Symphony Orchestra
doing an all Elgar album,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.260
and there were these marches

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:30.070
that the live concert was enigma
variations and Bernstein songfest.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:37.040
And so the enigma was taken
from the live performance,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.520
but at the recording session

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.150 position:56%
at Watford Town Hall the album was
being filled out with Elgar marches.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.990
And I remember in the car
going up to Watford I said,

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:51.880
how is it that this orchestra
is going to just play these

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.860
and record them without
any rehearsal?

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.710
We're doing, you know, six
or seven marches in one day.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:06.460
And Bernstein said, well,
they've played these before.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.260
[laughter] They know
these, this music,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.300
and they're going to watch me.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.430
And he said, just pay attention
at this recording session

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.730
and you'll see how it's done.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.560
And it was done, it was incredible.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.710
And they're good, they're fabulous
recordings of those Elgar marches,

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.620
of the Crown of India and Pomp

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.640
and Circumstance and
all those standards.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.910 position:56%
But then there was still an approval
session and when there was a piece

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.170
that had several performances and
sometimes a little bit of retakes,

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.140
the audience would sit there in
the hall because the ambiance had

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:50.760
to be the same, and there would
be maybe the end of one movement,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.110
just three or four bars that
Hans Weber would say, well,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:39:00.150
we heard someone shuffling in
their seat or something like that,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.430
we heard a creaking seat,

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:07.790
or the second bassoon wasn't
really paying attention

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.090
or something like that.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.390
I'm just making things up.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.600
So there would be splices and then
there would be a listening session

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.920
maybe six months later.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:24.460
And Bernstein and Hans Weber
would compare notes without,

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.770 position:56%
I mean neither of them had anything
written but Bernstein would say, oh,

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.820
so that was the Sunday
morning concert,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.180
the end of that movement was
from the Sunday morning concert,

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:42.830 position:56%
even though you used the Saturday
afternoon for most of that movement.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:46.920
And Hans Weber would say, yes,
yes, that's exactly right.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.770
They remembered all this.

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:52.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: How did
Lenny actually edit his scores?

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.340
What was the process of ...

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.640
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Something he
learned from Koussevitzky was

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.980
to mark the phrasing at the top
of the page with a blue pencil,

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:13.530
a curve for a three-bar phrase,
and the top of a triangle,

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:18.240
like a gable on a house,
for a two-bar phrase,

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:27.280
and then if it was more than, more
bars than that you could draw,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.410
say in Haydn when there
are five-bar phrases,

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:36.770 position:56%
you draw the three-bar phrase and
then you put a plus, four plus five,

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:42.370 position:56%
and it's just a reminder, it's a
conductor's note and it's a reminder

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.950
of where the music is
going, you know, what --

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:51.710
as though you were an actor reading
a soliloquy from Shakespeare,

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:58.490
you want to know where the phrase
ends so you can take a breath

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.800
or emphasize something new.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:07.600
But then with red pencil he'd
mark, especially articulation,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:12.110
lots and lots of articulation,
sometimes just making it consistent

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:17.340
within a score and sometimes it was
the matter of a not great edition

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:23.550
or an older edition or
the original edition and,

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.230
but sometimes a real change.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:35.890
I remember in a Moller 9, I
think, must be in the Burlesque,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:41.390
there's an upward scale passage
for almost the entire orchestra,

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.770
but there's also a
retard in that scale.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:52.440
And what Bernstein did was to
alter the rhythmic notation

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.610
so that the retard would happen
pretty much automatically from,

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:07.430
let's say, 16th equal 16th notes
to, let's say, a triplet of 16ths

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:12.090
with the last one tied
to an 8th note,

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:16.940
and then the orchestra would
play it absolutely accurately

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.470
and then it would be
that automatic change

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:22.580
of tempo that he was looking for.

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.950
And that's something
that you can do in music.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:31.930 position:56%
You don't want to tell everybody in
the audience that you're doing that.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.710
[laughter] But I mean
Moller did it to Beethoven.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But how
would he make those decisions?

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.860
Did they evolve over time?

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.790
Would he play something,
conduct something one way once

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.880
and then decide that
worked or that didn't work?

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.980
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: He was
constantly rethinking every piece

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.290
that he conducted.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:53.460
And I remember at the
last concert at Tanglewood

00:42:53.460 --> 00:43:00.640
when he was doing Beethoven 7 he --
I'd never seen a conductor do this

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.840
and I've seen it now over
and over -- talking to the --

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.670
as he was rehearsing talking
to the orchestra over the music

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.270
and telling them things and
praising them when they did well.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.640
But, for instance, in
the second movement

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:20.480
of the Beethoven 7 the winds come
in at one point on a 7th chord,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:25.370
it's not -- it's there's
a long phrase, but the --

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.900
and there are no woodwinds and
then the winds come in on a chord

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:35.800
that is going to resolve eventually
at the end of this phrase,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.600
that was very new, nobody
did it before Beethoven.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.250
And Lenny was talking ...

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.550
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Before Beethoven?

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Before Beethoven.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.150
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Okay.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.450
Okay.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.980
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: And so Lenny
was talking to the Boston Symphony

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:54.500
about this particular chord
and that Brahms used it,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.960
borrowed that from
Beethoven, and you hear it

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.440
in the Brahms symphonies, you
don't hear it in Mozart or Haydn,

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:07.990
the winds don't come in on a chord
that is just going to hang there.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:11.740
And so what it does
in the Beethoven --

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.710
all this was explained while he was
conducting, during the rehearsal --

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:20.180
what it does in the Beethoven
is it adds to the phrase,

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:25.160
but the winds have to shape
that second half of that phrase

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.760
in such a way that it's going
to help the phrase resolve.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.060
It's very beautiful.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.330
So what he got them to do, and I
don't remember if he marked this

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:39.210
in his score, but at least
he told them, was they enter,

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:45.150
the winds enter in the 7th chord,
they expand the sound a little bit

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:49.850
and then they taper off
because then the chord resolves

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:57.390
and everybody plays in a downward
scale to the end of the phrase.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:02.990
And that's the sort of thing that
a conductor, I mean you really have

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.100
to study a score and get
the composer in the context

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.870
of where he was in his career and.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:13.380
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Would he be
reading biographies of the --

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.250
I mean where would he get some
of the musicological background?

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.040
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, it was
mostly just from reading scores.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.140
He could -- his knowledge,
his perception

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.600
in reading a score was phenomenal.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.250
He did read a number -- I mean
he was always reading books.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.200
There were three bookbags
that went on every trip.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.470
There was an interesting biography
of Robert Schumann that came out,

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.970
really a psycho-sexual
biography of Schumann

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.430
by a guy named Peter Ostwald.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:50.650
And authors would give
galleys to Bernstein,

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.130
so he would get these in advance.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.960
And he expected me to read them,
too, because I mean, you know,

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.040
you're going to sit in an airport
changing planes and you're there

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.750
for two hours with
nothing to do, well,

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:06.750
you're going to have a
conversation with Leonard Bernstein

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.610
about Robert Schumann's
sexual problems

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:13.770
because that's what he
wanted to talk about.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.220
[laughter] So I had
to read the book, too.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.090
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did Lenny
listen to other conductors?

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.750
Would he get recordings
or go to concerts

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.720
and would he ever be
influenced by what they did?

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.750
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Not as
much as people would think.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:37.030
He usually, when offered,
he would agree to go.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:41.500
Oh, there were some bad moments.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:49.230
Sinopoli was doing Moller, a Moller
Cycle also for Deutsche Grammophon.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:52.840
And we were in Rome one time and
Sinopoli was doing the Moller No.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.830
2 and with the academia of
santachachilia [Assumed Spelling]

00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:00.010
and they gave, they
said to Bernstein, well,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.420
you have to come hear
this guy, he's fantastic.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.140
And we'd never heard of him.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.030
And I didn't want to go.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:14.300
I was working on the orchestra
material for the Beethoven 3rd,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.790
which was being done
the following week,

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:21.310
Bernstein with the same orchestra.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:27.770
And so Bernstein went to
this concert and his seat was

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:33.870
in the middle of a row and he
realized within a minute-and-a-half

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.730 position:56%
that the performance was a disaster,

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.490
that Sinopoli didn't know
how to conduct Moller.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:44.910 position:56%
And he wasn't any more specific than
that, but Bernstein said he looked

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.740
around and he realized he couldn't
get up and leave, it would be --

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.970
and there's no intermission
in that piece.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:52.480
So he was stuck.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.140
And he came back to the
hotel and I was still up.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.470
We were in a suite where there
were bedrooms at opposite ends

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:04.690
of the suite, and I didn't
always share a suite,

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.700
I usually had a very separate room.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:11.280
And he saw that the light was on
and I was sitting at a little desk,

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:18.380
marking up the Beethoven 3rd
Symphony parts, and he was furious,

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.730
he was absolutely furious.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.170
He said he wasted an entire
evening and he never wanted

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:27.080
to hear anything more
about this conductor.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.870
But usually, I mean if he went to
something he was kind of grateful.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.290
He'd go back stage.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.310
What's his name?

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:46.980
Wonderful British conductor, ah, he
always had a cane, younger guy --

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:51.160
Davis, no, I can't
remember his name.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:49:01.160
Bernstein would go back stage and,
you know, be worshipful usually,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.030
but not with someone like Sinopoli.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.760
I can say Sinopoli because he died

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.840
and his Moller symphonies
didn't sell very well.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.640
[laughter]

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: This
may be a naive question,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.970
but I've been involved in theater

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:22.180
where a director will have the
actors experiment with things,

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.250
try things, does a
conductor ever do that?

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:30.260
Let's say, let's see what
happens if you do this or let's --

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:34.390
there's not that kind of
give and take with the ...

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.380
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, that
was Bernstein and especially not

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:41.020
in the last, the last eight years
that I knew him of his life.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.640
He really knew what he wanted.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.900
He may have done that when
he was at the Philharmonic.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.080
There were some experimental
programs.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.500
In fact, Jack Gottlieb and would
talk about that occasionally

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.740
because Jack was Bernstein's
assistant during some

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.400
of those Philharmonic years.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:03.760
And Bernstein did tell
me that at one concert

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:11.580
with the Philharmonic it was
all very new experimental stuff

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.210
and there was no applause

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:18.180
and he didn't know how
to get off the stage.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:22.490
[laughter] And so he finally just
put his baton down and slunk off.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:26.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: How much
did he try and find new works?

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.860
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well,
he didn't have to do much

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.780
because there were upwards

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.660
of two dozen scores arriving
every week at his apartment.

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.960
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Would he
read through them, though?

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, that was part
of my job was to sift through them

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:46.960
and if I felt something was
worthy to put it on his desk.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.600
And I'd say every year
maybe three works.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.660
Sometimes it was it was a famous
name and I felt obligated.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.640
He did ask, though, for instance

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:03.850
when Peter Maxwell Davies wrote
his 8th symphony he said he wanted

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.150
to look at it.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.260
Oh, I know, we had
the Fires of London

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:12.040
that was Max Davies
group came to New York.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.550
Bernstein had never heard
the Fires of London.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.230
He knew what they were.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:18.120
And I got a pair of tickets.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:23.650 position:56%
I had met Max Davies a number of
years before, he was doing a US tour

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:29.010
with Corolla Nair [Assumed
Spelling] and a couple other works.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:34.780
And, oh, I met Max Davies
because when I lived

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.800
in Boston I shared an apartment

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.720
and my roommate had
been a pupil of Davies.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.300
So we went to this.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.560
I got this -- I got tickets.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.880 position:56%
There was also, there was a premiere
by Elliott Carter that night.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:55.110
And so Bernstein met Davies
and he was very impressed,

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:59.020
I mean he thought, yeah,
this guy is the real thing.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:06.610
Although at the party afterwards
off in a corner I saw Bernstein,

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.210
Ned Rom [Assumed Spelling], Elliott
Carter and Max Davies talking

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.730
to one another and they
didn't look very happy.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.470
And I thought I would
go over there and see

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.370
if anybody needed a
refresher for their drinks.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:26.230
And what they were discussing was
how they had lost their looks.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:31.030 position:56%
[laughter] And I thought, you know,
this incredible congruence of talent

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:36.400 position:56%
of 20th Century musicians and
that's what they were talking about.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.430
But, so I got some scores
of Davies from Boosie

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:41.810
and Hawks [Assumed Spelling],

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.730
but Bernstein never
conducted any of them.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was it awkward
for him, friends who were composers,

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:51.880
like David Diamond, that they would
want him to look at their works

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.490
or conduct them and he
would have to say no?

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:59.270
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, it was
-- it depended on who it was.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:04.430
One of the albums that Bernstein
did with the New York Philharmonic

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:06.170
that I helped out on, but it was

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:11.440 position:56%
after I had stopped being his
Assistant, was a David Dell tratagie

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.050
and adrorum [Assumed
Spelling] album.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:18.740
And Ned's piece was for violin
and orchestra and it's a suite,

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.030
I can't remember what the title is.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:28.740
And Bernstein decided to
reorder the suite, and Ned didn't

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.110
like that he did that, but what
are you going to do, you know,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.960
it's a recording by the
New York Philharmonic.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.200
It's going to help
publicize the suite.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.070
And I think eventually --
well, they stayed friends,

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.400
I mean they weren't going to
break up, it wasn't going to break

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.640
up their friendship, but I think
eventually Bernstein came around

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.210
and said, yeah, you were right,
the original order was better.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:54.690
And he did a terrific recording
of the David Dell trategie piece.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.870
I think it could have been done --

00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:05.100
no, it was a piece that wasn't
connected to the Alice books.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:13.510
But also they would -- all these
composers that he'd known --

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:15.800
I mean he'd known Rorum
[Assumed Spelling]

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.990
since the, I think the 1940s.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:24.580
David, I can't remember when they
would have met, and David Diamond

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.380
of course they knew one
another all their lives.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.500
So he was always in touch with them

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.820
and they would always send
their scores or a recording,

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.820
or a recording and a score.

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.040
I remember when the first of the
Halles' [Assumed Spelling] pieces

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.950
of deltratachie [Assumed
Spelling] arrived,

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:45.140
and that afternoon
Lenny put on the album

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.870
and followed through the score.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.660
And I wasn't -- this
was up in Connecticut,

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.040
I was doing something else.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.710 position:56%
And later that evening Bernstein
said, well, you really should listen

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:03.250 position:56%
to this thing and look at the score,
you know, you'll learn something.

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:05.650
I couldn't really get into.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.930
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was he ever
concerned that other people's music

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.370 position:56%
that he was conducting and listening

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:16.970
to might inadvertently influence
his own writing or that never ...

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.390
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, there
was this other problem he had,

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:26.000
when he conducted Moller of,
for instance, it was very hard

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.370
to get the Moller out
of his head and get back

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:34.960
to what he considered Bernstein.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:41.150
But I don't think the
influence, I think his --

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:46.420
somehow how he had learned music
composition was so accurate

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:55.270
in some way of pinpointing
what was his personality.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.270
I think this was something
he learned from Copland

00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.220
and Copland learned it from
Nadia Bulange [Assumed Spelling],

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:05.820
that Copland had said that when
he first went to Bulange --

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:09.700
I can't remember the piece he
had, he'd written something,

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:15.700 position:56%
and she'd say, well, these two bars
that's you, so we need more of that.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:21.010
And there would be 40 other pages
that were, you know, she'd say, no,

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.210
that doesn't mean anything.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:29.280
And there is some correspondence
between Copland and Bernstein

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.080
because everything
that Bernstein wrote

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.760
after he met Copland he
would share with Copland

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.690 position:56%
and Copland would do the same thing.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:44.550
I think, what was the piece, maybe
Jeremiah went through that process,

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:51.690 position:56%
I think there is some correspondence
here that helps illustrate that.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:56.440 position:56%
And Copland did the same thing,
he'd say, well, this section is you,

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.900
but all this other stuff
that's somebody else.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:05.650
And that, when you have a good
instructor or a good mentor

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:11.670 position:56%
when you're young enough that really
does focus your compositional skill.

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.830
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: When he was
working on A Quiet Place how much

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:22.000
of it was setting, text and did
that, you know, was he concerned

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:31.440 position:56%
about the natural flow of
language, the rhythm and the pitches

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.490
of language or they were separate?

00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:38.210
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, the
language, he and Stephen had this,

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:46.670
I don't want to say agenda
but they definitely wanted

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:50.810
to do an American opera
in the vernacular,

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.800
the way people actually speak.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.550
So there are all kinds
of interruptions

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:05.550
and people interrupting one another
and people interrupting themselves.

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.790
And there was a big
discussion one week

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:17.350
about whether they could use the
F word in an opera and, in fact,

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.580
it is, there's the F word
appears in A Quiet Place.

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:28.090
So there is that aspect, there
was the conscious setting

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:31.300
of an American vernacular.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:41.330
Musically, I didn't
know it at the time,

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:47.740 position:56%
but Bernstein constantly recycled
music that he had written for pieces

00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:53.510
that either never took off or were
abandoned in some way or other.

00:58:53.510 --> 00:59:00.690
So in A Quiet Place I think there
are segments that had been written

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:05.010
for a musical version of the
Nabokov Bocalita [Assumed Spelling]

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.900
that he was going to
write with Edward Albee.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:14.710
I think most of A Quiet Place,
though, is newly composed.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:20.840
Harmonically it's based on the
harmonic language of Trouble

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:26.180
in Tahiti with a little
bit more abstraction.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:31.270
And one evening he finished
one of the interludes,

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:32.590
this was up in Connecticut,

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:36.270
there are these interludes
between the acts.

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:39.510
And he couldn't -- he wanted
to play it at the piano,

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.530
but he needed two extra hands.

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:45.670
And I was up, I was reading, it
was around three in the morning.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:50.040
And so he asked me to sit at the
piano with him and play this thing,

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.550
and he explained to me as we --

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:54.730
I mean I sat there and
I did what I could.

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:58.250
We got better, we played
it about 10 times,

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.930
I mean I got better,
he played perfectly.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:07.740
But he explained to me how
out of the harmonic language

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.900 position:56%
that he was using for A Quiet Place,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:15.300
and there was a different harmonic
language for certain other pieces.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:21.190
Dybbuk is a great example of
a harmonic structure that out

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.810
of which the entire piece comes.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:30.180
There are these scales and
chord combinations that are --

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:36.640
it's not like serialism
because it's more --

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:42.460
there's more emotion
involved in that and more

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.820
about what can be caught
by the listener.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.580
I think serialism is not
so much about listening,

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.940
but it's just how it
looks on the page.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:59.470
But with A Quiet Place
he was explaining how

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:04.900
out of the harmony he derives the
melodic contours that he wants.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.670
And, of course, it's based on the
emphasis of speech and rhythms

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:14.390
and the rhythms had to be exactly
what a vernacular rhythm would be.

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:20.110
And it was quite an instruction.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.920
And so that's really
what A Quiet Place does,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.680
it puts the vernacular into it.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was there
a tension with him of wanting

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:29.120
to do something musically
and at the same time wanting

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.830
to do the vernacular and they
would never be in conflict or?

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:34.130
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I think for him

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:40.490
that was the way he always
had wanted to compose,

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:47.310
and I think his first stab at that
was probably Trouble in Tahiti.

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:52.740
But actually I think a really good
example of that is Wonderful Town.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.600
I think Wonderful Town
is very vernacular,

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:03.010
even though it's got some --
what's -- a song like A Quiet Girl,

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:08.860
which was actually written
for [inaudible] for Jamie.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:15.250
It's very singerly, but
still it works as a kind

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:19.500
of vernacular number
and it's never stilted.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.980
In everything, the emphasis --

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.850
well, there is something that
Sondheim talks about when somewhere

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:31.540
from West Side Story has always
been known as the Ah Song.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.140
[laughter] But, for
me, the syllable, ah,

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:41.060
leads to something else,
a place, but it is ...

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Is that
something Lenny ever talked about?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.080
Did he, was he self-conscious
about that at all, or?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.360
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, I actually
never talked to him about --

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.750
I didn't talk, I had never even
seen West Side Story when I worked

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:58.070
for him, I had never seen the film.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.720 position:56%
My mother wouldn't let me go see it.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.920
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: You've
heard the score?

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I'd
heard two numbers from it

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:10.400
because when I was a teenager
I bought an album that said,

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.370
Highlights of Broadway from
whatever year, in the 50s.

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:21.260
And so the Jet song and
America were on this album.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.380
It was one of those
composite albums with cuts

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.190
from various original cast albums.

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:32.570
And I loved the Jet song because it
didn't sound like show music to me,

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.990
it sounded completely other.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:39.650
And talk about vernacular, I mean
that's wonderfully vernacular.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.510
But I didn't know the show at all,

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:46.280
and the first time I saw it I
sat next to Bernstein at the --

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.660
you know, I was his Assistant,
I had to sit next to him --

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:56.940
at a London revival in
'84 I think, maybe '85.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.260
It was a wonderful production.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.510
Tommy Abbott, who had been Geetar
in the original, was the --

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:06.390
who had recreated the choreography.

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:10.610
And Bernstein, as he always did,

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:13.580
talked all the way
through the performance.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.830
I didn't take notes, but
I remember what he said.

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.880
It was like a private master
class, and it just happened

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:25.330
to be his biggest, you
know, his splashiest piece.

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:28.180
It was an unforgettable evening.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:32.440
Mostly he would say
things like, I mean he --

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:39.430
when the conductor would speed
up too much he'd put his hand,

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:42.760
Bernstein would put his hand
like he was putting the brake

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.590
on or something like that.

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:48.470
And he told the conductor
afterwards to trust the music more.

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.770
[laughter]

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: What about working

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.760
with a choreographer
in terms of the music?

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.880
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, I don't,
you know, in the years I worked

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:02.770
for him there wasn't
any choreography.

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.940
I don't think that there was any.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:10.830
And I didn't know anything
about ballet or dance at all,

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:15.050
and he was horrified that I'd
never really been to a ballet.

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:19.880
I think I saw one ballet
when I lived in Naples.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.520
Ballet has never really
interested me that much.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.940
Well, for one thing the music
tends to be pretty silly, you know.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.930
You go to Don Quixote, the Pettipop
[Assumed Spelling] production

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:34.880
of this music by Mincus [Assumed
Spelling] really is ridiculous.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.280
So what Bernstein started doing
when I would have a free night

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:46.680
and he knew that something, that
there would be a Robbins' revival

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.820
at City Ballet he would call up

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:54.010
and get me a ticket
and insist that I go.

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:58.540 position:56%
And then after the performance I had
to go back to the Dakota and talk

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.070
to Bernstein about what I saw.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.410
You know, how did it
work with the music?

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:07.520
Because when there was an
interesting revival Bernstein,

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.040
himself, would often go, especially
if Robbins was touching up,

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.270
you know, making sure that the
dancers really were following

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:19.570
his instructions.

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:24.890
And he said that for Stars and
Stripes Robbins invited him up on

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:26.760
to the catwalk above the stage,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.060
and so they watched the
performance from up in the catwalk.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:34.970
And he said that's a complete,
it's a dazzling way to look

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:39.190
at how a choreographer thinks
about placement on the stage.

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:46.620
He said you just can't believe how
it changes how you look at dance.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:50.480
I said, well, you know, lucky
for you, that's terrific.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.860
[laughter] So the first
thing I got to see

01:06:52.860 --> 01:07:00.380
of Robbins was the Debussy
Prelude to an Afternoon,

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.660
it takes place in a dance studio.

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.200
I just didn't know
what to make of it.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.270
So I went back to the Dakota and
I said, well, here's what I liked,

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.080
because I had learned long ago

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.570
when giving a criticism
you say three good things

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:21.770
and then you can say whatever you
want about what you didn't like,

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:23.530
but you have to start
with three good things.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:24.830
And I don't remember ...

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:26.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: With
Lenny or just in general?

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:28.060
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: In general,
I would never give criticism

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.480
without saying three good
things, and if I couldn't think

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.800
of three things I'd say, well,
I just can't say anything.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.460
[laughter] And so we
talked for about an hour

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.880
about this particular
ballet of Robbins.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.280
And Bernstein knew it
backwards and forwards

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.980
and he understood exactly
what Robbins was trying to do

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:54.700
and what all the names were of
all the classical movements.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:59.020
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did he
have a photographic memory?

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: You know, the
visuals for him were kind of strange

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:09.390
because he didn't know
anything about painting.

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:14.850
When we were in Madrid one time
and we had a twelve o'clock flight

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:21.500
to Barcelona he got up early the
day we were leaving and he said --

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.090
we were at the Ritz, which is
right, the back garden goes right

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:28.110
to the Prado, and he said
do we have time to go

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:30.230
over to the Prado before
we get into the car?

01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:34.130
And I said, yeah, we can go,
but I said I'm going to take you

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:38.360
to just, to one painting.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.260
And the Las Meninas, the
Handmaidens of Velasquez,

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.280 position:56%
was in a separate room at that time.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.430
I think it had just been cleaned.

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:51.660
So I took him in there, and he
didn't know what he was looking at.

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:55.660
And I explained, I'd read all
kinds of essays about this painting

01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:00.870
and I explained who everybody was
and how the painting was organized

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.910
and colors and structure and light.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:11.620
And he was really fascinated, but
he'd never, he never even thought

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:14.240
about that in terms of
looking at a painting.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.300
So it was odd, it was odd.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.980
But he loved dance.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:21.580
I don't know what the
big draw was, though.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.550
He loved talking to
Robbins about choreography.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.360
But, yeah, while I was working

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.040
for him there wasn't anything
that was choreographed.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: When he was both
composing and conducting did he work

01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:37.920 position:56%
at a piano or to what degree did he?

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.430
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Conducting was only at a desk.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:45.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So he wouldn't
go and see if there was an ...

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.200
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
No, very, very rarely.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:53.010
No, and he really didn't have
to rely on a piano for that.

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:59.990 position:56%
For composing it was a mix, it was a
-- Fairfield was the perfect setup,

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:04.390
his house in Connecticut,
where he had the grand piano,

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:06.680
a big flat desk.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.820
I mean, you know, you could put --
well, the paper was pretty much 11

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.700
by 17, but you could put
four pieces of paper.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.460
And then a stand-up desk, like
-- something like what Jefferson,

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:27.500 position:56%
Thomas Jefferson had, with an angle,
very long, six or eight feet long,

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.880
so you could put page after
page next to one another.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.100
And I was thinking of that
yesterday when I was looking

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.900
at manuscripts here, it's
very easy to tell for me

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:44.060
when something was written at the
piano, there's a kind of shakiness.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.160
It looks more like an older guy's
script, but it isn't necessarily

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.180
that he was older, he was just
writing like this at the piano.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:11:02.060 position:56%
And then go to the flat desk to make
the fair copy, rewrite it completely

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:05.120
from start to finish, but
that was only when he was sure

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.460
that he had a segment
that was a real entity.

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.780
And the stand-up desk
was for the corrections

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.150
or making yet another copy.

01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:23.000
Sometimes there would be two
fair copies of the same piece.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.170
There would be an insert and then
he would want to put that in.

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:27.470
Although when I was looking

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.480
at Dybbuk yesterday there
were an awful lot of inserts

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.070
that simply got, it's the next
page, and you have to know to go

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.370
to that page and then come back.

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:46.810
And then some of the paper that
he was using was this fold --

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:53.680
what do you call that when it's
two pages that are folded together,

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.740
not a fold -- well, maybe
it is called a folio.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:02.540
And then one of those folded
pages would become the folder

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.990
for that number.

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:10.020
And every piece he wrote
is in discrete numbers,

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.930
and then on the front of the folder
you put whatever the title is

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.370
or if it doesn't have
a title it's just

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:19.030
where it goes in the larger work.

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:22.600
And everything for that
number goes into that folder,

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:29.370
any little envelope on which
he's written thoughts or a change

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:32.480
in lyrics or something like
that it goes into that folder.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.020
And so all of his works
were organized in that way.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.290
But that's all done piano and desk.

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:42.500
Conducting was completely,
completely other.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.800
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: The collection,
as you know, is so huge.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:55.720 position:56%
How much of it was saved because of
his own sense of posterity or was it

01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.010
because of Helen Coates, was
it a combination, was it --

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:04.710
you know, and not -- the music
manuscripts sort of, of course,

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:08.270
but the fact that they saved
all the fan mail or ...

01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:10.520
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: You
know, I never talked to him

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.310
about the posterity aspect.

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:20.970
Helen probably felt that
weight of posterity.

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:24.510
I think she must have
recognized even

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:29.350
from the very first piano
lesson that he had with her

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:35.790
that this was a talent that
would actually go somewhere.

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:41.810
And, yeah, she certainly saved
every, every piece of fan mail.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:47.220
I had the feeling that
Bernstein saved his manuscripts

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:52.140
so that he could refer
to them later.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.220
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did
he do that that you saw?

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, there were,

01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.100
especially with A Quiet Place
there were previous manuscripts

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.120
that he would want to look at,

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.850
and then there would be
little individual numbers.

01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:09.390
Ah, there was a number about --

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:13.440
he wrote, I wouldn't call
it a cabaret song but a kind

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.540
of a throwaway song called,
I Wish I Had Never Gone

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.860
to That Party, and
I couldn't find it.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.160
He asked me what happened

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.540
to this song he had written,
and I never found it.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:32.820
It actually may be here, but I --
that's beyond what I can look at.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:39.400
But he liked to have these things
kept track of because rather

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.360
than write them out from
memory again it was just useful

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.600
to have as a reference.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But
there was an ego there?

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:52.110
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah,
but we never talked

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.570
about the posterity aspect.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:56.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Somebody once said

01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:58.790
to me he suffered from
importantitis.

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:01.230
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, it's true

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:07.240
that everything he uttered he felt
was going to be earthshattering,

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.400
of great importance, and that
people should pay attention

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.560
to what he was -- but then he
thought consciously before he would

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.240
say things, although he never
went on to Cavett or any

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.050
of those talk shows because he
was afraid he would put his foot

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:29.250
in his mouth, say something that
he -- well, would be misunderstood,

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:32.180
not that he hadn't intended but
that would be misunderstood.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.900
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And he
actually verbalized that to you,

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.200
that that's why he didn't do that?

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.860
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes,
that's why he didn't do it.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.070
He never went on a talk show,

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:45.300
plus his language was a
little colorful and, you know,

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.000
it just would have been bleeped out

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.160
and that would have
been embarrassing.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:53.880
I mean back then there, you know,

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.340
a series of leaps people would
have turned off their TV.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But it's
an interesting self-awareness

01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.940
to have that.

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.560
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: He
also, I mean he didn't --

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.480
he liked to be carefully prepared,

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.700
everything he did was
actually carefully --

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:14.330
he was a student all of his
life, he really studied scores

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:17.590
that he was going to conduct,
when he had to give a speech,

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:19.620
went through seven drafts.

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:24.580
The Young People's
Concerts, an enormous amount

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.300
of preparation for each script.

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.360
It was all about being prepared.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.660
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: As he got old,

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:36.580
or you talked about even the very
first time you met him he sort

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:44.330
of seemed, from what I can tell, to
become somewhat dissolute and did

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:49.280
that not influence the other,
was he able to compartmentalize?

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:56.310
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, there
was definitely that ability

01:16:56.310 --> 01:17:03.280
to shift gears, it was pretty
remarkable how he was able

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.580
to do that.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:08.970
Dissolute, yeah, there is
definitely some dissolution.

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:19.620
Sometimes a self-indulgence that
veered into being out of control.

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.070
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was there
self-awareness about that?

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.510
Was there embarrassment?

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:27.460
Would he try and then
rein himself in, or?

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:30.510
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I don't think
he understood what was necessary.

01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:33.950
For instance, at the end of
the first year that I worked

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:37.170
for him he wasn't sleeping.

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:41.430
He'd taken a lot of -- well,
for me, it looked like a lot

01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:44.160
of Dexedrine over that year.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.830
And it was something older
guys did in the 70s and 80s,

01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:53.970
they took Dexedrine for energy.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:59.840
I don't think -- well, I don't
know if anybody does that now,

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.880
but it definitely keeps you awake.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.140
And he wasn't getting any sleep.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:11.950
So Harry Kraut looked into
a sleep disorder clinic.

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:19.240
And over one particular weekend
in November of '82 Bernstein went

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.100
to the Montefiore Sleep-Wake
Disorder Clinic

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:29.970
and it was discovered he had what
is actually a pretty normal sleep

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:34.240
pattern of seven hours
and then 17 hours awake.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:40.870 position:56%
But he never learned about preparing
for the seven hours of sleep.

01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:46.560
I mean, you know, a couple
drinks before dinner, a big --

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.830
well, not necessarily a rich meal,
but a fairly big meal at the end

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:54.920
of the day, a chocolate bar
just before going to bed.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.250
He didn't drink after
dinner, particularly,

01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:00.740
and he didn't drink
much with dinner.

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:05.640 position:56%
And then, you know, a midnight
phone call from his sister, Shirley.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.000
Whenever he was on the phone
he had to smoke a cigarette,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.620
so he'd have three or four
cigarettes while on the phone

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.040
with Shirley discussing
crossword puzzles.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.430
Then his brain would be going, you
know, a million miles a minute,

01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:20.070
finishing the crossword puzzle
in the Guardian and being hyped

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:23.400
up from having smoked
a few cigarettes.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.370
And it would be two in the morning,
and then he would say, well,

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:30.550
you know, I'm not tired, so I'm
going to stay up and I'm going

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.950
to work on this piece of music.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:36.550
And on some pieces he
wrote the time of day,

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:42.840
if he got to a double bar line
he'd write the time of day.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.100
I think Puccini did this, also.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:53.130 position:56%
And it's often three or four a.m.
[laughter] Well, and then go to bed.

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:56.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But, why, what was
the importance of marking the time?

01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.030
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Oh, it was
just keeping track, I think.

01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:03.500
Although, for me, a piece he gave
me called, One Minute for Charlie,

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:08.560
I think it's 3:10 a.m. at
the double bar at the end.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.900
I think it was to show, see,

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:16.390
I stayed up all night
writing this for you.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:23.070 position:56%
[laughter] But, and then -- and
then realized that it was, you know,

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:28.520 position:56%
it was late and if he had a
commitment the next day he was going

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.900
to have to get up at some point.

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.700
So how was he going to fall asleep?

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.630
Well, you take a sleeping pill,

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:38.790 position:56%
but if you take it 15 minutes before
you go to bed it doesn't take affect

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:41.760
for an hour so he's up for an hour.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.880 position:56%
And then, you know, ends up
sleeping until two in the afternoon.

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.180
It was just, it was really ...

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.760
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Would he
miss appointments sometimes?

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.200
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
No, but there was --

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.490
the first time I was at
Tanglewood with him we --

01:20:55.490 --> 01:21:00.800
he would tell me, I would
wake him up let's say at eight

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.200
in the morning, and
he'd say, oh, you know,

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.990
cross-out the 10 a.m. I said,

01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:13.270
I'll make the one o'clock
conducting class, but that thing

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:15.730
at 10 a.m. just cross it out.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:18.120
So I'd call Richard Ortner
[Assumed Spelling] and say, well,

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.330 position:56%
we're not going to be there at 10
o'clock or whatever the heck it was,

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:27.250
but we'll be at Saranac [Assumed
Spelling] at one in the afternoon.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.060
And he regretted doing that.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:35.820
It got worse as the years
went on, but it was just --

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.690
he never really put it
all together in terms

01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:43.330
of how you prepare to go to sleep.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.590
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did you
ever try and explain any

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:46.950
of these things to him, or?

01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.640
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: No, because I
wasn't the medical professional

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.020
and he needed to talk to
someone who was a professional.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.640
So the doctor at the
Sleep-Wake Clinic got him

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.950
to adjust to this schedule.

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.900
It was mayhem for several weeks

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:14.170
because we were moving his
schedule I think two hours a day,

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:18.770
so that it would eventually be that
he would go to sleep at something

01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:26.470 position:56%
like one in the morning, but then
be up by eight o'clock the next day.

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:34.200
But to get to that meant that
we were moving the schedule,

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.290
and he was -- well, of
course, it was all about him,

01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:42.420
so he loved that he was doing
this and we were all, you know,

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.810
his whole household staff
was involved in this.

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:48.060
It would be nine o'clock at
night, he would be getting

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.950
up because we were moving
the schedule for him,

01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:55.670
and he'd come downstairs and
say to Julio [Assumed Spelling],

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:59.430
the housekeeper, I'm ready
for a bowl of oatmeal.

01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:03.290 position:56%
And she'd say, of course, Senor, and
make him a bowl of oatmeal at nine,

01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:06.250
whereas, we had just
finished dinner.

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:13.670
[laughter] And so the goal was that
by Thanksgiving, November of '82,

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:15.510
he would be on a normal schedule.

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:20.820
And it worked, it worked, it
worked for about two months

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:24.090
and then he just didn't
pay any attention to it,

01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:27.150
he went back to his old habits.

01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:30.360
Oh, and he also had to keep
track, just like with smokers,

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.770
he had to keep track of how he
felt across the course of the day,

01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:44.630
whether he felt like he needed a
nap, you know, was he indulging

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:48.250
in sugar or alcohol
or anything like that.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:49.560
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: This
was for his doctor?

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.050
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, for
the sleep disorder doctor,

01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:55.210
not for his normal doctor.

01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:58.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: To
what degree did he --

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.670
I mean faith seems to have been
such an important part of his work

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.720
and all that, but did
he go to show regularly,

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:14.470
did he do religious things or
that was just an internal thing?

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:18.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: There were -- one
of the first things he told me was

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:24.960
that on Friday, Friday evening
he would call his mother

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.600
and it didn't matter where we
were or what was going on he had

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.140
to call his mother every Friday.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:36.060
And that, that to me
that meant something.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:42.030
But, no, one Yom Kippur we were
in London and so he was invited

01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:46.390
to the Marble Arch
Synagogue and he went.

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:49.970
I was really grateful because
then I had a free night.

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:54.010
And the next night we went to that
performance of West Side Story,

01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:59.640
so I was recovered enough so that
I could actually pay attention.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:07.000 position:56%
I never went with him to any temple,
but I also remember that in Herona,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.020
Spain there are these,
there was a couple --

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.940
ah, I don't remember their names --

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:23.660 position:56%
they were researching the very
ancient Jewish presence in Catalonia

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:29.800
and they had found the
remnants of a synagogue.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.910
And Bernstein went to visit
them and got very emotional

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:37.560
about the Jewish connection
in that part of Spain.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.650
And there are photos
somewhere of him praying

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:44.810
in this kind of subterranean
chamber.

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:47.620
I wasn't with him on that trip.

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.150
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did
he believe in God?

01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:50.940
Did he believe in an afterlife?

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.520
Did he ...

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.820
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I
don't think he did,

01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:59.280
but that would be conjecture
on my part.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.250
Strangely enough, I think the place

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:06.080
where he was least
religious was Israel.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.670
He kind of chafed.

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:15.760
One time we were flying, we were
taking the Israel Philharmonic

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.620
to the May Festival in Florence,
Italy and in order to get

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.530
to Florence for a Saturday
evening performance we had

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:30.000
to leave Israel sometime on
Friday, but it wasn't clear

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.930 position:56%
that we could all get to the hotels
in Florence before sunset on Friday.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:40.130
So the members of the
Israel Philharmonic came

01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:44.780
up to Lenny individually and said,
it's not me, it's everybody else

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:50.530
in the orchestra who won't
fly on Friday after sunset.

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:54.930
And after about the tenth person
confessing this Lenny said, oh,

01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:58.280
you know, we'll get a dispensation.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.270
And, in fact, the orchestra
did get a special dispensation

01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:04.670
from the Grand Rabbi of Rome.

01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:08.720
He wasn't interested in the
religious rules that were going

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.150
to interfere with getting a
performance done, you know,

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:15.740
a trip followed by a performance.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:21.630
That was -- I thought that
was a pretty amusing dilemma.

01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:24.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did he fear death?

01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:26.280
Would he talk about that?

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:31.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: There was one
phase that started appearing I think

01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:36.210
in the third year I
was working for him,

01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:41.520
was the Maestro said just before
he died, you know, he would --

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.790
he'd be telling me to do something
and then he'd stick in a joke.

01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:50.840
I mean there were constant
jokes, so that everything was --

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.600
if I didn't have a new joke
every day then he wasn't going

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.220
to pay any attention to me.

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: You had
to collect jokes for him?

01:27:57.810 --> 01:28:01.320
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, they're
written in a kind of a shorthand

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.210
in the back of my date books.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:06.700
Anytime I heard a new
joke I wrote it down.

01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:09.230
And then what I learned
to do was to --

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:14.320
whenever he told me a joke I would
retell it immediately and try

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:19.820
to embellish it because you
always had to embellish whatever,

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:29.150
and so that this repertoire
of jokes became just part

01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:31.770
of daily conversation.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:38.810
But, yes, absolutely, there had
to be new jokes all the time.

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:42.130
So, oh, yes, so after
a joke he would say,

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:44.930
and then the Maestro
said just before he died.

01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:48.870
[laughter] And that was
supposed to be funny.

01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:54.940
That was, it was an indication that
he was feeling mortal, I think.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.920
He also began singing,
and this was --

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.150
I remember the first time he sang
this, something that I had learned

01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:09.400
as a little kid -- where will
we be in 100 years from now,

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.280
pushing up the daisies,
pushing up the daisies.

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:21.210
[laughter] Chopin's funeral march,
I mean that's pretty morbid.

01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:23.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Were there
things that he desperately wanted

01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:25.630
to accomplish before
he died that he was,

01:29:25.630 --> 01:29:28.170 position:56%
that you had a sense there was a ...

01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:31.610
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, there was
an opera based on the Holocaust,

01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:34.150
I think that would
have been interesting

01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:35.970
and he really did want to do that.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.270
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Why
didn't it happen?

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:39.090
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
There was collaboration,

01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:41.750
the collaboration never
came together.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:44.570
He really wanted to record Macado.

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:45.870
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Really?

01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:47.340
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, it
would have been wonderful.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:51.340
Deutsche Grammophon didn't
know what it was, basically.

01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:56.870
I used to poke fun at the big wigs
at Deutsche Grammophon, you know,

01:29:56.870 --> 01:30:03.030
yes, for Macado we will have such
[inaudible] soprano for yum yum,

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:04.400
Burket Nielsen [Assumed Spelling].

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:10.190
[laughter] He wanted
to record Othello.

01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:15.500
He wanted to do Don Carlos

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.490
at the Escarole [Assumed
Spelling] filmed by Zeffirelli.

01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:22.160
That was a -- that would have
been a very exciting project.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.200
And just never came together.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.790
And Zeffirelli got
very excited about it.

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:29.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: How much power
did Deutsche Grammophon have

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.420
or how much did he have with them?

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:35.640
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: That's a good
-- that was a Harry Kraut question.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.330
I don't know, I don't know.

01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:43.610
They seemed to dictate the
repertoire that they wanted.

01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:53.550
I mean they had actually scheduled
Elijah of Mendelsohn for 1991

01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:57.930
and it didn't happen,
obviously, but Elijah.

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:02.540
I mean, gosh, there's
so much else to record.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.700
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Could he say no?

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.360
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: I
don't think he ever did.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:10.260
I'm not aware that he ever said no.

01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.840
I was after him, the
Vienna Philharmonic wanted

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.190
to do Histroda Sidot [Assumed
Spelling] and they wanted

01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:22.790
to do a really interesting program,
especially interesting for them,

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:29.300
Histroda Sidot and maybe the Gran
Partita of Mozart [inaudible].

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.740
And, God, there was a third piece,

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.880
maybe Requit denot [Assumed
Spelling], I can't remember.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.310
It was a really interesting program

01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:41.510
and for them very,
very off-the-wall.

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:45.310
I mean the Vienna Philharmonic
just doesn't do Stravinsky.

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:53.150
And he got excited about
that, but it, you know,

01:31:53.150 --> 01:31:56.320
can't get the recording company
behind it it's just not going

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.530
to happen.

01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:04.470
Yeah, the Othello and the Macado
were very important to him.

01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:07.880
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: You just reminded
me, the story you had told me

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:11.150
about the date books, and I don't
know if it's in your memoir,

01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:17.540
so if it's not I'd want to
get it down that you would put

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.170
in the schedules in
advance so he would see ...

01:32:21.170 --> 01:32:22.470
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Right.

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: ...

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:25.070
but then he would write in ...

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:28.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yes, I always put
in every concert with every piece

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:34.550 position:56%
and the time and the hall because he
looked at his date book every day.

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:37.440
In fact, when we -- after
Bloomington, Indiana,

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.790
we got back to New York, and
I decided I would continue

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:46.380
with the job, the first
day in New York he said,

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.900
the first thing you
have to do when you get

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.610
to the apartment every day
is look at my date book.

01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:57.210
Because he would be on the phone
at two in the morning and agree

01:32:57.210 --> 01:33:01.720
to go have dinner with somebody
and he'd write it in his date book,

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.770
everything was very carefully
notated in his date book.

01:33:04.770 --> 01:33:07.260
But then what I would do
once I got a tour schedule

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.780
or let's say we were going to
Vienna for two weeks I would write

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:14.840
in all the concerts, any
press events that I knew

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:18.900
about or anything like that.

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:22.010
And when we did a tour with
the Bavarian Radio Symphony,

01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:30.740
we went to Budapest, Zagreb and
Ljubljana, there were supposed

01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:34.550
to be encores but they
hadn't been settled on.

01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:38.140 position:56%
Eventually he did two numbers from
his Divertimento [Assumed Spelling],

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:42.160
he did the Turkey Trot, the Waltz
and the Turkey Trot as encores.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.960
So at the bottom of each program
I just wrote encore, colon,

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.520
and he decided to write in the most
stultifying pieces he could think

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.060
of, well, the most
ridiculous encores.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:03.460
Something by John Cage, ah, I can't
remember the title, it was a piece

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:07.170 position:56%
of John Cage's I had never heard
of, but you would never do John Cage

01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:12.360
as an encore after the Schumann
2nd Symphony, I mean really,

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.850
and Bartok music for strings,

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:17.290
percussion [inaudible] yeah,
do a piece by John Cage.

01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:21.200
But another encore was
the Meditation from Tales

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.500
of Massoney [Assumed Spelling].

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.800
[laughter]

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.250
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: So he
did this to amuse you?

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.710
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, and
no one else was ever going

01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:29.380
to see what was in his date book.

01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:34.180
The third concert he wrote in
as encore, Ravelle Deafness

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.740
and Chloe Full Ballet
[Assumed Spelling].

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.040
[laughter]

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But so
researchers now looking

01:34:39.450 --> 01:34:42.690
at his date books will think these
are the encores he's performed.

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:45.170
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Exactly,
and I think that's hilarious.

01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:51.060
[laughter] So you'd have to go
to the actual concert program.

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.660
I don't know if the encores ever
got printed in those programs.

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:57.220
But, yeah, I thought that
was actually pretty funny.

01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.790
And I haven't really noticed
those until four years ago

01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:04.680
when I was looking at
those date books again

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:10.380
and I saw those encore
spoofs, as they were.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:15.550
I was pretty amused, but
that was a wonderful tour.

01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:16.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: When he talked

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:20.380
with his mother Friday nights how
long would the conversations last

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.510
and what would they talk about?

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:26.070
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Probably 15 to 30 minutes.

01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:36.930
Well, she would say,
have you stopped smoking?

01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:39.730
[laughter] And I talked to
her a couple times a week.

01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:41.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Really?

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:45.260
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: After I met her
we talked pretty constantly, yeah.

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:49.630
And if we got someplace,
let's say we got to Vienna

01:35:49.630 --> 01:35:53.920
and we hadn't really been in
touch with anybody for a few days,

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.120
sometimes I would call Shirley,
especially if Shirley, his sister,

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.180
would be up in Connecticut,
I would just call her there.

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:07.010
And she was always very grateful
to hear that, but to call Jennie,

01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:10.030
that was special, and
we would talk about --

01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:12.620
I would tell her where we
were and what we were doing.

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:17.080
And she'd say, well, is he
cutting back on the cigarettes?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.060
What can we do to get him
to stop, to stop smoking?

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:24.600
And I'd just have to say, well, I'm
not sure that I can do anything.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.410
And, of course, I would --

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:33.460
I sent postcards and if
we saw something that,

01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.380
or if I saw something
that I thought she would

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.100
like I would send it to her.

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.100
One time in Key West we sent --

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.840
this was Patty Pilloliam's
[Assumed Spelling] idea --

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:48.500 position:56%
we went to a tropical fruit market
and we packed up a box of, you know,

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.930
star fruit and mangoes and papayas
and passion fruit and all kinds

01:36:53.930 --> 01:37:00.400 position:56%
of stuff and grapefruit, and shipped
it by air to Jennie in Boston.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.620
And she loved getting
stuff like that.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.450
I don't think she could
eat all of that.

01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:08.780
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Did Lenny know
you were doing these things?

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:15.400
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: He -- I think he
was a little surprised how much I

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.710
was in touch with his mother.

01:37:17.710 --> 01:37:26.100 position:56%
And if he came into -- at the Dakota
if he came into the office and I was

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.060
on the phone with her
he wouldn't interrupt,

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:33.240
but afterwards he would say, well,
now what were you talking about?

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.580
And I'd say, well, how to
get you to stop smoking.

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:40.330
[laughter] And he didn't
want to hear that.

01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:42.590
And then after I quit
being his Assistant I went

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:47.790
up to Boston periodically, whenever
there was a new CD out I would go

01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:51.930
up to Boston, I'd take Jennie
and her sisters out for lunch,

01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:55.420
give her the CD, organize
what she had.

01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:57.320
And one day she called
me and she said,

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.550
you know that clothes hamper
that's at the foot of my bed?

01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:03.260
I couldn't really remember.

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.500
She said, well, I was
emptying it the other day,

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.520
I decided I should take
everything out of it,

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.110
and you know what I found?

01:38:11.110 --> 01:38:13.150
I found a score of Jeremiah.

01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:14.980
And I said, oh, come on?

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.060
And she said, yeah, it's
always been in there.

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:22.060
[laughter] And she said, I
think you should have this.

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.430
Yeah, okay, that's a good idea.

01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:31.830 position:56%
So I flew up there the next day and,
sure enough, it was the manuscript

01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:36.670
of I guess just of Lamentation
that he had submitted

01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:46.410
to a composition contest and
she had kept it and forgotten

01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:49.480
that she'd put it in the
bottom of her clothes hamper.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: For years.

01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:53.460
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Oh, decades.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.760
[laughter] But I was
so grateful, you know,

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.820
because I had this friendship
with her that she felt she --

01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:05.200
she wasn't embarrassed about it,
in particular, but she knew that at

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.160
that point that it had some value
and that somebody should have it,

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.070
somebody should take it off
her hands and I was the one.

01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:14.830
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: And how often
did Lenny talk to Shirley?

01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:16.130
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Oh,
it was every night.

01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:17.430
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Really?

01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:18.730
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, yeah,

01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:21.850
especially about crossword
puzzles and about other things.

01:39:21.850 --> 01:39:28.230
I mean they would -- also,
Shirley had the roster of jokes,

01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:32.380
the repertoire of jokes, new jokes.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.960
And also about show
business and other things,

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.510
just gossip about show business.

01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:37.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Would he
talk to [inaudible] much, or?

01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:40.530
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Yeah, there
was a lot of conversation

01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:44.000
with BB [Assumed Spelling],
as he's called.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.430
Not as much as with Shirley
because with Shirley it was really

01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:54.530 position:56%
about the crossword puzzles and the
puzzles in Harper's and The Atlantic

01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:57.750
and also just plain gossip.

01:39:57.750 --> 01:40:04.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: The focus on games
and jokes, he didn't think of them

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.640
as time away from more
important things, or?

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.530
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
No, they almost are

01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:15.560
like jumpstarting the
imagination sometimes.

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:21.620
But also the joke telling had a
kind of rabbinical quality to it

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:26.670 position:56%
because if he told a joke,
especially if there was a new person

01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:30.950
in a particular group, he would
tell the joke and then point

01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:36.820 position:56%
to the one person who hadn't said
anything and say, now you retell it.

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:41.720
And there was one very complicated
joke, I'm not going to tell it now,

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:47.620
but it deals with a guy
with a cleft palate.

01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:51.020
It's not derogatory, but it is --

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.560
it's, you have to imitate
someone with a cleft palate.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.950
But it's complicated, it's
really complicated and you have

01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:03.710
to pay attention when
the joke is being told

01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:06.920
and it actually is
pretty funny at the end.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.330
But then he would turn to
the person who was, you know,

01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:15.120
shy and make them retell it.

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.850
And inevitably it would
be all screwed up

01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:22.250 position:56%
and then he would insist on, no, no,
no, all right, I'll tell it again

01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:24.500
and then you're going to retell it.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.660
And I have saw people
burst into tears

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:31.880
because they just couldn't get
this and then when you're put

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:34.970
on the spot, of course,
it makes it worse.

01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:37.510
But it was all part
of being a teacher.

01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:41.500
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Was there
aspects of cruelty to it?

01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.020
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: He really did
it for love more than anything else

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:52.110
and also for someone who is shy
and not going to participate

01:41:52.110 --> 01:41:57.850
in whatever the camaraderie was
around a table it was trying to get

01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:02.210
that person included, also
about using your imagination,

01:42:02.210 --> 01:42:05.260
paying attention, remembering
something,

01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:10.560
really understanding how a joke
or how a story was structured.

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.260
He was really always interested
in how people tell stories

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:21.290
and how thinking and
language come together.

01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:29.150
One year, I think it was The
Library of Congress printed

01:42:29.150 --> 01:42:35.100
up a calendar illustrated with
Judaica that was from a collection,

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:39.410
and The Library sent
Bernstein this calendar

01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:41.630
and he was very impressed by it.

01:42:41.630 --> 01:42:46.180
And I remember looking through
it with Bernstein and I said,

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:48.710
Jack would love to have this.

01:42:48.710 --> 01:42:52.620
And he signed it and
wrote a note for Jack.

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.230
And Jack called me, he was in
tears, he was so thrilled to have

01:42:56.230 --> 01:43:04.850 position:56%
that because they really did discuss
whether shared heritage quite a bit.

01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:13.410
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Okay, I guess
in closing just your thoughts

01:43:13.410 --> 01:43:17.770
about your time with Lenny
and how that affected you,

01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:24.940
and in retrospect now if your
feelings about him changed

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:32.530
over time, your sense of
his progression at the end?

01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:39.100
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Well, I wish
that I had appreciated more, well,

01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:45.590
I wish that the job
hadn't been so grueling.

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:57.410
The last time we were on a
Concord together, as he was sitting

01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:02.240
down he said, he was obviously
picking a fight, he said,

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.860
you never said anything
good about my Mass.

01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:12.200
And I said, well, I've never
seen Mass, I've never --

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.670
I know the album, but I've
never seen it performed

01:44:14.670 --> 01:44:16.700
and I shouldn't really have --

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:20.410
I can't have an opinion
till I've seen a production.

01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:26.080
And spent the whole flight,
he really wanted to argue,

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.880
and I tried to steer it
around to what he felt worked

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:32.000
in it and what didn't work.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.870
And I remember sitting
there thinking, you know,

01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:38.860
I should be very flattered that
he's having this discussion with me

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:42.470
because who gets to
talk to a composer

01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:45.490
of this stature about
a particular work.

01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:47.580
And I just didn't know
enough about Mass

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:50.050
to have an interesting discussion.

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.880
I was more interested in why
he wanted to pick a fight,

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.370
he was in a real foul mood.

01:44:57.370 --> 01:45:05.980
And I just wish that I hadn't
been so exhausted all the time

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:09.430
from the job because it would
have been a lot more fun.

01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:13.960
To think of him more as a colleague
or as a mentor, and I didn't think

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:17.600
of him that way when
I was working for him.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Do you think he
ever thought of you as a friend, or?

01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:23.210
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Eventually.

01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:29.360
I took a month off, let's see,
that was after a [inaudible] Place

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:37.760
at L'escola and Harry gave me the
entire month of July of '84 off.

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.560
And I came back to the States.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.730
I stayed for a few weeks in Italy,
and I came back to the States.

01:45:45.730 --> 01:45:52.440
And the production was at the
Kennedy Center in July of '84,

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.740
and I wanted to see one
performance at the Kennedy Center.

01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:00.450
So I called the Watergate Hotel and
I was put through to Harry's room,

01:46:00.450 --> 01:46:03.410
and I said, you know, I'm just
calling to see how things are.

01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:04.980
And Harry invited me
over and said, well,

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:09.250
come up to Lenny's suite
and you can say hello.

01:46:09.250 --> 01:46:13.900
And I did, and we -- and Harry
was sitting at the end of a table

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:20.360
and Bernstein and I were sitting
at the other end at a corner.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.990
And we just carried on
with jokes and all kinds

01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:28.490
of just interesting chit-chat.

01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:31.720
And Harry said later, I
couldn't get a word in.

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:42.040 position:56%
[laughter] And it was the first time
I'd come in to meet with Bernstein

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.540
after a long break and it was
like a friend, visiting him,

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.860
and it was what I had
seen for a couple years.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.060
When I remember the
first time in Washington,

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:55.910
the first Bernstein friend to come

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:59.740
by was Roger Wilkins,
and it was exactly that.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.900
He came in, he sat down, and
they hugged, and he sat down.

01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:08.840
And Roger Wilkins had just
published his memoir at that point.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:13.120
And I was just astonished at the,
you know, at this friendly banter

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:16.450
that Bernstein could have with
just about anybody under the sun.

01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:19.320
And that was the first
time I actually had

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.600
that feeling for myself.

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.010
I thought, well, how sweet,

01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:27.240
this could really be an
interesting guy to know.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.550
But then, of course, I went
back into being the Assistant

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:33.500
for another year-and-a-half
and I should have quit.

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:37.860
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: But he wrote
pieces of music for you and poems

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:44.130
and I mean he wouldn't do that
-- was that extraordinary, or?

01:47:44.130 --> 01:47:47.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: There were quite
a few people who got pieces of music

01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:51.940
and poems, and they were
always very genuine.

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:54.930
And they took some
thought on his point.

01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:57.620
However, the piece
of music with my name

01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.680
in the title he didn't want
it published in the last group

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:05.880
of piano anniversaries
because he said the middle part

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:08.250
of the piece doesn't go anywhere.

01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:13.820
[laughter] And I remember
saying, well, thanks a lot.

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:18.830
It's not random, but it's a
series of chords and it --

01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:20.940
he's right, it doesn't
really go anywhere.

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:23.290
It has been recorded, actually.

01:48:23.290 --> 01:48:27.150
I'm not sure that Boosie [Assumed
Spelling] has ever published the

01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:29.890
printed music, but.

01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:33.660
Yeah, so there's a
little bit of regret,

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:37.220
but at the same time
one very good friend --

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:42.370
I guess after Bernstein
died asked me if working

01:48:42.370 --> 01:48:44.280
for him had changed my life?

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.960
And I said, not so much a
change, but the various aspects

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:53.530
of what I had always
found compelling --

01:48:53.530 --> 01:49:00.700
music and language and
using the imagination,

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:04.040
being able to think
musically and think --

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.640
I mean the reason why I went to
Carnegie Mellon in Architecture was

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.100
because I've never had a problem --

01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:15.160
it's so easy for me to imagine
interiors and exteriors and spaces

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.510
and volumes just in my head.

01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:24.250
I think it's from having lived
overseas and visiting, you know,

01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:28.190
a thousand different cathedrals and
castles and palaces and so forth.

01:49:28.190 --> 01:49:35.720 position:56%
And you just begin to think in this
way, and the history of architecture

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.240
and the history of
music and all that stuff

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.570
that I just I find so compelling.

01:49:41.570 --> 01:49:44.260
And so with Bernstein it
was the first time all

01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:49.930
of this could come together and
actually be useful and I could talk

01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:55.520
to someone who spoke
to me as an adult

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.390
and who had interesting thoughts,
even though he really seemed

01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:01.940
to know nothing about
the history of painting,

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:06.110
but he did understand certain
aspects of architecture.

01:50:06.110 --> 01:50:10.810 position:56%
And in terms of music, I mean I've
never spoken to anybody else who was

01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:15.560
so articulate and who really
understood it from the inside, out.

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.790
So that was extraordinary,
but whether that was a change

01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:21.980 position:56%
in my life, I don't really think so.

01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:26.300
It certainly made me into a
better, a more articulate person

01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:34.570
and a better thinker, but I
don't think, I don't know,

01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:37.970
I still haven't really
grown up so it's not,

01:50:37.970 --> 01:50:40.690
that's not really a change.

01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:48.350 position:56%
[laughter] But it's a -- I wouldn't
say apotheosis, but it's a good sort

01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:53.410
of summary feeling
that I got from him.

01:50:53.410 --> 01:50:54.820
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: A
good summary feeling,

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:58.100
I think that's an appropriate
time to end.

01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.380
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: And
it's all there in memoir.

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.430
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Soon
to be published by ...

01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:03.850
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon:
Yes, Charlesbridge,

01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:11.530
distributed by Random House, and
it should be out in March of 2018,

01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:16.540
and the more I think about it
the more I would like it to be,

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.390
you know, like War and Peace,
it should just be enormous

01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:22.960
but focusing will really help.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.310
And the hardest thing, though, is
to get Bernstein to come to life

01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:35.050
on the page, it's just
impossible, it's really impossible.

01:51:35.050 --> 01:51:42.590
So it's my effort, anyway, it's
my contribution to the centenary.

01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:43.890
&gt;&gt; Mark Horowitz: Thank you.

01:51:43.890 --> 01:51:45.190
&gt;&gt; Charlie Harmon: Thank you.

01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:48.380
Thank you very much, Mark.

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:52.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
