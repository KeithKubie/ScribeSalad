00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.540
In this video, I want
to familiarize you

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.060
with the idea of a limit, which
is a super important idea.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.610
It's really the idea that all
of calculus is based upon.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.157
But despite being
so super important,

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:15.740
it's actually a really, really,
really, really, really, really

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.350
simple idea.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.540
So let me draw a
function here, actually,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.690
let me define a function here,
a kind of a simple function.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.460
So let's define f of x,
let's say that f of x

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.846
is going to be x minus
1 over x minus 1.

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.220
And you might say,
hey, Sal look,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.511
I have the same thing in the
numerator and denominator.

00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.480
If I have something
divided by itself,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.730
that would just be equal to 1.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.200
Can't I just simplify
this to f of x equals 1?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.750
And I would say, well,
you're almost true,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.860
the difference between
f of x equals 1

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.300
and this thing right over here,
is that this thing can never

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.200
equal-- this thing is
undefined when x is equal to 1.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.560
Because if you set,
let me define it.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.040
Let me write it over
here, if you have f of,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.650
sorry not f of 0, if you
have f of 1, what happens.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.599
In the numerator,
we get 1 minus 1,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.770
which is, let me just write
it down, in the numerator,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.910
you get 0.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.590
And in the denominator, you
get 1 minus 1, which is also 0.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.800
And so anything divided by
0, including 0 divided by 0,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.550
this is undefined.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.520
So you can make
the simplification.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.980
You can say that this is you the
same thing as f of x is equal

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.080
to 1, but you would have to add
the constraint that x cannot be

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.340
equal to 1.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.190
Now this and this
are equivalent,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.470
both of these are
going to be equal to 1

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
for all other X's other
than one, but at x equals 1,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.070
it becomes undefined.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.770
This is undefined and
this one's undefined.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.540
So how would I
graph this function.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.610
So let me graph it.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.130
So that, is my y is
equal to f of x axis,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.330
y is equal to f of x axis,
and then this over here

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.666
is my x-axis.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.940
And then let's say this is
the point x is equal to 1.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.320
This over here would be
x is equal to negative 1.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.140
This is y is equal to 1, right
up there I could do negative 1.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.430
but that matter much relative to
this function right over here.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.890
And let me graph it.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.180
So it's essentially for
any x other than 1 f

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.390
of x is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.390
So it's going to
be, look like this.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.250
It's going to look
like this, except at 1.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430
At 1 f of x is undefined.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.590
So I'm going to put a
little bit of a gap right

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.310
over here, the circle to signify
that this function is not

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.810
defined.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.210
We don't know what this
function equals at 1.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.840
We never defined it.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.010
This definition of the
function doesn't tell us

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.760
what to do with 1.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.730
It's literally undefined,
literally undefined

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.740
when x is equal to 1.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.120
So this is the function
right over here.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.850
And so once again, if someone
were to ask you what is f of 1,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.340
you go, and let's say that
even though this was a function

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.126
definition, you'd go,
OK x is equal to 1,

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:15.100
oh wait there's a gap in
my function over here.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.320
It is undefined.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.440
So let me write it again.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.875
It's kind of redundant, but I'll
rewrite it f of 1 is undefined.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.770
But what if I were
to ask you, what

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.320
is the function
approaching as x equals 1.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.630
And now this is starting to
touch on the idea of a limit.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.080
So as x gets closer
and closer to 1.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.190
So as we get closer
and closer x is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.490
to 1, what is the
function approaching.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.960
Well, this entire
time, the function,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.760
what's a getting
closer and closer to.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.830
On the left hand side,
no matter how close

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.080
you get to 1, as long
as you're not at 1,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.880
you're actually at f
of x is equal to 1.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.130
Over here from the right hand
side, you get the same thing.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.370
So you could say, and
we'll get more and more

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.530
familiar with this idea
as we do more examples,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.710
that the limit as x and
L-I-M, short for limit,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:24.590
as x approaches 1 of f of x
is equal to, as we get closer,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.610
we can get unbelievably, we
can get infinitely close to 1,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.240
as long as we're not at 1.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.202
And our function is
going to be equal to 1,

00:04:31.202 --> 00:04:33.160
it's getting closer and
closer and closer to 1.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.490
It's actually at
1 the entire time.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.030
So in this case, we
could say the limit

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.214
as x approaches
1 of f of x is 1.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.880
So once again, it has very fancy
notation, but it's just saying,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.380
look what is a
function approaching

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.140
as x gets closer
and closer to 1.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.040
Let me do another example where
we're dealing with a curve,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.680
just so that you have
the general idea.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.230
So let's say that
I have the function

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.230
f of x, let me just for
the sake of variety,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.970
let me call it g of x.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.940
Let's say that we have
g of x is equal to,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.710
I could define it this way, we
could define it as x squared,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.930
when x does not equal, I don't
know when x does not equal 2.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.565
And let's say that when x
equals 2 it is equal to 1.

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:26.190
So once again, a kind
of an interesting

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.110
function that, as you'll
see, is not fully continuous,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.110
it has a discontinuity.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.880
Let me graph it.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.870
So this is my y
equals f of x axis,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.180
this is my x-axis
right over here.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.350
Let me draw x equals 2, x,
let's say this is x equals 1,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.750
this is x equals 2, this is
negative 1, this is negative 2.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.650
And then let me draw, so
everywhere except x equals 2,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.400
it's equal to x squared.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.870
So let me draw it like this.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.670
So it's going to be a parabola,
looks something like this,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.880
let me draw a better
version of the parabola.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.110
So it'll look
something like this.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.370
Not the most beautifully
drawn parabola

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.570
in the history of
drawing parabolas,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.720
but I think it'll
give you the idea.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.750
I think you know what a
parabola looks like, hopefully.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.674
It should be symmetric,
let me redraw it

00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:29.840
because that's kind of ugly.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.860
And that's looking better.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.740
OK, all right, there you go.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.210
All right, now, this would be
the graph of just x squared.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.020
But this can't be.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.600
It's not x squared
when x is equal to 2.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.290
So once again, when
x is equal to 2,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.200
we should have a little bit
of a discontinuity here.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.440
So I'll draw a gap right over
there, because when x equals 2

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.610
the function is equal to 1.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.560
When x is equal to
2, so let's say that,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.200
and I'm not doing them on the
same scale, but let's say that.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.970
So this, on the graph of f
of x is equal to x squared,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.020
this would be 4, this would
be 2, this would be 1,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.850
this would be 3.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.755
So when x is equal to 2,
our function is equal to 1.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.480
So this is a bit of
a bizarre function,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.890
but we can define it this way.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.280
You can define a function
however you like to define it.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.490
And so notice, it's
just like the graph of f

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.800
of x is equal to x squared,
except when you get to 2,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.410
it has this gap,
because you don't

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.830
use the f of x is equal to x
squared when x is equal to 2.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.170
You use f of x--
or I should say g

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.497
of x-- you use g
of x is equal to 1.

00:07:48.497 --> 00:07:49.580
Have I been saying f of x?

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.940
I apologize for that.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.670
You use g of x is equal to 1.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.470
So then then at 2, just
at 2, just exactly at 2,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.830
it drops down to 1.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.250
And then it keeps going
along the function

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.310
g of x is equal to, or I
should say, along the function

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.240
x squared.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.542
So my question to you.

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:08.000
So there's a couple
of things, if I

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.860
were to just evaluate
the function g of 2.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.840
Well, you'd look
at this definition,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.260
OK, when x equals 2, I use
this situation right over here.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.950
And it tells me, it's
going to be equal to 1.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.940
Let me ask a more
interesting question.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.150
Or perhaps a more
interesting question.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:30.370
What is the limit as x
approaches 2 of g of x.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.159
Once again, fancy notation,
but it's asking something

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.220
pretty, pretty, pretty simple.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.758
It's saying as x gets closer and
closer to 2, as you get closer

00:08:38.758 --> 00:08:40.799
and closer, and this isn't
a rigorous definition,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.419
we'll do that in future videos.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:48.050
As x gets closer and closer to
2, what is g of x approaching?

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.210
So if you get to 1.9, and
then 1.999, and then 1.999999,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.960
and then 1.9999999, what
is g of x approaching.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.450
Or if you were to go from
the positive direction.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.680
If you were to say
2.1, what's g of 2.1,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.050
what's g of 2.01, what's g of
2.001, what is that approaching

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.100
as we get closer
and closer to it.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.510
And you can see it visually
just by drawing the graph.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.610
As g gets closer
and closer to 2,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.350
and if we were to
follow along the graph,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.560
we see that we
are approaching 4.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.930
Even though that's not
where the function is,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.840
the function drops down to 1.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.940
The limit of g of x as x
approaches 2 is equal to 4.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.540
And you could even do this
numerically using a calculator,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.170
and let me do that, because I
think that will be interesting.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.795
So let me get the
calculator out,

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:43.230
let me get my trusty TI-85 out.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.820
So here is my calculator,
and you could numerically

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.770
say, OK, what's it
going to approach

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.770
as you approach x equals 2.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.310
So let's try 1.94,
for x is equal to 1.9,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.550
you would use this top
clause right over here.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.070
So you'd have 1.9 squared.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.280
And so you get 3.61, well what
if you get even closer to 2,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.730
so 1.99, and once again,
let me square that.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.410
Well now I'm at 3.96.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.715
What if I do 1.999,
and I square that?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.760
I'm going to have 3.996.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.520
Notice I'm going
closer, and closer,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.930
and closer to our point.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.930
And if I did, if I
got really close,

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:36.290
1.9999999999 squared,
what am I going to get to.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.290
It's not actually
going to be exactly 4,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.150
this calculator just
rounded things up,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.650
but going to get to a number
really, really, really, really,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.917
really, really, really,
really, really close to 4.

00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:47.250
And we can do something from
the positive direction too.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.958
And it actually has
to be the same number

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.280
when we approach from the below
what we're trying to approach,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.700
and above what we're
trying to approach.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.020
So if we try to 2.1
squared, we get 4.4.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.980
If we do 2.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.870
let me go a couple
of steps ahead,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.920
2.01, so this is much
closer to 2 now, squared.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.420
Now we are getting
much closer to 4.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.710
So the closer we
get to 2, the closer

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.230
it seems like
we're getting to 4.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.180
So once again,
that's a numeric way

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.110
of saying that the
limit, as x approaches 2

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.620
from either direction of g
of x, even though right at 2,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.230
the function is equal to 1,
because it's discontinuous.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.980
The limit as we're
approaching 2,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.803
we're getting closer, and
closer, and closer to 4.
