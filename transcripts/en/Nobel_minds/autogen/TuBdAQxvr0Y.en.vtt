00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
oh I would think that that would be a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
oh I would think that that would be a
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.600
oh I would think that that would be a
would be very exciting because it would

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
would be very exciting because it would
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.320
would be very exciting because it would
bring together people of many different

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330
bring together people of many different
 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.200
bring together people of many different
backgrounds and also hopefully people

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
backgrounds and also hopefully people
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060
backgrounds and also hopefully people
from the public that are very interested

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
from the public that are very interested
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.029
from the public that are very interested
in science and things that the

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039
in science and things that the
 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.490
in science and things that the
literature as well is that the Nobel

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500
literature as well is that the Nobel
 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.870
literature as well is that the Nobel
represents a very useful thing is being

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
represents a very useful thing is being
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880
represents a very useful thing is being
able to engage directly with the public

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
able to engage directly with the public
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.540
able to engage directly with the public
so having you know lecture series on a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
so having you know lecture series on a
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.339
so having you know lecture series on a
variety of topics would be would be

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
variety of topics would be would be
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410
variety of topics would be would be
really exciting well i think that with

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
really exciting well i think that with
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.810
really exciting well i think that with
more space and with excellent management

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
more space and with excellent management
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.940
more space and with excellent management
you would be able to i should i just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
you would be able to i should i just
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.840
you would be able to i should i just
show the continuity of the story of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
show the continuity of the story of
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.170
show the continuity of the story of
science over the past hundred years

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180
science over the past hundred years
 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.479
science over the past hundred years
through the Nobel prizes I think it's a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
through the Nobel prizes I think it's a
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.540
through the Nobel prizes I think it's a
fabulous idea now more than ever we all

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
fabulous idea now more than ever we all
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400
fabulous idea now more than ever we all
need to come together and support the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
need to come together and support the
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.150
need to come together and support the
sciences so that we can improve the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
sciences so that we can improve the
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.440
sciences so that we can improve the
future and improve on the human

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
future and improve on the human
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.469
future and improve on the human
condition going forward we have a lot of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
condition going forward we have a lot of
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.590
condition going forward we have a lot of
work to do and I think certainly I'm

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
work to do and I think certainly I'm
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080
work to do and I think certainly I'm
very grateful for all the efforts of the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
very grateful for all the efforts of the
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.620
very grateful for all the efforts of the
Nobel foundation and the Swedish people

just such an important tribute that you
pay to science and to the human spirit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
pay to science and to the human spirit
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.280
