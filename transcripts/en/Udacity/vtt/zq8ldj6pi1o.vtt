00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.960
Thanks Fredo! So, like old times, we're going to

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.800
need to ask for permission. Go ahead and change

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.960
the Android Manifest file, to request the Internet permission.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.730
And then tell us the exact string name of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.380
the permission that you used. Run the app

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.760
again, to ensure that it doesn't crash. You can

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.070
also log the output of the network call, to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.530
verify that you got the weather data back correctly.
