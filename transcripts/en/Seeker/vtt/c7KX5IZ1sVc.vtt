00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Today we’re talking about loneliness;
not to be confused with introversion,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.377
or social anxiety, while those subjects are worthy topics.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.420
Loneliness actually has been defined in many ways:

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.580
“a state of solitude or being alone,”
“inability to find meaning in one’s life....”

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.120
Okay, this is already a downer, so look at
a picture of a panda.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.240
Aw, it's cute! Now I want a panda.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.480
I'm gonna overnight one to my crib. I'm gonna do that.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.160
Of course, we’re not the only generation
to experience loneliness,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.720
even though listening to The Weeknd 
really does make it feel like that.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.980
Health insurance provider Cigna recently published a study citing that 18-22 year olds

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.740
have the highest “loneliness score,”
 followed by millennials,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.440
then Generation X... so yeah,
young people, we just killin' it right now.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.180
Generation Z cited that they feel people are
around them but they aren’t really with them,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.640
feel shy, and they feel like people
don’t know them very well.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.379
The old man in me really wants to say, “these
kids right now are out here spending too much

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.900
time on the Twitters and the Fortnites!”,
but that’s not exactly what Cigna found.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.000
Cigna cited lack of an IRL social life
as part of the problem,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.420
saying that “levels of in-person interactions,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.100
physical and mental wellness,
and life balance”

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.860
are better predictors of loneliness 
than social media alone.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.580
So, if your IG game is on point but you like to hang
out with your friends, you should be good...

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.780
but if social media IS hanging out with your
friends, go outside! Humans are social mammals

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.939
and need social interaction to survive; that’s
part of why solitary confinement in prisons

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.900
is so torturous. Why do that to ourselves
on the outside?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.520
"Y’all best go out to the quarry for some stickball and a swim!"

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.480
You know, I'm not doing this voice again.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.900
One study breaks down three types of loneliness.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.820
Situational loneliness is when unpleasant events 
or circumstances cause us to retract from society.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.560
Developmental loneliness can hinder
our capacity to balance individualism and intimacy.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.380
(Psychological disorders like depression or schizophrenia could cause developmental loneliness).

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.620
And finally, internal loneliness,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.280
when a self-perception of worthlessness intensifies
the feeling of being alone.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.280
This got dark again, bring in another panda pic.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.300
Lifestyle influences our neurophysiology,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.680
so lonely people perceive the world very differently.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.490
For instance, people suffering from loneliness

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.480
tend to see benign events as more threatening,
living in self-defense mode…

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.039
even in their sleep. Some research suggests that lonelier
people have more restless sleep patterns,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.140
which could impact cognitive development.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.780
Research suggests that there are 
neural correlates for loneliness.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.740
A 2009 study revealed that lonelier people
 showed less activation in brain centers

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.500
associated with reward when viewing pictures of people in pleasant situations,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.360
and less activation in parts of the brain linked to empathy

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.180
when viewing images of people
in unpleasant situations.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.060
Other researchers also discovered that neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei are sensitive to social isolation.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.100
Those neurons in question, taken together
with the ones from the ventral striatum,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.440
deal with the reward neurotransmitter dopamine.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.819
So, it’s possible that low social interactions

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.080
= less dopamine = less feeling good. Of course,
the latter study was run with mice,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.480
so more research is always needed.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.980
On top of that, a meta-analysis from 1980 to 2015 
found that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.120
loneliness and its accompanying
depression was as bad as smoking 15 cigarettes a day,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.500
and is a risk factor for mortality.
This is so dark; bring in the pandas!

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.360
Please, don’t leave, don't leave! I’m
not gonna leave you on a downer.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.640
Loneliness is a social epidemic, yes, 
but there are remedies.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.400
Don’t replace friendships and happiness

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.520
with likes and text messages.
Go out and meet people!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.780
Humans need social interaction in real life – 
it’s developmentally necessary.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.020
Easier said than done, but remember, you’re
not alone in feeling alone.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.220
And if you’ll excuse me, I have a panda 
waiting for me at home.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.940
I did order one, and I can't wait to play with it.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.100
Yo, thanks so much for watching. If you're
like, "ooh, I need a little bit more loneliness content!"

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.720
watch this video about what solitary
confinement does to your brain.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.640
And if you're like, "that's a little bit too dark for me,"
watch this video about pandas watching...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.760
watching porn? Watch this video about pandas
watching porn.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.660
Thanks for watching my video, and also, subscribe to Seeker for more videos!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.740
Pandas watching porn? 
I'm definitely gonna hafta watch that.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.240
I gotta find out what's going
on with pandas.
