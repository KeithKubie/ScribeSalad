00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.020
You have to walk before you can run, crawl
before you can walk, and make it through a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.340
pelvis before you can crawl.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.030
Hello bipeds, Julian in for DNews.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.070
Compared to other animals, humans have a lot
going for us.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.089
We’re intelligent, we’re long lived, we
have the internet.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.499
But in some areas we get left in the dust.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:21.720
Take walking for instance.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.810
While newborn horses are standing up and walking
within hours of their birth, dumb ol’ babies

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.699
take a year to start waddling around.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.099
Why are humans so good at complex things,
but so terrible at the simple stuff like walking?

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.550
It turns out two of our defining human characteristics,
our brain size and our upright walking, are

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.710
at odds with each other.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.480
The hypothesis is, when our ancestors came
down from the trees and started walking across

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.019
the savannah 3 to 6 million years ago, a more
upright posture was an advantage.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.030
It used less energy than knuckling on all
fours, allowing our extremely great grandparents

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.440
to cover large distances more easily.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.239
To support this upright stance our hips had
to change shape, and with this change in shape

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.390
came a narrowing of the birth canal.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.640
According to Cal State Fullerton anthropologist
John Bock, this is where our delayed ambulatory

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.860
skills come from.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.960
Your brain has to be developed enough to control
all your limbs before you can start walking.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.090
But this brain development makes your head
bigger, and if your head is bigger, you can’t

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.930
get through the birth canal, and if you can’t
get through the birth canal you don’t get

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.930
born.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.720
Not so smart with your big brain now, are
you, stuck genius baby?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.670
To work around the dilemma, babies are born
with comparatively underdeveloped brains.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.700
They also need soft skulls so they can squish
their way out of momma.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.210
The bones in our skulls aren’t fused together
at birth, leaving room for our brains to double

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.619
in size in our early years.8 So for us to
become smarter, we had to start out dumber

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.619
and vulnerable.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.180
There’s an inspiring instagram post in there
somewhere.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.300
Once you take into account that we’re born
with less developed brains than our animal

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.479
friends, the reason for our time spent as
rugrats makes a little more sense.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.400
In 2009 Martin Garwicz of Lund University
in Sweden authored a study comparing how long

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.210
various mammals took to start walking.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.250
He and his team compared 24 species, looking
at what their brain size was when they took

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
their first steps relative to their final
adult brain size.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.210
Garwicz formed a timeline predicting when
a species would get off the ground, and crucially

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.399
the timeline starts at conception, not birth.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.850
With conception as the starting point, humans
began walking when they hit the same developmental

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.540
milestone as other animals.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.120
For example, horses are walking in just a
few hours, but that’s because they spend

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.790
up to a year in the womb and their brains
are almost fully developed at birth.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.980
Garwicz also explored whether our bipedalism
delays us compared to our quadruped pals,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.230
and found that it does have a small effect:
the added complexity of heel-to-toe walking

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.140
makes us hit our stride a little later.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.290
That characteristic, along with our less developed
brains at birth, means we take baby steps

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.879
towards taking baby steps.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.030
So now you know why humans walk later than
other animals, but how about some other fun

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.120
animal facts?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:51.980
Check out our friends over at Did You Know
for more...

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.800
So we can walk upright eventually like everyone
else, except snakes, sorry snakes.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.990
But we can never walk up walls like spiders.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.830
To learn why you can never be spider man and
ruin your whole day, check out Trace’s video

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.230
here.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:16.500
This 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.650
video was inspired by a viewer question on
facebook, thanks Jorge.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.109
If you’d like to ask a question there are
tons of ways to ask us.
