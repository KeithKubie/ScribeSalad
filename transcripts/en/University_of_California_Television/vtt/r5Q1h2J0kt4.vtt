- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large brained. Long the

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:20.900
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:31.586
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:39.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.500
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.300
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.673
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:51.610
- [Ajit] And so we humans ask ourselves,
"Who are we? What are we doing here? Where

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.521
did we come from? How did we get here? And
where are we going?"

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.164
Two of these questions are amenable

00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:05.490
to direct scientific enquiry
and constitute the science of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.970
Anthropogeny; explaining the origin of
humans. So, the center CARTA is run by

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.910
Rusty, Gage, Margret and myself, along
with Pascal Gagneux, with management by

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.332
Linda Nelson, community relations by
Ingrid, computer systems by Kate and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.586
programs run by Jesse.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:35.743
Anthropogeny, of course, pursues
most academic disciplines so we involve

00:02:35.743 --> 00:02:41.850
everybody across the mesa and across the
world in our activities. And our goal is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.000
to use all rational and ethical approaches
to seek all verifiable facts from all

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.480
relevant disciplines to explore and
explain the origins of the human

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.300
phenomenon, while minimizing complex
organizations, structures, and hierarchies

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.552
and avoiding unnecessary paperwork and
bureaucracy.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.340
In the process, we try to raise awareness
and understanding of the study of human

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.650
origins within the academic community and
the public at large. Special thanks to our

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.250
major sponsor, the Mathers Charitable
Foundation, Jim Handelman executive

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.740
director, and thanks to all of our
individual supporters, many of whom are in

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.640
the audience. This really means a lot to
us to get your support which helps us to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.510
continue these programs. Special thanks to
Mr. John Armstrong who is providing the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.970
closed captioning for the video recording
to the symposium, which by the way are

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.130
being seen live across the world right
now, and will eventually come on UCTV and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.540
the websites later. Special thanks to
UCTV, Rich, Matt, Marcy, and Jacob, and to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.410
the Salk Service's Kent and Neil running
things in the back there. So I'll close

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.307
this introduction with a rhetorical
question. "Which is the single organ

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:14.431
system that is most different between
humans and chimpanzees?" And the answer is

00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.300
in this symposium.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.760
With that Ill hand over to Nina Jablonski.
