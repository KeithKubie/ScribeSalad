00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.447
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.447 --> 00:00:04.802
is look at this graph y is equal to f of x

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.183
and think about the intervals

00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:08.923
where this graph is positive or negative

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:10.561
and then think about the intervals

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.369
when this graph is
increasing or decreasing.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.142
So first let's just think
about when is this function,

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:20.725
when is this function positive?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.065
Well positive means that the value

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.131
of the function is greater than zero.

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:27.569
It means that the value
of the function this means

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.483
that the function is
sitting above the x-axis.

00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:32.503
So it's sitting above the x-axis

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:33.923
in this place right over here

00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:38.433
that I am highlighting in
yellow and it is also sitting

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.683
above the x-axis over here.

00:00:42.693 --> 00:00:44.853
And if we wanted to, if we wanted

00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:48.150
to write those intervals mathematically.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.379
Well let's see, let's say that this point,

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.570
let's say that this point
right over here is x equals a.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.100
Let's say that this right
over here is x equals b and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.989
this right over here is x equals c.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.890
Then it's positive, it's
positive as long as x is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.098
between a and b.

00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:10.372
At x equals a or at x equals b the value

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:13.436
of our function is zero but it's positive

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:16.519
when x is between a and b, a and b

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.008
or if x is greater than c.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.430
X is, we could write it
there, c is less than x

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.263
or we could write that
x is greater than c.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:34.439
These are the intervals when
our function is positive.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.000
Let me write this, f of x, f of x positive

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.019
when x is in this
interval or this interval

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:42.597
or that interval.

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.070
So when is f of x negative?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.229
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.062
F of x is going to be negative.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:56.715
Well, it's gonna be negative
if x is less than a.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:00.882
So this is if x is less than
a or if x is between b and c

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:05.213
then we see that f of
x is below the x-axis.

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:09.380
F of x is down here so this
is where it's negative.

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:14.640
So here or, or x is between
b or c, x is between b and c.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.295
And I'm not saying less than or equal to

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:24.462
because at b or c the value of
the function f of b is zero,

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.950
f of c is zero.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.186
That's where we are actually
intersecting the x-axis.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:32.670
So that was reasonably straightforward.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.748
Now let's ask ourselves
a different question.

00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:38.022
When is the function
increasing or decreasing?

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:41.355
So when is f of x, f of x increasing?

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.380
Well increasing, one way to
think about it is every time

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.887
that x is increasing then
y should be increasing

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:53.510
or another way to think
about it, you have a,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.249
you have a positive rate of
change of y with respect to x.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.304
We could even think about it as imagine

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.563
if you had a tangent line
at any of these points.

00:03:02.563 --> 00:03:04.687
If you had a tangent line at
any of these points the slope

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:08.949
of that tangent line is
going to be positive.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.702
But the easiest way for
me to think about it is

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:15.075
as you increase x you're
going to be increasing y.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.061
So where is the function increasing?

00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:19.522
Well I'm doing it in blue.

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:22.469
So it's increasing right until we get

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.552
to this point right over
here, right until we get

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:30.929
to that point over there
then it starts decreasing

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.228
until we get to this
point right over here and

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:35.422
then it starts increasing again.

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:38.589
It starts, it starts increasing again.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.886
So let me make some more labels here.

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.808
So let's say that this,
this is x equals d and

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:48.727
that this right over here,

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.747
actually let me do that in green color,

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.664
so let's say this is x equals d.

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.325
Now it's not a, d, b but you
get the picture and let's say

00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:01.878
that this is x is equal to, x is equal to,

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:06.638
let me redo it a little
bit, x is equal to e.

00:04:06.638 --> 00:04:08.205
X is equal to e.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.736
So when is this function increasing?

00:04:10.736 --> 00:04:14.903
Well it's increasing if x is
less than d, x is less than d

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.097
and I'm not gonna say
less than or equal to

00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:21.127
'cause right at x equals
d it looks like just

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.182
for that moment the
slope of the tangent line

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:25.318
looks like it would be,
it would be constant.

00:04:25.318 --> 00:04:27.694
We're going from increasing to decreasing

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:31.433
so right at d we're neither
increasing or decreasing.

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:36.390
But then we're also increasing,
so if x is less than d

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.557
or x is greater than e,
or x is greater than e.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.783
And where is f of x decreasing?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.450
So f of x, let me do this
in a different color.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.617
When is, let me pick a
mauve, so f of x decreasing,

00:04:59.053 --> 00:05:02.432
decreasing well it's going
to be right over here.

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:06.054
It's gonna be right between d and e.

00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:08.330
Between x equals d and x equals e

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.548
but not exactly at those points

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:10.988
'cause at both of those points

00:05:10.988 --> 00:05:13.215
you're neither increasing nor decreasing

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:15.641
but you see right over
here as x increases,

00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.380
as you increase your x
what's happening to your y?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.343
If you go from this point
and you increase your x

00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:21.663
what happened to your y?

00:05:21.663 --> 00:05:23.393
Your y has decreased.

00:05:23.393 --> 00:05:25.901
You increase your x, your y has decreased,

00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:27.781
you increase your x, y has decreased,

00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.580
increase x, y has decreased all the way

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.553
until this point over here.

00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:36.720
So f of x is decreasing
for x between d and e.

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:40.622
So hopefully that gives
you a sense of things.

00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:42.457
Notice, these aren't the same intervals.

00:05:42.457 --> 00:05:45.475
That we are, the intervals
where we're positive

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:47.596
or negative don't perfectly coincide

00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:49.132
with when we are increasing or decreasing.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:52.301
So it's very important to
think about these separately

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.867
even though they kinda sound the same.
