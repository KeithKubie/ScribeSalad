1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,680
Has the Joe the past.
I hear you.

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:04,190
I don't want to be right about
them killing babies. That doesn't,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,680
I know you don't want to be, want to be
round about a human. You don't have to be.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,680
You don't, it means it doesn't matter
whether you want to be right here. Oh,

5
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,530
Jesus. What's your longest podcast?
We're going, no, don't do that.

6
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:18,780
That was like six hours or
something. [inaudible] I think. Uh,

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,320
Kevin Smith was along this. He was like
five and a half. Fuck that dude. Oh,

8
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,940
he's a great guy. Just kidding.
I love him. Okay. 30 more
minutes. I want to give up.

9
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,440
You're going to get shanked
up to, I'm fine, man. Will
ours look. Here's the thing.

10
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,360
Fine. Listen, I'll be honest
with you. I'm kind of retarded

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,750
in that. No, no, no. That's
going to be a soundbite.

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,920
They're going to put that
to Mariachi music. No,

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,440
I might have to use it. You must be
flame thrower to light. The next choice.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,790
I'll take a poll of
tobacco. No, no. Seriously.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,810
When it comes to regular life,
regular tobacco with no marijuana at all.

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,560
Would you like some? Yes. Okay.
Dell, but I know lead for hours.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,780
My Gut never wrong.

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,940
That's all your your points. Cause
here's the deal. What points?

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,840
That's all I got back. 100%.
100% ain't got no points.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,190
He's got some great points.
No, no. Eddie, Eddie,

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,980
big UFC Basadur of the flat
earth society. No, he's not.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,060
Eddie barely listened to anybody.
Doesn't believe more than he believes.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,530
Everybody fluttered
became a universal truth.

24
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,210
He would fucking start
believing the earth is round.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,910
No Flat Earth Society contraries front.

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,700
The flatter society is
controlled opposition. Nobody
gets in flatter. Okay, listen,

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,340
I know there's a lot of bullshit.
So I run her society. It's not real.

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,520
I respect you. I do. I
love you. The point is,

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,210
is that I'm asking you a
real question here. Okay.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,940
It'd be the biggest documentary
in history. It only costs
like $1 million. Okay?

31
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,900
Let's take it that 50,000 ton big
ship and to have it shirk them.

32
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,530
Navigate the planet, okay? You will
be there with GP and no, no, no, no.

33
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm not going to be there.
Fuck No.

34
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:13,420
We're going to get someone to represent
me there. Okay. All right. Good drugs.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,590
We're launching God doing no, no, no, no.

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,580
We're launching the discovery of flat
earth project. Well, that rocket man,

37
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,780
Dude's already shooting himself in
the space, isn't he? Like, yeah,

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,080
it's really easy. You know, you know, you
prove the earth. We really live on a ball.

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,530
How when you, when they supposedly
make those missions to the ISS,

40
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:34,140
when they shoot up,
just have the one of the astronauts,

41
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,800
it's going to go to the ISS.
Just have a GoPro camera on his head,

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,360
on his helmet and just go uncut.
No cuts, no cuts from the tongue.

43
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:46,720
You get on that ship to the tongue.
You Doc, and I want you to duck

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,390
and Fred. Fred, no fricking
technology. It'll be my up.

45
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,070
I got my phone is awesome.
Let's listen to what does that Eddie,

46
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:01,600
the suck be combative here, but if
that combat deaths talk, I know,

47
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,200
but you're talking over each other.
If that did happened, would you a,

48
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,970
you want some tobacco,
Alex Jones.

49
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,390
And that happened lots of pure amount
in the first time. I'm saying this.

50
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,760
I've been saying if that happens,
if that happened, you let it go.

51
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,770
There's no footage of the construction
of the international space station.

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,400
There was no footage. You just
appeared cause they're not as feathers.

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,700
Painters of the modules
of the international,

54
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,660
I you sure about that 100% there's
no footage of the construction.

55
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,470
That shit. I've known people
that worked on the space station.

56
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,930
I've known astronauts. They're
real people, man. They were,

57
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,960
they know they are real people.
I didn't say to her real piece,

58
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:39,640
so you don't think it's really constructed
or you would like to see the footage

59
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,000
first? Listen, listen. If you know there's
a, there's a debate. Let me finish, dude.

60
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,820
Let me just, there's a debate, uh,

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,000
out there whether you believe he
went to the moon or not. You have,

62
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,850
everyone needs to acknowledge it.
There's a debate. There's people,

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,160
what am I the laser? Hold on, hold on.

64
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,790
There's people that believe we went to
the moon and there's people believed that

65
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,410
we faked it. You have to understand
both resalable ever necessary. Exactly.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,980
Exactly. So when you talk about, uh,

67
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,010
the people that don't
believe we went to the moon,

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,420
when they also say they're
faking other space shit too,

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,670
you have to kind of understand where
they're coming from. Moon mission.

70
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,760
They believe whether we win or not. Maybe
we were, maybe we didn't. I don't know.

71
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,000
But there's people that don't believe it,
so when they don't,

72
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,910
you should understand it. They have no
trust for any of that as I love you.

73
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,980
How many times you've got to fake
going to the moon before you go, okay,

74
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,340
well before that bullshit meter
just fucking explodes. No, I agree.

75
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,230
Let's [inaudible] probably got mad about
Sandy Hook, which I think happened.

76
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,290
I have a right to question.
Hold on.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,910
I was watching minions three or four
where they go to us and they run through

78
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,100
the minions, you know, run through
Hollywood and they're staying in them.

79
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,180
And lighting people have a
right to do that. The true,

80
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,480
there's nobody wants to send people up
cause a bunch of die a bunch of test

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,200
Palestine. We fly on jumbo jets around
the country, our cell phones work.

82
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Do you think that we definitely went to
the moon? Absolutely. 100%. Absolutely.

83
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,420
Bet Your life on it that my life.
But the difference is is that they say,

84
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,350
I say it didn't happen.

85
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,340
The truth says that we have f type
of Alex Jones and i's moon landing.

86
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,320
I've denied it a bunch
of times. They, you know,

87
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,290
they say Alex Jones says that there are a,

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,310
you are a human slaves on Mars.
Ever said it.

89
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,000
But all I'm saying is I know
the real NASA people and

90
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Wernher von Braun, the guy who directed
all six blue missions was a Nazi, correct?

91
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,290
Yes. Uh, he uh, he hung out
with uh, a Walt Disney, correct?

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,580
Yeah. Yeah. And who in the 50s
just made up space? They never,

93
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,890
no one would ever went to space.
How is space?

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,950
What Elisha had space while I was on
the phone with you for 45 minutes this

95
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,110
morning.
I told you I have a 12 inch telescope.

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160
12 inch diameter opening aperture. Yes. I
talked to him. Look, it's a fricking mode.

97
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,830
You're taking 35 millimeter photos there.
It's there.

98
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,790
All the shit you see when
you look up it's there.

99
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,840
You get kind have a total scope.
You can closer to what's going on.

100
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,980
We're not going to have a
space is fake conversation.

101
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,280
You told me the fucking why can't I
can't do this? I didn't say the lights.

102
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,630
I don't know.
Well I don't know what they are.

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,870
The way I describe this is the
same way I talk about Jujitsu. You,

104
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,950
you should never talk about how effective
martial arts art can prove that shit.

105
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,860
You can't do all this thing can prove
that the sun is 93 million miles.

106
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,290
You don't think like scientists.

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,910
You've got to believe that we believe
are real people that have souls and

108
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,330
freewill. Cause you could say maybe
we don't even exist. You don't exist.

109
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,840
Joe Doesn't exist and nobody exists.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,490
So because we can have a space for your
talk fucking head but break. No. Great.

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,040
Let's not do it. Nope. The
only, my point of all that was,

112
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,870
I don't want to have it
spaced discussion either.

113
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,990
But my point is that if there's people
out there that believe we faked going to

114
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:59,090
the moon six times, you have to
understand their skepticism. That's, yes,

115
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,740
this is, hold on. You know what I mean?

116
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,160
We actually talked about before when
he was talking to him. That's all.

117
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,060
This is what we talked about before when
he was talking about the reason why he

118
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,360
questions anything. It's cause he's,
he's seen so many different things.

119
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:15,770
It turned out to be exactly [inaudible]
earlier and he was actually saying that

120
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,470
sometimes you can get fucking crazy with
it and you think that everything's fake

121
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,860
and you call bullshit on things
that really aren't. But I,

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,570
human exploration is real.
Yes.

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,550
We can do some stuff like what have you,
we've done man.

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,160
Um,
what like what like fight wars and shit.

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,300
Like what? Like I like, that's awesome.
Tesla, right? Yeah. Right. Where's Tesla?

126
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,950
I know. Just how about all the technology
that you enjoy and make your life?

127
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,490
I love it. I love them
signs. That's of course,

128
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,440
of course I talking to [inaudible]
allows people to understand the distance

129
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,350
between earth and Mars. That's
the same, this kind of stuff.

130
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:57,110
Then you get into rumors,
but by the way,

131
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,421
you've taught me a lot.

132
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,590
You're a really smart guy and
entrepreneur and a badass show.

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,930
I think it's healthy to be where you're
at. Questioning everything first,

134
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:09,710
just buying everything. All I'm telling
you is is the stuff we have now.

135
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:13,400
A hundred years ago it would be considered
magic and we humans getting, wait, yes,

136
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,340
I agree with that.
Fucking iPhones.

137
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I know people that [inaudible]
hospital and nothing that side,

138
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,960
just on the main line in the
videos running NASA and I'm like,

139
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,510
where are we there? Yes.
I ran the RCA cameras.

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
We faked the photos because the radiation
belts in it, they dogged him up,

141
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,390
but when we shouldn't have done that,
I fucking know what happened.

142
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,350
That makes way more sense to me and it's
one of the things that Jamie and I have

143
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,290
actually discussed when we
talked about the Gemini 15 photo,

144
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,120
the famous photo of Michael Collins.

145
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,720
That turns out to be just a reverse of
a photo of him on a training mission

146
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,540
where he's in the harness.
One old PR, they use it.

147
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,050
That's why I said a little overzealous
PR agents. I didn't go to too.

148
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:55,010
I went to three
beds of NASA engineers.

149
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,910
One of them was Raymond take that
allowed me to talk about this.

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,380
Raymond was there running this Frickin,
he ran the lasers on the moon.

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,580
He ran the deals.

152
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:07,210
He said what was weird is they had
another group of ships and I'm out,

153
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,170
you know it be him, told me I will
say this, I just shouldn't do it.

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,380
Another group of ships,
well they got another group of sheriffs,

155
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:17,520
but basically he wouldn't
say it and this is not drama.

156
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,520
I was going to meet with him. I met with
him at the former Norad Command base.

157
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,500
That's the Hilton outside Austin and he
wouldn't tell me and then like a week

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,250
later his heart blew, but he was ready
to tell me. He said, no, it's real,

159
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:33,720
but there's more advanced and he had
like presidential letters, his house.

160
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,250
You look at him, he's like the
main guy, like running the cameras,

161
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,200
like number three in Nasa, like for
engineers, fricking g he was in Vietnam,

162
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,240
ran black ops and Cambodia and he said,
he said,

163
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,420
well we lost a lot of people,
but those were clandestined operations.

164
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,850
I wasn't part of them. It's all
compartmentalized. But he said,

165
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:54,300
you're right that there were a bunch of
missions beforehand because the US was

166
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,670
willing to kill 50 people to do that,
just to see if they can get some,

167
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,130
so no one else will do. It was a tragic
thing to us. Is that great Joe? No,

168
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,590
we were willing to, we had
men who are ready to die. Oh,

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,190
over and over again for the one time it
worked and that's what pisses me off.

170
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,800
Well, Gus Grisham in those,
the original blew up on them.

171
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,840
Line phone blew up on the launchpad.
You know,

172
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,280
we'll be incredibly tragic if is if
they actually did go to the moon,

173
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,300
but they fake the footage because of the
radiation. So their releases bullshit.

174
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,940
No,
but do you know how,

175
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,900
how horrific that would be if you were
a guy like Neil Armstrong and you knew

176
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:29,040
that the footage was bullshit,

177
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,250
but you actually had gone to
the moon and you're like fuck.

178
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,890
And this whole thing was like, people
were starting a little, why are these,

179
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,240
what does it look like? They're
on wires. There's eyes good.

180
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,090
They're on trampolines.
Like yeah. By the way,

181
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:42,450
they all got radiated cause it's true.
Like he says going through that,

182
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:46,280
it's like a thousand chest x rays or
something. You know? Even if it's noon,

183
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,730
you know it's like 10 texts Chessa
right? Yeah. Terrible for you. Notice,

184
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,290
although I thought it was only one.

185
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
Notice how they know it's more notice
how the international flights are all now

186
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,440
at night. Why is that? Because
there's freaking know. Ready Dude.

187
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,900
So did you go to sleep?
It's a red. No, no, no.

188
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,640
Solar radiation from
35,000 feet to two two.

189
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,650
She level on average is 10 feet of
water and about six inches of stone.

190
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,270
There's dirt. Why? Why is the
sun so big on the, on the,

191
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,790
explain that again. What are you saying?
Imagine that the atmosphere is a lens.

192
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,400
Okay.
So when you,

193
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,090
why do you think the sun or the moon
look so much bigger on that rise?

194
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,930
Why is that? You ever thought about that?
I always thought it was just refraction.

195
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,160
Harrison. [inaudible] I'm
bigger than clothes. Why is red?

196
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,240
Why is it red? The atmosphere, you're
looking at all more care and yeah,

197
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,270
you're looking through a thousand
miles instead of 20 miles. Okay.

198
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,660
Show the moon gets smaller and her
totally wide as it goes up. Right.

199
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,290
So this is listens like astronomy.
I'm on.

200
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,840
I see what you're saying because you're
looking at it on the, on the plane.

201
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,520
[inaudible] I forget. Uh, we
were talking about that flights.

202
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,780
Yeah. Radiation we're talking about
already or shield, whatever it is.

203
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,340
You get a bunch of chest x rays when
you fly during the day because the sun

204
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,540
solar radiation because you're above,
everybody knows you're in the mountains.

205
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,690
You get a worst sunburn.
Why?

206
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,350
Let's oxygen less dropping the v the UV.

207
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,270
Yeah. Show when you're at 35,000 feet.
That's above the Himalayas. Yeah.

208
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,190
You, you are up there. And there's no,
there's, there's on average 35,000 feet.

209
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,590
This is NASA [inaudible]
probably not true.

210
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,110
[inaudible] feet of water and six
inches of stone stick as theirs.

211
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,480
If you can densed 35,000 feet of dust,

212
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,650
the filter. Oh Wow. Why won't you hit a
filter on your iPhone as it turned out?

213
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,250
The color put a filter over.
Right. She'll think about,

214
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,550
think about the atmosphere when you're
looking straight up the boons fucking

215
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:58,870
white looking at this
angle. It's yellow, right?

216
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,430
It's big and orange on the
like, damn, that's big.

217
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,850
It's not just where it's coming up.
That's part of it. It's that itch.

218
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,410
It's bubbled, it's deformed. You're,

219
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,680
it's like looking through a
pair of glasses on the edge.

220
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,800
So you're looking through all that
atmosphere you look at through pollution,

221
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,880
through dirt, everything. Yeah.
Yeah. My Dad told me all that.

222
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,020
That's fucking a manger now.

223
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,540
So that's why moons are red.

224
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,190
They're red when they arise, they're
white. Where they go to the top.

225
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,270
It's all this shit. We're
looking at it through. Yeah,

226
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,370
we've got a weird situation,
Huh?

227
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,120
A big ass one quarter
sized planet just floating,

228
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,590
just floating above us. We stare at
it. Well, it's a full moon tonight.

229
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,840
That is fucking weird. Is a planet.
It's right there. I I, yeah.

230
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,770
I fell asleep at like 10 o'clock last
night and missed your call and I woke up

231
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:56,750
at like three 30 and I had to get up and
I looked out, it looked fake news show.

232
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Sometimes it's a half moon and I was
looking out of the hotel like 500 yards,

233
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,940
Shamir, and I'm looking at beautiful.
That is, it's just like, hey,

234
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,230
it's okay to say it's made out of
cheese. Did you? Probably, isn't it.
