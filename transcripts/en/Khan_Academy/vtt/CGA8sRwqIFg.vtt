00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.190
Everything we've been dealing
with so far has just been with

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.110
the individual atoms,
but atoms bond.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.770
Or another way of saying it
is, they stick together.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.130
Because if atoms didn't stick
together, then we'd all be

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.730
essentially just a collection
of atoms and this video

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.360
wouldn't be being produced.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.960
So atoms stick together and
they form molecules.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.540
You take a bunch of
atoms together and

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.370
they'll stick together.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.580
And they'll form molecules.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.730
And then obviously molecules
start building up and you get

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.680
other structures.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.770
And if we started talking about
organic chemistry, you'd

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.530
have a bunch of atoms, a lot of
carbons and hydrogens and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.100
other things, fitting
together and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.840
they'd be forming proteins.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.600
And then proteins would fit
together to form organic

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.160
structures.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.580
And you fit enough of those
together, and you'll

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.460
eventually get someone recording
a YouTube video.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.970
So this is where
it all starts.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.790
Atoms bond.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.970
Or they stick together.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.570
And the purpose of this video
is to think about the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.940
different types of ways
that an atom can

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.770
stick to another atom.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.720
So the first, and kind of the
most powerful way-- or I think

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.520
of it as the most powerful way--
is if you take an atom

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.850
that really wants to give an
electron, and then you have

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.805
another atom that really wants
to take an electron.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.920
Right?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.420
And we've talked about
this before.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.950
An atom that wants to give an
electron wants to give it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.365
because it's trying to get into
a stable configuration in

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:28.610
its outer shell.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.910
Everyone wants to look
like a noble gas.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.050
They're all envious of the noble
gases, because the noble

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.280
gases have eight electrons
in their outer shell.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.050
So who wants to give?

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.490
Well if you look at the period
table, the people who want to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.990
give really badly-- and we've
talked about this a good bit--

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.480
are the alkali metals.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.440
These guys just really want
to offload an electron.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.870
And there are other people
who want to give them.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.260
But let's take the
extreme example.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.370
So these guys really want
to offload an electron.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.710
And who wants to take
an electron?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.660
Well, the halogens.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.430
We've talked about it.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.110
These guys love taking
electrons.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.230
They're not the only ones.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.020
But they have a very high
electronegativity.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.130
They really want to
take electrons.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.310
So if you put these around
each other, what happens?

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.130
Let's say, sodium
and chlorine.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.000
And let's say we wanted to
flavor some of our food.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.130
So you have some sodium and
you have some chlorine.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.660
So sodium-- let me draw its
valence shell-- sodium's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.650
valence shell looks like this.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.980
It's got one electron sitting
there that it would really

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.640
just like to get rid of.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.470
And then chlorine
looks like this.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.890
It has seven valence
electrons.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.550
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.330
So what happens is this
guy wants to escape.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.550
This little blue electron right
here really wants to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.160
escape the sodium
and essentially

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.210
move into the chlorine.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.930
And obviously, it's not
like a one-for-one.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.880
You'd have billions and
trillions of these atoms

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.820
rolling around, and these
electrons jump off, then they

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.390
go to one, then they
jump to another.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.710
But for the sake of our
purposes, let's say we just

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.080
have these two atoms. And what
you have is that that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.630
electron jumps off.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.070
And then if that electron
jumps off,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.440
what happens to sodium?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.160
Well then the sodium
has no electrons

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.660
in its valence shell.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.490
Although it does.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.110
Now its valence shell is one
lower, but we can say it's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.140
lost that one electron
that was out there.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.770
And now its atomic configuration
will

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.490
look a lot like neon.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.810
Right?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.950
Sodium, you lose an electron,
now it looks a lot like neon,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.880
at least its electron
configuration.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.860
But now it has one fewer
electrons than protons.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.110
So now, it has a positive
charge.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.500
It was neutral back here.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.760
Right?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.900
Now it's positive.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440
And now, what does a
chlorine look like?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.940
And I'm kind of mixing up
notations, but that's really

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.920
just to give you the idea.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.980
So chlorine before had
seven electrons.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.870
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.710
That electron had jumped
onto the chlorine.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.010
So now it's happy.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.625
It looks a lot like argon now.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.930
It has a completely filled
valence shell.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.510
And what's the charge now?

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.730
Well in has one more.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.290
Now it will have 18 electrons
instead of 17.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.029
Right?

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.050
So what is its charge now?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.660
It has 17 protons,
18 electrons.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.040
It has a negative one charge.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.220
So I'll just put a negative
up there.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.950
It has a negative charge now
because it got that electron

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.170
from sodium.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.640
So now these guys are both
happy from an electron

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.840
configuration point of view.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.090
They both have these stable
valence shells.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.170
But they're attracted to
each other, right?

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.220
Coulomb forces.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.450
Positive is attracted to
negative, negative is

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.580
attracted to positive.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.620
And it can be very strong, this
electrostatic force, so

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.170
they stick to each other.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.250
And so this force
of attraction,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.720
this is an ionic bond.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.690
So they essentially
will form NaCl.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.740
They're not sharing electrons.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.010
This guy wanted the electrons so
badly, and this guy wanted

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.520
to give them away so badly, he
just handed the electron over.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.280
But then he says, oh, by the
way, now that I handed you the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.740
electron, you're negative,
I'm positive.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.080
I want to stick to you.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.960
And then we formed table
salt and we're ready

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.760
to season our food.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.120
Now that's the situation where
one guy really wants to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.580
offload an electron, one guy
really wants to take it.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.680
What happens in the situation
where they're both not as

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.690
extreme in their views in
whether or not they want to

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.550
give or take electrons?

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.870
So let's think of a few
other examples.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.960
The best example is
elemental oxygen.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.360
Right?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.290
Let's see, elemental oxygen.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.390
So this right here
is an ionic bond.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.560
Not to jump back and forth,
but I'm not sure if I just

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.330
mentioned that.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.160
Why is it called
an ionic bond?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.410
Because we formed ions.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.530
When we donated the electron
from sodium to chlorine, we

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.540
formed an ion.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.700
The sodium, this became a
cation, because it's positive.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.980
And this became an anion,
because it's negative.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.310
And then they stuck
to each other, so

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.690
this is an ionic bond.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.760
Fair enough.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.110
Now what happens, like I was
just starting to say, if we

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.950
have two elements that aren't
that different in how much

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.310
they want electrons.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.560
Their electronegativity
is very similar.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.080
And the best example
of that is we had

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.895
two of the same element.

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:21.820
So let's say I had oxygen.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.050
Let's have one oxygen there.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.940
Let's look at the periodic table
to make sure that we're

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.390
not-- oxygen has six valence
electrons, right?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.900
One, two, three, four, five,
six valence electrons.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.130
Right?

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.380
It's 2s2, 2p4.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.380
So on the second shell
it has six electrons.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.510
So oxygen has one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.500
And then let's say we
have another oxygen.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.920
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six electrons.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.780
Now both of these oxygen
atoms would love

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.640
to have eight electrons.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.500
They'd be stable.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.130
They could start pretending
like they're a noble gas.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.410
But clearly, they don't
have eight electrons.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.910
And let's say in this, all they
have around each other is

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.180
other oxygen atoms. So what
they can do is say, this

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.240
oxygen goes to that oxygen, and
says, hey, why don't we

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.820
share some electrons and then
we can both pretend that we

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.650
have eight electrons.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.620
And this guy says,
oh, sure enough.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.690
So we can just bring
him over here.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.380
And I'll just write
him in blue.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.900
Oxygen doesn't necessarily
have to change colors.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.400
I'm joking.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.730
So I'm just going to draw this
guy over on this side just so

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.010
you recognize that this is
different than this guy.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.490
And then they share
these electrons.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.680
So they share these electrons.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.290
And we could do it by
drawing a line here.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.360
So they're sharing two
pairs of electrons.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.360
So this guy right here, he had
six electrons, but he can kind

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.550
of pretend that he has this
electron and that electron.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.420
So he has eight in his
valence shell.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.050
And this guy, he's going
to do the same thing.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.420
He has one, two, three, four,
five, six, but he also can

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.320
kind of pretend that
these guys are also

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.330
in his valence shell.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.540
So he's happy.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.480
And this notion, where you're
actually sharing electrons,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.410
where these electrons are going
to go and both electron

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.740
probability distribution clouds
of both atoms. This is

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.280
called a covalent bond.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.060
And this is typical when
you're dealing with two

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.300
elements that aren't very
different in terms of their

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.940
electronegativity or their
desire to attract electrons.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.250
Now, when we talked about
ionization energy, I think, we

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.060
talked about when oxygen
and water bond, right?

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.190
And oxygen-- oxygen, we've
drawn that-- is six.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.620
Not oxygen.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.880
Water.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.980
Oxygen and hydrogen to form
water, and hydrogen looks

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.480
something like this.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:55.660
Right?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.850
You have a hydrogen
atom there.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.410
You have a hydrogen
atom there.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.690
They said, hey, why don't
we get together.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.680
Let's share some atoms. And the
hydrogen atoms say, oh,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.090
OK, let's share some atoms.
Let me rewrite this oxygen

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.900
like this, so it becomes clear
that we're sharing.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.860
So if I rewrite this
oxygen like this.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.550
I essentially split up
one of these pairs.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:19.070
And these hydrogens come along
and they share one hydrogen

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.690
there, one hydrogen there.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.780
This guy can pretend like he
has his first shell filled,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.530
because you can only
put two there.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.920
That's where the eight
rule breaks down

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.030
in the first shell.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.070
This guy can pretend, too.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.830
And now oxygen can pretend like
he's got eight electrons

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.890
in his valence shell.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.880
And everyone's happy.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.980
So this is also a
covalent bond.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.290
Another way we could have
written this, and I think I

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.640
did this in the last
video, I could have

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.810
written it like this.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.200
Where the implication of this
line, each of these lines

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.480
involve two electrons.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.120
These are equivalent
statements.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.420
But in this situation,
oxygen is more

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.430
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.880
It wants to get the electrons
more than hydrogen.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.530
So in this situation, the
electrons are going to spend

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.910
more time around oxygen than
they will around hydrogen.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.600
So hydrogen will experience, I
guess you could call it, a

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.180
partial positive charge on this
side of the molecule,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.450
while the oxygen side will
experience a partial negative.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.730
I'm going to draw it
real small, because

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.260
it's a partial negative.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.430
This is called a polar
covalent bond.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.570
Because it's still covalent.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.670
We're sharing electrons.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.500
But it's polar, because the
electrons are getting pulled

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.090
to spend most of their time
at one side of the atom.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.440
And since that is the case, the
molecule as a whole, the

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.090
collection of atoms, is going
to have polarity.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.170
One side of the molecule is
going to be more negative than

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.150
the other side, which will be
more positive because the

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.500
electrons are spending more
time on that side.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.690
Now the last bond we can talk
about, and I've touched on

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.500
this a little bit, is
the metallic bond.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.780
I was in a metallic bond in
high school, but anyway,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.480
that's a subject for
another video.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.360
But with metals, you can't
really draw the electron

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.930
structure there.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.650
But what happens with, let's
say we have iron, right?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.820
And you have just a bunch
of neutral iron

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.630
atoms sitting around.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.400
And we established the one
commonality of metals, what

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.640
makes something metallic or have
metallic characteristics

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.040
is that they have a bunch of
electrons in their outer

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.240
orbital that they're
very giving.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.750
They're very happy to share.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.060
So if you put a bunch of these
guys together, what happens is

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.310
they share their electrons.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.560
So they all become positive.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.230
They're very communal
this way.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.410
The metallic atoms. And then
their electrons kind of just

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.370
form this sea out here.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:54.960
But they all share.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.510
E minus.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.190
E minus.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.340
E minus.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.520
E minus.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.540
And because their electrons are
all on the sea and they've

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.900
kind of gotten this positive
charge, they're attracted to

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.180
the sea that they've created.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.740
They're attracted to their
shared electron pool that all

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.640
of the atoms have donated to.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.100
And this is essentially what
allows, well definitely,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.620
metals to be conductive, because
you have this pool of

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.920
electrons that are very
easy to move around.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.710
And also it's what makes
them malleable.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.510
Because even if you
have visually--

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.380
it's a little intuitive.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.340
There's nothing exact here.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.960
But you can kind
of move these.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.020
You can imagine that this is
kind of a big pudding of

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.370
electrons or big glue
of electrons.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.410
And you can move, you can bend
the rod or flatten the rod

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.190
without having it break
or get brittle.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.030
While if you're talking about
salts that have a very strong

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.660
but rigid bond, if you were to
try to bend a bar of salt, the

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.720
bond will just be broken.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.050
There's no, kind of, squishy
electron mush that you can

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.420
kind of bend around
and play with.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.020
Anyway, so those are
the three bonds.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.430
And hopefully that gives
you a little intuition.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.110
And this is super useful,
because in the rest of

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.410
chemistry, everything we do will
essentially involve some

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.140
combination of these bonds.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.660
And we'll start talking about
what these bonds mean in terms

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.070
of the temperature at which they
boil, or the properties

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.880
of the molecules themselves.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.130
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
