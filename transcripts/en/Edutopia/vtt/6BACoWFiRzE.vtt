00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:01.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How are you, sir?

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.946
Good morning, good morning, sir.

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:04.936
Good morning.

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:06.186
Good morning, Mr. Sauder.

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:06.916
Morning sir.

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:10.186
&gt;&gt;Student: I believe there is a
correlation between bullying and stress.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.686
For example, when someone's being
bullied, they might lose sleep

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:14.826
because they're stressed about it.

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:15.796
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Absolutely.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.456
What are you willing
to do to foster more

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:21.076
of an anti bullying culture
here at Urban Prep?

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:24.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Our hundred percent college
acceptance rate is a direct result

00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:25.876
of our pride periods.

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:28.716
We focus on building them character wise

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:29.926
and building their social
and emotional skills.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.276
&gt;&gt;Marcus: It's really difficult to
ask a young man to sit and focus

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.176
in a biology class if they're
hungry, if they're worried

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:48.686
about where their mom is, if their
worried about coming to and from school,

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:50.596
and they have to cross gang lines.

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:55.216
When they come to pride class, the idea
is that this is a relaxing environment

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:58.096
where they can talk about issues
that they're facing and also leave

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.166
with skills every day to help them
better navigate their situation

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.546
in school and outside of school.

00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:04.096
&gt;&gt;What we're going to
do today, gentlemen,

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.936
is actually go through a few activities
so that we can know the difference

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.136
between positive peer
interaction and bullying.

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:14.016
&gt;&gt;Tim: Each of our students is
placed when they're freshmen

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:15.456
in a group that we call pride.

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.206
We're Urban Prep lions and
lions travel in prides,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:20.716
and so we have our students
grouped according to prides,

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.906
and they meet in their prides every day.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.986
&gt;&gt;Student: You're with them from
freshman year to senior year,

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.916
so it creates more of a
connection, where these are

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:32.736
like actually my brothers, people that
I can lean on if I need something.

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:34.166
&gt;&gt;Student: We all had to apologize

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:37.396
that we weren't trying to
make him feel unwanted.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:38.926
&gt;&gt;Marcus: Give yourselves a hand.

00:01:38.926 --> 00:01:39.826
Let's give it up for the guys.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:42.076
Great job, gentelmen.

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:45.406
&gt;&gt;We have four pride leaders and
so one pride leader represents each

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:45.906
grade level.

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:49.126
Essentially, we're kind of like
a grade level counselor for them,

00:01:49.126 --> 00:01:52.436
the one person in the building that will
remain consistent from freshman year

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:56.196
until graduation, that will know
about their familial situations,

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.266
know about challenges that
they've had academically.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:02.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How has the environment
that you have been in affected you?

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:08.426
&gt;&gt;Student: Where I used to live,
people around me set a bad example,

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:12.036
so I used to follow kind of
and I didn't really work hard.

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:14.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what does a positive
environment look like to you?

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:17.066
&gt;&gt;Student: Positive people,
because people really make

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.386
up the environment actually.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:20.756
It's the way that people
react to each other

00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:23.556
and treat each other,
and show you respect.

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:24.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So, respect.

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.386
&gt;&gt;Marcus: So relationships
are the cornerstone of pride.

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.126
They young men are able to
develop a bond with their brothers

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:36.546
and their pride families, as well
as with an adult in the building.

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:40.226
All of the pride leaders
have a background or a degree

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.366
in the field of social work.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:45.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Last year when I was having
problems with my father, Mr. Moore,

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:49.906
he came to me, because he
noticed that I had a problem.

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:54.236
&gt;&gt;Lionel: Pride leaders can provide them
not just with an ear, but with a toolkit

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.666
on how to deal with these things.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:59.866
&gt;&gt;Marcus: We have a framework
full of topics and ideas

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.246
for our lesson plans for the week.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.256
Anything from safe sex practices,

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:06.776
college preparedness
and awareness, stress.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:10.156
&gt;&gt;Explain one thing you learned about
stress from this week's discussion

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:13.586
and remember, do not
write your name on it.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:14.966
&gt;&gt;I asked them, "What
should do with stress?"

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.506
and they said, "Get rid of it,"
and then they balled up the paper.

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:19.106
So let's get rid of the stress.

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:21.256
&gt;&gt;Go!

00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:24.736
&gt;&gt;We're able to have fun, laugh, be
loud, so that we can actually have

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:25.846
that discussion about stress.

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:27.376
&gt;&gt;Everyone have a snowball?

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:27.776
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah.

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:30.256
&gt;&gt;Marcus: All right, so open them
up and let's see what we've learned.

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:31.236
&gt;&gt;Student: It's fair to say,

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.816
I have learned that stress
affects how much you eat a day.

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:37.656
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes stress could
give you some type of body pain.

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:41.336
&gt;&gt;Student: One thing I learned is that I
should be able to feel good about myself

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:42.886
in order to prevent stress.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.316
I believe that I haven't felt good
about myself for such a long time,

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:51.206
that I think that it
is a problem for me.

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:54.186
&gt;&gt;Marcus: As social workers,
we also are given the autonomy

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:56.276
to address the specific
needs of our students.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:00.156
If I had come in class today prepared
to do an activity regarding stress,

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.316
but there had been some community
violence issues that arose last night,

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.066
then that's what we would
focus on for that class period.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:09.496
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Many of you all know
that I had a brother that passed

00:04:09.496 --> 00:04:12.386
in February, due to gun violence.

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:14.026
I had to make a decision.

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:19.056
Do I make this anger
constructive or destructive?

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:24.456
&gt;&gt;By facing these issues that many of
them try to suppress, w bring them face

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:28.706
to face with them so that can talk about
ways to deal with these type of things.

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:31.636
&gt;&gt;Deveon: Constructive anger
seems like it would mean,

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:34.176
I'm so angry that this
violence is going on,

00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:35.896
so I'm going to go out here and stop it.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:39.216
It puts a passion to your heart, to
the point where you don't want to quit.

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:43.616
But destructive anger makes
you feel like, "I don't care.

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:46.336
&gt;&gt;Going to pride every
day does something for me

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:48.196
that no academic class could do.

00:04:48.316 --> 00:04:51.896
It's like a second home to come
and be able to talk about anything,

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:54.736
so I don't have to hold
things in all day long.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.546
&gt;&gt;Gregory: What is something that
angers you all about society?

00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:02.056
&gt;&gt;Student: You can't be judged
on who you are or your character.

00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:06.136
People just judge you off of your race,
your gender, the community you live in.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.866
&gt;&gt;Student: When a person tries to
change their gender, they're treated

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:10.816
like a monster, that's my thing.

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:14.746
&gt;&gt;Deveon: If I get angry, I
can just think of pride class

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:18.706
and Mr. Sashington's words,
and it may calm me down.

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:22.476
&gt;&gt;Lionel: If we really care about
academic development, we have to care

00:05:22.476 --> 00:05:24.106
about social and emotional development.

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:25.566
You can't have one without the other.

00:05:25.786 --> 00:05:28.136
Our students, through our pride
program and through the fact

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:32.616
that we provide them with those non-cog
skill development, they're able to apply

00:05:32.616 --> 00:05:35.386
to college and be accepted, and then
once they get there, they persist.

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.336
&gt;&gt;Student: There's no limits
to how many things you could do

00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:39.956
if somebody is believing in you.

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:40.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Thank you.

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:41.956
So when you have that
support system, right?

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:42.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.
