00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.680
I mentioned in the
last several videos

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.210
that the coefficient of kinetic
friction tends to be less,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.280
sometimes it'll be
roughly equal to,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.080
the coefficient of
static friction.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.970
But this might lead
you to-- at least,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.470
a question that
I've had in my mind,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.760
and I still have to
some degree-- is why?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.680
Why is the coefficient of
kinetic friction lower?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.930
Or why can it be lower?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.842
And the current best theory--
one I can visualize in my head,

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.550
and based on the
reading that I've done--

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.850
is the difference between-- so
let's think about it this way.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.450
So if we look at it at a kind
of a regular human level,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.620
maybe we have a block.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.390
So this is the static case.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.570
So let's think about
the static case.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.110
Let me draw it like this.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.010
So I'll draw the
static case over here.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.780
So I have a block that
is stationary on top

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.480
of-- let me do the surface
in a different color-- on top

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.300
of some type of surface
right over here.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.220
And over here, I'm going
to have a block moving

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.120
at a constant velocity
relative to some surface,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.090
relative to the same surface.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.710
And so let me draw it out.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.145
So this is moving at
some constant velocity.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.730
And so the
interesting thing here

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.760
is, assuming that these are
the same masses, that these are

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.940
the same surfaces,
is, why should

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.950
the coefficient of
friction here-- why

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.262
should the coefficient of static
friction-- so here, since this

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:31.720
is stationary,
what's under play is

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.178
the coefficient of
static friction.

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:36.180
Why should that be larger
than the coefficient

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.945
of kinetic friction over here?

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:39.820
Why should that be large
than the coefficient

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.880
of kinetic friction?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.660
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.520
you would need to apply
more force to overcome

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
the static friction here, and
start to get this accelerating,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.120
than you would need to
apply to get this already

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.700
moving body to accelerate.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.631
Because there would be kind of
a less of a responsive friction

00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:01.130
force.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.260
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.090
So what I'm going to do is
zoom in into the atomic level.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.190
And so when you zoom
in to the atomic level,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.920
almost nothing is
completely smooth.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.420
So the surface over here might
look something like this.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.820
So I'm going to draw the
molecules that make up

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.410
the surface, the
best to my ability.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.930
So the molecules, when
you zoom up really close

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.510
for the surface, might
look something like this.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.940
So we're really zooming
into the atomic level,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.150
unimaginably small level.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.820
Much smaller than
that box I just drew.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.361
But I'm just trying
to look at what's

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:42.570
happening with the atoms
where they contact,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.070
or the molecules
where they contact?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.575
And the box's molecules might
look something like this.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.360
They aren't completely smooth.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.340
And hopefully this
video also emphasizes

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.800
that all of these forces and
all of this contact that we're

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.470
talking about in these
videos-- and it's actually

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.330
interesting
philosophically-- nothing

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.780
is ever really in
contact with each other.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.730
You really just have atoms
that are repulsing each other,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.100
because their electrons
the electromagnetic force

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.070
of repulsion between
them is not allowing

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.810
them to get any closer together.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.055
So that's all-- when
you push something,

00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:26.269
it's just the electrons in your
hand pushing on the electron--

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.810
or the electronic clouds in your
hand pushing on the electron

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.700
clouds of, say, the
pen you're holding,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.710
or the key on your
keyboard, or the mug,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.260
so that it repulses
it and causes

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.740
it to go in the other direction.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.010
So there's never
any of this thing

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.450
like, what we imagine in
our heads, real contact.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.780
And if you really want
to blow your mind--

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.530
and watch the chemistry
videos if you want

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.056
understand this-- is
that most of these atoms

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:53.555
are actually free
spaced themselves.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:58.180
That the electron
cloud-- or I guess

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.670
where most of the probability
of finding the electron--

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.590
is huge compared to the
size of the electron,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.120
or the size of the nucleus.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.460
So it's kind of just a
lot of free space pushing

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.220
on a lot of other free space
through the electromagnetic

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.780
force.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.270
But anyway, we're talking
about friction here.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.660
So if you were to really zoom
in here, when this thing is

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.040
stationary, the surfaces
aren't actually even.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.890
And so you could imagine that
these molecules that you have,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.790
sometimes when it's
sitting stationary,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.810
they might be kind of
fit into each other.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.810
They've kind of slid in to
maybe these little ruts here

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.690
and there.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.920
And so if you're trying
to move this object,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.680
if you're trying to accelerate
it to the left with some force,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.210
you have to overcome,
essentially,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.800
either-- for example,
this part right over here

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.710
either has to somehow break
off, or the whole thing

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.170
has to be shifted up a couple
of atoms or a couple molecules.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.280
Or maybe, this part over
here has to be broken off,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.460
or has to be shifted
down one atom-- you

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.990
wouldn't notice these things.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.072
You wouldn't notice the
shifting of a block,

00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:58.280
or the shifting of the floor.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.370
You wouldn't notice it by
the width of a molecule,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.829
or diameter of an
atom or molecule.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:05.119
But that's essentially what
you're going to have to do.

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:06.930
Or you have to rip
them off entirely

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.830
in order to start
this thing moving.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.580
Once something is
already moving--

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.270
and this is at least
how I think about it--

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.200
it doesn't have a chance to
settle into these little ruts.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.630
So let me draw something
that's already moving.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.560
And I'll try to draw
a similar surface.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.530
So I'm trying to
draw the surface that

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.460
looks, essentially, just
like the one I drew.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.310
So maybe it looks like that.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.040
This is supposed to
be the same surface.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.620
But once it's moving, it's not
sitting in these ruts anymore.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.710
The whole thing is moving.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.110
So it's kind of
sliding across the top.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.730
And so now it might look
something like this.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.040
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.680
Maybe this has been
shifted up a little bit

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.420
so that it could start sliding.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.490
You've overcame the
static friction.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:09.000
So now it is-- I'm trying to
draw the same surface here,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.160
give or take-- so
now it's moving.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.570
It doesn't have a chance
to really settle in.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.010
It has to kind of
bounce along the top.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.820
And so that's the
best understanding.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.341
And so the real force
of the friction here,

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.590
as it's moving along it still
might every now and then

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.510
bounce into a little
ruts here and there.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.320
But you also have any type
of chemical bonds that

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.710
form between the
atoms temporarily

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.660
that keep breaking and forming.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.350
And in order to keep this
thing, I guess, moving,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.730
or especially if you
want to accelerate it,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.870
you're going to have to
keep breaking these bonds.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.580
And so that's essentially
the force of friction

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.680
that you're overcoming.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.450
Here you might have
those same bonds.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.230
And not only do you
have the same bonds,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.060
but you also have to
overcome these ruts,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.050
or these little ragged
parts that have a time

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.960
to settle in to
these little nooks

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.725
that you have to
overcome even more.

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:04.725
So that's the intuition.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.620
And you know this is actually
still an area of research.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.287
So it's not like this
cut and dry thing.

00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:11.036
And it's a fun thing
to think about what's

00:07:11.036 --> 00:07:12.320
happening at the atomic level.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.240
But this is the
general intuition

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.440
of why the coefficient
of static friction

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.640
is higher than the coefficient
of kinetic friction.
