00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.253
- With Dr. Chambers and Elizabeth Grigsby.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.490
Liz has been to our
conference a number of times,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.633
but for those of you who have not met her,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.448
she is, uh...

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:28.448
Works at the Golden Gate
Regional Center as an advocate.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:33.580
She's also got a great
voice for civil rights,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.478
and she's gonna talk to
us a little bit today

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:40.570
about some of her...

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.973
life as an adult woman
living with cerebral palsy.

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:48.235
- [Dr. Chambers] You okay?

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.302
- Yeah.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:53.385
Good morning.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:57.090
- [Audience] Good morning.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.653
- At least I think it's still morning.

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:05.140
(light laughter in audience)

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.850
Like Gerry said, my name is Elizabeth.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.850
I work for Golden Gate
Regional Center as an advocate.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.011
Yes, I get paid to work there.

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.296
(light laughter in audience)

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:29.296
Yes, I do have cerebral palsy from birth.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.409
It's never a dull moment.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.561
(audience laughs)

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:42.561
I do live in my own place.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.030
And I don't have 24-hour support,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.973
because I don't need it.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.072
And I don't want it.

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:57.800
(light laughter in audience)

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.735
People get on my nerves.

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:02.647
(audience laughs)

00:02:02.647 --> 00:02:06.552
I'd rather be around my two cats.

00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:08.991
(light laughter in audience)

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.905
They don't talk back.

00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.738
(audience laughs)

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.096
Hopefully Dr. Chambers will
ask me a bunch of questions

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:22.550
(Dr. Chambers laughs)

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.533
about how it is living with CP.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.060
- Yeah, so what would you say
your biggest challenges were

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.060
going from high school to
your post high school years?

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.240
- Well, I know my biggest challenge

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.320
from elementary up to high school.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.410
- Okay, there was a big
problem at that point?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.331
- The biggest problem was I have,

00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:59.331
I didn't get the physical
therapy that I needed.

00:03:00.028 --> 00:03:04.427
I heard some people talk about CCS,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.580
and the videos look really good.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.163
But I'm like, what the
hell happened to me?

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.223
(scattered laughter)

00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:23.600
I can tell you what happened to me.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.823
My foster mother didn't want me to get

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:31.823
the physical help that I
needed, because she was afraid

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:38.374
the more independent I became,
I wouldn't need her anymore,

00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:44.970
which was pretty messed up.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.830
Because I think I would've...

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.214
went a long way physically if I had got

00:03:56.214 --> 00:04:01.214
the physical therapy when I was little,

00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:06.643
but neither here or there.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.960
- [Gerry] So I think you're
bringing up a really good point,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.358
Liz, that we all have to
keep in mind that people have

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.354
very different lives, when
we see them outside of,

00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:19.416
in their home, and in their everyday life,

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:23.360
and some people have much
more support than others.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.360
- By the way, this is my
primary nurse practitioner,

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:33.147
which I love.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:36.827
- [Gerry] (laughs) She
says that every year, yeah.

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:38.290
(audience laughs)

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.350
- That's why she gets to come back.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.164
- That's why we ask her back, all right.

00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:42.600
(audience laughs)

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.331
- And she doesn't even pay me to say that.

00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.164
(audience laughs)

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.260
- That's a good question.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.073
So you're working as a consultant.

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:56.242
What do you do for
people whose parents have

00:04:56.242 --> 00:05:00.330
different ideas, parents
or the clients themselves,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.230
have a different idea than what you think

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.910
is the right thing for them?

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.910
- Parents are, I love
you guys who are parents.

00:05:09.378 --> 00:05:13.850
You guys are really awesome.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.410
But parents with people with disabilities,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.410
I do have to be honest,
you are a thorn in my side.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.530
(audience laughs)

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.530
Because you're all like,
"My son can't do this."

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.817
Or, "My daughter can't do this

00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:39.220
"because they have a disability."

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.223
I'm here to say that's BS.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.259
The only disability is that
you don't want to let them go.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.916
You don't want to let
them fall and get back up,

00:05:56.916 --> 00:06:01.916
and fall again, and it's like I'm scared.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.502
But what's gonna happen
when you pass away?

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:13.502
You hold on to them really tight,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.340
they're not gonna know how
to make it on their own.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.340
So I'm here to tell you
if you're in Golden Gate

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:29.439
Regional Center's kids main
area, don't let me hear about

00:06:33.277 --> 00:06:38.277
your not wanting your son or
daughter becoming independent,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.872
'cause you're gonna have hell to pay,

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:46.133
(audience laughs)

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:50.152
which you're gonna have to deal with me.

00:06:50.152 --> 00:06:52.360
(audience laughs)

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.360
And don't let the wheelchair
fool you, I'm not that nice.

00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:01.572
(audience laughs)

00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:04.033
- [Gerry] I told you she had a voice.

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:06.660
- Let me ask you a question, though,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.320
because this is a serious
one because it happens to me

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.836
every day, and also for
our CCS people here.

00:07:10.836 --> 00:07:12.730
What about the families
that say I would like

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.100
to have therapy not five days a week,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.053
but could we do it twice a day?

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:20.940
And that's a real, that's a real problem.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.005
Especially when we have less resources,

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:26.160
and also, is that bad?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.040
Is it bad to have that much extra work?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.040
- You know, there is something
coming up in California

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.483
called self-determination.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.350
And a person who doesn't
like the traditional services

00:07:50.014 --> 00:07:55.014
from the regional center, they can sign up

00:07:55.568 --> 00:08:00.568
for self-determination,
and they will be allotted

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.800
some money where they
can buy into services

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:13.009
that the regional center is
not able or willing to pay.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.720
I'm gonna just keep it real.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.429
I love working for the regional center,

00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:28.429
but sometimes we get
into this bureaucracy,

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:35.364
and we always say we can't
do this, or can't do that.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.610
I'm sick of hearing the word can't.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.610
It's time to start saying
we can, and we will.

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:48.845
'Cause that's a...

00:08:48.845 --> 00:08:51.674
(applause)

00:08:51.674 --> 00:08:54.773
that's a basic human right.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.196
- [Gerry] And I'll just
say also, it's good to have

00:08:59.196 --> 00:09:01.796
advocates and people
who can help negotiate,

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:05.082
and there are some stark realities
that we have to deal with

00:09:05.082 --> 00:09:09.160
in terms of resources,
but that is a good point.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.160
- I've been an advocate for
myself pretty much all my life.

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:22.081
I had to prove myself
to non-disabled people

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.900
on an every day basis.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.240
Hell, I'm still doing it.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.330
Do you know how tiring that gets?

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.570
That gets really tiring.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.570
When I go see Gerry,
and I love her office,

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:49.367
but sometimes the people
there talk to me like I'm,

00:09:51.843 --> 00:09:55.950
like I'm stupid or something.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.077
They're like, either
they talk really loud,

00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:04.323
or very babyish, and they're like,

00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:08.731
"Can you stretch your arm out?!"

00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.070
(audience laughs)

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.070
And I'm like, "I could, if
you stop yelling in my ear."

00:10:15.612 --> 00:10:17.604
(audience laughs)

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:22.604
Or even when I'm working
at the regional center,

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.413
and I've been working
there for over 21 years,

00:10:31.182 --> 00:10:36.182
and I still get from
some of my co-workers,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.310
like the other day, this
social worker was like,

00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:49.137
"Liz, Elizabeth, where's your nurse?"

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.437
And I'm like, "I don't have a nurse."

00:10:54.797 --> 00:10:59.092
"Sure you do, where's
the lady that's with you

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.787
three days a week?"

00:11:01.787 --> 00:11:04.352
"You mean my job coach?"

00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:09.352
"But I thought, I could've
sworn you had a nurse."

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.360
And I'm like, that's
the problem with people,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.190
they always assume.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.163
Don't assume.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.330
It makes you look stupid.

00:11:24.314 --> 00:11:25.890
(audience laughs)

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.890
I'm sorry, it makes
you look really stupid.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.080
And I get tired of educating you.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:40.080
It's like, do I really have
a disability, or do you?

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:43.519
(laughter and applause)

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.870
- We could keep asking
questions, but y'all are here

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.220
for this, any questions
that you'd like to ask Liz?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.220
- The biggest disability
is people's attitude.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.250
That's what makes, I
suffer from depression.

00:12:06.152 --> 00:12:11.152
Like Dr. Chambers was saying earlier...

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.950
A lot of us have depression.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.260
I'm just keeping it real.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.083
You know why we have depression?

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.370
'Cause nine times out of
ten, people aren't seeing us

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:35.020
for regular people.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.507
They want to see us as disabled bodies.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.487
We didn't wake up one morning and say,

00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:50.187
"Oh, I love having CP.

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:53.894
"Oh, I love having down syndrome,"

00:12:53.894 --> 00:12:58.590
or whatever your disability may be,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.487
but if people's attitude
make you feel like

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:09.825
you've done something wrong,
it's time to change that.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:17.225
'Cause like Dr. Chambers says, again,

00:13:17.225 --> 00:13:21.222
we're all gonna be
disabled, whether you want

00:13:21.222 --> 00:13:24.140
to face it or not.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.517
You're able bodied now, but you won't be

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.267
in a couple of years.

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:33.517
So take heed of that.

00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:37.426
- Sounds like a threat, is that a threat?

00:13:37.426 --> 00:13:39.351
(audience laughs)

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:43.416
- Hey, I need to travel
around with you, Dr. Chambers.

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:48.416
Both of us together, we
would be very lethal.

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.262
(loud laughter)

00:13:54.535 --> 00:13:56.759
- Can I be Mel Gibson?

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:59.880
(light laughter)

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.340
- I would love to give up my
job and just travel with you,

00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:08.073
and talk to stupid people.

00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:11.756
(audience laughs)

00:14:17.312 --> 00:14:19.259
- [Audience Member 1] I have a question.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:23.597
I noticed your reaction to
Dr. Chamber's comment about

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:26.643
transportation being a problem.

00:14:26.643 --> 00:14:28.027
- Oh yeah.

00:14:28.027 --> 00:14:32.561
- [Audience Member 1] So tell
us what are the worst parts

00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.860
of the transportation problems.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.340
- So, let me ask the question
again for the other people.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.672
So what are the worst parts
that you've encountered

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.990
with the transportation
problems, I would assume,

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.130
in San Francisco?

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.130
- You know what the worst
part is about transportation?

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.667
When I have a doctor's appointment,

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:58.667
and I'm waiting for my van...

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:05.180
and Gerry is so patient,
but I'm not that patient.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.276
I'm like, "Where the hell is the van?"

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.520
(audience laughs)

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.520
And when they get there,
they act like it's your fault

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:21.747
that they're late, and
they're always like,

00:15:21.747 --> 00:15:23.160
"Get on the van."

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.043
I'm like, I have a disability.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.230
You can't rush somebody with CP.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:39.590
We have spasms, and if my hand goes wild,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.700
the control goes wild, and
if the control goes wild,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.919
I'm gonna end up running you over.

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:53.551
(audience laughs)

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:57.107
Well, maybe I'll run you over just because

00:15:57.107 --> 00:15:59.146
(loud laughter in audience)

00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:03.781
you deserve it, and you
annoy the hell out of me.

00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:08.310
And that doesn't have
nothing to do with my CP.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:15.330
I love how people tell me,
"Oh honey, it's just your CP."

00:16:17.613 --> 00:16:22.613
It's like, not everything
that's wrong with me is my CP.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.100
You're my problem, and
you're not part of my CP.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.973
(audience laughs)

00:16:33.973 --> 00:16:35.830
So what do you think about that?

00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:39.770
- [Gerry] So part of the
reality that I think, too,

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.429
is there are lots of
medical issues to deal with,

00:16:43.429 --> 00:16:47.122
and transportation can,
there's a number of things,

00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.400
transportation can be an issue.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.280
Getting an appointment with
a specialist can be an issue.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.450
- Getting on the table
to have a pap smear.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.080
- [Gerry] Getting on the
table, even though I have

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.950
an adjustable table, getting on the table

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.330
was quite a chore this year, wasn't it?

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:08.330
- Yeah, just a couple weeks
ago, we got the Hoyer Lift.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.803
I miss the lifting.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.930
I'm very mad at UC for
getting rid of the lifting.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.470
Not only was it fast and strong
to have two guys lift me,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.121
but they were cute too, you know.

00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:34.361
(loud laughter)

00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:39.361
I'm just like, they just
ruined my whole day.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:43.752
(audience laughs)

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:47.669
But having the Hoyer
Lift, so I get strapped up

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.810
to the Hoyer Lift, fine.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.810
We go out in the hall, I get
hooked up to the Hoyer Lift,

00:17:58.622 --> 00:18:03.622
finally after these two people
figured out how to use it.

00:18:07.979 --> 00:18:12.979
So I get hooked up, I'm like, "Okay we're,

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:16.869
"we're cooking with gas now."

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.771
(light laughter in audience)

00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:23.327
They go press the button to lift me up.

00:18:25.257 --> 00:18:28.763
The damn thing stops.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:34.690
I'm in mid-air, and they're
like, "Oh, the battery died."

00:18:36.797 --> 00:18:39.333
(audience laughs)

00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:40.682
What the feh?

00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:43.320
(loud laughter in audience)

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.766
- [Gerry] We'll try to bleep,
can we bleep that out, John?

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.834
(laughs loudly)

00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:51.010
- You can't make this stuff up!

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.878
Even if I try, I'm looking at Gerry,

00:18:55.878 --> 00:18:58.420
she's looking at me.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.240
I'm looking at one of
my staff, I'm like...

00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:05.990
"Okay."

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.907
(loud laughter in audience)

00:19:08.907 --> 00:19:11.787
I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm cool.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.209
And they're like, "Oh,
don't worry, we just

00:19:17.209 --> 00:19:22.209
"have to run across the street
and get another battery."

00:19:25.023 --> 00:19:29.566
I'm like, "Oh, don't mind me."

00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:30.827
(audience laughs)

00:19:30.827 --> 00:19:34.470
"I'll just hang here,
like I have a choice."

00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:40.247
(audience laughs)

00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:45.247
"But don't mind me, I love
having my hips separated.

00:19:47.865 --> 00:19:52.865
"Even though one of them
happens to be dislocated,

00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:59.125
"but I'm happy to be hanging up here.

00:19:59.247 --> 00:20:03.938
"You just go and take
your slow, sweet time."

00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:05.447
(audience laughs)

00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:07.187
"I'm not going nowhere."

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.220
- [Gerry] It was the longest
pap smear that I've done

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.030
in my history of, uh--

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:21.030
- No the longest pap smear you did is when

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.440
one of my staff fainted.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.904
- [Gerry] Yes, that was, uh.

00:20:25.904 --> 00:20:27.700
(audience laughs)

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.975
Yep, right, I forgot about that.

00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:34.190
Yep, (chuckling) we've
had some really good

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.513
experiences over the years.

00:20:35.513 --> 00:20:36.346
(audience laughs)

00:20:36.346 --> 00:20:38.720
So you can see why we
attract so many people

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.783
to go into primary care.

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:40.616
(laughs)

00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:42.790
- I know you probably don't believe that.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.880
- [Gerry] It's true!

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.819
- But yeah, she was holding my leg up.

00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:51.819
Gerry was doing her thing,
and the next thing you know,

00:20:52.754 --> 00:20:57.754
she's about to fall on the floor.

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:59.689
Gerry had to catch her...

00:20:59.689 --> 00:21:02.212
(laughter in audience)

00:21:02.212 --> 00:21:04.683
and ease her down.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.920
And then Gerry called the,
called the, the ambulance.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:16.928
They came, and they're
banging on the door,

00:21:16.928 --> 00:21:20.538
and Gerry said, "You can't come in."

00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:22.840
(loud laughter)

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.540
- [Gerry] We just dragged
her out and put her,

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.959
no, we didn't do it.

00:21:25.959 --> 00:21:27.720
(audience laughs)

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.370
- And they're like, "What do
you mean we can't come in?"

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.164
'Cause I have my pants down!

00:21:35.164 --> 00:21:36.755
(audience laughs)

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.005
I'm indisposed!

00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:45.758
And they're all like, they
thought I was the patient.

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:47.753
No, no, no!

00:21:47.753 --> 00:21:52.753
I didn't faint, one of my staff did.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.650
Because, why?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.130
She didn't eat all day that day.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.978
How stupid can you get.

00:22:04.978 --> 00:22:07.668
(audience laughs)

00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:10.634
And they say I have a disability.

00:22:10.634 --> 00:22:12.860
(audience laughs)

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.464
You don't know how it is being in a chair,

00:22:17.464 --> 00:22:22.464
having to depend on people
for everyday, basic needs.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:27.560
It's...

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.580
It's crazy.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.303
Does anybody have any questions?

00:22:33.303 --> 00:22:35.210
(audience laughs)

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.170
- [Gerry] Can I first say,
I did get endocervical cells

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.354
on the pap smear, though,
despite that being two hours?

00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:42.420
Okay?

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.378
- Well, that's because
you're one hell of a--

00:22:45.378 --> 00:22:48.423
- [Gerry] (laughs)

00:22:48.423 --> 00:22:50.500
I'm persistent, if nothing else.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.550
- Yes.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.508
- Nevertheless.

00:22:52.508 --> 00:22:53.770
- [Audience Member 2] Hi, Liz.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.811
- Hi. I know you, you're my co-worker.

00:22:57.811 --> 00:23:00.453
- [Audience Member 2] I wanted
you to touch a little bit

00:23:00.453 --> 00:23:03.441
on what reactions you
get when you tell people

00:23:03.441 --> 00:23:06.024
that you enjoy having alcohol--

00:23:07.114 --> 00:23:11.114
(bursts of air into microphone)

00:23:13.865 --> 00:23:18.865
- So the question was,
how do you tell people

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.670
or what reaction do you
get when you tell people

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.972
that you are a person...

00:23:24.972 --> 00:23:26.505
(light laughter in audience)

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.090
essentially, who likes to have fun,

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.040
go out on dates, have a life?

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.917
- I can answer that question.

00:23:34.917 --> 00:23:39.917
It amazes people when
I tell them that people

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.370
with disabilities can have sex.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.920
They're all like, "Oh my god, but how?"

00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:51.830
(audience laughs)

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.004
I'm like, do you really want me to...

00:23:56.004 --> 00:23:58.467
(audience laughs)

00:23:58.467 --> 00:24:01.140
explain it to you?

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.303
I mean, I can.

00:24:04.303 --> 00:24:09.303
We can have a full hour
conversation how it works.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.732
One gets on top of the other one.

00:24:13.732 --> 00:24:15.847
(audience laughs)

00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:19.347
And then, you know, we take it from there.

00:24:20.462 --> 00:24:25.462
But when I do drink, yes I drink,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.480
I used to drink to hide my pain.

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:35.440
I'll admit it.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.710
I was a drinker to hide my depression.

00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:46.147
But I have, I've been seeing
a therapist for a while now.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.820
And it's been, it's really helpful.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.942
I'd recommend everybody
to see a therapist.

00:24:57.942 --> 00:25:02.942
Even if you don't have a
depression or whatever.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.310
We all need somebody to talk to.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.720
Let's keep it real.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.720
But when I go out to clubs...

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:20.810
Well, I don't go as much as
I used to, but when I drank,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.120
people were like, "But, but you have CP."

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.510
And I'm like, "Yeah, but
you know, the alcohol

00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:34.486
"relaxes my muscles."

00:25:34.486 --> 00:25:37.673
So, it does really.

00:25:39.001 --> 00:25:41.059
I'm not kidding.

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:43.738
I don't abuse it no more.

00:25:43.738 --> 00:25:48.738
But it does relax my
muscles, and I tend to drive

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.071
my chair much better...

00:25:53.071 --> 00:25:55.349
(audience laughs)

00:25:55.349 --> 00:25:59.185
when I'm a little bit intoxicated.

00:25:59.185 --> 00:26:01.530
(Gerry laughs loudly)
(audience laughs)

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.568
- At least you think you do.

00:26:02.568 --> 00:26:05.214
- [Gerry] (laughing) Yeah!

00:26:05.214 --> 00:26:09.070
- Well, I think I do very good.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.400
I know how to parallel park
like nobody's business.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.080
(audience laughs)

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.763
- Somehow, I get better looking.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.807
I think that's a really important point,

00:26:21.807 --> 00:26:23.680
and it's not just in adults.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.412
You have to start asking your 13 year olds

00:26:26.412 --> 00:26:30.587
if they drink alcohol, and
it's one of those things

00:26:30.587 --> 00:26:33.506
you can't do in front of the parents.

00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:37.500
And there's a certain
point, I and one of my other

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.663
physiatrists, we ask the parents to leave.

00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:42.476
And about 13 year olds, and
we ask them those questions

00:26:42.476 --> 00:26:47.476
about alcohol, drugs, other
behavior, sex behaviors

00:26:48.282 --> 00:26:51.970
that might need contraceptive
or even be tested.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.460
So those are things that, it's hard to do.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.530
And parents, like you
said, parents do not want

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.043
to be out of the room.

00:26:59.043 --> 00:27:01.500
And sometimes there are
some communication problems,

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.042
but usually these are
the kids that are maybe

00:27:05.042 --> 00:27:09.578
ambulatory kids who you
think are doing really well,

00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:12.406
and then when you finally
talk to them, they're doing,

00:27:12.406 --> 00:27:15.642
"Oh yeah, I drink every
Saturday," or something like that.

00:27:15.642 --> 00:27:17.803
Or "I do a lot of marijuana."

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:19.510
That's the biggest one that I've seen now.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:24.090
Even before it became legal,
there were a lot of kids

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.579
that would use a lot of
marijuana as a relaxant

00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:33.579
and also just like any
other teenager, I guess.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.553
- Doctor, can I ask you a question?

00:27:37.553 --> 00:27:38.386
- Sure.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.123
- So you said, if I understand correctly,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:50.670
you said CP does change
over the years, right?

00:27:52.306 --> 00:27:56.170
'Cause when I was younger...

00:27:58.563 --> 00:28:03.563
I must've been around 10, maybe nine,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.563
the doctor I would see was like,

00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:14.277
"CP is never gonna change,
you're gonna maintain

00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:19.277
"your mobility, don't worry about it."

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.519
And the older I got, I was like,

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:27.519
I can't turn over like I used to.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.847
What does he mean it's never gonna change?

00:28:31.847 --> 00:28:36.847
So I kept getting tighter, my muscles,

00:28:38.834 --> 00:28:43.834
and I was just like,
the doctor lied to me.

00:28:47.777 --> 00:28:52.777
And that brought on my depression, too.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.820
Because here, this doctor's telling me,

00:28:59.857 --> 00:29:04.467
"Oh you don't have to worry
about it, it's never gonna,

00:29:04.467 --> 00:29:07.280
"it's not gonna get any worse."

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.603
- Yeah, I think what most
people are, just maybe,

00:29:11.603 --> 00:29:15.116
they misinterpret, is that
the brain problem, the lesion

00:29:15.116 --> 00:29:18.620
that you had when you were
born, shouldn't change.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.670
I think it changes a little bit,

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.210
but it shouldn't change much.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.925
But the outward
manifestations, the tightness,

00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:29.499
the motor problems, the hips coming out,

00:29:29.499 --> 00:29:31.249
that all gets worse.

00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:36.249
- Yeah, my left hip, they
put it in a bunch of times,

00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:41.570
and it always comes back out.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.845
So I was like I'm done, no more surgeries,

00:29:45.845 --> 00:29:48.856
I'll just keep it like it is.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:49.743
- Yeah.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:55.453
- And yes, it does hurt a lot.

00:29:56.758 --> 00:30:01.758
When I, especially when
I'm in my shower chair.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:08.156
And I take, I want to take long
showers to relax my muscles,

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:20.060
but then I can't sit that
long, because my leg goes numb

00:30:22.723 --> 00:30:27.723
and my hips start to hurt really bad.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.293
- Yeah.

00:30:31.551 --> 00:30:35.322
- Somebody has a question.

00:30:35.322 --> 00:30:37.130
- Yeah, one last question.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.920
- [Gerry] One or two more
questions, and then we're,

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.783
gotta wrap up.

00:30:41.112 --> 00:30:43.198
- [Audience Member 3] I'm a
pediatrician in a rural area,

00:30:43.198 --> 00:30:46.460
and my question is, and
our nearest rural center

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.740
is three-and-a-half hours
away, would you rather

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.232
have a well-meaning and willing to

00:30:51.232 --> 00:30:52.891
(breathing in microphone)

00:30:52.891 --> 00:30:56.850
as your primary care,
and most of your care,

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.970
or would you rather take
the three-and-a-half hour

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.103
car ride to see a specialist?

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.117
- So the question is, if you
were living in a rural area

00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:11.880
where this pediatrician's
living, would you rather

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.139
have a well-meaning doctor
who's gonna try to do

00:31:14.139 --> 00:31:17.300
everything they can for
you, or would you rather

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.904
take the three-and-a-half
hour drive to see

00:31:18.904 --> 00:31:22.221
some specialist who might
know a little bit more

00:31:22.221 --> 00:31:24.423
about the problem?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.880
With all the transportation issues.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.227
- I'd rather see the one person...

00:31:36.053 --> 00:31:41.053
than have a longer time
to have to sit on the van,

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.140
not knowing when I'm gonna get there,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.140
and when I do get there,
no problems, the doctor,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.280
but they might not have
the time to see me.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.660
So I'd rather, I'd rather, um...

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.398
try my luck with the
doctor who doesn't know

00:32:06.398 --> 00:32:11.398
as much about CP, and we
figure it out together, than...

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:21.550
'Cause if people would
listen, that's the thing.

00:32:26.061 --> 00:32:31.061
Doctors need to listen
more to their patient.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:38.210
If people will listen, the
person with the disability

00:32:40.513 --> 00:32:45.039
can tell you how they're
feeling, or what their

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:48.280
physical needs are.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.280
You just need to take
the time and stop asking

00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:00.060
the person that they're with,
like they're not the patient.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.990
- [Gerry] Great, thank you so much, Liz,

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.432
for being with us today, and Dr. Chambers.

00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:11.682
(applause)
