JJ BEHRENS: Are we ready?

00:00:04.528 --> 00:00:04.966
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yeah.

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.280
JEFFREY POSNICK: Hey, JJ.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.640
JJ BEHRENS: Come again.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.960
Let's get started.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.890
OK, welcome to the next
installment of Hangouts on Air

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.440
for YouTube APIs.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.970
I'm JJ Behrens.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.290
We have Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.160
Jarek is a mild-mannered
developer relations guy by

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.270
day, hardcore Android
hacker by night.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.420
And then there's Jeffrey
Posnick.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.280
Can you wave, Jeffrey?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.900
What can I say about Jeffrey?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.150
Can I say that he's an eccentric
billionaire taking

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.010
gymnastics lessons who keeps
vowing to rid the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.610
world of all evil?

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.910
Probably not.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.230
I mean, that's Sergey Brin.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.510
But I will say that when I see
him and Sergey Brin hanging

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.040
out together, they refer
to each other

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.950
as Batman and Robin.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
And we also have Neal
Norwitz with us.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.740
Neal Norwitz.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.170
Man, I had to tackle, like,
three bodyguards to get this

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.090
guy out of the middle
of the Plex.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.720
So senior software engineer.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.560
He used to work on search, and
now he works on YouTube.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.830
And then we have a guest today,
Adrian Holovaty, who is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.040
famous on the Django project.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.320
Pretty awesome.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.460
Adrian, what do you have
to say for us today?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.520
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Hey, I'm just
hacking on a YouTube API for a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.500
little side project.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.710
So I just wanted to ask
a couple of questions

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.330
and see what's up.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sweet.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.460
Cool.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.760
Hey JJ, I heard you were hiding
in the Googleplex all

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.200
day yesterday.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.390
What were you up to?

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.600
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, man,
that was rough.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.540
So I had to video two 45-minute
long tutorials, and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.110
it actually took eight
and a half hours.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.010
I've never done so many
takes in my life.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.850
I mean, I thought I was going
to grow up to be a software

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.570
engineer, and instead I grew
up to be an actor.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.270
But I'm super psyched.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.430
We're going to release these
at Google AdWords slightly

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.150
before Google I/O, and
I think they're going

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.810
to be pretty awesome.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool,
well, what are

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.530
they going to be about?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.840
JJ BEHRENS: The first one is
YouTube For Your Business, and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.530
then the second one is Using
Ruby on Rails and YouTube APIs

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.770
For Education.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, cool.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770
JJ BEHRENS: Since I'm surrounded
by Python, guys,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.060
that's going to be a little of a
worry, having admitted that.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.850
But it ought to be pretty
awesome, right?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.460
So let me ask you a few
questions, since I've got Neal

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.660
for, like, 10 minutes before
he gets called back into

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.490
active duty.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.120
I want to ask you a few
questions about software

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.550
development at Google and
YouTube since you've been here

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.180
for a while.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.580
And I know that people love to
talk about these kind of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.170
things, so tell me about the
programming languages that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.400
Google uses.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.700
NEAL NORWITZ: So Google has
primarily four main

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.610
programming languages that
are used very prevalently

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.030
throughout Google.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.890
Those languages are C++, Java,
Python, and JavaScript.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.490
All four of them are used for
fairly different purposes,

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.820
although there, of course,
is some overlap.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.350
Many servers are implemented
in C++ and Java.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.510
For YouTube, it's a little bit
of an exception, where the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.955
primary language is Python for
most of the development.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:05.500
Python is used throughout Google
for many scripting

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.950
environments, as far as things
used in production.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.730
When we have tools that we want
to write, very often we

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.320
script them.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.700
And of course, JavaScript is
used primarily on the client.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.030
JJ BEHRENS: Great Can you tell
me a little bit about your

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.040
development environment?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.570
I assume everyone uses
Eclipse, right?

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.770
NEAL NORWITZ: There are some
people that use Eclipse.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.130
There's more people that
don't use Eclipse.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.820
Like all the religious wars,
Google is good at them as

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.430
well, and for the editors, there
is everything from VI to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.500
eMax, to Eclipse, to IntelliJ.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.770
And to some extent, it depends a
little bit on the languages.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.552
Java certainly uses IBEs
considerably more than many of

00:03:48.552 --> 00:03:53.180
the old C and C++ hackers, as
well as Python, and so forth.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.200
JJ BEHRENS: Sweet.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.750
Great.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.950
So I heard that Jeff, the
famous, infamous Jeff that

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.630
everyone always talks about,
still codes using just a

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.640
magnetized needle and a hard
drive, is that true?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.510
NEAL NORWITZ: I think
now he's moved up.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.300
He starts using Cat to just
append to the files, and then

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.500
that way he can keep adding more
new code that works just

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.850
perfectly, flawlessly
the first time.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.170
JJ BEHRENS: Appended-only
editing, I mean, jeez, I wish

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.029
I would've taken that
class at school.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.620
So tell me about a
day in your life.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.300
What happens when you wake up?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.070
What's it like to
live at Google?

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.050
NEAL NORWITZ: So mostly I
don't live at Google.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.500
JJ BEHRENS: Sweet, I'm
glad to hear that.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.226
NEAL NORWITZ: I recently bought
a house about seven

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.210
months ago and live
in the mountains.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.640
But we spend a little bit of
time at Google, so I'm here

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.080
for about eight hours
a day now.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.260
Sometimes a little bit less,
sometimes a little bit more,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.650
depending upon what's
going on.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.940
I get in now a little bit
earlier in the morning than

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.995
many people, which gives me a
really good chance to catch up

00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:53.410
on email from the night before
and actually get some coding

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.760
done before everybody
gets in and the

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.450
email onslaught occurs.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.520
And since I switched to YouTube,
I've actually been

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.917
doing a little bit more coding
than I was doing prior when I

00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:03.860
was working the search.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.735
JJ BEHRENS: Sweet.

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:07.090
And so throughout the course of
the day, obviously you have

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.920
to deal with email.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.790
What other parts--

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.070
you get a little bit
of coding in.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.600
How's that work?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.100
NEAL NORWITZ: I'm very interrupt
driven, and so for

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.905
me I love being interrupted, and
email I can use to service

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.005
those interrupts.

00:05:23.005 --> 00:05:25.680
If I have any downtime,
I can read email.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.200
There's always lots of
threads going on.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.970
There are code reviews
going on.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.530
Code reviews are very common
throughout Google.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.360
They're a required
part of our job.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.165
So what I may intermix reading
some email with doing code

00:05:39.165 --> 00:05:41.700
reviews, intermix it with
doing some coding.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.980
I do have a few meetings here
and there, less than one a

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.150
day, though, at this point.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.610
And so sometimes, then, I have
to run to a meeting, or maybe

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.780
grabbing lunch with a friend,
which is another meeting.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.405
Or tomorrow it's breakfast
with a friend.

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:55.725
Today was breakfast with
somebody different.

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:58.550
So there's always something
going on.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.810
Since Google is very
distributed, sometimes we have

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.450
VC meetings.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.940
My meeting this morning was
through VC, similar to this.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.360
But lots of other times, they're
face to face or a

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.100
combination of face
to face and VC.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.570
JJ BEHRENS: Jarek, he says he
goes to one meeting a day.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.320
How many meetings do you have
to go to on average?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.296
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Once per day,
I get to sit down and do

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:19.130
some coding.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.500
JJ BEHRENS: That just goes to
prove that what I've been

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.650
saying all along is that
developer relations guys read

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.410
email and go to meetings
so that real

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.170
engineers don't have to.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.420
NEAL NORWITZ: Sounds
good to me.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.300
JJ BEHRENS: Google's really big
on data, and I know that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.340
we do a lot of things
with data analysis.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.360
Can you tell me how that
fits in with YouTube?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.210
NEAL NORWITZ: Certainly.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.810
YouTube is a part of Google and
similar in many respects.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.940
And data collection
is no different.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.650
We do like to be very focused
on the users, and so what we

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.817
do is we don't always know
what's going to work well for

00:06:53.817 --> 00:06:55.140
users and what isn't.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.440
So we run many different
experiments.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.950
At any given time across many
different products--

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.770
most of the products,
in fact--

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.060
we are running many experiments
that will be

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.570
making sometimes very small
changes and other times very

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.620
large changes.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.180
These changes can be visible to
you or, in the case of the

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.640
one I'm working on now, is a
pure infrastructure change,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.940
which has very little visible
component to it.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.102
We may be doing these
experiments to test stability,

00:07:21.102 --> 00:07:24.515
we may be doing them to see what
colors work better for

00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:27.830
users, when users can operate
faster, when they have less

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.850
mistakes, and so forth.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.250
So by collecting the data based
on all the different

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.240
user interactions, we can tune
the UI to do a much better job

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.870
and service users better.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.750
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.890
Pretty awesome.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.135
Now before I came to Google, I
was really, really big into

00:07:45.135 --> 00:07:46.742
code quality.

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:48.970
Well, I'm still into code
quality, but that's one of the

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.860
reasons I came to Google.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.480
I'd heard so much about the
steps that Google used to

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.930
maintain high code quality.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.800
Can you tell me about those?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.610
NEAL NORWITZ: So I already
mentioned code review.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.280
That's one of the primary
techniques that we use at

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.050
Google to improve code quality,
as well as to prevent

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.230
any sorts of problems
down the road.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.510
It also helps communicate
intent to different

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.720
developers.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.990
Some people do pair programming,
which can be very

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.750
beneficial as far as
communication goes.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.860
Many teams do not use that, but
code reviews are a way of

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.450
getting closer to that and
helping spread the knowledge

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.540
as far as across
the code base.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.830
Since we have a very large code
base, it's very important

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.160
to know many different
portions of it.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.730
In addition to code reviews,
we also have a very strong

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.539
testing culture throughout
Google.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.970
It's something that early in my
Google career I helped to

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.539
improve and make
much stronger.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.430
It's interesting, the different
perspectives that

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.740
people have as far as testing
and how it's evolved over

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.350
time, where we've attempted to
drive more people to do unit

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.960
testing so that we can, again,
find problems sooner and

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.010
prevent the problems from
ever getting to users.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.010
JJ BEHRENS: So one thing that
I've heard from a lot of

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.820
people who visit Google is
that even going to the

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.530
bathroom at Google makes you
want to be a better tester.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.970
Can you tell me about this?

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.100
NEAL NORWITZ: So this
is something

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.900
that there is a team.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.460
There is grouplets at Google.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.900
These are groups of volunteers
that are

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.230
interested in any one task.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.970
In this case, the testing
grouplet had just reformed

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.410
when I joined Google nearly
seven years ago, and we wanted

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.970
to improve testing at Google.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.710
We were trying to figure
out ways that we

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.660
could improve testing.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.050
Google has a fairly collegiate
environment, and so there were

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.890
already many posters on the
walls, but the bathrooms were

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.880
pretty bare.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.020
We figured, where can we get a
community of people that have

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.370
no other choice but to read
the material we wanted to

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.390
present to them.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.190
And so we started putting
them up in the bathroom.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.850
It was a little bit of a joke,
and again, I was talking about

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.050
experimentation earlier.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.930
This was one experiment, and
it happened to be one

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.355
experiment that was
very successful.

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:59.590
Nearly 300 episodes have been
run since we started it many

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.050
years ago, and across a
wide range of topics.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.420
And in this way, it's become
part of the Google culture,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.440
and it's helped educate
people.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.950
And we try to entertain people
at the same time, because we

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.660
don't want to make it too dry
and boring when you're already

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.630
doing a pretty mundane task.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.370
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.200
That just goes to show you that
the best way to learn how

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.450
to not core dump is
to take a dump.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.650
NEAL NORWITZ: Exactly.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.210
JJ BEHRENS: So can you tell me
about how designs get done at

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.820
Google, in terms of how do we
make sure that one rogue

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.810
engineer doesn't end
up doing something

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.460
that's not really scalable?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.540
NEAL NORWITZ: So one of the
things that we do, especially

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.080
on larger projects, is
run design reviews.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.770
So Google is fairly light on
many points of documentation,

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.740
but design docs are pretty
common throughout Google.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.660
And when bigger changes are
made, very often design docs

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.990
are requested.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.380
Out on my prior team, one of my
tasks was to run the whole

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.450
design review process, where
as teams wanted to add new

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.980
features, they would have to
create a design doc that would

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.060
explain what they
wanted to do.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.810
And we would have a meeting
where many different people

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.400
across the organization would
come together and figure out,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.240
is this going to work on
the production side?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.290
Is this going to work from
the coding side?

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.880
In the case of our team, we
maintained the infrastructure,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.350
but others were adding features
to the infrastructure

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.670
that we were maintaining.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.900
So we had to make sure that the
features were added in a

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.450
maintainable fashion.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.350
And so design reviews were,
again, a way that we could

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.700
find problems faster and before
we ever got to the code

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.690
review phase, or certainly
before we got to production.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.350
That's not to say that mistakes
haven't been made.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.495
There have definitely been some
products that have been

00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:48.240
released where they've pretty
much fallen over.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.010
Many users have experienced
that, but we strive to do

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.945
better each time and learn
from our mistakes.

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.960
So one of the other things we
do, in addition to design

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.150
reviews, the other side of the
culture that's very strong at

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.760
Google is having postmortems.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.950
So whenever there's a failure,
whenever there's a large

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.150
outage, we ask for
a postmortem.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.860
And this, again, spans many
different products and many

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.850
different projects, such
that we can try to

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.860
learn from our mistakes.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.030
There are action items
that come out.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.430
We attempt to address the action
items so that we can

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.930
prevent these same problems from
occurring in the future.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.340
JJ BEHRENS: So I think it's
pretty well known that Google

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.215
uses Linux.

00:12:26.215 --> 00:12:28.723
Now do you use Linux in your
development environment?

00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:29.116
NEAL NORWITZ: I do.

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:32.330
On a day-to-day basis, my
desktop is Linux, and for me

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.100
it's very natural, since prior
to coming to Google I've used

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.590
Linux for, I don't know, 10-plus
years at that point.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.580
So it was a great environment
for me to come here.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.250
And most developers, virtually
all developers, unless they're

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.300
specifically developing for
Windows or for Mac or

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.700
something like that, if
they're doing a client

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.760
application--

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.340
like Chrome would
be one example--

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.220
almost all developers are
using Linux for their

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.476
day-to-day development.

00:12:59.476 --> 00:13:01.500
JJ BEHRENS: Right on.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.690
So since Google is a big user
of Linux, I know that Google

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.230
kind of contributes back
to open source.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.050
Can you tell me about that?

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.200
NEAL NORWITZ: Sure.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.740
Prior to coming to Google, I
actually was involved with

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.120
several open source projects,
Python being the most well

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.490
known one, for sure.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:23.270
And once I got to Google, I
continued working on Python

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.460
for several years, actually
and was fairly well known

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.760
within the Python community.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.750
These days, I might have
a much lower profile.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.400
JJ BEHRENS: I still think
you're famous.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.930
NEAL NORWITZ: But I
still work on many

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.590
different Python tasks.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.700
Since I recently switched to
YouTube, one of the open

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.500
source projects that I've been
working on is Spitfire.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.280
And so since we use Spitfire
within YouTube, one of my jobs

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.560
has been to improve
the efficiency of

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.580
Spitfire for YouTube.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.910
And so I've been submitting
little performance

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.280
fixes here and there.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.080
One of the other tools that I
have developed in the past as

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.740
part of Google, I did a lot of
C++ work, and so I wanted to

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.590
do some lightweight
analysis of C++.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.170
This is prior to client being
a much better development

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.710
environment for C++ and
having a much richer

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.500
set of tools available.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.300
And so I just wanted to do quick
and dirty scripts, and

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.890
so I wrote a C++ parser, or
approximate parser in Python

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.460
and released this part as open
source, which is very common

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.430
throughout Google.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.500
As we have scripts that are not
the core search part of

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.010
Google, we try to get as much as
possible out into the open

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.990
source community, if nothing
else, to make it available so

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.480
that others can learn.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.860
And if we get contributions,
that's great, and certainly

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.640
helping others so that they can
innovate faster, so that

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.730
they can develop more tools
without having to develop all

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.190
the basic building blocks.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.670
JJ BEHRENS: So you said that
you're actually parsing C++

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.050
with Python?

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.900
I thought only PEARL and
Bjarne Stroupstrup were

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.780
capable of such a feat.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.110
NEAL NORWITZ: It's, like I said,
an approximate parser.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.320
It doesn't do many different
constructs, but it did do a

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.990
significant part of Google's
code base at the time.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.940
This was several years ago
now, which was many, many

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.220
lines of code.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.990
And I ran it through the whole
Google code base, and it did

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.470
90-plus percent of Google code
base [INAUDIBLE] parsed.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.940
And it just gave me an AST--
an Abstract Syntax Tree--

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.220
representation of the code
so that I could do some

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.440
transformations.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.450
One of the things that we used
for it was to find cases where

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.480
we had a base class that had
virtual methods but no virtual

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.130
destructor.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.910
If you don't know C++, this can
be very bad because the

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.860
destructor can then not
be called in certain

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.070
circumstances, and you may leak
memory, or you may do

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.630
other bad things like code
locks, in which case your

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.520
entire program will deadlock,
and that's

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.540
not such a good thing.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.340
JJ BEHRENS: Deadlock?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.200
I've never seen that.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.090
NEAL NORWITZ: No, not
in Google code.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.960
JJ BEHRENS: So you mentioned
Spitfire, and I know that

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.260
that's not as well known as
some other projects in the

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:57.870
Python world.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.570
Can you tell me what it is?

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.040
NEAL NORWITZ: Sure.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.750
It's a template engine.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.350
So it was based off of Cheetah,
which is probably a

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.690
little bit better known.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.640
But there were certain things
that YouTube, back in the day,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.420
needed out of the templating
engine, and so they wrote

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.890
their own and then open sourced

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.750
it, that being Spitfire.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.060
So Django is much more
commonly used today.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.710
Many more people know that.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.110
And it's used for certain
circumstances.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.780
But YouTube already has a very
large code base written in

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.455
Spitfire, and so in order for
us to change out of Spitfire

00:16:30.455 --> 00:16:33.125
to something else, we would need
a very large benefit that

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.620
we would gain as well.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.640
And so far we haven't been able
to determine that we can

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.960
do that much better with another
templating language,

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.770
and so we use that for pretty
much all of our HTML

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.490
generation.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.885
So we have the Python code that
fills dictionaries, and

00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:51.265
then those dictionaries
are rendered

00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:53.350
into HTML by Spitfire.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.000
JJ BEHRENS: That's funny, I
haven't heard people talk

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.350
about Cheetah very much lately,
but I remember talking

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.050
to the author, recently,
of Python.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:07.819
So a lot of people have heard
of this 20% thing at Google,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.650
and a lot of people ask me,
is this fact or fiction?

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.910
NEAL NORWITZ: For
sure, it's fact.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.109
It is very well encouraged
throughout

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.260
Google to take 20% time.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.869
Unfortunately, many people do
not, and at times I've been

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.670
guilty of this as well.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.290
The good thing is that you can
bank it, and so it's not

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.079
actually tracked.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.260
If you wanted to do 100% time
for two weeks, and not do any

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.080
20% time for a year on a 20%
project, that's just fine.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.660
If you want to do one
day a week, that

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.160
would also work well.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.100
As I said, many people don't
use it, which is a bit

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.200
unfortunate and not really
what the company wants.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.020
But it's a reality based on how
happy so many developers

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.610
here at Google are and that we
are very much entertained by

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.660
our day job and enthusiastic
about our day job that

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.600
sometimes it's hard to take a
step back and try to work on

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.740
something else.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.840
And some people just don't have
any particular ideas.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.500
I mentioned grouplets earlier.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.480
Grouplets are another way of
contributing to 20% time that

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.800
many people throughout
Google actually use.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.180
And so in order to make the
whole of Google a better

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.670
place, they invest their time
as a volunteer working on

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.900
something that is not a formal
part of Google in any way.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.130
The grouplets overall are, but
any individual grouplet may or

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.950
may not be really formalized.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.640
And they just try to get
done the tasks that

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.810
they view as important.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.390
JJ BEHRENS: Great so you
mentioned earlier you did some

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.130
stuff at Google Open Source.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.880
Was that a 20% project
at the time?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.840
NEAL NORWITZ: It was.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.320
So the project I was working on
was C++, and so I did a lot

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.695
of it in my own time, and then I
also did a fair amount of it

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:50.270
on Google time as well.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.750
And that would be all 20% time
that I worked on it.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.930
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.370
So I know that it's a little
bit strange when engineers

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.510
first come to Google, and in
the Python world, a lot of

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.770
people comment that Google is
a black hole for Python

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.350
programmers, because if you're
on event horizon close enough

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.840
to Google to get sucked in,
you'll get sucked in, and

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.620
people might not hear from
you for a little while.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.550
Why is that?

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.170
NEAL NORWITZ: The various
different reasons, like again,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.280
I mentioned earlier that people
are very enthusiastic

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.750
when they come to Google.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.420
And that enthusiasm
doesn't even wane

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.870
after many years sometimes.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.050
I've been here for nearly seven
years, and when I start

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.090
getting bored of a project,
I switch projects.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.100
I've been on three primary
projects here at Google.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.740
My most previous project I had
been offered up four and a

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.690
half years.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.460
Since that was a C++ project,
I didn't do that

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.320
much work in Python.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.815
However, now that I've gone to
YouTube, and I'm starting to

00:19:46.815 --> 00:19:49.680
do a lot more Python work again,
I'm getting more back

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.750
into the Python community and
contributing back to Spitfire

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.000
and doing some of the
things that I had

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.020
done many years ago.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.410
And so many people, if they've
been at Google long enough,

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.200
will go through various cycles
where they are doing more open

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.290
source, and then less open
source, and then they can go

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.010
back to doing more
open source.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.020
JJ BEHRENS: Cool.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.850
So I guess the rumors that
engineers have to spend, like,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.580
50% of their time avoiding
getting hit by self-driving

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.680
cars is probably not true?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.690
NEAL NORWITZ: Probably not,
although I don't know too many

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.545
people that work there, so
I should hold judgment.

00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:21.714
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:20:21.714 --> 00:20:24.990
Neal, I really appreciate
your coming in today.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.960
Thanks a lot.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.620
NEAL NORWITZ: Thank you.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:26.990
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.770
NEAL NORWITZ: Good day.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.580
JJ BEHRENS: So now let's do some
Q&amp;A. And Adrian is here,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.760
another famous Python guy.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.010
What have you got
for us, Adrian?

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.950
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK, turning
on my mic here.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.320
So it's the right time now
to ask, just like, really

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.750
technical questions
about the API?

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.520
JJ BEHRENS: Jeffrey's already
sending an email with an

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.775
answer key, you know, for the
sake of the audience.

00:20:56.775 --> 00:20:58.930
Why don't you ask your question,
and then he'll say

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.100
it verbally.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.350
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Oh, sure.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.260
So I have, actually,
a couple questions.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:17.670
The first is, what's the best
way to get more granularity in

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.080
the YouTube player
API in JavaScript

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.160
for the current position?

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.450
So I think the current, it's
only every, maybe, 200

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.350
milliseconds?

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.680
JJ BEHRENS: Jeffrey, can
I answer this one?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.890
Because I'm so excited
I actually know the

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.080
answer to this one.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.740
JEFFREY POSNICK: I am so
happy for you, JJ.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.480
JJ BEHRENS: Thanks.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.068
So of course we have an iframe
player that uses either Flash

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:48.720
or HTML5, and it turns out with
Flash, there are these

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.970
things called key frames that
are in the stream, and so you

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.640
really can't see to anything
more finer

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.010
grained than a key frame.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.980
So it's actually not so much of
a YouTube thing as it is a

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.860
core thing about Flash.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.310
And so this comes up a lot
with Flash developers.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.800
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK, so if I
were to switch to the HTML5

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.325
player, would there be a way
of getting around it?

00:22:14.325 --> 00:22:19.320
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, so as a
YouTube API user, you

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.580
generally don't pick which
player you want to use,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.160
because, of course, different
players are used in different

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.200
environments.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.180
And so there are some
environments, like iOS, that

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.455
don't even support Flash.

00:22:29.455 --> 00:22:32.550
Then there are some environments
that don't

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.760
support HTML5, and so basically
you have to coach

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.480
the HTML5 to the iframe API, and
you kind of have to deal

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.790
with the limitations.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: One thing you
might consider, though, is

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.050
test it out with
HTML5 enabled.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:51.130
So if you go youtube.com/html5
you can enroll.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.640
It's a cookie that gets saved in
your browser, so it's just

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.380
for a single user.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.450
We don't really have a
documented way to switch and

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.360
force the iframe player
to play HTML5.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.230
The idea being that we try to
make it transparent for

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.610
developers, and eventually the
functionality should really be

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.770
equivalent.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.830
It is still not.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.510
But then, yeah, there's cases
where HTML5 might actually do

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.800
a little better already, so I'll
be very interested to see

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.690
if HTML5 actually improves that
for you, because we could

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.620
give to our team and see
if there's anything

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.360
that they could do.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.680
And maybe for certain cases,
we should allow forcing the

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.230
HTML5 playback with certain
types of applications.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:40.370
We purposely have not exposed
it so that the complexity is

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.830
hidden from the application
developer.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.140
But I did also hear some
evidence that when it comes to

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.780
the resolution, it's
actually a little

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.710
better with HTML5 playback.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.960
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sorry, Adrian,
I just wanted to see

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.700
if you could clarify a little
bit what you're doing with

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.430
these time stamps.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.400
Are you seeking to a specific
time stamp, or are you just

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.780
trying to get the current time
of the playing video, and you

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.970
want a higher resolution
of the current time?

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.830
ADRIAN HOLOVATY:
Good question.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.210
I'm actually doing both, but
more of the second one, where

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:26.270
I have like a timeline view of
the video, and I just want to

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.840
have a play head that's really
nice and smooth, instead of

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.150
really choppy, because the
resolution's fine.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:37.370
So I'm getting around it by
using set timeout between

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.430
calls to get current time, so
that sort of just fakes it,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.685
but I'm just wondering if
there was a better way.

00:24:44.685 --> 00:24:47.626
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I could answer
that a little bit more.

00:24:47.626 --> 00:24:52.150
I recently went to an HTML5
conference and went to a talk

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.920
on animation.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.150
And one of the things that a
YouTube developer there was

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.280
talking about was there's a new
API called Get Animation

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.200
Frame, and this works out a
little bit better than set

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.880
timeout for various reasons.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.000
But if you have an idea of the
key frame, then you could kind

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.800
of fake it a little bit in order
to get the smoother flow

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.790
of the timeline.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.890
So I haven't tried that exactly,
but that's probably

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.150
what I would go try to do.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.475
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK, Get
Animation Frame?

00:25:21.475 --> 00:25:24.540
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, so you use
Get Animation Frame as the

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.840
backbone for your animations,
and then maybe you measure how

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.050
long the key frame interval is,
and then thereafter you

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.630
set up a smooth animation
using even CSS.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.550
You don't even need to
do it in JavaScript.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.690
You could to do it in
CSS to some degree.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:47.340
So you could have the
progression animating and

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.900
update the animation
in response to

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.300
changes in the play head.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.780
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Got it.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.110
Cool.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.480
JJ BEHRENS: Just because you're
not getting enough call

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.190
backs doesn't mean that you
can't be animating that time.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.950
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Sure.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.885
OK, cool.

00:26:01.885 --> 00:26:04.300
I'll definitely check
that out.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.710
And then can I ask
another one?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.510
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.300
JEFFREY POSNICK: Please do.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.130
JJ BEHRENS: Well, you there's
a large crowd behind you.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.660
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: I've been
posting videos to YouTube

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.910
since 2007 or something
like that.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:24.260
And I've got around 24,000
subscribers, and I would like

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.650
to be able to reach the
subscribers who have been with

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:35.460
me for a long period of time,
for four years or whatever.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.500
And I don't think that there's
currently a way in the data

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.120
API to get at the day
they subscribed.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.680
Can you think of a way that I
can get at the early people,

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.740
to sort of give them maybe a
special thanks for being with

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.420
me for a long time, or
something like that?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.450
JJ BEHRENS: Jeffrey,
what do you say?

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.960
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, so it's
not really symmetrical, the

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.900
type of information that we
expose regarding subscriptions

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.150
in the API.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.420
You're kind of making the
assumption that there's some

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.370
way to get the list of people
that are subscribed to you and

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.470
asking about how to find the
date which that subscription

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.170
took place.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.110
But the first part of that
actually is impossible.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.400
You can't get a list of
everybody who subscribed to

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.250
you using the data API.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.270
What you can do is get a list
of everybody that you are

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.190
subscribed to, so if you
get a list of your own

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.790
subscriptions, but not
the people that are

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.090
subscribed to you.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.190
So there's a fundamental
problems with exposing the

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.480
time stamps of people's start
of their subscription.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.970
That information just isn't
available via the data API to

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.785
begin with.

00:27:51.785 --> 00:27:54.870
JJ BEHRENS: You know, I have
kind of a crazy idea.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.900
If you've been a Gmail user
this whole time, Gmail

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.990
actually has an API as well,
and you might be able to

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.550
search for the email that you
get when someone subscribes to

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.174
you, and do it that way.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.440
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: That's clever,
but I turned off those

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.860
emails many years ago.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.560
JJ BEHRENS: I don't know why.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.300
I mean, what's wrong
with 24,000 emails?

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think the
only other option is, you can

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.510
engage with your users on your
channel, and that's what,

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.120
typically, people do.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.210
So uploading your video is one
thing, but now there is

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.740
basically a wall of sorts where
you can post updates,

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.930
and so forth.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.640
So if you, for example, want
to interact with them, then

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.770
you could post some notices
there, and if they subscribe

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.140
to you, they will get that
in their stream.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.530
So that's typically what people
do for engagement with

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.480
their audiences.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.850
They basically use the YouTube
Channel page, and then

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.170
depending on how you configure
your channel, you can actually

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.450
configure it in a way that
features the activity from you

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.240
a little more prominently.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.650
And so there's engagement around
a single video, but

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.180
there's also engagement
on the channel.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.380
So I think using that might be a
good way to achieve whatever

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.465
it is that you wanted
to send them.

00:29:13.465 --> 00:29:17.620
Through email, you could try to
do this on the channel and

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.590
see if that works for you,
because it typically is what

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:26.890
YouTube stars, such
as yourself, do.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:27.950
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.930
JJ BEHRENS: So Adrian, I'm
not subscribed to you.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.267
But I do remember you
play guitar, right?

00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:34.400
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yeah.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.600
JJ BEHRENS: So I've seen one
of your videos, and your

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.360
guitar playing's pretty
dang amazing.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.190
I remember when I first watched
it, I was like, holy

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.810
crap, he's a damn good Python
programmer, as well as an

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.350
amazing guitarist. I mean,
that's just not fair.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.260
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Thanks, man.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.580
I wish I could do it full time,
but it's hard to make a

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.310
living as a musician,
you know?

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.620
JJ BEHRENS: You want to mention
where the name Django

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.605
came from, then?

00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:04.380
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Oh,
yeah, it's named

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.010
after Django Reinhardt.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:13.970
He was a jazz guitarist
in the '30s and '40s.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.570
That's basically it.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.440
JJ BEHRENS: Pretty cool.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.690
Do you have more questions?

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.970
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: This is very,
very low level, but I guess

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.440
while I have you--

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.850
on the iPad, I've noticed that
when you press Play, in the

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.560
JavaScript API, it actually
falsely reports that it's

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.340
playing for three
or four seconds.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.590
And then after, like, three or
four seconds, then the get

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.840
current position goes back to
zero, and then it's correct.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.340
Does this make sense?

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.630
Is this a known thing?

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You're using
the iframe player, right?

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:57.440
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yes.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:57.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.400
Interesting.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.780
I haven't seen that before,
but that would

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.692
probably be a bug.

00:31:03.692 --> 00:31:06.690
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, it
unfortunately might be a bug

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.900
in the way the HTML5
video element is

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.220
implemented on iOS web kit.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:20.480
Just in general, the iframe API
tends to be a fairly light

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.690
layer over the native events
exposed by the browser's HTML5

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.700
video implementation.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.940
So you do occasionally see
differences in what might be

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.600
recorded in terms of
the player states.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.080
And it's probably for the best
that the iframe API tries to

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.030
stay out of the way and just
report what's going on in the

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.930
browser, rather than imposing
its own logic and having

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:50.820
special cases hard coded, like
if this is iOS, then I should

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.110
wait a few seconds before
I report playback, or

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.810
something like that.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.660
But if I had to take a guess,
I would say that that's

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.560
probably what the
root cause is.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.990
But we could talk to the player
engineering team and

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.590
ask them to confirm that and
look into it a little bit

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.020
more, and maybe even file
required bugs against web kit

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.773
folks if needed.

00:32:11.773 --> 00:32:13.060
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.030
I'm happy to send a little
example thing if that would be

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:17.620
useful

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.640
JEFFREY POSNICK: That
would be fantastic.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.370
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: OK.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.620
JEFFREY POSNICK: I know that we
take iframe API bugs super,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.440
super seriously.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.120
We want to get those completely
squashed, and that

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.470
API, we want it to be
completely solid.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.030
And an example will really
help the team, so we'd be

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.460
really grateful for that.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.130
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Sure.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.890
Sounds good.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:41.285
JEFFREY POSNICK: Feel free to
do that via our Google group

00:32:41.285 --> 00:32:47.160
that we have set up for YouTube
data and player API

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.760
questions and bug reports
and things like that.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:55.850
It is being slightly neglected
right now.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.000
All of us are super busy getting
ready for Google I/O.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.880
So apologies to anybody who is
watching this video and has

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.072
recently posted a question to
our group that we haven't had

00:33:04.072 --> 00:33:06.470
a chance to get to you
yet, but these

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.410
things will not be ignored.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.410
It's just a slight delay in
getting back to folks.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.720
JJ BEHRENS: So by slightly
neglected, do you mean that

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.445
your average response time has
fallen from a mere 45 seconds

00:33:18.445 --> 00:33:20.900
to like, 57 seconds?

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.770
JEFFREY POSNICK: It might be
slightly more dramatic than

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.160
that, but we want to make sure
that everybody knows that

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.470
they're being heard, even if
they're not hearing back a

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.770
response right away.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.740
JJ BEHRENS: Adrian,
is that it?

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.760
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yeah,
that's it for me.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.756
Thanks so much.

00:33:35.756 --> 00:33:37.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How was
the sandwitch, Adrian?

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.480
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: I'm sorry?

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.222
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How
was the sandwich?

00:33:40.222 --> 00:33:41.310
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Oh,
it was good.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:46.230
Sorry, I put myself on mute,
went on visual mute, so you

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.390
wouldn't see me, you know--

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.540
JJ BEHRENS: So are you
still in Chicago now?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.245
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yeah.

00:33:51.245 --> 00:33:51.960
JJ BEHRENS: Right on.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.670
How's the weather?

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.860
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Beautiful
today.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.495
Yeah.

00:33:55.495 --> 00:33:57.490
Very nice.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.910
JJ BEHRENS: Great.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.050
Jeffrey, what was the best
question you got asked on the

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.300
Google group recently?

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.320
JEFFREY POSNICK: Best question
is a little tough, but I can

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.480
say that I have been helping
some very patient developers

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.460
recently in the Google
group [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.420
bear with a few bugs that's been
ongoing with our player

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.659
APIs in particular.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.949
So I'll briefly talk
about that.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:30.100
So we have been having some
issues related to the default

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.239
playback quality that's
being used for--

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.340
I think in particular, it's
been the Chromeless

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.000
ActionScript 3 player.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.139
And some folks have rightfully
been upset because we ended up

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.320
defaulting to basically
a 240p, which is our

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:51.100
lowest-quality version of the
video, even if the player is

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.735
large enough for
a 720p version.

00:34:54.735 --> 00:34:58.675
This has purely just been due to
some issues on our end that

00:34:58.675 --> 00:35:01.610
were introduced with some recent
changes to the quality

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.800
selection code, and I think
everything should be fully

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:10.750
ironed out by the end of the
day today when we do our

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.410
weekly push of the YouTube
players and the associated

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.630
code for that.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:21.330
So thanks for everybody's
patience regarding that.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.550
JJ BEHRENS: And Jarek, I know
you've been working pretty

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.920
hard on setting up sandbox
partners for Google I/O. And I

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.050
don't want to get the whole
list just yet, but can you

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.570
give us any teasers of what
we're going to see?

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So we'll be
announcing the list shortly on

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.410
our Google I/O site.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.790
I can tell you that we'll have
12 partners this year, so

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.080
quite a few application
developers that use YouTube

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.210
API for a very wide
range of products.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.650
So if you're out there building
an awesome app, and

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:56.550
one day you feel like you need
more exposure, maybe next year

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.150
you could join us at
Google I/O as well.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.480
This is of the things that we
are trying to do for our

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.820
application developers, to
help them get noticed.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.480
I know it's a huge press event
for us as well, so we expect

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.460
good coverage.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.780
And yeah, we've been busy
getting it all together.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.020
The list should be coming out
soon, so if you're coming to

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.500
I/O, I hope you'll visit
our sandbox.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.180
We'll have some very
exciting demos.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.990
JJ BEHRENS: Wow, that's
pretty awesome.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.890
I heard something about spying
on people, and I heard weird

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.210
Scottish accents with
you on the phone.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.980
I just can't understand
what's going on.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We will have
a nice international

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.525
representation.

00:36:36.525 --> 00:36:39.170
Since I speak with an accent,
I'm trying to kind of foster

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.440
that within my immediate
neighborhood.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.550
So we have more weird accents
in the developer sandbox.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.660
But I think about 33% of
participants will be from

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.950
outside of the United States.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:51.330
JJ BEHRENS: Wow,
I'd have to say

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.680
that's pure dead brilliant.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.450
So I think we're out
of time today.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:58.940
Thank you, Adrian.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.515
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: I do have
one more question.

00:37:00.515 --> 00:37:01.870
Is it too late?

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.110
JEFFREY POSNICK: No, perfect.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:07.870
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: So I'm working
on looping sections of

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:13.310
videos with that same iframe
API, and I've noticed that

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.520
even if the loop
is very small--

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.810
so, like, one second's
worth of stuff--

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.600
every time it goes back to the
start, it requests the

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.480
underlying video data again.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.080
And I'm wondering
if there is--

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.840
that seems very inefficient.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:35.360
So is there a way to just have
it cache that somehow or

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.630
somehow clue it in that it's
already seen that portion of

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.286
the video, and it shouldn't
have to download again?

00:37:40.286 --> 00:37:41.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Which player?

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.405
Is it Flash, or HTML5 player?

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:46.110
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: I would assume
it's the Flash one,

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.400
because I'm using that iframe
API, and it picks it

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.290
automatically, right?

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Just
on the desktop?

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.186
ADRIAN HOLOVATY: Yes.

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:54.000
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.910
No, I don't think we cache
that right now.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.460
I think in theory with Flash,
there are some possibilities,

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.300
but we don't do that
right now.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.925
I mean, this is obviously
good feedback.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.990
I'm going to bring this up with
the players team, because

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:20.670
frankly I think it's a little
overkill to do that.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:28.370
We only now are getting into
allowing people to script the

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.580
playback with the API and player
parameters, so I this

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.600
is probably going to become
more and more of an issue

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.120
going forward as people
use the API.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.570
JJ BEHRENS: Think it's a good
feature request. OK Thank you,

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.660
Adrian, so much for joining
our hangout.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.610
You made it a lot more fun
having some live questions.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.550
And for all the people watching
the live streaming,

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.500
thanks for joining, and we'll
be posting this probably on

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.460
Google Developers site.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.510
So thanks a lot, guys.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks, guys.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.390
Bye, bye.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.640
ADRIAN HOLOVATY:
Bye, everybody.
