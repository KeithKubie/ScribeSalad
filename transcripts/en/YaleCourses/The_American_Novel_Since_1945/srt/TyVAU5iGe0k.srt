1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,100
This is a American novel since 1945.
Welcome.

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:07,380
I'm Amy Hungerford today.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm going to do a couple of
things in the first half of class.

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,970
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
the class and introduce some of the

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,090
questions that we will
think about over the term.

6
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:22,350
If you stay in this course
in the second half of class,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,560
I will introduce to you and start telling
the first story of the term and that's

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,210
about Richard Wright's black boy, which
is our first reading of the term, uh,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,580
in between those two parts.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,970
I will ask than anyone who is shopping
the class and would like to leave at that

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,660
time.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,160
Do so then I would be grateful if you
would wait until that point if at all you

13
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,650
possibly can.
Uh,

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,980
just makes the whole thing work a little
easier and it prevents that drop in the

15
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,690
pit of my stomach when I see half
the class leave. So, um, I will,

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,060
I will indicate when that moment is,
come on,

17
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:04,770
make yourself comfortable on
the floor. Um, if you can.

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,040
My goal in this course is to allow you,

19
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:21,041
or to invite you to read some of the most
compelling novels written in the last

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,110
little over a half century.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,570
This includes a whole
range of thematic concerns.

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,160
So when I looked down at my list of
novels, which I have not brought with me,

23
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,470
I trust you can find it on the web.
Um,

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,240
I didn't want to kill trees by making
enough of these for all of you.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,550
When I looked down at my list of books
and I think about what these books are

26
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:49,310
about,
I see war,

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I see war all the way from the Trojan
war to the Mexican American war in the

28
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:59,150
1840s,
all the way up to the Vietnam War.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,210
I see love in all kinds of guises,

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,050
be they criminal as in Lolita,
pedophilia,

31
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,050
love be they uh,

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,110
sort of ideational romantic
John Barth be they campus love.

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,780
That's the human stain,
Philip Roth,

34
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,670
all kinds and forms of sex and love.

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,170
And then there's politics
interweaving with all those things.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,830
There are questions of identity and race.

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,880
There is a nervous breakdown that actually
happens right here in new haven in

38
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:46,760
one of these novels that's
in Franny and Zooey.

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,470
I see women who give up on housekeeping
altogether and let their house go to

40
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:59,360
ruin and become vagrants. I
see suicide, I see slavery.

41
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,680
All these things you can
read about in these novels,

42
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,010
but reading these novels is not just
about reading about those things.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,040
It's also going to be the process of
watching an artistic form unfold over a

44
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:20,971
very exciting period of time in the
second half of the 20th century and up now

45
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,030
into the 21st century writers,

46
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
we're thinking very hard about what to
do stylistically with all the innovations

47
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,210
that come in that powerful
period known as modernism.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,790
So one of the things we're going to think
about together in the course is what

49
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,480
happens to all those innovations?
Are they abandoned?

50
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,280
Are they embellished or they
stretched or they rejected?

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,860
What happens to those resources that
the great modernist writers in Dowd

52
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,640
language with so powerfully
earlier in the century?

53
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,930
So there are formal questions that we
will take up time and again there are

54
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,370
questions that intersect between the form
and the content in every single novel

55
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,204
that we read.

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,130
Now perhaps those of you who like to
read fiction and especially who like to

57
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:19,330
read fiction from this period, we'll look
down at that syllabus and you'll say,

58
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:23,080
well where is,
where is your favorite writer?

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,930
Where is Don Delillo?
Where is John Updike?

60
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,360
My answer for the question
why these writers?

61
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,330
My answer for the question is the course.

62
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,770
It's an answer that unfolds over
these 14 weeks of the term 13,

63
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,333
13.

64
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,930
The short answer is that I think these
writers best represent all the different

65
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,224
threads,

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,680
all the different forces in American
novel since 1945 there are lots of other

67
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:02,041
writers we could include including those
two that I named that would equally

68
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:06,280
illustrate some of the threads that
I've got a on the syllabus now,

69
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,510
but these are the ones for
various practical and uh,

70
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,360
and more substantive
reasons that I have chosen.

71
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,870
Now you do have an opportunity this
class does that my class has never had

72
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,044
before.

73
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,140
And that is to nominate your own
novel for the last one that we read.

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,280
One of your choice.
Now I have done this in,

75
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,090
I did it in a sophomore seminar
and I did it in a graduate seminar.

76
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:37,530
I invited my students to,
uh,

77
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,300
present some choices to the class
and then the class voted on them. Uh,

78
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,240
it was incredibly successful in the,
in the undergraduate course.

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
It was a small seminar.

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,790
I had groups of students proposing
to novels actually for the end of the

81
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,624
syllabus.

82
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
And the exercise gets you to think very
hard about what you think this period is

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,980
all about.
It's not just about what's fun to read,

84
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
although it is that too.
Um,

85
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,010
it's about thinking what would make
the right ending to this intellectual

86
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,031
trajectory,

87
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:18,410
this intellectual narrative that
we're going to move through this,

88
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,900
this term,
what would make the right ending.

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,990
So it has a sort of
intellectual purpose to it. Um,

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,270
but I will tell you the students I had
in that seminar did amazing things to

91
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:33,290
push their choice of novel
for g one one group, um,

92
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,930
nominated Jeffery Jenny's Middlesex,

93
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,140
there was a huge art installation that
I walked into on that day of class.

94
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,350
It covered the ceiling and the
walls and the floors. It had,

95
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:49,070
they had done original photography
for it. It was really spectacular. Uh,

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,600
there was a, there was a theatrical
skit for Dave Eggers how we are hungry.

97
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,010
There was campaign literature,
um, pamphlets and so on.

98
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,030
So people were very creative with it
and it was really lots of fun. Um,

99
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
and for me it's,

100
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
it's fun because I may not know
the novel that you end up picking.

101
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
And so it is a kind of challenge for me
to take a novel that you've chosen and

102
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,340
come to grips with it myself.
It may be one that I know. Now,

103
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,980
let me just say in a,
in a technical way,

104
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,820
if you decide to volunteer
to nominate a novel,

105
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,670
you'll get no extra credit.
It will do nothing for your grade,

106
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,040
but you will get glory,

107
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,340
whatever glory there is to be
had at the front of this room.

108
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:41,330
Maybe that's like minuscule,
but maybe it's going to be fun for you,

109
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,710
especially if you have a
sort of theatrical bent or
if you like getting up in

110
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,140
front of people, uh, or
if you're just really,

111
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:51,200
really passionate about a novel
that you want everyone to read.

112
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,790
So that's something that we will do
and I will tell you more about at mid

113
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,450
semester. So that's the piece of the
syllabus that I can't tell you about.

114
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,350
I don't know what that,

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,150
what that a dream we're going to dream
together is when we read that novel.

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I don't know what that'll be.
Um,

117
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,810
I want to just go over the
requirements of the course, uh, that,

118
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,680
that really are required,
not the optional piece. Um,

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,780
just so that you understand
what my purposes, um,

120
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,810
pedagogically this course is very much
open to English majors and to non English

121
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:27,530
majors. Uh, it's essentially
a reading course.

122
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:31,880
That's what I want you to take away from
this is the knowledge of these novels.

123
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,060
I want you to read them.
I want you to think about them.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,320
I want you to talk about them.
Um,

125
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,650
but I don't expect you to
become an English major in
order to do that if you're

126
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,570
not already one.
However,

127
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,340
if you do happen to be an
English or literature major
or someone who's just very

128
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:52,400
serious about reading at that level,

129
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,980
you will find plenty to chew on here.

130
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,130
Not all of the novels aspire
to or have as their purpose.

131
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,300
That kind of difficulty that sometimes
English majors really want. They want to,

132
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,780
they want to have to work
incredibly hard at the formal level.

133
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,830
Some of the novels have that,
but not all of them.

134
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,010
The challenge for you is to figure out,

135
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,920
well what do we do with those novels?

136
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,010
What is the aim of a novel that
isn't all about formal innovation?

137
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,470
What are those novels doing?
Are they just like not a,

138
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,750
is it just inappropriate
to call them literature?

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,630
Should we think about
them in a different way?

140
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,270
How should we integrate that kind of
novel with novels that have more formally

141
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,870
ambitions?
So the paper length,

142
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,420
there are two papers required
and there's a final exam.

143
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,960
The paper length is
designed to be quite large.

144
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,900
It's a five to five to eight page papers.

145
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,800
Now a five page paper is very
different from an eight page paper.

146
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:59,130
If you're actually thinking about the
words you choose and how you write it.

147
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,880
If you just sort of, you know, the
night before scribble, scribble,

148
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,170
scribble until you're done.

149
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,290
Maybe there's not that much difference
between a five and an eight page paper

150
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,800
except like editing.
But substantively,

151
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:14,310
if you're using every
sentence in that paper,

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,250
you can write a lot more
in an eight page paper.

153
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:24,630
If you've used every sentence to say
something substantive to move an argument

154
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,760
along,
then you can in the five page.

155
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,030
That's for those people who really want
to push themselves and want to advance,

156
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,560
uh, really, uh, some significant
piece of thinking about a novel.

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,780
Now I will also say that
a five page paper written,

158
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:47,460
well can Trump an eight page paper
written poorly any day of the week.

159
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,320
So you don't have to write long papers.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,470
But what I'm saying is the room
is there for you to stretch out.

161
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,350
If you want to do that.
Um,

162
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,830
the final exam you should do well if you
read and if you come to lecture and if

163
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:07,650
you 10 section the process
of doing those three things,

164
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:12,000
we'll have allowed you to already have
thought quite a bit about these novels.

165
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
You should remember them.
I think they're quite memorable.

166
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,840
They're quite distinct from each other.
Uh,

167
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,760
and you should be able to
manage with that final exam. Um,

168
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,830
without undue difficulty.

169
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,750
I will say that the reading load is heavy.
I've made some adjustments every year.

170
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:32,751
I'm trying to deal with the fact that
there are so many novels I love written

171
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,791
between say 1985 and the present
that are over 400 pages of piece.

172
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,460
So what do you do with
those on a syllabus? Well,

173
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,030
I guess it's the problem that the eight
people who teach the 18th century novel

174
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:49,320
always have, or the Victorian novel
Victorian novel, like the Triple Decker.

175
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,930
You know, the three volume
novel, least I don't have those.

176
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,290
But what I've is to excerpt some of the
texts earlier in the term and actually

177
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,060
there's a slightly heavier
reading before break, um,

178
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,660
than there used to be so that it's a
little bit lighter after break when we're

179
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:09,100
doing those long novels.
Okay. Last thing. Um,

180
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,810
this course, uh, as you may
have noticed from our, uh,

181
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,730
our friends behind us, uh, is
being filmed as part of the Yale,

182
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,090
the Open Yale courses, uh, initiative.

183
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,200
It is an initiative funded by the
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

184
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,370
This is one of eight courses being
offered this year that are, um,

185
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,660
that are being videotaped.

186
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,950
They will be made available free
to the public via the Internet.

187
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
So this is a way of allowing the world
to benefit from what we all do at Yale.

188
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,790
Um, that said, what we try to do,

189
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,480
what I will try to do and,

190
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:50,290
and what I hope you will try
to do is to forget about them.

191
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,320
It's sometimes hard for me, but I
trust that you will be able to do that.

192
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,150
Um,
so forget about that.

193
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,930
The point is not to cater to that camera,

194
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:06,550
but to do what we do and to show
the world what it is that we do.

195
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,180
Now I like to ask questions in lecture.

196
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,840
I really am just not a fan
of the sort of zone out,

197
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,550
a model of lecture audition.
So I will ask you questions.

198
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,530
The only annoying thing I will have
to do is to repeat your answers.

199
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,150
So I hope you will not object to that
because you don't have microphones on you

200
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,230
and it's very cumbersome to get them
back to you. So we're not gonna. Uh,

201
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,040
Mike, you said that your, your
answers can be hurt. All right. Uh,

202
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,600
any questions so far about what I've said?
Okay.

203
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,750
Now I want to talk about the handout.
Um,

204
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,750
those of you who don't have it,

205
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,840
there are a couple more up front here.

206
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,100
Uh, there should be the rest of the stack
over here. Oh No. These are my notes.

207
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,260
Uh, are we out? Yeah, there are a
couple more. And if you don't have one,

208
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,220
you can share.

209
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,030
What I have here for us
to look at together today

210
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,720
are two little texts.

211
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,870
I'm going to read parts of them to you
and together I think they give you the

212
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:41,291
sort of snapshot I want you to
have of where literature stands,

213
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,300
where reading stands at the Begin,
at the middle of the 20th century.

214
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,250
The first one is an advertisement for
the random addition of James Joyce's

215
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:56,780
Ulysses and this appeared in the
Saturday review of literature, uh,

216
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,340
in 1934.

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,320
So I'm going to read just parts and I'm
going to skip around a little bit and

218
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,220
stop and start

219
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,010
how to enjoy James Joyce's
great novel Ulysses.

220
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,923
Yes,

221
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,210
for those who are already engrossed in
the reading of Ulysses as well as for

222
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:21,780
those who has attained to begin it
because they fear that it is obscure.

223
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,480
The publishers offer this simple clue as
to what the critical fuss is all about.

224
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,060
Ulysses is no harder to understand
than any other great classic.

225
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,130
It is essentially a story
and can be enjoyed as such.

226
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,950
Do not let the critics confuse you.

227
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,200
Ulysses is not difficult to read and it
richly rewarded each reader in wisdom

228
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:47,034
and pleasure.

229
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,430
So thrilling and adventure into the
soul and mind and heart of man has never

230
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,090
before been charted.

231
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,660
This is your opportunity to begin the
exploration of one of the greatest novels

232
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,310
of our time.
What I want you to notice first of all,

233
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,920
is the kind of reader that's being
invoked here for that modernist classic

234
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,950
Ulysses.

235
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,010
It is not the fussing critic. Now, if you,

236
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,050
if you read down, if you sort of skimmed
down, you'll see that kind of language,

237
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,640
uh, applied to critics. They, uh, they,

238
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,230
they seem fretful.

239
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,280
They seem interested in obscure knowledge.

240
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,420
That's how this advertisement
represents critics. Even though,

241
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,050
even though it also invokes critics to
describe what's powerful about the novel.

242
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,850
So there's a sort of two faced
representation of the critic.

243
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,930
But the important one I think
is that dismissal of the critic.

244
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,060
The point of this advertisement is to
make you feel like you don't have to know

245
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:02,180
what the critic knows in
order to read this novel.

246
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,190
What you need is something
like strength or bravery.

247
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,020
Listen to that language.

248
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,350
For those who are already engrossed in
the reading of Ulysses as well as for

249
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:19,790
those who has a Tate to begin at.

250
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,690
The people already engrossed
are the strong ones.

251
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,780
And you can be that this are, this, uh,

252
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,910
advertisement wants to say you can be
the strong reader that hesitation those

253
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,300
who hesitate to begin at.

254
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,100
It's a kind of feminized
mincing approach to the novel.

255
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,360
It's sort of like those
fussy critics. So this, uh,

256
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,390
this advertisement tells you that the
great classic of Modernism is something

257
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:52,920
you stride into like a man,
but,

258
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,130
but you don't have to be a
particularly extraordinary man to do.

259
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,274
So.

260
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,270
This monumental novel about 20 hours in
the life of an average man can be red

261
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:10,710
and appreciated like any other great
novel once its framework and former

262
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:11,610
visualized,

263
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,640
just as we can enjoy hamlet without
solving all the problems which agitate the

264
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:20,580
critics and scholars. There's that
agitation that I was talking about.

265
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,530
The average man.

266
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,770
This advertisement wants you to see you
lyses as a story about a man you can

267
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:32,970
identify with.
So you don't have to be a critic,

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,160
you have to be strong.
But you know what,

269
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,310
you can be the average man because this
is a story about the average man with a

270
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:47,691
plot furnished by homer against a setting
by Dante and with characters motivated

271
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,220
by Shakespeare.

272
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Ulysses is really not as difficult to
comprehend as critics like to pretend.

273
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,680
This is like saying dress,
buy Prada shoes by Ferragamo.

274
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,240
It's as if there are brands,
Dante, Shakespeare, homer,

275
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,370
that are identifiable.

276
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,090
They're familiar and what's
more they carry with it.

277
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,740
That sense of cultural capital. Well,
what do I mean by cultural capital?

278
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,120
It's that knowledge that makes you
one of the elite of your world.

279
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,160
It's also that knowledge that an educated
sort of Bella touristic reader of the

280
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:33,300
Saturday review of literature
would be very, very familiar with.

281
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,500
So in a sense it tells you this work of
art is of a piece with what you already

282
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:45,900
know. It's familiar in those ways
and you shouldn't be afraid of it.

283
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,700
At the same time,

284
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,960
it's part and parcel of that
elite body of knowledge.

285
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,183
So again,

286
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,810
there's this kind of two faced
newness to the advertisement.

287
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,110
It's both every man and it's the
elite who will best read this book.

288
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Now I want to contrast that
with what we see from nobach off

289
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,460
in this essay.
Good readers and good writers.

290
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,650
This is from 1950

291
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,760
now the part of the essay just
prior to this explains that he gave,

292
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,790
he gave this little quiz that you see
to some college students when he was

293
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:37,110
giving a lecture,
so this is what he asked them to do.

294
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,030
Select for answers to the question,

295
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,940
what should the reader
be to be a good reader?

296
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,760
The readers belong to a book club.

297
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,840
The readers should identify himself
or herself with the hero or heroine.

298
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,220
The readers should concentrate
on the social economic angle.

299
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:05,430
The readers should prefer a story with
action and dialogue to one with none.

300
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,260
The readers should have
seen the book in a movie.

301
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,360
The readers should be a budding author.
The reader should have imagination.

302
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,250
The reader should have memory.
The readers should have a dictionary.

303
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,150
The reader should have
some artistic sense,

304
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,910
and a backoff says the student's leaned
heavily on emotional identification

305
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,190
action and the social,
economic and historical angle.

306
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,740
Of course,
as you have guessed,

307
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,880
the good reader is the one
who has imagination, memory,

308
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,850
a dictionary and some artistic sense,

309
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,710
which sense I proposed to develop in
myself and others whenever I have the

310
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:48,544
chance.

311
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,710
There are at least two varieties of
imagination in the reader's case.

312
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,300
So let us see which of the two is the
right one to use. In reading a book.

313
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,350
First there is the
comparatively lowly kind,

314
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,450
which turns for support to the simple
emotions and is of a definitely personal

315
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,284
nature.

316
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,270
A situation in a book is intensely felt
because it reminds us of something that

317
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:17,620
happened to us or to someone
we know or knew or again,

318
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,660
the reader treasures of book mainly
because it evokes a country, a landscape,

319
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,980
uh,
mode of living,

320
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,150
which he nostalgically recalls
as part of his own past or,

321
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,580
and this is the worst
thing or reader can do.

322
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,300
He identifies himself with
a character in the book.

323
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,540
This lowly variety is not the kind of
imagination I would like readers to use.

324
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,760
What a crime. How many of you are
guilty of this kind of reading ever?

325
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,360
Okay, now back off, be gone.

326
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,640
But he wants to get at something here and
I think it's helpful to put it next to

327
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,260
that advertisement for Ulysses.

328
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,130
He wants you to think
about reading on his terms.

329
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,230
His terms are very much informed by a
modernist sensibility of what literature

330
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:11,464
is all about.

331
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,220
And I'm going to say more about what
that is when I lecture on Lolita,

332
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,830
but it's very much in contrast with
that Ulysses ad don't identify.

333
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,250
It's not about you,
it's about something else.

334
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,630
But what is it about?

335
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,640
So what is the authentic instrument
to be used by the reader?

336
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,650
Is it,
sorry?

337
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,180
It is impersonal imagination
and artistic delight.

338
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,140
What should be established,
I think is an artistic,

339
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:48,200
harmonious balance between the
reader's mind and the author's mind.

340
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,620
We are to remain a little aloof and take
pleasure in this aloofness while at the

341
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:58,520
same time we keenly enjoy,
enjoy with tears and shivers.

342
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,760
The inner weave of a given masterpiece
to be quite objective in this matters is

343
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,870
a matter is of course impossible.

344
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,710
Everything thing that is worthwhile
is to some extent subjective.

345
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,360
For instance,

346
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,630
you sitting there may be merely my
dream and I may be your nightmare.

347
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,970
Some of you might think
that after a Lolita,

348
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,450
but what I mean is that the reader must
know when and where to contribute his

349
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:30,491
imagination and this he does by trying
to get clear the specific world,

350
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,500
the author places at his disposal.

351
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,450
If there's a balance of power between
the writer and the reader in this little

352
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,124
Vignette,

353
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,820
the power really I think
finally resides with the writer.

354
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,470
It is the writer who's world the
reader is here asked to get clear.

355
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:03,030
You are asked to use your imagination
to enter a world made by the writer,

356
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,150
a world of imagination and so it's the
writer who directs you in that way.

357
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,110
You are not asked to imagine a place
you knew something from your history,

358
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,820
something from your knowledge of yourself.

359
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,300
It is not about finding the average man,

360
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:26,290
which you are also in the novel
there staring back at you.

361
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,400
It's about finding some other dream world.

362
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,780
Maybe it's a nightmare world.
So for Nepal cough,

363
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,810
he wants to imagine a kind of literary
encounter that's very much separate from

364
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,240
those other things. He talks
about. Um, other media,

365
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,100
the movies, having seen
the book in the movie, uh,

366
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,590
from the life that we all lead when
we work and when we go to school,

367
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,850
the social economic angle,

368
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,810
he wants to read it as a
part from the emotions,

369
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:07,100
although he wants to enlist those
emotions in a very specific way.

370
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,920
Remember those tiers and shivers.

371
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,360
Those have to be the tiers
and shivers of impersonality.

372
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,510
That word impersonality made famous by
t s Elliott who advocated impersonality

373
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,630
as the ultimate stance of the artist.

374
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,290
That is the stance from which
all great art should proceed.

375
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,490
So nabar cough imbues that
state of impersonality with
certain kinds of emotion

376
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,940
and then asks the reader
to be as impersonal as that
modernist artists also must

377
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,454
be.

378
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,750
So what I think we'd get from these two
little readings today is this sense of

379
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:56,790
where literature finds itself
at a kind of crossroads.

380
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:02,210
What kind of reader our writers in this
period looking for and what do they want

381
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:06,960
from that reader? To what context
did they address themselves?

382
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,820
Is it a social context? Is it a
literary one? Is it a psychological one?

383
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,990
Is it a philosophical

384
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,940
cold one?
Is it a political one?

385
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,390
What should the novel strive to do?

386
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:23,450
What can novels do in the world?

387
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,010
What is the role of the imagination?

388
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,320
How does that factor in to what the,

389
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,790
the reader lives in,
in daily reality?

390
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,290
What is the status of identification?

391
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,470
Is that the primary model of readership?

392
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,510
Is that what makes people want to read?

393
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,030
Is that what should make
people want to read?

394
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,510
These are some of the
questions that these,

395
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,980
these two readings res and there are
questions that we will return to over and

396
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:58,280
over throughout the term.
Now I'm going to stop there.

397
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:01,160
I've gone on longer than I expected.

398
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,240
I'm going to let shoppers leave and
then I'm going to, in a very short time,

399
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:06,790
I'm going to,
uh,

400
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,280
pick up again and talk about Richard
Wright's so anyone who wants to leave now,

401
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,533
please do so

402
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,730
and please sign in. By the
way, guys, before you leave,

403
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,590
the sheets are coming. Round three.

404
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,710
Should I say you can sign in right there.

405
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,810
Oh, there's assignment chief. Thanks.

406
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,990
Those were my notes. Yeah, I
don't take those right here.

407
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,250
I was looking for the

408
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,900
Oh, syllabus, that sheet that was
handed out. Oh, uh, let's see.

409
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:54,430
Do I have any more online? No,
it's not. Hey Casey. Casey,

410
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,840
can I borrow your handout? Um, can he
have it? I'll give you another one.

411
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,310
[inaudible]

412
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,190
okay, I'm going to start even
though it's still in flux here,

413
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:10,870
cause I don't want to lose my time.

414
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,500
[inaudible]

415
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,910
Ooh, that's bad. Whoa,

416
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:24,510
I'm stepping over you.
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

417
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,040
All right. That was dramatic,
wasn't it? Um, okay.

418
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,160
All right. Now. Now we've talked about
the imagination. Now I want you to use it.

419
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,780
Now. I want you to use it.
Imagine that you are a,

420
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,690
it's all you've ever wanted to be.

421
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,610
You're at a very happy time in your life.

422
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,330
You just wrote a really successful novel.

423
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,150
Everyone loved it. It was unlike
anything that had been written before.

424
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,400
It was very well received.

425
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,390
You decided for my next project,

426
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,980
I am going to write about my life.
You've had a hard life by the way.

427
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,440
Uh,
you've had a hard life.

428
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,780
That hard life you think is really
what made you into the writer.

429
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,614
You are,

430
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,010
it's what allowed you to speak so
powerfully to people in your first novel.

431
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,310
And you've always wanted to write an
autobiography. So, so that's what you do.

432
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,560
That's what you take up
as your next project.

433
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,060
So you write the story
of your life. It's, uh,

434
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,690
nearly 400 pages long.

435
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,980
It gets a really nice reception
at a very good publisher.

436
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,000
It's in page proofs, everything's
going great, you're thrilled.

437
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,020
And then someone says to you,
you know,

438
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,170
imagine this is Oprah.
Oprah gets page proofs of your novel.

439
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,350
She's thinking about
putting it on her book club.

440
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,520
And if any of you know anything
about contemporary literature,

441
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,180
getting on Oprah's book club is like,

442
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,320
it makes your sales for the next
20 years. It's huge. It's huge.

443
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:13,321
There is no more powerful marketing force
in contemporary fiction than Oprah's

444
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,034
book club.

445
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,440
It even does wonders for Tolstoy when
Tolstoy gets on Oprah's book club. Um,

446
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,290
not by seance.
Um,

447
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,050
so you get on Oprah because Oprah
asked for the proofs for your novel.

448
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,130
She takes them, she says, this
is great, but you know what?

449
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,700
I think that last hundred pages you
should just get rid of it and you think

450
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:40,900
about it and you say yes,

451
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,990
and it comes out in that form.
And there you are.

452
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,090
And for the next 40 years,

453
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:53,920
no one ever sees the novel that you
wrote or the autobiography that you wrote

454
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:58,870
originally. It's still only two thirds
of what you ever wrote it to be.

455
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,600
Well, this is what
happened to Richard, right?

456
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,990
This is pretty much exactly what happened
to Richard Wright in 1944 so he had

457
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,990
published native son
in 1942 great acclaim,

458
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,960
very successful novel.

459
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,430
In 1944 he completed black boy
then called American hunger,

460
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,160
and he had placed it with
Harper and brothers publishing
company in New York and

461
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,460
they were very happy with them.

462
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,930
It had a first part called southern night
and a second called the horror and the

463
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:45,521
glory southern night was about his
experience growing up in Mississippi.

464
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,890
So he was born in 1908 and Mississippi.

465
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,690
And in 1927,
I think it's 27,

466
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,980
let me get my deep right.

467
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,000
In 1927, he moved to Chicago, moved north.

468
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,120
And uh,
in the 1940s,

469
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,050
he moved to Paris and
he died there in 1960.

470
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,830
So his was a progression out of a very
poor southern childhood from a black

471
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:20,180
family led by a single mother

472
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,720
to the circles in which
Gertrude Stein moved in Paris.

473
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:29,030
So this was a long trajectory,
well,

474
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,470
black boy or American hunger as it
was then called covered the part in

475
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:37,160
Mississippi and then the
beginnings of his life in Chicago.

476
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,780
Now the part about his life in Chicago
was the part that was finally cut from

477
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,090
the, not from the, I'm
going to keep doing this,

478
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,490
call it the novel versus
the autobiography.

479
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:52,410
And I'll explain why I made
that mistake a little later. Um,

480
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,430
it was cut from the autobiography.

481
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,390
Now he had this in page proofs with
Harper and brothers and heartburn brothers

482
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:07,241
sent the page proofs out to various
writers for blurbs and also sent it to the

483
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,160
book of the Month Club editorial board.

484
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,640
The book of the month club was a mail
order book club that started in 1926 and

485
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:21,470
it became an incredibly powerful
engine for selling books.

486
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,570
Just as Oprah's book club is today.

487
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,630
In 1926 it had about 4,700 members.
Just three years later,

488
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,180
it had 110,000 members,

489
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:38,170
110,000 subscribers in 1929 by the
forties and fifties it was incredibly

490
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:40,634
powerful.

491
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,840
So what we have is this marketing
juggernaut getting interested in Wright's

492
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,090
autobiography.

493
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,460
So they take it up and the board decides
that they only like the southern night

494
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,600
part. They don't want any of the part
of the story of his life in Chicago.

495
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,180
And that's what he finally agrees to.

496
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,620
So in the summer of 1944,

497
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,380
he embarks on this correspondence with a
woman named Dorothy Canfield Fisher who

498
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:15,470
was one of the editorial board
of the book of the month club.

499
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,020
And they go back and forth
trying to figure out how he
will revise the ending to

500
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:24,050
southern nights so that it sounds like
the end of the book rather than the end

501
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:28,430
of a section of a longer book.
Now for um,

502
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
for Wednesday I'm going to ask you to
go online to the Beinecke key digital

503
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,360
archive and read those letters.
We hold them here.

504
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,300
They are not published anywhere.
So this is kind of fun.

505
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:46,380
This is one of the special things about
being at Yale. We have those letters,

506
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,110
you can go and touch them.
Uh,

507
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,480
you can read them online and I want you
to read those in addition to reading, uh,

508
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,990
the sections that I've indicated.
Um,

509
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,070
you can see what happens when right
starts coming up against these demands on

510
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,570
his manuscript.

511
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,570
And I will project them during class too
so that we can, we can talk about them.

512
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:17,810
Rights manuscript was therefore very
much under pressure as a literary object,

513
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,740
and it really was a literary object.

514
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:26,040
I think we can make the mistake
thinking about autobiography,

515
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,960
that it's somehow not literary,
but in fact it's very literary.

516
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,850
And part of what makes it literary is
the fact that you have to choose what

517
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:39,240
scenes go into that narrative.

518
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,820
You can't just write every single
thing that happened in your life.

519
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,620
You have to choose.
Well,

520
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:48,510
critics took it fairly straightforwardly
as the account of a life,

521
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,110
and in that sense,
taking it that way,

522
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,730
some of them were a little disappointed
with what they held in their hands.

523
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,860
For one thing,
it seemed exaggerated to some people.

524
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,720
So the first scene as you'll discover
in black boy is when Richard Young

525
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:07,260
Richard,

526
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,260
he's like six burns down the family
house playing with matches underneath the

527
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,154
curtains,

528
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,280
and his mother finds him where he has
hidden under the burning house and flogs

529
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:24,861
him until he's unconscious and he's
sick for a good long time after that.

530
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,970
Okay. Critics were like, mm, I don't
think so. That doesn't seem right.

531
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,570
A mother flogs her son,
until he's unconscious,

532
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,160
didn't seem too credible.
As time went on,

533
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,970
there were other kinds of
complaints these about accuracy.

534
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,100
So for instance,

535
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,280
his mother in the book is
represented as being uneducated.

536
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,260
Well, in fact, she was a school teacher.

537
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:57,261
Now there is a difference between scholars
on how long she was a school teacher.

538
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,850
Some say she was a sort of
long term successful school
teacher. Others said, well,

539
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:06,360
she only taught school for a
couple of months. So this was not,

540
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:10,160
didn't seem to be accurate.
Then there was another scene in,

541
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,360
in the autobiography where Richard,

542
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,310
who was the Valedictorian of
his high school class, um,

543
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,580
writes his valedictory speech gives it
as required to the principal beforehand.

544
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,570
The principal demands certain kinds
of changes and Richard refuses.

545
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,070
Well, apparently Richard in
real life, did not refuse.

546
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,230
Make those changes and imagine in a
book that then undergoes this publishing

547
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:45,250
history that I've described this,
this is kind of a symbolic scene.

548
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,270
This is a scene of whether you as a
writer compromise yourself in the face of

549
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:56,310
authority that resists what you
want to say. So in the book,

550
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:57,660
it's a very important scene.

551
00:38:57,661 --> 00:39:01,620
It's the moment when Richard
really finds his voice and get it,

552
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:06,120
gives him the strength eventually
to leave the south. But,

553
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,200
uh, in real life, apparently he did cave.

554
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:11,940
Yeah.

555
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,840
Then there came to be questions
about whether the scenes,

556
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:20,040
the stories in the book
actually did happen to him.

557
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,030
So there's this story about his uncle
Hoskins who takes his horse and cart with

558
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:31,590
Richard in the back and drives it into
the middle of the Mississippi River as a

559
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,950
kind of practical joke on Richard.
Well,

560
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:37,650
apparently this is not something
that happened to Richard, right.

561
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,080
This is something that
happened to Ralph Ellison.

562
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,490
Yeah.

563
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:47,990
Where these stories come from,
began to be a problem.

564
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,210
So what his autobiography,

565
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:54,740
what is this Shondra that
right is working with, um,

566
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,740
it raised these kinds of
questions on the one hand,

567
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,240
but then there was another
kind of question and uh,

568
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:06,590
that was coming from the
other side. This is what, uh,

569
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,090
William Faulkner wrote to
write upon reading black boy.

570
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,423
He said,

571
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:19,030
the good lasting stuff comes out of one's
individual imagination and sensitivity

572
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:24,710
to and comprehension of the
sufferings of every man.

573
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:29,870
Any man not out of the
memory of one's own grief.

574
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,950
I hope you will keep on saying it,
but I hope you will say it.

575
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,770
As an artist,
as in native son.

576
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,150
So Faulkner's objection
is on the other side.

577
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,310
It's not fictional enough to write about
your life and to pretend that you're

578
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,970
communicating the memory of what
happened to you. Your grief,

579
00:40:49,971 --> 00:40:54,410
your private grief doesn't
contain that universalizing move,

580
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,360
that fiction by its very essence
contains and you see that.

581
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,020
You know, you can remember back to that
conception of literature we see in the

582
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:04,340
advertisement for Ulysses,

583
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,460
that it's about every man that great
greatness in literature comes from its

584
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:14,000
ability to speak to some
archetypal every man, any man.

585
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:15,950
And Faulkner capitalizes those,

586
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:21,220
those words in his letter as
if they really are types well,

587
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,740
right himself described that difficulty
of writing his autobiography and this,

588
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,570
this, this is, these
are the terms he used.

589
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,120
I found that to tell truth is
the hardest thing on earth.

590
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,170
Harder than fighting in a war harder
than taking part in a revolution.

591
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,610
If you try it, you will find that
a time sweat will break upon you.

592
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,990
You will find that even if you succeed
in discounting the attitudes of others to

593
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:51,950
you and your life, you must
wrestle with yourself. Most of all,

594
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:56,951
fight with yourself for there will
surge up in you a strong desire to alter

595
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,990
facts,
to dress up your feelings.

596
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,910
You'll find that there are many things
you don't want to admit about yourself

597
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,240
and others as your record shapes itself.

598
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,160
An odd wonder haunts you,

599
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,310
and yet there is no more exciting and
adventure than trying to be honest in this

600
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,010
way.
The clean,

601
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:21,680
strong feeling that sweeps you when
you've done it makes you know that.

602
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,610
And even though,

603
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,000
and that little passage,

604
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,690
he suggests that it's a
struggle to be truthful,

605
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,850
a struggle to be accurate,

606
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,350
a struggle not to dress up your feelings
with some sort of embellishment.

607
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,700
He at other times says that,
well,

608
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,580
some of the stories did
come from other people.

609
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,580
Some of the stories he included did
come from other people's experiences,

610
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:53,930
not from his own life.

611
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,070
And that this is allowed and allowable
because what he aimed to do was produce a

612
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,080
generic life of a black
boy living in the south.

613
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,460
And from the titles we know
he considered for this book,

614
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,720
none of them make that claim.
The life of Richard, right?

615
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,750
None of them say that it's
always black boy American hunger.

616
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,480
These are not person specific.

617
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,780
These implicitly make a claim to the
generality at the national scale or in the

618
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,250
racial sense,

619
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,550
the representativeness of this life and
indeed what more powerful testimony to

620
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,190
the power of narration is there the
power of a story to say that you heard a

621
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,861
story and it became as if part of your
experience that you heard Ralph Ellison

622
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:56,480
tell that story and somehow
you began to live it yourself.

623
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,340
So what we see in the publishing history
of black boy and also in its reception

624
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,400
brings us back to those questions that
I was raising at the beginning of class.

625
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,150
What is the relationship
between writing in the world?

626
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,150
What's the relationship between
the writer and the reader?

627
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,600
What's the relationship between fiction
and what we all experience as the real

628
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,500
world?
Our course over the term,

629
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,310
we'll come back to this question over
and over again and it will also come back

630
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,670
to the generic question of autobiography.
Uh,

631
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:38,130
even so experimental,

632
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,400
a book as a John Barth lost in the fun
house is totally absorbed in the problem

633
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,520
of what it would mean
to write about yourself.

634
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,130
It's a persistent problem,

635
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:54,870
partly because it always raises these
issues of fictional reality versus

636
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:58,860
truthfulness of honesty
versus embellishment.

637
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,520
It also raises the question
of how a self is made.

638
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,930
If we look forward to the end of the term,
when we read the human stain,

639
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,550
which is about a man Coleman
silk who tries to weld,

640
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,640
tries to and succeeds
in passing as Jewish,

641
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:19,641
he's a black man and he passes for his
whole life as Jewish and in doing so,

642
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:23,460
reject his family.

643
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:25,230
Okay?

644
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,011
In a way,

645
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:31,011
what Komen does is write his autobiography
of fictional autobiography in the

646
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:34,260
very process of living it.

647
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,680
So Roth imagines lived life as fictional
in the same register as a novel or as

648
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:47,931
truthful dubiously stow perhaps in
the same register as an autobiography.

649
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,850
So these are questions
that we'll come back to us.

650
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:59,130
This is part of what I find so compelling
about fiction and literature in

651
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,240
general in this period. And this is
why I study it. This is why I teach it,

652
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,660
because that interface between the
imagination and the world between literary

653
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,800
art and trying to tell the truth about
something between form and content,

654
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,240
those contexts are very,
very close and they're very compelling.

655
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:27,050
And I think in part because other media
are so powerfully on the rise in this

656
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,134
period,

657
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,490
literature has to figure out
where to stake its claim.

658
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,430
What can literature say
that nothing else can?

659
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:40,850
How can it address us in a way that is
compelling in a way that nothing else is?

660
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,310
Can we make those kinds
of claims for literature?

661
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,750
The writers on the syllabus consistently
try to imagine a way to make those

662
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:55,740
claims, make those claims for the primacy
and the importance of what they do.

663
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:01,070
And I think that in addition to being
able simply to understand the literature

664
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:02,220
of your moment,

665
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,440
to understand the literary world in
which writers probably among you sitting

666
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:08,274
right here,

667
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:14,440
that world in which you will
bring forth your next novel,

668
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,490
what that world looks like,
you can understand that world,

669
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:23,790
but also you can understand how art
confronts the world in a much more general

670
00:47:24,161 --> 00:47:25,630
sense.
That's what's exciting,

671
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,460
and that's what I invite you to think
about with me in the course. Um,

672
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,570
so I'll stop there and hopefully
I'll see some of you on Wednesday.
