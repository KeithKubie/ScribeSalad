one of the things that I think companies
 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.960
one of the things that I think companies
do to a large degree that makes very

do to a large degree that makes very
 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.470

little sense is the use of focus groups

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
little sense is the use of focus groups

little sense is the use of focus groups
so think about what a strange idea is

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099
so think about what a strange idea is
 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.009
so think about what a strange idea is
that we take ten people who know

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019
that we take ten people who know
 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.590
that we take ten people who know
basically nothing about your project and

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600
basically nothing about your project and
 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
basically nothing about your project and
you put them in your room and you let

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610
you put them in your room and you let
 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.130
you put them in your room and you let
them talk for a while and then you take

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140
them talk for a while and then you take
 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.720
them talk for a while and then you take
the whatever they came up with is a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730
the whatever they came up with is a
 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.970
the whatever they came up with is a
consequence of these two hours of random

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980
consequence of these two hours of random
 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.520
consequence of these two hours of random
thinking and you base your strategy on

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530
thinking and you base your strategy on
 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.370
thinking and you base your strategy on
it to a large degree and I don't want to

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380
it to a large degree and I don't want to
 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.050
it to a large degree and I don't want to
say that focus groups are always useless

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060
say that focus groups are always useless
 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.389
say that focus groups are always useless
and also uninformative but I think that

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
and also uninformative but I think that
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.790
and also uninformative but I think that
taking this data and then relying it as

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800
taking this data and then relying it as
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.819
taking this data and then relying it as
extensively as companies do I think I

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829
extensively as companies do I think I
 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.040
extensively as companies do I think I
think it's crazy in many ways and the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
think it's crazy in many ways and the
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.660
think it's crazy in many ways and the
reason I think companies do it is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
reason I think companies do it is
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.119
reason I think companies do it is
because when these people create a

can help you create a fourth formulate

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940
can help you create a fourth formulate
 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.660
can help you create a fourth formulate
an idea around it when if you said

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670
an idea around it when if you said
 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.090
an idea around it when if you said
eighty-seven percent of the people said

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
eighty-seven percent of the people said
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.160
eighty-seven percent of the people said
X it just doesn't have a face it doesn't

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170
X it just doesn't have a face it doesn't
 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.079

have a desire it's just not as concrete

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089
have a desire it's just not as concrete
 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.700
have a desire it's just not as concrete
and therefore people are not a is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710
and therefore people are not a is
 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.520
and therefore people are not a is
excited about the about the notion so I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530
excited about the about the notion so I
 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.560
excited about the about the notion so I
think that focus group is incredibly

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570
think that focus group is incredibly
 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.490
think that focus group is incredibly
useful as a persuasive attempt to tell

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500
useful as a persuasive attempt to tell
 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.770
useful as a persuasive attempt to tell
people what to do but is a way to find

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780
people what to do but is a way to find
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.870
people what to do but is a way to find
out information it's not as useful as

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880
out information it's not as useful as
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.840
out information it's not as useful as
people think it is the other thing that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850
people think it is the other thing that
 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.020
people think it is the other thing that
really puzzles me is that companies how

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030
really puzzles me is that companies how
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.380
really puzzles me is that companies how
little they understand about how

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
little they understand about how
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.569
little they understand about how
incentives really work so the biggest

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579
incentives really work so the biggest
 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.849
incentives really work so the biggest
expenditure for almost any company is

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859
expenditure for almost any company is
 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.249
expenditure for almost any company is
salaries and you ask people what do you

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259
salaries and you ask people what do you
 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.450
salaries and you ask people what do you
know about the relationship between

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
know about the relationship between
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.060
know about the relationship between
salaries and performance the answer is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070
salaries and performance the answer is
 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.789
salaries and performance the answer is
nothing right and the question is why

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799
nothing right and the question is why
 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.039
nothing right and the question is why
don't they study anything why don't they

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049
don't they study anything why don't they
 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.510
don't they study anything why don't they
study why don't they try different

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520
study why don't they try different
 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.219
study why don't they try different
performance different incentive level

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229
performance different incentive level
 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.770
performance different incentive level
and see how it influenced performance

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
and see how it influenced performance
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.560
and see how it influenced performance
and they often say well the law kind of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
and they often say well the law kind of
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.889
and they often say well the law kind of
low laws and if we have paid some people

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899
low laws and if we have paid some people
 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.149
low laws and if we have paid some people
one way in something another way we

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159
one way in something another way we
 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.429
one way in something another way we
might be sued and but in the last two

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439
might be sued and but in the last two
 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.840
might be sued and but in the last two
years with all these questions about

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850
years with all these questions about
 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.340
years with all these questions about
bonuses and so on I've gone to many

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350
bonuses and so on I've gone to many
 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.830
bonuses and so on I've gone to many
companies and said why don't we at least

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
companies and said why don't we at least
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.260
companies and said why don't we at least
do some surveys one we at least see how

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270
do some surveys one we at least see how
 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.779
do some surveys one we at least see how
happy people are on the months when they

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789
happy people are on the months when they
 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.460
happy people are on the months when they
give them you give them the bonus and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470
give them you give them the bonus and
 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.589
give them you give them the bonus and
how productive they are and the answer I

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599
how productive they are and the answer I
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.000
how productive they are and the answer I
got one hundred percent of the time is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
got one hundred percent of the time is
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.370
got one hundred percent of the time is
that people are really

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
that people are really
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110
that people are really
durable in bone the season and because

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
durable in bone the season and because
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.880
durable in bone the season and because
of that they don't want to ask them any

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
of that they don't want to ask them any
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.100
of that they don't want to ask them any
more questions and I said if people are

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
more questions and I said if people are
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.750
more questions and I said if people are
miserable in bonuses and shouldn't it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
miserable in bonuses and shouldn't it
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580
miserable in bonuses and shouldn't it
mean that you should study it understand

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
mean that you should study it understand
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.680
mean that you should study it understand
it and try to prevent it from next for

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
it and try to prevent it from next for
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540
it and try to prevent it from next for
next year and say well well not this

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
next year and say well well not this
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.980
next year and say well well not this
year this year was really miserable

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990
year this year was really miserable
 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.800
year this year was really miserable
maybe next year come back to us next

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
maybe next year come back to us next
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270
maybe next year come back to us next
year but if you think about it it's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
year but if you think about it it's
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.100
year but if you think about it it's
really incredible now how do companies

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110
really incredible now how do companies
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.280
really incredible now how do companies
decide about compensation they look at

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
decide about compensation they look at
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.720
decide about compensation they look at
what other companies are doing and try

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
what other companies are doing and try
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.520
what other companies are doing and try
to equate compensation to what other

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
to equate compensation to what other
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530
to equate compensation to what other
companies are doing it but it's a place

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
companies are doing it but it's a place
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.510
companies are doing it but it's a place
of the blind leading the blind right and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520
of the blind leading the blind right and
 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.920
of the blind leading the blind right and
then if we pay five percent more other

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
then if we pay five percent more other
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390
then if we pay five percent more other
people would start doing it but the real

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
people would start doing it but the real
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550
people would start doing it but the real
question is how do you pay and how do

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
question is how do you pay and how do
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560
question is how do you pay and how do
you get people to care about their work

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570
you get people to care about their work
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.650
you get people to care about their work
and become more productive and be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
and become more productive and be
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.510
and become more productive and be
happier at their work and the answer is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
happier at their work and the answer is
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.730
happier at their work and the answer is
not simply that more money is better

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740
not simply that more money is better
 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.800
not simply that more money is better
more money can be part of the equation

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
more money can be part of the equation
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.420
more money can be part of the equation
but it's also the question of how do you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
but it's also the question of how do you
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.030
but it's also the question of how do you
give that money you give it a bonus do

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
give that money you give it a bonus do
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.180
give that money you give it a bonus do
give this a fixed salary you give it as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190
give this a fixed salary you give it as
 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.190
give this a fixed salary you give it as
part of the benefits maybe you give

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
part of the benefits maybe you give
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.690
part of the benefits maybe you give
benefits for the gym do you send people

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
benefits for the gym do you send people
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.120
benefits for the gym do you send people
on vacation to the Bahamas and it turns

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
on vacation to the Bahamas and it turns
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.680
on vacation to the Bahamas and it turns
out that there are ways to use money

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
out that there are ways to use money
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.490
out that there are ways to use money
that is economically less efficient but

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
that is economically less efficient but
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.020
that is economically less efficient but
actually get people to be more motivated
