00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.850
This summer the University of Cambridge will
begin field testing self-healing concrete

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.170
that’s fueled by bacteria.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.670
And NASA would like to explore Jupiter’s
moon Europa with a robotic space squid.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.670
Vsauce!

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.620
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:23.490
The worldwide leader in beauty products has
partnered with a company that prints human

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.490
skin.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.280
L’Oreal announced the partnership with Organovo
- who specialize in growing skin tissue in

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
a 3D environment.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.320
Growing with 3D bioprinting allows for the
automated creation of living human tissues

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.430
that have the form and function of body tissues
and this process allows for faster and more

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150
accurate testing of pharmaceutical products.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.040
The partnership could someday bring medical
advances including 3D printed skin grafts.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.430
Vortex Bladeless can harvest wind energy without
any blades.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.930
The bladeless cones produce energy by harnessing
an aerodynamic effect known as vorticity,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.710
which causes the cones to produce a pattern
of spinning vortices.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.799
The energy is harvested with a ring of magnets
and an alternator at the base, and if this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540
model is successful it could be a cheaper
and quieter alternative to traditional wind

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.540
turbines.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.960
These are the first ever images of Pluto’s
smallest moons, captured with the New Horizons

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.990
Spacecraft.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.990
Pretty moons.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.880
Whill is a personal mobility device that hopes
to replace traditional wheelchairs.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.210
A wheel composed of 24 small rollers was invented
for this device to allow for making small

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.210
turns.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.130
It also has four wheel drive, allowing it
to drive over grass, pebbles, snow, and even

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
clear a curb.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.939
You can test drive one yourself if you live
in Japan or California, and they’re currently

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.740
looking for distributers to sell it worldwide.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.740
Researchers in London are 3D printing medication
into different shapes.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.689
They wanted to see if a pill’s shape affected
the release of the drugs, and it turns out

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.479
that a pyramid dissolves a lot faster than
a cylinder due to the surface area to volume

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.479
ratio.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.040
This could lead to greater precision and customization
when prescribing medication and also it just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.040
kinda looks cool.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.340
The freight liner inspiration is the first
autonomous commercial truck to operate in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.560
the United States.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.340
It utilizes radar and a system of cameras
to scan a range of 820 ft.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.959
The trucks are safe, more fuel efficient and
have greatly reduced blind spots, which is

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.060
good because they still require a driver and
currently they have two of these concept trucks

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060
built.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.200
Adrian Smith and Fredrick Larabee have discovered
that some ants use their jaws to fling themselves

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.270
to safety.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.690
Trap Jaw ants use their stingers and their
incredibly quick jaws to catch prey, but it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.370
turns out they also use their jaws to escape
from predators.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.370
Yahoo!

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.770
Scientists have found a missing link that
bridges the gap between the evolution of single-celled

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.960
organisms called prokaryotes, to the more
complex ones called Eukaryotes.&nbsp;

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.069
By extracting DNA from the sediment around
a hydrothermal vent the team from Sweden found

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.190
microbes that had complex genes typically
found in higher lifeforms, allowing us to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.770
further track the evolution of complex lifeforms
like you and me.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.910
The Hovding is an airbag for bicyclists that
you wear around your neck.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.239
But you knew that if you saw Mind Blow #69,
at that point it was just a student thesis,

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.300
but the device is now available for purchase.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.370
Hovding, Mind Blow complete.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.909
Now go save some lives, kiddo.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.330
NailO is a bluetooth trackpad that you wear
on your nail.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.519
Developed at MIT, it can fit on your thumb
and be used to access your computer while

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.680
your hands are full or discreetly control
other wearable technology.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.770
The team hopes to make the device even smaller,
and integrate different sticker designs.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.660
Finally, the Taurus Dexterous Telepresence
Manipulation System is designed to revolutionize

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.910
the way humans operate remote controlled precision
focused robots.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.620
These devices precisely track your hand movements
giving you full control of the robotic arms.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.220
The entry-level solution provides hand-tracking
and control over the robotic grasper.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.650
For our customers looking for haptic capability
we have input devices offering full haptic

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.650
feedback.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.780
Meaning you're actually going to feel the
forces between the robot and its environment.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:44.729
I’m going to leave you with bionic butterflies,
and as always, thanks for watching.
