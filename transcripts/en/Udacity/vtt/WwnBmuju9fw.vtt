00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.410
Next we're going to be speaking with
John Kansky, the interim president and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.290
CEO of
the Indiana Health Information Exchange.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, John, I want to thank you for

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.480
taking the time to be
with us this morning and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.580
to help the students learn more about
the Indiana Health Information Exchange.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.865
They're already aware of the challenges,
the financial challenges,

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:26.360
the sustainability challenges faced
by health information exchanges.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.910
As you look around the country,
where do you think we are on that?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.760
&gt;&gt; I, yeah thanks, Mark.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.150
The sustainability has
long been discussed and

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.950
debated as a key part of health
information exchange and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.590
I think it's helpful to view that in
terms of the three types of health

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.000
information exchanges that have
merged in the marketplace.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.570
There are a number of state run
exchanges run by their respective state

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.370
governments, largely funded by
our recent era high tech funding.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.970
There are private or proprietary
exchanges that are run by and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.360
controlled by single organization like
a large health system for example.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
And then there's the type of exchange
which I think most of us have been

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550
thinking about for a number of years,
and the type of exchange that we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.180
are in Indiana which I call a regional
inter-organization exchange.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
We have to sustain
ourselves by delivering

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.570
services that our customers
value in exchange for fees, and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.200
making sure that those fees, the revenue
from those fees exceed our expenses.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.630
The other two types of exchanges,
the state run and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.530
the proprietary,in some cases have
the opportunity to be sustained by their

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.840
sort of parent organizations.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.960
If the state government chooses
to levy attacks or generate or

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.570
provide dollars from the general
fund of the state government,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.210
they really don't have
a sustainability challenge.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.870
And in the case of the proprietary or
private exchange,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.380
they're sort of sustained at the whim
of the organization that runs it, so

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.610
I feel that question is most
interesting for the region exchanges.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.160
And again, we really have to run
ourselves like a business or

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.230
despite the fact that many of us
are not for profit organizations,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.590
you need to be very conscious of
having revenue in excess of expenses.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.220
The way to do that is to focus
on services that your customers

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.070
value enough to pay for.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.460
It sounds fairly mundane and it sounds
more like a business class than

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.870
informatics, but it's very important for
HIEs to remember to sustain themselves.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.630
&gt;&gt; The students are familiar with what

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.240
IHIE does thanks to some examples
that you sent before the class.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.390
Let's take a moment and look at
what it takes to do those things.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.260
Can you tell us a bit about
the IHIE organization?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.610
&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.120
And again, stressing that our, we're not
affiliated with the state government,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.800
but certainly have a good
relationship with them.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.750
We're a non-for-profit
501 C3 organization.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.370
We have a board of health care

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.520
stakeholders from across the state
including many of our large customers.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.120
We have a governance body which
is extraordinarily important.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.440
Which governs the data
use of our data and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.820
allows, it provides for
confidence between competing

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.260
organizations to share their data and
have it used for our services.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.700
And the structure of our organization,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.060
we're about 54 people separated
into three management stacks.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.510
One which is software and
product development,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.940
one which is all the customer
facing functions like support,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.380
implementation and customer relationship
management and product strategy.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.880
And then finally a third stack which
is largely IT infrastructure and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.749
administrative function.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.298
&gt;&gt; At the heart of all this, of course,

00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:04.740
is this normalized,
curated database of clinical information

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.650
that you've accumulated from the many
different kinds and varieties and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.560
brands of EMRs that I'm sure in
use across the state of Indiana.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.720
How do you do that?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.100
How do you bring all that
together into something that for

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.050
example can create the Indiana
network for patient care.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.510
Which makes every patient look as though
they have a single record even though

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.800
that date may be,
may exist in many different EMRs.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.550
&gt;&gt; So how we do that is through
many real time interfaces.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.500
And an ongoing task of
what we call data mapping,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.130
which a little bit more specifically
is semantic normalization of the data.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.100
The best way to explain that, that I've
found, is that we like to say that

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.760
one organization will send
us their data in Italian.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.700
Another organization
sends it in Portuguese.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.910
Another organization
will send it in German.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.250
We translate everything to Latin,
so that we can combine it into that

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.300
virtual patient, single patient record,
that you referenced.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.220
That gives us the ability, which is
really the key for our past, present and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.650
the future that we're
going to be able to deliver.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.300
That gives you the ability to look at
a patient's record at the point of care

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.930
as if it came from one place, even
though the data came from many places.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.830
It also gives you the opportunity
to analyze across a population or

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.960
to manage the health of a population
using data, knowing that you

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.750
have the complete view of that
population, patient by patient.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.520
It is very expensive.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.170
I want to acknowledge that.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.470
To put the labor into normalizing
the data and maintaining the interfaces

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.620
which gets back to that
question of sustainability and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.000
having to work very hard to make sure
you're delivering value to customers

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.280
to cover the cost of that semantically
normalized system of repositories.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.880
&gt;&gt; Well, that's very interesting.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.020
I've used you as the primary example
of centralized HIE in the course.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.698
Does IHIE see a role for some of
the newer technologies designed for

00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:15.520
a federated environment?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.920
Technologies such as Direct,
RESTful APIs and more recently Fire.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.990
&gt;&gt; Sure.
Let me start by commenting that we

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.270
describe ourselves as a centrally
managed federated structure.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.570
Meaning our repositories,
the data in our repositories,

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.800
continues to be owned and

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.080
legally controlled by the organizations
that provide the data to us.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.530
It's not our data.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.670
But it is centrally managed in a single

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.780
data center which gives us
the best of both worlds.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.740
We have the performance of a centrally
managed structure with the governance

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.350
advantages and comfort of the providers
knowing that it's federated.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.930
But that's not the question
that you asked.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.690
So, let me comment on some of the newer,
emerging standards.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:09.370
This is a very practical answer because
HIEs have to be practical organizations.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.580
We can only base our services on
what's available in the marketplace.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.690
So using Direct as an example, Direct
is one of the newer standards that's

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.590
finding its way driven by meaningful
use into the marketplace.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.060
And to that extent, we are providing
services based on Direct.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:32.190
Some of the other standards that
are still evolving, we pay attention to.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.740
We study, we try to anticipate.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.220
We try and participate at a federal
level in learning about and

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.120
influencing those standards but
we of necessity to sustain ourselves,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.780
base our services only on those
that are in the marketplace and

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.480
to an extent Direct is
emerging as a useful standard.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.780
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.730
And to conclude, as you look
toward the future, all right.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:05.750
Can you tell us what additional services
or directions you see IHIE going?

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.640
&gt;&gt; Certainly, and this is an interesting
area for us because you always have to

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.480
be responsive to what your
customers are looking for next and

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.830
what In our business what
the government is steering towards.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.410
So, I took a couple of notes of
things that I thought might be worth

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.380
highlighting.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.110
For example, one of the things
we have done in the past, but

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.010
we know we're going to
be doing a lot more of.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.265
And, I wanted to stress, because,
I don't believe there are many, if any,

00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:38.390
other HIEs doing this is
that we are increasingly

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.500
able to put structured data from our

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.260
repository system into the EHR's in
response to some clinical event.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.170
So for example,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.730
say a patient shows up at the emergency
department of a hospital.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.480
We're able to take data from
the repository corresponding to that

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.040
patient, matching them with
their identity on the fly and

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.920
send that data, which comes from many,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.750
many other sources outside the
enterprise where they just presented,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:13.270
and deposit that data electronically
in the EHR at that facility.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.110
That's something we've only
accomplished with a couple

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.500
of different organizations
in our customer base and

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.740
it's been those that have been somewhat
more sophisticated in terms of their IT.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.880
But I definitely see things going
that way, if for no other reason than

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.210
we don't want physicians, clinicians to
be pulled out of their native EHR, but

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.849
still need to be able to view data
from outside the organization.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.970
One more example well,
I'll give two quickly.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.190
Medication data is something
that's in great demand and

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.130
high value at the point of care.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:54.169
We're working hard to increase the
amount and make it more comprehensive.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.700
In terms of the data that we can
make available at the point of care,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.492
we've always done that but it's a very
difficult thing to try to aggregate.

00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:08.000
It's worth noting that that even means
working with the state legislature

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.200
in Indiana to sometimes influence policy
to make the data more available and

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.740
remove obstacles.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.050
The last thing that is,
I think, worth noting,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:22.660
is analytics is a word that is thrown
around quite a bit these days,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.960
almost to the point that it loses
its meaning without being defined.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.140
There's a lot of things
in that category.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.700
We've already tried a couple of
things in the analytics space,

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.730
with mixed success and
it's a great question I think for

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.380
HIEs whether the marketplace
is going to expect them to

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.680
analyze the data that they
are able to acquire and aggregate.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.710
Or whether the market is expecting
them only to provide the data and

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.200
not necessarily the analysis.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.500
I think that's an open question.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.330
&gt;&gt; Well John, this has been
a fascinating conversation.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.910
IHIE is something that anyone
interested in health informatics

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.430
needs to know about and
needs to follow and I

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.630
appreciate your taking the time today to
help the students understand it better.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.300
&gt;&gt; Happy to do it.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.800
Thank you.
