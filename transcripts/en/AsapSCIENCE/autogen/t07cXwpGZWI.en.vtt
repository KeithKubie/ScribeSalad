00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.500
 A monogamy, or a relationship with one person, is actually very rare among mammals. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.360
 With just about 3% showing monogamous relationships. 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.840
 So what happens to people? 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.800
 Is it really better to be with one person for a lifetime? 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.900
 Historically, people did not practice monogamy. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200
 Anthropological notes indicate that they were tens of thousands of years old 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.340
 about 85% of human societies were composed of men with more than one partner 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.380
 The reason why most of the world turned into socially imposed monogamy was debated among scientists, 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.960
 but the leading hypothesis is to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.680
 As human societies changed about small collector hunters 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.040
 in large densely populated agricultural societies, 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.000
 models show that changing lifestyles would allow sexually transmitted infections to spread by causing death and infertility. 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 But while monogamy may have evolved to prevent sexually transmitted infections, what is it now? 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520
 Many claim they are in a monogamous relationship, but in fact they commit adultery. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.820
 Estimates of cheating among married Americans ranged from 21% -57% among men, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.860
 and 11% -35% among women. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.080
 In fact, studies on students in relationships 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 showed that 1 out of 5 acknowledges the use of Tinder on the side, 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.980
 and those who identify themselves as monogamous are less likely to practice safe sex, including using condoms and testing for sexually transmitted infections. 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.460
 Because they are afraid that the representation of these customs will make them doubt. 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.060
 However, they are more likely to use condoms for both vaginal and anal intercourse, 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.340
 to be regularly tested for sexually transmitted infections, and discuss external sexual relations with their primary partners. 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 So, now it seems that they are in consensual non-interlinked relationships, at a lower risk of sexually transmitted infections than those in monogamous relationships. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.280
 Research using 1500 people in monogamous relationships 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.380
 and 617 people in consensual non-ethnical relationships 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.560
 did not show any significant differences in the function of the relationship, generality of satisfaction, dedication, and passionate love. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 In fact, the jealousy was lower and more confident in individuals who are not monogamous. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.080
 Skeptical to these results? 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.960
 You're not the only one. 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.380
 The survey gave the participants an opportunity to read a brief description of the hypothetical results of the research 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.560
 in which it says: "Generally, polymer pairs had more positive outcomes than monogamous pairs." 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 The participants rated this statement as unfairly prejudicial. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.240
 And when exactly the same statement was replaced in favor of monogamous connections 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.140
 it would have been rated less unfair. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.600
 These results help us to show that we are prepared to think that they are monogamous connections 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780
 more loving, committed, and satisfying. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.960
 While consensual unconnected bonds such as palliamy and open connections are more often seen in negative light. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.220
 This does not mean that your partner and you need to think about other people. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.840
 The monogamy might be for some, but also not for some. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.160
 One study showed that men and women who wanted to get involved in random sex, 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 were more likely to have higher levels of testosterone, 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.160
 but this group is still a minority. 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.800
 In self-identifiable research on the ideal arrangement of the connection 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.540
 It has been shown that both men and women predominantly prefer a strictly monogamous arrangement of the connection when asked to choose. 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 So, if you prefer to keep your relationship for one person or more 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.020
 Research has shown that there are many ways to have a dedicated, satisfying, and loving relationship, 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.440
 and monogamy is not the only gold standard. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.980
 Thank you very much for watching. 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.600
 If you have not seen it yet, we just released another new video about what happens when Millennials are trying to be environmentalists. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.840
 It's a new style of video. 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.020
 We tried to make science fun and cool, so watch and share the video. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.120
 It would mean a lot to us. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.800
 You can click this link here, and we'll link in the description of the video. 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840
 Also subscribe. 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 There will be a new video on Thursday. 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 So, hi. And see you!
