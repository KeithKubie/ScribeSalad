00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:02.626
&gt;&gt;George: Most people look at
education and say it's impossible.

00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:05.106
&gt;&gt;Woman: The research
suggests that as early

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:07.546
as first grade, students
are checking out.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:10.796
&gt;&gt;Man: If they aren't excited, or
if they don't see how it is relevant

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:13.496
to their life, kids are
either bored or lost.

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:17.196
&gt;&gt;George: We need a different way of
looking at what we learn, why we learn

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:18.946
and how do we use what we learn?

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.916
We need to teach people how to think.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:33.146
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm going to
take a trip to Venus.

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:36.826
&gt;&gt;Steve: Twenty-five years ago, George
said, "People know education ought

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:39.586
to be different, but they
don't know in what way."

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:42.606
&gt;&gt;George: Saying that it needs
to be better is very, very easy.

00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:44.496
The how is very, very hard.

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:47.576
So the idea of making
an archive of what works

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:49.466
in education seemed like a great idea.

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:53.866
&gt;&gt;Steve: We started focusing on
technology, but very quickly moved

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.566
to the broader notion, how can we
help make education better for kids?

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.806
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so we'll start
with your first sample now.

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:03.676
&gt;&gt;George: We started with making movies
of classrooms and processes that work,

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:06.146
and putting them on videotapes.

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.626
And then the internet became viable,
and we were able to take all the ideas

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:12.486
and put them in one place so
people had access to them.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:15.606
We decided we needed to
define what education is.

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.176
What are we educating kids?

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:18.666
How do people actually learn?

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:21.006
So we've been doing that
for twenty-five years now.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:25.946
&gt;&gt;Steve: The George Lucas
Educational Foundation has the mission

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:28.706
to tell the stories of
what works in education.

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:30.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes!

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.936
&gt;&gt;Salman: Edutopia has spent a
quarter century creating materials,

00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:36.656
documenting great teachers,

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:40.116
talking about how you can make
those classrooms more in tune

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:41.616
with what actually interests students.

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:43.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Sweet, it worked.

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:48.296
&gt;&gt;Cindy: I look at Edutopia as an
experience for teachers, parents,

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:52.536
administrators, even for
students, to see what's possible.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Who here have dreams

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:56.626
and goals they want to
achieve in their life?

00:01:56.796 --> 00:01:59.946
&gt;&gt;Laura: Edutopia is like the
best staffroom we could ever have.

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:03.766
One of the most powerful
aspects of Edutopia is being able

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:06.526
to see other teachers
working in their classrooms.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:08.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What was the
problem we were trying to solve?

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.576
&gt;&gt;George: Here's people
doing it in Texas.

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:12.286
Here's people doing it in North Dakota.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:14.646
Here's people doing it in New York City.

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:16.766
You just see it, and it works.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:22.056
&gt;&gt;Woman: Schools That Work is a series
of excellent schools across the K

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:26.456
through twelve spectrum that have
evidence that what they're doing works.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.506
&gt;&gt;Student: I really like to read.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:33.136
I would read fifty books
a day if I had the time.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:37.566
&gt;&gt;Steve: Our most significant impact is
when we can make successful practices,

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:40.626
accessible to more and more
educators, so that they can try it out.

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:41.976
&gt;&gt;Man: Let's do it.

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:44.986
&gt;&gt;George: A lot of what we do
now focuses on methodology.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:48.096
We're trying to introduce people
to social emotional learning,

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:51.886
to multidisciplinary studies,
to project based learning,

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:54.676
things that have been taken
for granted for so long,

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:58.526
that nobody ever tested them to
say, does this actually work?

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:02.086
&gt;&gt;Kristin: Our mission at Lucas
Education Research is to build

00:03:02.086 --> 00:03:06.756
that evidence base and to think about
progressive practices that we know

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:11.296
in our hearts engage and inform
learning, but to really subject them

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:12.806
to more rigorous research trials.

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:17.026
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Does it feel
cold, does it feel hot?

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:20.056
&gt;&gt;Salman: There's a lot of talk these
days about project based learning

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:23.726
or inquiry, and these
aren't just nice to haves.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:27.426
The key for every learner is, as soon
as they get excited about something,

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:30.326
they're off to the races, then it's
hard to keep the knowledge from them.

00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:33.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're looking to see if
the bubble is between the lines.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.826
&gt;&gt;Students: It is!

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:35.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Nice work, people.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:39.216
&gt;&gt;Steve: The skills kids need to
come out of high school and college

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:42.556
with are the skills of the problem
solver, of a creative thinker,

00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:45.796
of a collaborator, of
a lifetime learner.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.516
That's what our goal is, is to
help people see what's possible

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.676
and then implement it in a way
that changes what kids learn.

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:57.956
&gt;&gt;George: I don't think the work of the
foundation will ever run out of things

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:01.396
to do, because as we progress
and the world changes,

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:03.876
the educational system is going
to have to change with it,

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:06.866
and so we have to try to help it along.
