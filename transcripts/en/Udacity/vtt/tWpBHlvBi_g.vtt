00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.230
A word about API's.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.390
I've mentioned it requires and provides part of the components description.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.920
This is sometimes called the component's application programming interface or

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.845
API. If you look at documentation for systems at the level of Javadoc for,

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:23.792
let's say a bunch of software you may download. The description of the,

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:29.341
of the classes and what their methods are and so on, are this,

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:35.400
is that, is that classes API. It's going to include the names

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.810
by which you can refer to the elements of that particular unit for example,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.980
the method names, the arguments you,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.870
you provide to that component, and, and their types, the return value and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.840
so on. The API could be specified in a particular programming language.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.470
If, if it's, if that's the case, it's called the language binding.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.880
It might be described that a higher level of abstraction, such as using OCL. And

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.830
a little later were going to look at specialized notations for describing APIs

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.600
at the architectural level called Architectural Description Languages, or ADLs.
