Playful on the nose,
very dry on the palette,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.187
hints of eucalyptus, stone
fruits and kalamala olives.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.288
- Do you know what that is?

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.690
- Is that the Devil's penis?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.524
- No.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.725
(laughs maniacally)

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.560
- Man, (bleeps) nature.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.563
- I can't take being white,
I gotta get back to my roots.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.432
- Ow, hey, ow, stop it, oh!

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.500
God damn!

Um, hey warden, that's
a really nice tie.

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:39.372
Take that Malloy!

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.640
Ow!

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.608
Wait wait wait I
thought my friend

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.842
had to suffer for my sins?

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.145
- I was being sarcastic, idiot!

Anti-christ!

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.050
- This is going too far, Denzel.

- That baby's evil,
I'll prove it.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:52.886
- How?

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.387
- Through science.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.289 align:start size:97% position:3%
If I shoot it in the face
and it lives, it's the Devil.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.759
- Okay, okay, shoot it
if it will shut you up.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.794
- Whoa!

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:01.594
Whoa!

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.664
Oh shit!

Man, y'all are freaks.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.372
I bet you ain't smiled like that

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.407
since you got the right to vote.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.009
So last night when my
girl says she wanted

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
to slip into something
more comfortable,

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.779
I didn't know she meant a coma.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.115
(laughs)

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hey, what's wrong with
you, that's funny.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean it's sad too,
'cause she died.
