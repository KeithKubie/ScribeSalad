00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is yes. She'd have to throw the object faster.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I approach questions like this in physics,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I think of what I call limiting cases.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For example, I ask myself what if gravity were 0?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, if there was no gravity, the object wouldn't be attracted to the earth at all.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you threw it in some direction it would just go floating forever.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As I increase that gravity, I can see that, okay, maybe the object will start to get pulled towards earth.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I make gravity huge, almost infinite, the object will always be attracted to the center of the earth.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It seems like the trend is that if gravity is stronger, you have to throw it a little harder.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If it's weaker, you don't have to throw it as hard to maintain the circular orbit.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, remember when Dr. Fara said that there were 2 reasons why the Principia Mathematica

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was truly revolutionary? We can now go to the first one.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
[Dr. Fara] It establishes one single law of gravitation

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that extends right through the whole universe.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Before that--well, a couple of hundred years before that--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
everybody followed the Aristotelian idea that there was one set of laws on earth

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and a completely different set of laws up in the heavens,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so that in the heaves everything is perfection and unchanging and eternal,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and on earth everything is changing and corrupt.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Galileo first but the Newton brought all those changing ideas together

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and said, no, there's one force that extends right through the universe.
