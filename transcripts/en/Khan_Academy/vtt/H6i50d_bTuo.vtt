00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.052
- Hi, this Sal of the Khan Academy.

00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:08.798
And you know, we've always
had a lot of content

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:11.738
on Khan Academy for the various AP tests.

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:13.600
And we've actually been building out a lot

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.968
for American History.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:17.313
So I'm here with Kim, who's our history

00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:19.069
or American History fellow.

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:21.998
And what do you bring
to the table here, Kim?

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.292
Did we just find you on the street?

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:25.046
- No, actually.

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:28.595
So I used to teach college
history for a number of years,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.422
and last year I actually
graded the AP US History exam,

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:35.027
so I have a pretty good insight

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:36.805
into what the graders are looking for

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:39.538
when you're looking at the test.

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.726
- And what we're hoping to do,

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.024
we did an AP review for
calculus a couple of days ago

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:46.497
and it seemed to be really successful.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:47.915
So we thought it would do today.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.980
But this is still a
little bit groundbreaking

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.213
and we're still figuring it out,

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:52.570
just in terms of how to
do these live streams.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.300
So give us your feedback,
give us your questions

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.629
on the comment thread below this.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.048
But this is pretty exciting.

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:00.924
I think you're part of the
first ever live streaming

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:02.958
AP American History review session

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.445
in like, all of history.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:05.701
(laughs)

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.629
- So this is a historic event.

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:09.462
- That will one day make our timeline

00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.319
of major points of American history,

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:12.854
the live stream.

00:01:12.854 --> 00:01:14.271
So what are we...

00:01:16.797 --> 00:01:18.611
I guess there's a bunch of
ways we could tackle this.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.899
We have some stuff here.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.320
It looks like you've made a timeline

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.594
of all of American history.

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:24.161
- Yes, this is my beautiful timeline.

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:27.040
- And so maybe we could first go through

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.647
just a quick overview of it,

00:01:28.647 --> 00:01:30.457
just so everyone here,
including myself, has context.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:34.290
And then, you've put
together a pretty neat...

00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:37.038
I would say kind of high-level study guide

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:38.562
that has the different periods

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:41.145
as well as the different themes

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.465
that the AP American History test.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:48.838
- So we've uploaded a
screenshot of this to Facebook

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:50.516
so you can take a look at it yourself.

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:52.549
But basically what we're doing here

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.464
is taking kind of the thousand-yard
view of American history

00:01:56.464 --> 00:02:01.083
and examining these themes
like migration and labor

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.370
over time, to kind of give you a sense

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.008
of how things are moving

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:06.878
that will help you build intuition

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:09.220
about what's going on
in a particular moment

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.626
in American history.

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:12.979
- And not only will this help, I think,

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.879
everyone understand the
layers of American history,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.342
but these are often just called out

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:17.805
on the essay portion of the exam.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.804
Or even the multiple choice.

00:02:19.804 --> 00:02:20.895
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.522
So this will kind of build
that backbone for you,

00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:25.931
so that when you're sitting down

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:27.237
to answer an essay question,

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:28.576
sitting down to write a
multiple choice question,

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:30.430
you can say, "Oh, what was going on

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.203
"in American culture in the early 1900s?

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:34.843
"Oh yeah, this was the jazz age.

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.858
"This was a period of internationalism."

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:39.441
- Awesome, awesome.

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:42.972
Well, I know people
are watching from home.

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:45.505
They probably can't read this

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:47.105
while I'm just holding it up like this,

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:48.921
but you, it's available for download.

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.629
We'll make that more
obvious, if it's not already.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.864
So let's get started.

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:56.832
Let's do a walkthrough of what, 400...

00:02:56.832 --> 00:02:58.942
No, 600 years of history.

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:00.784
- Yeah, it's 600, and
that's not counting--

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:02.812
- And we're gonna do it multiple times.

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:06.688
We're gonna try to do it
seven times in an hour.

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:08.093
- Yeah, so that's not
counting 15,000 years ago,

00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:10.484
when people actually crossed
the Bering land bridge

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:12.089
into the continental North America.

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.701
So we're kind of skipping forward in time

00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:18.565
to say there were many native peoples

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.813
who were living on the
American continent in 1492,

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:24.986
which was this moment of contact

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:26.928
between Europeans and Native Americans.

00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:28.237
- You have it right there.

00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:31.354
And then we see that you have the contact,

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:34.391
but then what's the
significance of Jamestown?

00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.139
Why does this make this timeline?

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.424
- Right.

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:39.745
So the first kind of
100 years of settlement

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:41.682
on the North American continent

00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:43.171
is like the Spanish,

00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:45.675
they're trying to just mine
things, there's traders.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:47.334
So these are people who
are taking resources

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:49.758
from the New World and
bringing it back to the old.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:51.328
They have no intention of staying.

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:54.162
It's when we get to
Jamestown and Plymouth Rock

00:03:54.162 --> 00:03:55.741
and Massachusetts Bay,

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.411
this is when English settlers are coming

00:03:57.411 --> 00:03:59.263
to what will be the United States

00:03:59.263 --> 00:04:01.396
and planning on living there.

00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:02.696
- I see.

00:04:02.696 --> 00:04:04.109
So this is your first,

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.162
Roanoke and all this was
the first permanent--

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:08.960
- First permanent settlement--

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.382
- First permanent settlement.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.480
- [Kim] In what would
be the United States.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.596
- And that's a little after 1600,

00:04:13.596 --> 00:04:15.439
it was 1608 or something like that.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.216
And then, and then you get to kind of

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.555
the formation of the country.

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:19.820
What was going on in this,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.445
this really 200 year period?

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:25.607
- So that's kind of what we
would call the colonial period.

00:04:25.607 --> 00:04:28.094
And this is when there
are various colonies.

00:04:28.094 --> 00:04:30.200
We've got Massachusetts and Virginia

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.066
and Georgia and Pennsylvania,

00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:34.339
who are all pretty much
doing their own thing.

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:39.245
And they're mostly focused on
trade and farming, commerce.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.535
And they don't really see themselves

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:44.074
as being even really part of a nation,

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:46.907
or really anything other
than British subjects

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:49.137
who are on the wrong side of an ocean.

00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:52.179
It's kind of in this mid-1700s period

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:55.627
when the British Empire
starts really paying attention

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:56.960
to the colonies.

00:04:57.856 --> 00:04:59.226
They're saying, "Wait a minute,

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:02.179
"aren't you supposed to be
helping us out economically?

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:04.394
"Why aren't we taxing you more?"

00:05:04.394 --> 00:05:06.415
- Why did they start paying attention?

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:07.956
Just, they got big enough and
there was enough people there

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:09.964
and their economies were
large enough to matter?

00:05:09.964 --> 00:05:13.970
- Yeah, that and there's an
economic depression in England.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.742
They have a lot of debt
they wanna pay off.

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:16.965
So they look across the ocean and say,

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:19.714
"We have a lot of people over there

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:22.075
"that we could be making
more money off of."

00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:24.827
And for the American colonists

00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:29.414
who are very used to British
power being super hands-off,

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:31.744
this is not okay with them at all.

00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:32.915
- They didn't want that money

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.574
just to kind of provide benefits
to the English citizens.

00:05:35.574 --> 00:05:37.422
This was during an age of empire,

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:40.670
where they're competing with
the French and the Spanish.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.804
- So there's this Seven Years War,

00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:45.848
also known as the French and Indian War,

00:05:45.848 --> 00:05:48.285
where the American
colonists and the British

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:50.145
are fighting against the French

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:52.041
and their Native American allies.

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.802
And this, eventually the British succeed

00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:56.119
and the colonists succeed,

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.019
but now England's in a lot of debt.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.320
They wanna tax the colonists
to make up that debt,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.628
and the colonists are saying,
"Oh, we already helped enough.

00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:07.178
"We actually provided some
manpower to do this fighting."

00:06:07.178 --> 00:06:09.151
So that's when they start really rebelling

00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:10.850
against British taxation.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.606
- And not to dig too deep,
we're trying to do it fast,

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.184
but I always find it funny,

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:15.667
you know, Seven Years War,
what I learned in American

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.111
history like oh, the Seven Years War,

00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:20.099
or the French and Indian
War, but as you say

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.546
the Seven Years War it's
part of a larger theater,

00:06:22.546 --> 00:06:24.034
it wasn't just in the US.

00:06:24.034 --> 00:06:25.951
- This is a global war and
it's hard for us to see this

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:28.987
but this these empires all over the world

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:31.965
who are competing for
territory and resources

00:06:31.965 --> 00:06:36.017
so this is just one small
part of a much larger war

00:06:36.017 --> 00:06:37.412
over empire.

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:40.374
- And then that kind
of tensions build and--

00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:41.967
- Revolution!

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.412
(laughs)

00:06:43.412 --> 00:06:46.316
As far as revolutions go,
the American Revolution

00:06:46.316 --> 00:06:48.497
is maybe a boring one, right?

00:06:48.497 --> 00:06:50.529
This is a revolution over taxes.

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.648
- I've seen some very
non-boring memes about it.

00:06:52.648 --> 00:06:56.244
- But it's got this sort
of very revolutionary idea

00:06:56.244 --> 00:06:58.987
of these enlightenment thinkers.

00:06:58.987 --> 00:07:00.888
- Oh I see 'cause you're
saying with economic

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.013
but then there's
principles underlying that.

00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:07.639
- Right, so the principles
of consent of the govern

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.185
is where government draws its power

00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:11.926
instead of absolute monarchy,

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:14.563
this is kind of the
birth of true democracy

00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:16.384
in the United States.

00:07:16.384 --> 00:07:18.794
It is going to really
spread throughout the world,

00:07:18.794 --> 00:07:21.684
the ideas from the
revolution go many places

00:07:21.684 --> 00:07:22.962
in the world.

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:24.101
And it's a successful revolution

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:27.187
and I mean it is unique and it inspires

00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:30.276
the French Revolution in
certain ways and so now

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:33.940
you have, and revolution,
1776 you have the

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.024
Declaration of Independence
but it isn't until

00:07:36.024 --> 00:07:39.774
the late 1780s that you
have the constitution

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.924
as we know it.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.337
- Right, and the constitution

00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:49.663
is kind of the blueprint
of American government.

00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:52.248
So before that there was the
articles of confederation

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:54.997
which was a very weak government system.

00:07:54.997 --> 00:07:59.435
They had just fought against
this tyrannical power abroad

00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:01.505
and they were saying alright,
well we're gonna make sure

00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:02.943
that we don't have a central government

00:08:02.943 --> 00:08:04.984
that is going to be tyrannical at home.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.765
Unfortunately that meant
that their government

00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:10.581
couldn't do anything so the constitution

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.702
is kind of this amendment saying okay,

00:08:12.702 --> 00:08:15.207
we are going to organize our
government into a judicial,

00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:17.145
executive, and legislative branch.

00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:20.053
- It was completely a redo.

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:21.235
- It was completely a redo.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.906
And they basically built
the system of government

00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:26.470
with its checks and balances
that we still have today.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.140
- Yeah, and so this new
country, pretty close

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.481
to the turn of the century,
now we get into the 1800s.

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:37.152
- Yeah, and so the 1800s
for the United States

00:08:37.152 --> 00:08:39.924
is really this period of
expansion both sort of

00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:42.675
expansion of markets,
expansion of technology,

00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:45.395
and literal territorial expansion.

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:49.566
So early on there's
kind of the War of 1812

00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:52.331
which we call maybe revolution part two.

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.775
British leave us alone,
really, we meant it.

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:55.858
Followed by--

00:08:57.192 --> 00:08:58.514
- What was it?

00:08:58.514 --> 00:09:02.681
The British were, they were
back, what was the factor

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:04.913
that brought them back?

00:09:04.913 --> 00:09:08.519
- Oh, well they never
really left, actually.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.530
(laughs)

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.728
- They were in Canada.

00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:13.165
- Yeah they're in Canada,
they're in the Great Lakes,

00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:14.734
and what really led the United States

00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:16.890
to declare war on England
is the impressment

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.014
of American soldiers which
are sailors which meant that

00:09:21.014 --> 00:09:23.458
British ships, the most
powerful Navy in the world,

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.998
would be stopping American
ships and saying hey,

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.808
all you Americans, you
must be British sailors

00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:31.728
who jumped ship, you belong to us now.

00:09:31.728 --> 00:09:35.895
So the American government
declares war and they kind of

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.925
get this final go ahead
saying alright, England,

00:09:39.925 --> 00:09:41.364
get out of our affairs.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:43.447
- Okay, so US wins again.

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:45.365
- Yes.

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:47.985
- And as we're expanding territorially

00:09:47.985 --> 00:09:51.930
there's kind of tensions
building in line with that

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.477
expansion.

00:09:53.477 --> 00:09:56.437
- Yeah, and the tension here
is the existence of slavery.

00:09:56.437 --> 00:10:00.604
Slavery started in the United
States back in the 1620s

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:03.694
so this was kind of the--

00:10:03.694 --> 00:10:05.983
- Shortly after Jamestown.

00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:07.559
- Yeah, shortly after Jamestown.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:11.041
So enslaved people from
African and the West Indies

00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:15.071
are being brought to what
will become the United States

00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:19.909
and later the United States
as laborers for cash crops.

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:22.235
So they are working in cotton fields,

00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:23.721
they're working on tobacco.

00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:28.374
And even though the
American Revolution is built

00:10:28.374 --> 00:10:30.585
on this idea of all
men are created equal--

00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:33.758
- Should draw a parallel line
to show this roughly here.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:35.730
I mean all this is slavery.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.563
- Yep.

00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:45.968
They just really did not
solve the problem of slavery.

00:10:48.962 --> 00:10:52.077
So to get the cooperation
of the southern states

00:10:52.077 --> 00:10:55.908
at the time of the revolution,
they kind of punted

00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:59.828
on this issue of slavery and
they continue throughout--

00:10:59.828 --> 00:11:02.198
- The founding documents
are very principled on

00:11:02.198 --> 00:11:05.486
people being equal and
life, liberty, all of that,

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:09.205
but yes, it was kind of like
okay, we'll not dig in too deep

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:11.970
on what that means right
now, just so we're unified.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.026
- Exactly.

00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:14.482
- But as we added territory,

00:11:14.482 --> 00:11:18.716
why did that somehow exacerbate the issue?

00:11:18.716 --> 00:11:20.012
As we added territory?

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.235
- The problem would be kind
of the balance of power

00:11:22.235 --> 00:11:25.947
in between the north and the
south so the early stages

00:11:25.947 --> 00:11:27.114
in the United States

00:11:27.114 --> 00:11:29.379
and we can take a look
at our map if you want.

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:30.711
- If we can do this.

00:11:30.711 --> 00:11:33.961
- Aha, alright, this is a beautiful map

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:37.766
that I colored myself.

00:11:37.766 --> 00:11:39.125
(laughing)

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:40.125
That's right.

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:43.292
So when the United States was founded,

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.537
so here are the 13 colonies there in red

00:11:47.537 --> 00:11:49.893
and then with the treaty
of Britain at the end

00:11:49.893 --> 00:11:51.971
of the American Revolution
we get all this territory.

00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:54.000
- These were already British territories.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.467
Britain hangs out up here.

00:11:55.467 --> 00:11:56.650
- [Kim] Right.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.747
And way over there.

00:11:57.747 --> 00:12:00.914
But then as the 19th century wears on,

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:06.413
first Jefferson acquires
a whole bunch of territory

00:12:06.413 --> 00:12:09.454
in 1803 in the Louisiana Purchase.

00:12:09.454 --> 00:12:11.644
- I always found that
interesting because it's often

00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:14.211
billed as like deal of
the century but Napoleon

00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:17.094
was in charge of France,
he's fighting these wars,

00:12:17.094 --> 00:12:20.082
and his navy was kind of being defeated.

00:12:20.082 --> 00:12:22.030
He's like well I can't
protect that anyway.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.104
- Yeah.

00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:24.706
So he sells it off and he
gets a whole bunch of money

00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:28.075
to help pay for his wars
over on the other continent.

00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:31.311
So we've got this whole
bunch of land and then

00:12:31.311 --> 00:12:35.069
with the Mexican War all of this land.

00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:38.598
And so you can see it kind of
goes right over the boundary

00:12:38.598 --> 00:12:41.167
where slavery existed in the south

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:44.917
and this is kind of the
line of slavery here.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.013
- We have a lot of videos
on this on Khan Academy

00:12:48.013 --> 00:12:49.318
if people wanna dig deeper into is.

00:12:49.318 --> 00:12:50.542
- Yes, we do.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:53.115
And then this is the free area up here.

00:12:53.115 --> 00:12:57.573
So they had managed to
keep their representation

00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:00.188
in the federal government
relatively equal,

00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:03.228
so they had 11 states that were free,

00:13:03.228 --> 00:13:05.630
11 states that permitted slavery,

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.332
and then as new states started to form

00:13:08.332 --> 00:13:10.115
out of these territories,

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.262
that might upset the apple cart, upset

00:13:12.262 --> 00:13:15.293
the balance of power so they just kind of.

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:18.355
- Because if there were
more free states in congress

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:21.143
they might be more likely
to abolish slavery.

00:13:21.143 --> 00:13:24.998
- Or in general pass laws
that would be more beneficial

00:13:24.998 --> 00:13:27.996
to people who weren't
part of the slave economy.

00:13:27.996 --> 00:13:29.447
- And this wasn't even just,

00:13:29.447 --> 00:13:31.152
I mean I'm sure there
were people on both sides

00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:33.279
on like a principle level
like slavery is good or bad,

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.406
it was also an economic, I
remember you told me once

00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:37.674
Lincoln's father was kind
of put out of business

00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.380
because he couldn't compete
with the plantations.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.501
- Exactly.

00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:44.355
Right, so there are many
white people who are living

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:46.711
in the north, who are living
in what's now the midwest

00:13:46.711 --> 00:13:50.544
who they didn't have any
real moral opposition

00:13:51.642 --> 00:13:54.995
to slavery, what they wanted
was to be able to move out

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:57.906
to this area and not have
to compete with someone

00:13:57.906 --> 00:14:01.806
maybe moving from here with
100 slaves who he doesn't

00:14:01.806 --> 00:14:03.131
have to pay.

00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:07.298
How is this guy gonna be able
to sell his grain for less

00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:10.608
than someone who's got free labor?

00:14:10.608 --> 00:14:14.809
- Yeah so you have this,
most of this is the 1800s,

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.142
this is the 1800s, Manifest Destiny.

00:14:17.142 --> 00:14:20.566
- Right, this is the era
of Manifest Destiny so

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:24.071
these tensions really
continue as they're trying

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.330
to balance power and then in the course

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.669
of the 1850s there are
more moral arguments

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.032
about slavery, the
abolitionists are saying

00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:34.939
slavery is evil, slavery
is wrong, they're right,

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:37.264
we've got to end it now, it doesn't matter

00:14:37.264 --> 00:14:38.848
what's happening over here.

00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:40.778
All slavery needs to go.

00:14:40.778 --> 00:14:43.544
And then there are sort
of apologists for slavery

00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:47.143
in the south who are
saying you know, slavery

00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:51.818
is a good thing, we've done
so much for these people

00:14:51.818 --> 00:14:55.050
and so there's this true clash.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.071
- There's a video you
uploaded where you did

00:14:57.071 --> 00:14:59.455
an AP American History, they had a passage

00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:01.169
from one of these apologists.

00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:02.530
So this isn't you making it up, this was

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.544
actually a quote from one of these people.

00:15:04.544 --> 00:15:07.039
Fascinating, fascinating.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.372
So this is the 1800s.

00:15:08.372 --> 00:15:10.759
And also it's worth noting
that the American Indians

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:14.703
were also kind of being pushed
back at this time period.

00:15:14.703 --> 00:15:18.203
- Right and the 1800s are a rotten century

00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:22.155
for Native Americans, maybe not as rotten

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:25.824
as kind of this period of
great death from disease

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.912
that's happening really early in contact

00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:31.431
but this is a time when
Native American lands

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.173
just continue to shrink
and shrink and shrink

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:37.751
and even Native Americans
who followed the rules,

00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:40.371
they assimilated, they
converted to Christianity,

00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:44.371
found that they were still
forced out into further and

00:15:44.371 --> 00:15:46.204
further Western lands.

00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:50.144
Because whites wanted those lands.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:57.567
- In this broader world
context that also was where

00:15:57.567 --> 00:16:00.398
the US started going from
this kind of agrarian

00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:03.269
because the Industrial
Revolution it was kind of

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:06.006
and economic power that can start to rival

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.396
the powers of Europe.

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:09.944
- Yeah and I think that's
sort of a good takeaway

00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:11.937
for the era after the Civil War

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:15.616
so we have this great
conflict of the Civil War.

00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:18.283
- Powderkeg ignites right there.

00:16:19.522 --> 00:16:23.439
- And 1861 to 1865 and
the North, the free part

00:16:25.972 --> 00:16:29.153
of the United States
prevails so slavery is over

00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:31.600
and there's this kind of brief period

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.042
in the South where African Americans have

00:16:35.042 --> 00:16:37.060
guaranteed civil rights, basically.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.273
They've got a military there
protecting their civil rights.

00:16:39.273 --> 00:16:43.399
And then at the end of
Reconstruction in 1877,

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:46.279
the North kind of gives
up on protecting them

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:49.013
and so that starts the era of Jim Crow.

00:16:49.013 --> 00:16:53.728
- It's kind of an occupied
territory until that point.

00:16:53.728 --> 00:16:54.729
- Yeah.

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:57.390
- And so this is where you
have Jim Crow beginning.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.591
And what is Jim Crow?

00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:00.347
You always hear that word, I mean.

00:17:00.347 --> 00:17:02.097
- So Jim Crow was a--

00:17:04.016 --> 00:17:06.074
- [Sal] Is there an E at the end?

00:17:06.074 --> 00:17:08.865
- No, just crow like the bird.

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:13.535
It was a system of segregation
so de jour segregation

00:17:13.535 --> 00:17:17.618
or segregation by law that
said that it was legal

00:17:19.313 --> 00:17:23.802
for whites and blacks to
be in separate places.

00:17:23.802 --> 00:17:26.870
So this is the idea of separate
but equal that comes up

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.032
in the late 19th century saying
that it is perfectly fine

00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:32.898
to send black children
only to black schools,

00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:34.761
it's perfectly fine to send white children

00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:36.061
only to white schools.

00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:37.791
- This is developing and then
there's barriers to voting

00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.840
and things like that and
that continues all the way

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.820
to the--
- The 1950s, 1960s.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.089
- Maybe I'll do Jim Crow in
a slightly different color

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:48.922
but that continues all
the way until you know.

00:17:51.522 --> 00:17:52.826
- [Kim] Yeah.

00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:56.139
- Something like that, that's
Jim Crow right over there.

00:17:56.139 --> 00:17:59.016
And as you said, this
coincides with the Industrial

00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:01.144
Revolution, the US really
getting its footing

00:18:01.144 --> 00:18:03.629
as, maybe people didn't realize it,

00:18:03.629 --> 00:18:06.779
but it was quietly becoming a world power.

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:08.544
- Exactly, and part of that is--

00:18:08.544 --> 00:18:10.895
- [Sal] Or a power, it wasn't
like on the world stage yet.

00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:12.211
- Right.

00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:15.072
So the North went to all
this industrial production

00:18:15.072 --> 00:18:17.408
to win the Civil War and
then they have all these

00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:18.979
factories, what are
they gonna do with them?

00:18:18.979 --> 00:18:20.123
They're gonna build stuff.

00:18:20.123 --> 00:18:24.290
Specifically steel for
railroads and so really by 1900

00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:27.638
the United States is the world's leading

00:18:27.638 --> 00:18:28.815
industrial power.

00:18:28.815 --> 00:18:31.392
We make more stuff than anybody else.

00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:34.226
- And then that gives us, and
we start flexing that power

00:18:34.226 --> 00:18:36.342
a little bit, you get
the Spanish American War

00:18:36.342 --> 00:18:38.521
right at around the same time, going into

00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:39.844
the turn of the century.

00:18:39.844 --> 00:18:42.577
- And that's a war, an
imperial war against Spain

00:18:42.577 --> 00:18:45.342
which the United States
is basically looking

00:18:45.342 --> 00:18:48.708
to flex its muscles saying
we've got this big navy,

00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:52.466
we're super wealthy,
we've got great industry,

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:55.512
let's let everybody know we're in power.

00:18:55.512 --> 00:18:58.740
- What was the given cause
and what is the actual cause?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.517
- The given cause was
that the Spanish in Cuba

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.126
were oppressing the
Cubans who were rebelling

00:19:05.126 --> 00:19:08.667
against Spanish rule and
then when the United States

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:11.559
sent a ship down there to
protect American interests,

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:15.506
that ship, the USS Maine
exploded in Havana Harbor.

00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:19.465
It was probably a boiler
malfunction, but the United States

00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:21.510
said oh no, they totally blew it up,

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.238
the Spanish sabotaged our
ship so they went to war,

00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:27.571
they won easily I would say.

00:19:28.699 --> 00:19:31.091
- Explosions on ships are
often used to justify war.

00:19:31.091 --> 00:19:32.779
Only to later be found.

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:35.117
Gulf of Tonkin Revolution later on.

00:19:35.117 --> 00:19:39.284
- So yeah after this the United
States becomes an empire,

00:19:40.405 --> 00:19:42.316
they have islands in the Pacific,

00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:46.676
islands in the Caribbean and
those islands are pretty much--

00:19:46.676 --> 00:19:48.113
- Part of the Philippines.

00:19:48.113 --> 00:19:49.266
- Yeah.

00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:51.742
And there's no path to
statehood for those islands.

00:19:51.742 --> 00:19:54.212
The United States has never
before taken territory,

00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:57.213
they never expected the
people who lived there

00:19:57.213 --> 00:19:58.473
to become citizens.

00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:00.007
- And that to some degree is almost

00:20:00.007 --> 00:20:01.006
the definition of empire.

00:20:01.006 --> 00:20:02.014
- Exactly.

00:20:02.014 --> 00:20:03.293
- It's when you have control over people

00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:05.223
who are not formal members of your nation.

00:20:05.223 --> 00:20:08.298
- Right, and contrast that
with the American Revolution,

00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:09.774
right?

00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:12.053
How much did the people
in the United States,

00:20:12.053 --> 00:20:13.633
what would be the United States,

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:17.340
like having a power across
the ocean in charge of them?

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.860
Not at all.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.312
So it's quite a turnaround
for the United States

00:20:21.312 --> 00:20:24.168
to take on that role as
the power across the ocean

00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:27.078
to a people that isn't self-governing.

00:20:27.078 --> 00:20:28.496
- Yep, yep.

00:20:28.496 --> 00:20:30.969
And so now we go, this is
kind of more modern times,

00:20:30.969 --> 00:20:33.868
and this is where, just as
a reminder, Khan Academy

00:20:33.868 --> 00:20:36.469
has a lot of content on modern times.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:37.819
You've done a lot on the civil rights,

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:40.455
I've worked on the world
wars, so for anyone who wants

00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:43.545
deeper context here, go there.

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:45.414
We actually have a lot on
the revolutionary period.

00:20:45.414 --> 00:20:48.014
- Yeah, we heard a lot from
students when we started

00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:51.018
this project saying my
teacher is trying so hard

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:55.987
but she can't get past 1945
or my teacher slowed down,

00:20:55.987 --> 00:20:58.745
we never got past Vietnam
and so what we did

00:20:58.745 --> 00:21:00.850
was say let's start there.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.208
So if that's a place where you're feeling

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:06.131
less confident, Khan Academy
has a ton of material

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.249
in that period just to help
students who are struggling

00:21:09.249 --> 00:21:12.649
with the later stages of American history.

00:21:12.649 --> 00:21:15.765
- It's videos, it's
exercises, it's articles.

00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:17.645
We actually have a few
overview videos of all of

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.197
American history too,
we're kind of making one

00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:20.227
as we speak right now live.

00:21:20.227 --> 00:21:24.238
So we go into World War One
which that wasn't really

00:21:24.238 --> 00:21:25.957
an American war.

00:21:25.957 --> 00:21:27.947
- Not really, the United
States only gets involved

00:21:27.947 --> 00:21:32.251
really late in 1917 and
that's because the Germans

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:36.001
continued to attack US
ships in the Atlantic.

00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:39.517
- Yeah the Lusitania famously.

00:21:39.517 --> 00:21:43.452
But this was, I mean this is
kind when the US is like wow,

00:21:43.452 --> 00:21:45.097
they can tip the balance.

00:21:45.097 --> 00:21:49.267
- Yeah, it shows that they're
a real player on the world

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:53.124
stage and someone like Woodrow
Wilson tries to negotiate

00:21:53.124 --> 00:21:54.981
what would become the League of Nations,

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:58.226
the first international
organization for keeping the peace.

00:21:58.226 --> 00:22:00.959
- Which clearly does not work out.

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:02.150
- Doesn't work.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.463
And the United States never joins it

00:22:03.463 --> 00:22:06.307
because there's sort of
this isolationist streak.

00:22:06.307 --> 00:22:08.731
A lot of people said oh
man, we should not have

00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:10.214
gotten involved in World War One

00:22:10.214 --> 00:22:12.396
and we don't want to get
involved in another war

00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:14.584
if we commit to being part of one of these

00:22:14.584 --> 00:22:16.927
international peacekeeping organizations.

00:22:16.927 --> 00:22:21.179
- The US is still kind of not
fully wants to be out there,

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:23.133
the world's policeman so to speak.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.680
- Yeah, and I mean they have
an ocean in between them,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.558
a lot of those problems,
which has worked out

00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:30.417
pretty well for them up until this point.

00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:32.994
You have the space to develop
without having to fight

00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:34.136
wars all the time.

00:22:34.136 --> 00:22:36.045
- Absolutely, absolutely.

00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:37.975
And so we go into that post war period

00:22:37.975 --> 00:22:41.076
and while you describe
the '20s right before

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:42.627
we get into the stock market crash.

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.971
- Well the '20s are kind
of this era of consumerism

00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:48.149
right, this is when we've got all sorts of

00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:51.605
cool new gadgets like radios and cars

00:22:51.605 --> 00:22:53.926
and people are buying them on credit

00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:58.093
so there's this massive
expansion of American consumerism

00:22:59.012 --> 00:23:02.447
and also American dabbling
in the stock market.

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:05.454
That was not something
that an ordinary person did

00:23:05.454 --> 00:23:06.762
before the 1920s.

00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:10.151
It seemed like a really
fun game right up until it

00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:13.026
didn't seem like a fun game at all.

00:23:13.026 --> 00:23:15.253
- Until it crashed and you get the crash

00:23:15.253 --> 00:23:16.626
and then we're in the Depression.

00:23:16.626 --> 00:23:17.953
The Great Depression.

00:23:17.953 --> 00:23:19.653
- Yeah, so the Great Depression.

00:23:19.653 --> 00:23:21.532
- It wasn't the first depression,
we talk a lot about it,

00:23:21.532 --> 00:23:22.889
it's the most recent great depression.

00:23:22.889 --> 00:23:24.240
- Yeah.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.064
The economics of the United
States since the development

00:23:28.064 --> 00:23:30.026
of American economy have
always kind of been on this

00:23:30.026 --> 00:23:32.557
20 year cycle of boom and
bust and there are a whole

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:36.753
bunch of other panic
of 1837, panic of 1819,

00:23:36.753 --> 00:23:39.187
panic of, there's a panic every 20 years

00:23:39.187 --> 00:23:42.874
when there's a bubble that
bursts but no bubble burst

00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:45.874
as badly as the bubble of the 1920s.

00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:50.571
- Great Depression, and
what effect did that have

00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:51.659
on the country?

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:53.870
It was just a bad time
and we got out of it,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.349
or has it somehow changed the fabric of?

00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:58.352
- Oh yeah, I mean this
was really the birth

00:23:58.352 --> 00:24:02.117
of the federal government having an idea

00:24:02.117 --> 00:24:05.220
that they have a responsibility
for citizens's welfare.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.244
Right, I mean for most
of American history,

00:24:08.244 --> 00:24:11.870
the biggest influence the
federal government had on your

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.366
life was the post office.

00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:15.665
That's the only time you
saw the federal government.

00:24:15.665 --> 00:24:18.439
- Which is one of the themes
we'll talk more about.

00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:22.016
The US has always been very
much a, both an individualistic

00:24:22.016 --> 00:24:25.348
but also kind of states have a lot of,

00:24:25.348 --> 00:24:27.121
it's very decentralized.

00:24:27.121 --> 00:24:28.122
- Yes.

00:24:28.122 --> 00:24:29.381
- People have been very suspicious

00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:30.398
of the central government.

00:24:30.398 --> 00:24:33.169
- So really that's it, the post office,

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:36.145
until the Civil War when
Lincoln expands a lot

00:24:36.145 --> 00:24:38.784
of federal power and institutes the draft

00:24:38.784 --> 00:24:42.261
for the first time but it wasn't
until the Great Depression

00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:46.130
that the federal government
said it's up to us to make sure

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.212
that our citizens aren't
starving in the street.

00:24:49.212 --> 00:24:52.006
It's up to us to make
sure that when you're old

00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:55.185
you can still live well
when you're not able to work

00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:58.007
anymore, so that's kind
of the expansion of what

00:24:58.007 --> 00:25:00.382
we call the social welfare state.

00:25:00.382 --> 00:25:02.814
- And FDR shows up and he's kind of,

00:25:02.814 --> 00:25:05.251
people talk about Keynesien economics.

00:25:05.251 --> 00:25:06.591
- Yeah.

00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:09.004
- He uses it on a massive
scale, building dams and

00:25:09.004 --> 00:25:12.056
some of it was actually to
provide energy and all this

00:25:12.056 --> 00:25:14.826
but also the theory is
to jumpstart the economy,

00:25:14.826 --> 00:25:18.006
to utilize all that excess
capacity to get the,

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:21.761
and that kind of starts
how you've got FDR but then

00:25:21.761 --> 00:25:24.144
it really the Depression ends with--

00:25:24.144 --> 00:25:25.236
- With World War Two.

00:25:25.236 --> 00:25:27.256
- Yeah clearly we weren't
all done in Europe with

00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:28.463
World War One.

00:25:28.463 --> 00:25:31.426
- No, and World War Two, the United States

00:25:31.426 --> 00:25:33.532
had continued to be very isolationist

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:37.754
throughout the 1930s,
their idea was we've got

00:25:37.754 --> 00:25:41.904
enough problems so they really
tried not to get involved

00:25:41.904 --> 00:25:44.481
in World War Two as it
was beginning in Europe

00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:48.564
but then in 1941 the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor

00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:53.874
and so the United States
joined this world war.

00:25:53.874 --> 00:25:56.499
- It was already going, the
Japanese had invaded China

00:25:56.499 --> 00:25:59.899
in the late '30s or
actually in the early '30s

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:03.104
and then you have the
Germans had invaded Poland

00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:05.860
well before the US joined in the war.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.456
- And the Germans and
the Japanese are allies

00:26:08.456 --> 00:26:11.873
so after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:17.093
the Germans actually
proactively declared war

00:26:17.093 --> 00:26:18.235
on the United States.

00:26:18.235 --> 00:26:21.653
We might not actually have
gone into the war with Germany

00:26:21.653 --> 00:26:26.054
had not the ally of Japan
already declared war on us.

00:26:26.054 --> 00:26:27.738
- Yeah, and it's unlikely
to be deeply covered

00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:30.344
on the AP History exam,
but these were major things

00:26:30.344 --> 00:26:31.503
for the US.

00:26:31.503 --> 00:26:33.381
'Cause a lot of people cite reparations

00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:35.989
and the Treaty of Versailles
and Germany kind of

00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:38.440
so you have a demagogue
like Hitler comes to power

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.938
and tries to kind of get
that German pride going

00:26:40.938 --> 00:26:43.581
and builds this war machine.

00:26:43.581 --> 00:26:46.817
That has got awfully close, scarily close.

00:26:46.817 --> 00:26:50.380
So then World War Two
ends and how is the US

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.451
relative to the rest of the
world after World War Two?

00:26:52.451 --> 00:26:54.500
- Well the United States kind of comes out

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.662
of World War Two, remember
they were on the other side

00:26:56.662 --> 00:26:59.564
of an ocean so they're
pretty much the only nation

00:26:59.564 --> 00:27:02.123
in the world whose industrial capacity

00:27:02.123 --> 00:27:03.828
is still functioning, right?

00:27:03.828 --> 00:27:06.253
The United States didn't get
bombed during World War Two.

00:27:06.253 --> 00:27:07.841
- Yeah, the other great industrial powers,

00:27:07.841 --> 00:27:11.272
talking about Germany,
England, or UK, France, Japan.

00:27:11.272 --> 00:27:15.501
They got, their factories were destroyed.

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:17.293
- Yeah, it's gonna take them
a long time to rebuild from

00:27:17.293 --> 00:27:20.289
that so the United States
really emerges as the world's

00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:23.948
preeminent industrial power,
they're supplying stuff

00:27:23.948 --> 00:27:24.948
to everyone.

00:27:26.204 --> 00:27:29.301
And then they're in sort
of a political standoff

00:27:29.301 --> 00:27:33.468
with the Soviet Union over
basically what economic

00:27:34.315 --> 00:27:37.031
and political form the world should take.

00:27:37.031 --> 00:27:40.656
- Yeah, you have (mumbles)
create this economic

00:27:40.656 --> 00:27:42.585
world order 'cause they're
competing against communism

00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:44.887
and they want that to win,
anyone who's aligned with them

00:27:44.887 --> 00:27:47.146
has a better economy
and then obviously also

00:27:47.146 --> 00:27:50.803
like a political and military escalation

00:27:50.803 --> 00:27:54.304
and then that goes all the
way until Vietnam which is,

00:27:54.304 --> 00:27:56.610
what's notable about Vietnam here?

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.494
It was I guess you could
say the hottest part

00:27:58.494 --> 00:27:59.505
of the Cold War.

00:27:59.505 --> 00:28:00.798
- [Kim] Yeah definitely.

00:28:00.798 --> 00:28:03.738
- Although maybe some of
the things of the '60s,

00:28:03.738 --> 00:28:05.769
Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile
Crisis got pretty hot.

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:07.597
- So the Cold War never
involves an actual war

00:28:07.597 --> 00:28:09.931
between the United States and Russia.

00:28:09.931 --> 00:28:12.126
They never actually are fighting against

00:28:12.126 --> 00:28:13.288
each other directly.

00:28:13.288 --> 00:28:15.584
Instead it involves a bunch of proxy wars

00:28:15.584 --> 00:28:19.338
or wars where the United
States is supporting one side,

00:28:19.338 --> 00:28:22.861
usually the side that is
associated with capitalism,

00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:26.527
and the USSR is supporting the other side

00:28:26.527 --> 00:28:29.113
that is associated with communism.

00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:32.250
So there's this sort of nationalist fight

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.858
we call it, sort of a civil war in Vietnam

00:28:34.858 --> 00:28:36.823
where northern Vietnam which was communist

00:28:36.823 --> 00:28:40.227
wanted to unite all of
Vietnam under communism

00:28:40.227 --> 00:28:43.423
and south Vietnam had
the United States' help

00:28:43.423 --> 00:28:45.468
in kind of staving that off.

00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:48.301
- And it's fascinating how
history all interweaves

00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.685
because Vietnam was a French
colony, during World War Two

00:28:52.685 --> 00:28:55.608
the French get overrun by
the British and then so

00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:59.448
the Japanese overrun and
so you're left with that

00:28:59.448 --> 00:29:03.075
and so there's kind of a power
vacuum after World War Two

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.623
and so you have these different
powers try to take hold

00:29:05.623 --> 00:29:08.728
but then you have communist
China to the north

00:29:08.728 --> 00:29:12.734
and the US and you have
(mumbles) containment

00:29:12.734 --> 00:29:16.155
and we have a lot, once
again, of content on this.

00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:18.237
You put Nixon resigning,
why is that notable?

00:29:18.237 --> 00:29:20.626
We only list about 15 or 20 things here,

00:29:20.626 --> 00:29:23.056
why is that, in 400 years
of American history?

00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:26.284
- Maybe it doesn't deserve
to be there, I don't know,

00:29:26.284 --> 00:29:29.867
but I just say Nixon
was the last president

00:29:31.975 --> 00:29:35.058
during Vietnam and he says he's
gonna get the United States

00:29:35.058 --> 00:29:36.322
out of Vietnam--

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:39.769
- And this was when both
parties, Vietnam, Kennedy,

00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:42.074
who's a democrat starts getting involved,

00:29:42.074 --> 00:29:44.970
then you have Johnson really escalates.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.061
- Right, I mean being
pro-communist was not a political

00:29:48.061 --> 00:29:49.478
position in the United States.

00:29:49.478 --> 00:29:53.645
So both democrats and
republicans were for a strong

00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:56.821
Cold War presence.

00:29:56.821 --> 00:29:58.890
- And then Nixon comes
in and everyone's saying

00:29:58.890 --> 00:29:59.890
that they wanna take us
out, it's not a popular war,

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.929
especially later on but
then they can't help

00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:03.656
but getting further and further sucked in.

00:30:03.656 --> 00:30:04.657
- Pretty much.

00:30:04.657 --> 00:30:08.058
So Nixon presides over this,
the war is kind of winding down

00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:12.225
and then it comes out that
Nixon has kind of worked to

00:30:13.237 --> 00:30:16.537
undermine the democratic
process by spying on his--

00:30:16.537 --> 00:30:18.238
- The famous Watergate.

00:30:18.238 --> 00:30:19.754
- Yeah, Watergate incident.

00:30:19.754 --> 00:30:23.315
Yeah, so this was real
kind of a black mark

00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:24.793
on American democracy.

00:30:24.793 --> 00:30:26.047
- But not the first.

00:30:26.047 --> 00:30:28.233
Sometimes we think modern
times, things in politics

00:30:28.233 --> 00:30:32.603
have gotten ugly and all
that but as you (mumbles)--

00:30:32.603 --> 00:30:34.300
- Politics has always been that way.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.776
- Politics has always been ugly.

00:30:35.776 --> 00:30:37.646
So then we go, the Cold War ends,

00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:38.913
that's definitely a big deal.

00:30:38.913 --> 00:30:40.234
Fall of communism.

00:30:40.234 --> 00:30:42.644
- Yeah so the end of
the 1980s, early 1990s,

00:30:42.644 --> 00:30:44.585
the Soviet Union collapses

00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:47.379
and you can kind of debate
how much the United States

00:30:47.379 --> 00:30:50.830
played a role in that,
most historians think that

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.497
it wasn't very much.

00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:56.751
- It was economic, some
would argue this arms race

00:30:56.751 --> 00:31:00.170
that Reagan helped
accelerate really broke,

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.813
our economy could somehow
survive that better

00:31:03.813 --> 00:31:05.422
than the Soviet economy could.

00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:08.915
- Well capitalism clearly
provided a better way of life

00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:12.270
than communism, but the
Soviet Union kind of

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.369
fell apart under the
weight of its own problems

00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:19.536
so by 1991, the United States
is the world's remaining

00:31:22.442 --> 00:31:23.934
superpower.

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:26.037
- And that's essentially
the world we live in today

00:31:26.037 --> 00:31:28.841
where you don't have
this kind of two powers,

00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:30.880
you have the United
States is the superpower

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.139
and you have the smaller
conflicts and frankly

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:36.751
more complex in a lot
of ways, fascinating.

00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:40.168
So, actually our timer is, went to sleep.

00:31:41.009 --> 00:31:42.259
We are on time.

00:31:44.243 --> 00:31:46.449
- [Kim] Alright so we still
have about half an hour left.

00:31:46.449 --> 00:31:47.776
- So that was cool.

00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:50.018
Let's talk a little about
some of these themes here.

00:31:50.018 --> 00:31:52.312
We'll probably touch on stuff
we already talked about,

00:31:52.312 --> 00:31:53.603
but just to reinforce it.

00:31:53.603 --> 00:31:55.508
So these are the themes
that come from the AP.

00:31:55.508 --> 00:31:56.707
- [Kim] Exactly.

00:31:56.707 --> 00:31:58.257
- It's like these layers
of American history.

00:31:58.257 --> 00:32:00.823
So the first one is
American national identity.

00:32:00.823 --> 00:32:02.192
So we talked a lot about that.

00:32:02.192 --> 00:32:05.365
- Yes, exactly, and this
kind of what does it mean

00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:06.752
to be an American?

00:32:06.752 --> 00:32:09.341
Who is an American and how
does that change over time?

00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:10.896
- Over here it's Native Americans.

00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:12.249
- Exactly.

00:32:12.249 --> 00:32:14.334
- And then, and you have
explorers kind of showing up

00:32:14.334 --> 00:32:16.505
for discovery or looking for gold.

00:32:16.505 --> 00:32:19.316
- Yeah and none of them are
thinking I'm an American now!

00:32:19.316 --> 00:32:21.245
They're thinking I'm Spanish
and I'm gonna go home

00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:22.779
with all my gold and live like a king.

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:24.798
- Yeah, and then you have English settlers

00:32:24.798 --> 00:32:27.474
and why would you want to get on a boat

00:32:27.474 --> 00:32:31.557
and go 3,000 miles and
live in forests and place?

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.081
- I mean, for some people it was money.

00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:38.298
For other people--

00:32:38.298 --> 00:32:40.829
- Economic land, if you're kind of a serf,

00:32:40.829 --> 00:32:42.359
essentially a serf in England.

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.941
- Yeah, England has a real
overpopulation problem

00:32:44.941 --> 00:32:47.656
at this time period so there
is a lot of poverty there.

00:32:47.656 --> 00:32:49.012
This, getting land.

00:32:49.012 --> 00:32:50.703
- Also religious freedom.

00:32:50.703 --> 00:32:53.319
Pilgrims and whoever
else they wanted to come

00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:55.653
and these people tended to be
more conservative religiously.

00:32:55.653 --> 00:32:57.545
They were somewhat ostracized in England.

00:32:57.545 --> 00:32:59.940
- Yes, yes, so this is the
Puritans that we're talking about

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.745
and this is a branch of
Protestant Christianity

00:33:02.745 --> 00:33:05.108
which is very strict.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:07.670
So they are, they're
not popular in England

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.376
because the Anglican church--

00:33:09.376 --> 00:33:11.080
- [Sal] Is not as strict.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.861
- Was in the ascendency
associated with the royal family

00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:18.831
so they can either be
persecuted in England

00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:20.893
or they can just give
up and go to a new world

00:33:20.893 --> 00:33:23.302
and make a society that
fits with their standards.

00:33:23.302 --> 00:33:26.703
- And so that's starting
to be, you start having

00:33:26.703 --> 00:33:30.490
the settlements, English
settlements in the current US,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.994
and then but at this
point people in the 1700s

00:33:34.994 --> 00:33:37.290
people consider themselves
English citizens.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.212
- They consider themselves
English citizens

00:33:39.212 --> 00:33:41.770
or maybe Pennsylvanians
or South Carolinians.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.693
They don't have a strong
American identity.

00:33:44.693 --> 00:33:46.699
- And then as we go through the Revolution

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:48.206
now the identity starts building.

00:33:48.206 --> 00:33:50.697
- Right and so they have
this sort of common cause

00:33:50.697 --> 00:33:54.502
against the British Empire
saying oh maybe we need

00:33:54.502 --> 00:33:58.252
to join or die, right,
as Ben Franklin wrote,

00:33:59.392 --> 00:34:02.963
and kind of develop an American spirit

00:34:02.963 --> 00:34:04.585
that will help defeat the British

00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:06.142
and make the United States free.

00:34:06.142 --> 00:34:08.312
- But to be clear, as
we already highlighted,

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:12.226
even at this point it was white males.

00:34:12.226 --> 00:34:14.798
- Right, and not just white
males but wealthy white males

00:34:14.798 --> 00:34:16.009
who own land.

00:34:16.009 --> 00:34:18.438
This is who an American citizen is.

00:34:18.438 --> 00:34:22.000
When Jefferson is considering
who do I want to vote

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.375
in this new republic, he's
not thinking everybody.

00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:29.209
He's thinking the wealthiest,
best educated landowners

00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:33.089
who have that specific stake
in the American nation.

00:34:33.089 --> 00:34:35.068
- I think we talk a lot
about things like slavery

00:34:35.068 --> 00:34:37.538
but women weren't participants in this.

00:34:37.538 --> 00:34:39.432
I would have put that on your timeline.

00:34:39.432 --> 00:34:40.691
We'll do that.

00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:42.274
When do women vote?

00:34:43.142 --> 00:34:45.167
- Women don't vote until 1920.

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:46.369
- Yes!

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:47.670
You see?

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.731
- I'm sorry, it was more
important than Nixon resigning.

00:34:50.731 --> 00:34:54.927
So this is, this is World
War One so somewhere

00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:55.932
right about there.

00:34:55.932 --> 00:34:57.031
- Here someplace.

00:34:57.031 --> 00:34:58.376
This is a long time.

00:34:58.376 --> 00:34:59.985
That's not even 100 years ago.

00:34:59.985 --> 00:35:01.093
- [Kim] I know.

00:35:01.093 --> 00:35:02.678
- So anyway, back to this.

00:35:02.678 --> 00:35:05.339
So right here it's, white, landowning men

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:07.282
was a lot of maybe what
some of the founding fathers

00:35:07.282 --> 00:35:09.589
were thinking, not all
of them but some of them.

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:11.984
But then it starts getting
a little bit broader.

00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:14.496
- Yeah, so if you think about
American national identity

00:35:14.496 --> 00:35:17.243
in this first part of the 19th century,

00:35:17.243 --> 00:35:19.860
I think you can think
about it first as democracy

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.823
expanding because by the
time Jackson is president

00:35:23.823 --> 00:35:27.490
in the 1820s, 1830s,
the American electorate

00:35:28.649 --> 00:35:31.228
expanded to all white men.

00:35:31.228 --> 00:35:32.649
You you didn't have to own property,

00:35:32.649 --> 00:35:36.816
you could be anyone who fits
the bill of white and male

00:35:37.811 --> 00:35:39.825
and cast a vote.

00:35:39.825 --> 00:35:43.057
But there's also kind of this
growing sectional identity,

00:35:43.057 --> 00:35:45.133
right, if you're thinking about yourself

00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:47.606
as an American, you're
probably thinking of yourself

00:35:47.606 --> 00:35:50.411
also as a northerner or a southerner.

00:35:50.411 --> 00:35:51.858
- [Sal] So early 1800s.

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:55.083
- Very strong sort of sectional division

00:35:55.083 --> 00:35:57.483
as far as identity goes.

00:35:57.483 --> 00:35:59.062
- [Sal] And does that
change with the Civil War?

00:35:59.062 --> 00:36:02.895
- Sort of, I mean the
version of America where

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:07.613
slavery is illegal prevails so I think

00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:11.531
that's part of the national
identity at that point.

00:36:11.531 --> 00:36:13.890
- Yeah, starts to shift, at least on paper

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.266
African Americans are allowed to vote,

00:36:16.266 --> 00:36:19.106
African American males
are allowed to vote.

00:36:19.106 --> 00:36:21.071
- Yes, and this is another
moment for women's rights

00:36:21.071 --> 00:36:24.518
because the 15th amendment
grants the right to vote

00:36:24.518 --> 00:36:27.478
to African American men and
they were already making

00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:30.035
an amendment to the constitution so a lot

00:36:30.035 --> 00:36:32.788
of women's rights activists
said alright, let's

00:36:32.788 --> 00:36:36.707
add women's rights to the 15th amendment

00:36:36.707 --> 00:36:38.278
and they didn't get it.

00:36:38.278 --> 00:36:39.815
- Fascinating.

00:36:39.815 --> 00:36:42.400
And so then we get, so we're
getting to this period,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.130
African Americans become
more citizens although

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.277
it depends on where they live and probably

00:36:48.277 --> 00:36:50.401
their economic situation
and things like that.

00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:53.521
And so what is kind of, we
talked about the European

00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:57.592
immigration in this period up
here being primarily English,

00:36:57.592 --> 00:37:00.281
when does it start becoming
from other parts of Europe?

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:03.043
- Well we would start kind of around 1840

00:37:03.043 --> 00:37:05.971
which is the Irish potato
famine so there are just

00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.922
thousands upon thousands
of Irish people who have

00:37:08.922 --> 00:37:10.878
given up in Ireland, they can't eat

00:37:10.878 --> 00:37:12.760
and so they're coming to the United States

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.490
for a new way of life.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.963
There are also political revolutions,

00:37:16.963 --> 00:37:20.871
the revolutions of 1848
in Europe that are driving

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:23.167
lots of other Europeans,
especially Germans

00:37:23.167 --> 00:37:24.694
to the United States.

00:37:24.694 --> 00:37:29.017
So that kind of goes on
into the 1870s, 1880s,

00:37:29.017 --> 00:37:32.067
and then we have a huge
wave of immigration

00:37:32.067 --> 00:37:35.626
from southern and eastern
Europe so this is in Italy,

00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:36.976
in Russia.

00:37:36.976 --> 00:37:38.856
- And what is that
roughly, that's at the--

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:42.912
- That's at the end of the
19th century so 1880s, 1890s.

00:37:42.912 --> 00:37:44.459
- And this coincides with
the industrialization--

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:46.267
- [Kim] Exactly, so
they're looking for jobs.

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:48.387
- And you read these
books like Upton Sinclair

00:37:48.387 --> 00:37:50.248
and all these books that are

00:37:50.248 --> 00:37:51.997
they're working in the
factories maybe under

00:37:51.997 --> 00:37:54.478
suboptimal conditions and
but they're coming here

00:37:54.478 --> 00:37:55.585
for a better life.

00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:57.611
- Yeah and I think one
thing that's interesting

00:37:57.611 --> 00:38:00.790
about this is because we have
a definition of whiteness

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.130
today that is very much
based on skin color right.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.672
You look white, you're white.

00:38:05.672 --> 00:38:08.800
But they had a much different
idea of who was white,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.446
who was an American
citizen because originally

00:38:11.446 --> 00:38:14.914
they thought Irish people
were really considered

00:38:14.914 --> 00:38:18.924
not white enough and then
later on they say oh, okay

00:38:18.924 --> 00:38:21.065
well someone from Italy,
someone from Russia,

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:24.288
they're too different from
Anglo Saxons to be considered

00:38:24.288 --> 00:38:28.427
white so even though they
have some political rights,

00:38:28.427 --> 00:38:31.070
they can vote, they're
not really considered

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.418
part of the American
body politic like someone

00:38:33.418 --> 00:38:35.825
whose ancestry is English might be.

00:38:35.825 --> 00:38:38.686
Not really until I
would say World War Two.

00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:42.853
- Yeah, even in the 20th
century it was a big deal,

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.419
it was a big deal John
F. Kennedy was Catholic.

00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:50.544
- Right, absolutely, 'cause
he's got this Irish background.

00:38:50.544 --> 00:38:53.785
- Irish or the Catholics
were Irish or Italians

00:38:53.785 --> 00:38:57.539
and so this was a big deal
that he was not Protestant.

00:38:57.539 --> 00:39:00.294
- Yeah and there's strong
ethnic communities too.

00:39:00.294 --> 00:39:04.461
This is why you have little
Italy and Polish brotherhoods

00:39:06.231 --> 00:39:10.300
as these ethnic groups
grew in American cities

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.937
and then starting around World War Two

00:39:12.937 --> 00:39:15.753
these men all kind of get
sent to the war together,

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:19.711
they develop more bonds,
and after World War Two--

00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:21.921
- Including African Americans,
I mean African Americans

00:39:21.921 --> 00:39:23.349
fought in the Civil, fought
in the Revolutionary War.

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:24.667
- [Kim] Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:26.948
- But it becomes, people
start to identify as a nation

00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:31.154
of Americans versus language,
I mean English is the language

00:39:31.154 --> 00:39:32.749
but around ethnicity.

00:39:32.749 --> 00:39:35.389
- Yeah and I mean if there's one thing

00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:39.604
that brings people together,
it's having a common enemy.

00:39:39.604 --> 00:39:41.055
(laughs)

00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:44.919
So the idea we're
American, we're not German,

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:48.400
we're not Japanese, these
ideas really coalesce

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.584
in World War Two to
bring national identity

00:39:50.584 --> 00:39:52.696
more about being from the United States

00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:54.787
then having a specific racial identity.

00:39:54.787 --> 00:39:57.656
- And so now you have after World War One

00:39:57.656 --> 00:40:00.603
in the '20s the women become participants

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:03.666
at least as voters, it takes
a little while for them

00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:05.140
to get positions of power.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.151
- Exactly.

00:40:06.151 --> 00:40:08.887
- But one position of power
maybe might happen soon.

00:40:08.887 --> 00:40:13.521
But that's when they get
involved and so kind of those

00:40:13.521 --> 00:40:16.242
trends wouldn't you say
they kind of go through

00:40:16.242 --> 00:40:17.250
World War Two?

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.239
- Exactly.

00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:19.446
- Then how would you
say that they've changed

00:40:19.446 --> 00:40:20.447
since then?

00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:21.569
- Well I think the civil rights movement

00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:23.663
is one of the most
important sort of political

00:40:23.663 --> 00:40:27.606
and cultural movements to
come out of World War Two

00:40:27.606 --> 00:40:31.669
which is, think about being
an African American soldier

00:40:31.669 --> 00:40:34.711
in World War Two and you're in France

00:40:34.711 --> 00:40:37.585
and having to listen to
someone say the United States

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:41.061
is the location where democracy is true

00:40:41.061 --> 00:40:43.349
and every man is created
equal and you're thinking

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:45.927
yeah, that's not been my experience.

00:40:45.927 --> 00:40:48.645
- Or if you're a second or
third generation Japanese,

00:40:48.645 --> 00:40:51.362
your grandfather immigrated from Japan

00:40:51.362 --> 00:40:53.677
to help build the railroads
and your family's in

00:40:53.677 --> 00:40:55.140
an internment camp while you're fighting

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.139
or something like that.

00:40:56.139 --> 00:40:57.144
- Exactly.

00:40:57.144 --> 00:40:59.248
So a lot of African
American veterans come home

00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:02.086
and they say alright, we
listened to all this propaganda

00:41:02.086 --> 00:41:04.467
abroad, I think if we learned anything

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:06.327
it's how important voting is

00:41:06.327 --> 00:41:08.928
so they really begin the
civil rights movement

00:41:08.928 --> 00:41:12.340
which is a national movement in the south

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.207
and the north to first
secure voting rights

00:41:15.207 --> 00:41:18.413
for African Americans
and then they're sort of

00:41:18.413 --> 00:41:21.418
a more generalized
movement for housing rights

00:41:21.418 --> 00:41:24.973
and poverty that kind of
work toward a more inclusive

00:41:24.973 --> 00:41:26.662
idea of American citizenship.

00:41:26.662 --> 00:41:29.005
- And it's really
interesting because, I mean,

00:41:29.005 --> 00:41:31.358
this is not gonna be on the
AP American History exam

00:41:31.358 --> 00:41:33.392
but it's always worth
citing, I always point it out

00:41:33.392 --> 00:41:35.634
because there weren't a
lot of other non-white

00:41:35.634 --> 00:41:39.271
people here then, for example
people from South Asia

00:41:39.271 --> 00:41:43.438
or and that was (mumbles) for all of us

00:41:46.584 --> 00:41:49.833
because if that didn't
happen then you would have

00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:53.868
had segregation, I mean,
across more broadly.

00:41:53.868 --> 00:41:55.807
- And the civil rights
movement also inspires

00:41:55.807 --> 00:41:59.389
future social reform movements
so late '60s and '70s

00:41:59.389 --> 00:42:01.770
there's the women's rights
movement that said women

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.890
shouldn't just be able to vote,

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.211
they should also be able to
hold the same jobs as men

00:42:06.211 --> 00:42:10.270
and be paid equally or
the LGBTQ movements,

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:14.053
also patterned on civil
rights saying we're gonna use

00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:17.803
the same tactics of
protest and advertisement

00:42:19.023 --> 00:42:22.544
of what's going on to try to
change our social position.

00:42:22.544 --> 00:42:24.083
- And you have figures
like Martin Luther King

00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:26.637
inspired by Gandhi whose
revolutionary in India

00:42:26.637 --> 00:42:29.637
during the lead up to World War Two.

00:42:31.028 --> 00:42:32.963
So let's go through more of these themes.

00:42:32.963 --> 00:42:34.253
Politics and power.

00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:37.266
- Alright, this one is a
little bit more specific

00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:40.438
I would say, just because
we're talking about maybe

00:42:40.438 --> 00:42:42.769
who gets to rule, who is in power.

00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:45.383
So I would say this early period here

00:42:45.383 --> 00:42:46.838
it's all about the Spanish.

00:42:46.838 --> 00:42:51.116
The Spanish set up this
system of slavery basically

00:42:51.116 --> 00:42:55.256
to try to extract wealth
from the New World.

00:42:55.256 --> 00:42:57.726
- The best political tool up
here was probably the gun.

00:42:57.726 --> 00:42:59.038
(laughs)

00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:01.345
- I would say probably the
microbe would be the best

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.785
political tool.

00:43:02.785 --> 00:43:06.868
And then there's kind of
I would say a different,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.810
again between the north and the south,

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.781
for what political power looked like.

00:43:12.781 --> 00:43:15.839
In the north they kind of set
up a very democratic system.

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:18.667
They're small farmers,
they're living in small towns,

00:43:18.667 --> 00:43:21.647
they have town hall meetings
and they kind of decide

00:43:21.647 --> 00:43:22.882
things pretty democratically.

00:43:22.882 --> 00:43:26.043
I mean there's religion
and religion plays a really

00:43:26.043 --> 00:43:29.878
central role in what's
important and who gets power

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:33.381
in the north, but in the
south there's the system

00:43:33.381 --> 00:43:36.267
of slavery and so there
are these land owners

00:43:36.267 --> 00:43:39.589
who have thousands of acres
of land and they really

00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:41.939
hold all the wealth
and the political power

00:43:41.939 --> 00:43:44.645
so even the democratic
institutions of the south

00:43:44.645 --> 00:43:48.226
like the Virginia House of
Burgesses are based on the wealth

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:49.907
generated by slavery.

00:43:49.907 --> 00:43:51.412
- Fascinating.

00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:56.255
And that continues obviously
power, we talked about it,

00:43:56.255 --> 00:43:57.468
into the Civil War.

00:43:57.468 --> 00:44:00.914
- Yeah and we can also
talk about the democratic

00:44:00.914 --> 00:44:05.416
and the political parties
that arise in the early part

00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:06.988
of the United States.

00:44:06.988 --> 00:44:08.411
- [Sal] So what were the political parties

00:44:08.411 --> 00:44:09.410
in the early part?

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.725
- So at first--

00:44:10.725 --> 00:44:12.088
- And Washington warned
us against parties.

00:44:12.088 --> 00:44:15.045
- Yeah, Washington was not
a fan of political parties.

00:44:15.045 --> 00:44:17.383
- That's strange, most of us love them.

00:44:17.383 --> 00:44:18.846
(laughing)

00:44:18.846 --> 00:44:20.194
What could be better
than a two party system.

00:44:20.194 --> 00:44:22.387
- This is gonna be terrible
'cause it's just gonna

00:44:22.387 --> 00:44:23.746
make us yell at each other all the time

00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:24.979
and he was not wrong about that.

00:44:24.979 --> 00:44:29.514
But the original parties
were divided on this concept

00:44:29.514 --> 00:44:32.394
of whether power should
be centralized in the

00:44:32.394 --> 00:44:34.400
United States or whether
it should be diffused

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.853
to the states so the
Federalist party was all about

00:44:37.853 --> 00:44:40.115
central power, they wanted
a strong central government,

00:44:40.115 --> 00:44:44.628
they wanted a national bank,
they wanted lots of development

00:44:44.628 --> 00:44:49.261
and then the Anti-Federalists
or we often call them

00:44:49.261 --> 00:44:54.001
Democratic Republicans, were
kind of the opposite of that.

00:44:54.001 --> 00:44:58.084
They wanted the states to
have most of the power,

00:44:59.798 --> 00:45:01.921
they wanted a pretty
small central government

00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.943
and we mostly associate the
Federalists with Alexander

00:45:04.943 --> 00:45:08.666
Hamilton, John Adams, and
then the Anti-Federalists,

00:45:08.666 --> 00:45:12.175
their real standard bearer
was Thomas Jefferson.

00:45:12.175 --> 00:45:15.201
- And if anyone has extra
time while they're preparing,

00:45:15.201 --> 00:45:17.280
I highly recommend the John Quincy Adams,

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.078
what is it like a six or seven part--

00:45:19.078 --> 00:45:20.077
- Oh John Adams, yeah.

00:45:20.077 --> 00:45:22.404
- John Adams, yeah, it's not
Quincy Adams, John Adams.

00:45:22.404 --> 00:45:23.605
- Yeah, that's a great miniseries.

00:45:23.605 --> 00:45:24.816
- It's very inspiring.

00:45:24.816 --> 00:45:26.569
- So we start out with the Federalists,

00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:29.319
with John Adams and then in 1800,

00:45:30.701 --> 00:45:32.229
I think this is one of the most important

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:34.855
political dates of the United States.

00:45:34.855 --> 00:45:38.818
March 3rd, I think that's
the right day, 1800.

00:45:38.818 --> 00:45:39.870
Do you know what happened?

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:43.453
- March 3rd, 1800,
that's, so what you have

00:45:45.088 --> 00:45:48.997
Jefferson versus, no I don't,
what happened that day?

00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:50.211
- Nothing.

00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:53.222
Nothing happened because
there was a peaceful

00:45:53.222 --> 00:45:57.389
transfer of power from one
political party to another.

00:45:59.489 --> 00:46:01.568
It was basically unheard of.

00:46:01.568 --> 00:46:04.253
Can you imagine
voluntarily giving up power

00:46:04.253 --> 00:46:06.465
in this sort of monarchistic world?

00:46:06.465 --> 00:46:08.407
- Yes, as recent nation-building
experiments have shown,

00:46:08.407 --> 00:46:11.242
that doesn't happen peacefully normally.

00:46:11.242 --> 00:46:12.322
- It's hard to do.

00:46:12.322 --> 00:46:16.712
Yeah so the Anti-Federalists
are pretty much more or less

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:20.879
in power up until the slavery
debate becomes even bigger

00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:26.985
and then the Federalists kind of die off

00:46:26.985 --> 00:46:29.345
because they were against the war of 1812.

00:46:29.345 --> 00:46:33.512
Nobody likes a hater so the
Whig party kind of takes over.

00:46:38.027 --> 00:46:39.166
- What are the Whigs?

00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:41.276
I always read, but what do
they represent, the Whigs?

00:46:41.276 --> 00:46:44.079
- The Whigs, Abraham
Lincoln was a Whig before

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:47.919
he became a Republican, and
the Whigs were pretty much

00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:52.086
for development, they were
pro railroad, pro canal.

00:46:53.296 --> 00:46:54.908
- And who were the Whigs going against?

00:46:54.908 --> 00:46:58.016
- They're going against
the Jacksonian Democrats

00:46:58.016 --> 00:47:02.183
who are kind of the heirs
to the Anti-Federalists.

00:47:03.228 --> 00:47:07.812
So just as Jefferson had
only imagined democracy

00:47:07.812 --> 00:47:11.311
for wealthy white landowners
and then Jackson said

00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:13.807
there should be universal
white male suffrage,

00:47:13.807 --> 00:47:17.974
his version of this sort
of anti centralized power.

00:47:18.827 --> 00:47:21.107
- So if I was a business
owner in this period

00:47:21.107 --> 00:47:22.159
I'd probably be a Whig.

00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:24.859
- Probably be a Whig, if
you were a small farmer

00:47:24.859 --> 00:47:27.446
out in the West you'd
probably be a Democrat.

00:47:27.446 --> 00:47:30.006
- And in terms of the slavery issue?

00:47:30.006 --> 00:47:32.788
- The Whigs were generally anti-slavery,

00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:35.198
they were often sort of northeasterners,

00:47:35.198 --> 00:47:37.570
they were generally very religious,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.642
and then Jacksonian Democrats
were generally pro-slavery.

00:47:41.642 --> 00:47:45.342
- And so when do we get into
our modern period of parties?

00:47:45.342 --> 00:47:48.565
- Well I would say that
this Democratic party

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:51.141
is still the Democratic
party that we have today.

00:47:51.141 --> 00:47:54.554
And as we've gone through
the years and we've changed

00:47:54.554 --> 00:47:57.661
different issues, what
they stand for changes.

00:47:57.661 --> 00:48:01.828
And then in the late 1850s
the Republican party was born.

00:48:03.257 --> 00:48:06.243
And the Republican party
was an anti-slavery party,

00:48:06.243 --> 00:48:10.076
the Whigs kind of fell
apart in the late 1840s

00:48:12.426 --> 00:48:16.240
I think is correct and were
replaced by the Republicans

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.268
who had many of the same
values but were specifically

00:48:19.268 --> 00:48:20.689
anti-slavery.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:22.435
- Yeah this was more,
these were sympathetic

00:48:22.435 --> 00:48:24.154
to the anti-slavery, this
was almost formed around

00:48:24.154 --> 00:48:25.154
anti-slavery.

00:48:25.154 --> 00:48:26.266
- Exactly, yeah.

00:48:26.266 --> 00:48:27.719
- And Lincoln gets elected

00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:28.717
as the first Republican president.

00:48:28.717 --> 00:48:30.316
- Right, Lincoln is the
first Republican president.

00:48:30.316 --> 00:48:33.114
- And so that was the spark,
as we've done in several videos

00:48:33.114 --> 00:48:34.229
where we talk about it together.

00:48:34.229 --> 00:48:37.296
- And so the Republicans
pretty much stay in power

00:48:37.296 --> 00:48:41.158
up until World War One, that's
when Wilson gets elected.

00:48:41.158 --> 00:48:45.375
He's the first Democrat
to serve, I believe,

00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:47.908
in between the Civil
War and World War One.

00:48:47.908 --> 00:48:49.525
So that's a long period.

00:48:49.525 --> 00:48:52.218
And as you know this is
the business interest party

00:48:52.218 --> 00:48:54.259
which is gonna do very well in this time

00:48:54.259 --> 00:48:55.862
of industrialization.

00:48:55.862 --> 00:48:57.788
- Okay, so in this period
of industrialization

00:48:57.788 --> 00:49:02.067
that's the Gilded Age, that's
when you have the Carnegies

00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:06.726
and so that period, you see
this swing back and forth

00:49:06.726 --> 00:49:08.027
in American history.

00:49:08.027 --> 00:49:09.184
- [Kim] Yeah, exactly.

00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:11.153
- This goes back to this
politics and power theme.

00:49:11.153 --> 00:49:12.207
- [Kim] Right.

00:49:12.207 --> 00:49:14.227
That sometimes it's the
Jacksonian Democrats,

00:49:14.227 --> 00:49:18.281
the everyman, very
populist, and then it's--

00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:19.324
- [Kim] Oh, 10 minutes left.

00:49:19.324 --> 00:49:20.983
- We can go a little over.

00:49:20.983 --> 00:49:22.391
(laughing)

00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:23.423
We're having so much fun.

00:49:23.423 --> 00:49:24.434
- We're trying to go fast.

00:49:24.434 --> 00:49:28.601
- You have these swings
between kind of the common man

00:49:29.984 --> 00:49:33.631
and more populist movements
and maybe more business

00:49:33.631 --> 00:49:35.833
interests or economic growth.

00:49:35.833 --> 00:49:38.971
- Yeah sometimes they'll say
the system isn't democratic

00:49:38.971 --> 00:49:41.817
enough and then they'll
say maybe the system's

00:49:41.817 --> 00:49:44.990
a little too democratic
so the Republicans,

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.926
except for this moment
with Wilson, are in power

00:49:47.926 --> 00:49:50.155
until the stock market
crash and this is a big hit

00:49:50.155 --> 00:49:51.238
for business.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.366
- Yeah and then you have
FDR come in who maybe

00:49:55.366 --> 00:49:57.789
defines the modern Democratic
party in a lot of ways.

00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:59.441
- Yeah, exactly, this is the New Deal,

00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:02.436
this period of increased government,

00:50:02.436 --> 00:50:06.186
work towards social
welfare and the Democrats

00:50:08.643 --> 00:50:11.586
who want to spend money
on social problems,

00:50:11.586 --> 00:50:14.750
on social movements in general,

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.758
they pretty much stay
in power until Nixon.

00:50:17.758 --> 00:50:21.775
So there's a 30 year
period where the Democrats

00:50:21.775 --> 00:50:24.442
are really defining US politics.

00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:27.696
- It seems like something
in the air right now,

00:50:27.696 --> 00:50:30.280
it's fun to connect it,
you seem like you have

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.579
what parties stand for
transitioning a little bit

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:33.594
right now.

00:50:33.594 --> 00:50:35.862
- Yeah and I mean after
that we generally think

00:50:35.862 --> 00:50:38.312
of the modern era as
being more conservative

00:50:38.312 --> 00:50:40.205
than this era that came before it.

00:50:40.205 --> 00:50:43.062
This is the time when labor
unions are really strong

00:50:43.062 --> 00:50:46.087
and the government is
spending a lot of money

00:50:46.087 --> 00:50:49.158
on social programs and kind
of starting in the 1980s

00:50:49.158 --> 00:50:53.897
there's been a little
bit of a walk away from--

00:50:53.897 --> 00:50:56.594
- You have a little bit of a
flip flop between the parties.

00:50:56.594 --> 00:51:00.761
Where you have the Republicans
are a little bit more

00:51:02.619 --> 00:51:05.841
sympathetic to, or the
civil rights movement

00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:09.055
gets a little more
sympathy from the Johnsons

00:51:09.055 --> 00:51:11.306
of the world, from the Democrats.

00:51:11.306 --> 00:51:13.997
- Yeah this is a little
bit confusing because

00:51:13.997 --> 00:51:16.988
there is a sort of a
flip flop of the parties,

00:51:16.988 --> 00:51:19.455
especially the Democratic
party which used to be

00:51:19.455 --> 00:51:20.552
the party of slavery.

00:51:20.552 --> 00:51:23.136
- The business of economic
growth and business,

00:51:23.136 --> 00:51:24.923
that's kind of consistent
with the founding of

00:51:24.923 --> 00:51:26.194
the Republican party.

00:51:26.194 --> 00:51:28.199
- Right, but the Democrats
really used to be

00:51:28.199 --> 00:51:31.394
the party of slavery and
later the party of Jim Crow

00:51:31.394 --> 00:51:33.698
but with the Great Depression and later

00:51:33.698 --> 00:51:36.079
the civil rights movement,
the Democrats said

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:38.826
if we want to get the
economy back on track

00:51:38.826 --> 00:51:41.177
we're really gonna need
to use this federal money

00:51:41.177 --> 00:51:44.344
and later said we should continue to--

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:47.934
- And gave a lot of power
to the federal government.

00:51:47.934 --> 00:51:51.056
Just going back to that
whole states rights,

00:51:51.056 --> 00:51:54.598
I mean FDR expansion of
the federal government too

00:51:54.598 --> 00:51:58.592
which was, fascinating, we
have many videos on this.

00:51:58.592 --> 00:52:00.925
We could do a couple things,

00:52:02.189 --> 00:52:03.273
we could do more of
these or we could tackle

00:52:03.273 --> 00:52:04.272
more questions, do you want to do that?

00:52:04.272 --> 00:52:06.011
- What do you all think?

00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:08.989
- [Boy] So there have been a
couple interesting questions

00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:10.561
that have come up.

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:11.678
- Okay.

00:52:11.678 --> 00:52:13.294
- [Boy] First is that a couple of students

00:52:13.294 --> 00:52:14.299
are nervous about the
long essay questions.

00:52:14.299 --> 00:52:15.652
- Oh, okay.

00:52:15.652 --> 00:52:18.154
(mumbling)

00:52:18.154 --> 00:52:21.245
- [Sal] Repeat the question.

00:52:21.245 --> 00:52:23.221
- Sure, the question is how do we approach

00:52:23.221 --> 00:52:27.304
the long essay and just
synthesis as a general skill?

00:52:27.304 --> 00:52:29.486
And we have a sample long essay question

00:52:29.486 --> 00:52:31.609
if you want us to work on through that.

00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:32.825
- Yeah.

00:52:32.825 --> 00:52:34.008
(mumbling)

00:52:34.008 --> 00:52:36.996
We're not going to write
it, we will speak to

00:52:36.996 --> 00:52:38.916
what could be written.

00:52:38.916 --> 00:52:40.089
This one right here?

00:52:40.089 --> 00:52:41.830
- Yeah, the revolution one.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.497
Alright, let's tape this one up.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.349
And you're gonna have
to use your own council

00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:53.989
on migration and culture in society.

00:52:53.989 --> 00:52:55.464
- Yes, well we're gonna
make this available

00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:58.892
and I suggest everyone
to take a look at these,

00:52:58.892 --> 00:53:01.237
Kim's done an incredible job
here 'cause this really talks

00:53:01.237 --> 00:53:03.856
about all of the major themes
and these actually would

00:53:03.856 --> 00:53:06.044
be really good points to even
bring up in the essay portion

00:53:06.044 --> 00:53:08.514
so really encourage you to
take a good look at this.

00:53:08.514 --> 00:53:10.147
- Yeah, and I'm around you know,

00:53:10.147 --> 00:53:13.270
I answer questions on Khan
Academy, I answer questions

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:16.467
on YouTube and Facebook
so yeah if you have

00:53:16.467 --> 00:53:18.874
any other questions for
us just let me know.

00:53:18.874 --> 00:53:20.735
- Awesome, so let's read this.

00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:22.794
Some historians have argued
that the American Revolution

00:53:22.794 --> 00:53:24.805
was not revolutionary in nature.

00:53:24.805 --> 00:53:27.749
Support, modify, or
refute this interpretation

00:53:27.749 --> 00:53:31.695
providing specific evidence
to justify your answer.

00:53:31.695 --> 00:53:33.846
So what would you do
Kim, when you see that?

00:53:33.846 --> 00:53:35.755
You have this blank space to fill up.

00:53:35.755 --> 00:53:39.005
- So I think all of the essay questions

00:53:40.898 --> 00:53:44.768
are kind of gonna be like
this, do you support, modify,

00:53:44.768 --> 00:53:46.949
or refute this interpretation?

00:53:46.949 --> 00:53:49.539
So we have three ways
we could go with this.

00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:52.827
We can say support it,
the American Revolution

00:53:52.827 --> 00:53:54.798
was not revolutionary.

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.170
We could say refute it--

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.280
- I wanna refute it.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.996
- Yeah, the American Revolution
was super revolutionary.

00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:02.288
Or refute would be like--

00:54:02.288 --> 00:54:03.513
- Or modify.

00:54:03.513 --> 00:54:07.180
- This is yeah, this
is a terrible question,

00:54:08.441 --> 00:54:10.325
here's the right question.

00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:12.269
That's a little harder
to do, I don't know.

00:54:12.269 --> 00:54:14.108
I can't think of something
off the top of my head

00:54:14.108 --> 00:54:15.114
that would do that.

00:54:15.114 --> 00:54:16.862
- Yeah so support is like
yeah it wasn't revolutionary,

00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:17.862
modify was like it was
revolutionary in some respects

00:54:17.862 --> 00:54:20.512
but maybe not in other
respects, refute would be like

00:54:20.512 --> 00:54:21.965
no it was actually quite revolutionary.

00:54:21.965 --> 00:54:23.219
- Exactly, yeah.

00:54:23.219 --> 00:54:24.737
Does anyone have a pen?

00:54:24.737 --> 00:54:26.075
Like a marker, Sharpie?

00:54:26.075 --> 00:54:28.848
- But this is high level thinking.

00:54:28.848 --> 00:54:32.156
Just for you personally,
where do you fit on this?

00:54:32.156 --> 00:54:36.414
My gut when I read this like
no, it is revolutionary.

00:54:36.414 --> 00:54:38.135
- I would totally go the other way.

00:54:38.135 --> 00:54:39.298
- That's good.

00:54:39.298 --> 00:54:40.439
- Maybe I'm a negative Nancy.

00:54:40.439 --> 00:54:41.839
- Either one would be
okay as long as we back up

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:43.339
our points well.

00:54:43.339 --> 00:54:46.028
- So yeah, I would say the question that

00:54:46.028 --> 00:54:50.195
they're asking for us is
is the society before 1776

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.700
very different than
the society after 1776?

00:54:58.700 --> 00:54:59.867
Or after 1783?

00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:04.828
So there are various things
that we could think about here.

00:55:04.828 --> 00:55:07.908
We could think about politics,
right, we've just been

00:55:07.908 --> 00:55:10.555
going through these themes
like is the political

00:55:10.555 --> 00:55:11.820
system different.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.607
We could think about society.

00:55:13.607 --> 00:55:15.857
Are social roles different?

00:55:16.719 --> 00:55:18.021
- [Sal] Economics.

00:55:18.021 --> 00:55:19.294
- Yeah we could think about economics.

00:55:19.294 --> 00:55:20.445
- [Sal] Geopolitics.

00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:21.278
- Yeah.

00:55:23.873 --> 00:55:25.275
- [Sal] Or military.

00:55:25.275 --> 00:55:29.079
- Yeah, so do all the
same things of those.

00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:31.912
Or culture would be another thing.

00:55:35.425 --> 00:55:36.874
- I don't know how you could think

00:55:36.874 --> 00:55:37.875
it wasn't revolutionary.

00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:38.875
(laughing)

00:55:38.875 --> 00:55:39.916
I mean let's break it out.

00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:40.894
Politics!

00:55:40.894 --> 00:55:41.906
- Politics.

00:55:41.906 --> 00:55:44.067
- I mean, England at
the time had some form,

00:55:44.067 --> 00:55:45.530
they had a parliament and stuff,

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.151
but it was still they
had a king on their money

00:55:47.151 --> 00:55:52.043
but now you had Thomas
Payne and the rights of man

00:55:52.043 --> 00:55:55.210
and you have this little, this colony,

00:55:56.228 --> 00:55:58.300
and they're taking on the
most powerful military,

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.780
and navy for sure, probably
military in the world

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.292
and they're able to win.

00:56:03.292 --> 00:56:06.217
And it's all about rule by the individual

00:56:06.217 --> 00:56:10.394
and these ideas that they
resurfaced and a lot of ways

00:56:10.394 --> 00:56:12.942
perfected from the Greeks and the Romans.

00:56:12.942 --> 00:56:13.988
- Yes.

00:56:13.988 --> 00:56:16.245
- Come back, thousands of years later.

00:56:16.245 --> 00:56:18.422
Like what was it?

00:56:18.422 --> 00:56:19.618
Roughly 1500, 2,000 years later.

00:56:19.618 --> 00:56:21.542
- This is great because you're now doing

00:56:21.542 --> 00:56:23.318
the pro-revolutionary side.

00:56:23.318 --> 00:56:24.558
- Yes.

00:56:24.558 --> 00:56:26.319
- And I'm going to do the
anti-revolutionary side.

00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:27.795
I'm gonna say that the revolution

00:56:27.795 --> 00:56:29.898
wasn't that revolutionary politically

00:56:29.898 --> 00:56:31.962
because the same people who were in power

00:56:31.962 --> 00:56:34.409
in the United States before the revolution

00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:37.173
were the people who were in
power after the revolution.

00:56:37.173 --> 00:56:38.979
- Like right after the revolution.

00:56:38.979 --> 00:56:40.699
But I would make that argument that sure,

00:56:40.699 --> 00:56:44.211
the year after, but this revolution

00:56:44.211 --> 00:56:46.753
and just so you all know
we did not prepare this.

00:56:46.753 --> 00:56:48.190
- No.
(Laughing)

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.933
- This is completely improv right now.

00:56:49.933 --> 00:56:53.766
But these ideas are what
allowed over the next

00:56:54.743 --> 00:56:57.139
few hundred years all of
this other stuff to happen.

00:56:57.139 --> 00:56:59.443
- You are making precisely
Gordon Wood's argument,

00:56:59.443 --> 00:57:01.045
just so you know.

00:57:01.045 --> 00:57:03.975
So you are like brainstorming
Gordon Wood right now.

00:57:03.975 --> 00:57:05.510
- Yeah well it's true!

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.458
(laughing)

00:57:07.458 --> 00:57:09.422
- When I think of the revolution,

00:57:09.422 --> 00:57:11.873
the next day it might have not changed

00:57:11.873 --> 00:57:14.290
but this was the spark that--

00:57:15.124 --> 00:57:16.413
- So this is like a long term thing.

00:57:16.413 --> 00:57:17.595
- And actually almost immediately you have

00:57:17.595 --> 00:57:18.773
the French Revolution

00:57:18.773 --> 00:57:20.916
which didn't immediately, it
became somewhat tyrannical

00:57:20.916 --> 00:57:23.398
with Napoleon and all of that,
actually even before Napoleon

00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:26.896
but it did spark this in modern times,

00:57:26.896 --> 00:57:28.640
this thread of democracy.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.589
What we now take for granted,
constitutional democracies,

00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:31.589
this was it!

00:57:32.961 --> 00:57:34.187
That's a revolution!

00:57:34.187 --> 00:57:36.994
- Alright well riddle
me this, Gordon Wood.

00:57:36.994 --> 00:57:41.017
How different was American
society after 1776

00:57:41.017 --> 00:57:42.280
then it was before?

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.015
- Well not right after.

00:57:44.015 --> 00:57:45.081
- Okay.

00:57:45.081 --> 00:57:47.344
- Not right after but once again because

00:57:47.344 --> 00:57:49.848
if the revolution didn't
happen then once again

00:57:49.848 --> 00:57:51.777
you wouldn't have been
able to have all of these,

00:57:51.777 --> 00:57:55.537
not only do you have a
democracy but this even

00:57:55.537 --> 00:57:56.582
goes to economics.

00:57:56.582 --> 00:57:58.536
If the revolution didn't happen

00:57:58.536 --> 00:58:00.809
you would have had the big power England

00:58:00.809 --> 00:58:03.223
have all of this extra industrial might

00:58:03.223 --> 00:58:04.954
and all of this extra agricultural land,

00:58:04.954 --> 00:58:07.422
but now you had an economic
power that was growing

00:58:07.422 --> 00:58:12.019
in the next 100 years
that was also a democracy.

00:58:12.019 --> 00:58:15.516
And so that combination
and so when you have

00:58:15.516 --> 00:58:18.395
a superpower here that's, it's imperfect,

00:58:18.395 --> 00:58:21.187
there's some parts that look
a little bit hypocritical

00:58:21.187 --> 00:58:25.529
but for the most part it
was true to the tenets

00:58:25.529 --> 00:58:27.530
and it became more and more true over time

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.529
and it's continuing to.

00:58:28.529 --> 00:58:30.490
- Alright, so you're
saying in the long term

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.011
these social values came to pass.

00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:35.036
I'm going to say in the short term,

00:58:35.036 --> 00:58:38.036
I mean how can you have a revolution

00:58:38.894 --> 00:58:40.817
that says all men are created equal,

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:42.734
and still have slavery?

00:58:46.058 --> 00:58:47.061
Right?

00:58:47.061 --> 00:58:50.000
- It was definitely not,
revolutions are never,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.468
in fact by definition, you
can't point to a revolution

00:58:53.468 --> 00:58:57.162
that's like clean, that like
people storm the whatever

00:58:57.162 --> 00:59:00.492
and then they put the king out of rule

00:59:00.492 --> 00:59:02.610
and then the next day
everything's hunky dory.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.216
Revolutions are, I don't
know, you know more history

00:59:06.216 --> 00:59:08.574
than I do but from what I
know they're always messy

00:59:08.574 --> 00:59:11.701
and there's always a period
where people are fighting

00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:13.569
and a lot of the people
who had power before

00:59:13.569 --> 00:59:17.899
still have power but they start
an interesting conversation.

00:59:17.899 --> 00:59:20.834
- Yeah but does that
last for like 87 years?

00:59:20.834 --> 00:59:25.001
Four score and seven years of
slavery after the revolution.

00:59:26.053 --> 00:59:27.916
- I guess so, yes.

00:59:27.916 --> 00:59:29.392
(laughing)

00:59:29.392 --> 00:59:31.435
- Alright, how about economics?

00:59:31.435 --> 00:59:33.926
- Economics, economic revolution.

00:59:33.926 --> 00:59:35.651
That I would not say so much.

00:59:35.651 --> 00:59:37.113
- Alright, so that's not one for you.

00:59:37.113 --> 00:59:40.001
- For example if you were
to compare and that could be

00:59:40.001 --> 00:59:41.911
like a modifying, maybe
that's a point to bring up

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:44.829
is in the 1800s economically
the US and England

00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:45.977
were in some ways very similar,

00:59:45.977 --> 00:59:47.916
they were part of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:59:47.916 --> 00:59:50.825
they were, so if they
were the same country,

00:59:50.825 --> 00:59:54.992
unclear if they were that
fundamentally different.

00:59:56.511 --> 00:59:57.512
- Alright.

00:59:57.512 --> 00:59:59.365
Well I'm going to take
the international view now

00:59:59.365 --> 01:00:02.114
and say in terms of
revolutions, if you compare

01:00:02.114 --> 01:00:04.943
the American Revolution
and the French Revolution,

01:00:04.943 --> 01:00:08.295
economically, I mean the French Revolution

01:00:08.295 --> 01:00:10.669
was a revolution of the people against

01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:14.336
the monarchy, against
the wealthiest people.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.532
Well, the United States doesn't change

01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:18.733
anybody's real--

01:00:18.733 --> 01:00:20.828
- Yeah, you're right, I agree with you

01:00:20.828 --> 01:00:23.228
this was not an economic revolution.

01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:26.206
I mean, kind of there
were pocketbook issues

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.176
of taxation and representation,

01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:30.482
but it was much more philosophic.

01:00:30.482 --> 01:00:32.866
It was economic for
everyone, it wasn't one class

01:00:32.866 --> 01:00:34.170
versus another class,

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.768
while the French Revolution
was like textbook

01:00:36.768 --> 01:00:39.101
the classes fighting it out.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.248
- Well I think I'm winning right now

01:00:42.248 --> 01:00:45.023
so you're gonna need to
provide some geopolitical

01:00:45.023 --> 01:00:46.023
or cultural.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:49.567
- I think you're very biased.

01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:53.327
So let's see.

01:00:53.327 --> 01:00:56.304
Geographically, yeah it's unclear.

01:00:56.304 --> 01:01:00.471
I think by becoming a nation
the ideas of manifest destiny

01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:07.565
became, if you're part
of the British empire,

01:01:07.565 --> 01:01:11.297
you would have, the sun never
sets on the British empire,

01:01:11.297 --> 01:01:13.762
they were already in India,
they were already in Africa,

01:01:13.762 --> 01:01:17.324
or starting to be in Africa
especially in the 1800s

01:01:17.324 --> 01:01:19.102
and so there could have been an argument

01:01:19.102 --> 01:01:22.866
that it was just an extension
of this already vast empire.

01:01:22.866 --> 01:01:25.434
While here it's like this
notion of Manifest Destiny

01:01:25.434 --> 01:01:27.272
is much more of a nationalistic thing.

01:01:27.272 --> 01:01:30.503
- Right so it causes Manifest Destiny.

01:01:30.503 --> 01:01:34.687
So it's a big transformation
of the American body politic.

01:01:34.687 --> 01:01:35.687
- Yeah.

01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:37.933
- And I might make the opposite argument

01:01:37.933 --> 01:01:39.558
that the American Revolution was terrible

01:01:39.558 --> 01:01:41.015
for Native Americans, right?

01:01:41.015 --> 01:01:44.265
I mean the British were the major power

01:01:45.819 --> 01:01:48.394
that were defending the
rights of Native Americans.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:50.789
That's why in the War of
1812 the Native Americans

01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:52.766
are gonna ally with the British.

01:01:52.766 --> 01:01:55.185
- But wouldn't you argue
for better or for worse

01:01:55.185 --> 01:01:56.837
that would be an argument,
that was a change.

01:01:56.837 --> 01:01:57.874
- Yeah.

01:01:57.874 --> 01:01:59.177
- So put it on that.

01:01:59.177 --> 01:02:00.568
- So you could see it could go either way.

01:02:00.568 --> 01:02:03.867
- [Sal] And actually in a
certain way slavery probably

01:02:03.867 --> 01:02:07.718
would have ended sooner if
we stayed a British colony.

01:02:07.718 --> 01:02:09.258
- [Kim] I would say so because slavery

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.479
was outlawed in England

01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:12.224
before it was outlawed
in the United States.

01:02:12.224 --> 01:02:13.623
- And so we're structuring,
there's multiple

01:02:13.623 --> 01:02:14.963
ways to structure it, how would the world

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:15.982
have been different if
the revolution happened?

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:17.982
Which is actually a fun thing--

01:02:17.982 --> 01:02:19.006
- [Kim] Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:21.495
(mumbling)

01:02:21.495 --> 01:02:25.527
- And just to obviously
if we were taking the test

01:02:25.527 --> 01:02:27.327
we wouldn't write it this
way, you'd write it out

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.886
a little bit but these,
how does it get graded?

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:31.576
You've graded these things.

01:02:31.576 --> 01:02:32.608
How does this get graded?

01:02:32.608 --> 01:02:34.225
- Yeah, well I would say
that what you want to do here

01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:36.911
is use each of these big
themes as your topic sentences

01:02:36.911 --> 01:02:39.928
so maybe if I were doing
something like this

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:42.280
I might just right down
some possible things

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.431
I could talk about right,
how does the economy change,

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:46.703
how does the politics
change, and then makes notes

01:02:46.703 --> 01:02:50.115
and decide which side you
fall on and then use that

01:02:50.115 --> 01:02:53.540
as your thesis statement to say that oh,

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.587
the American Revolution
was super revolutionary

01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:57.680
because none of these major social changes

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.713
could have happened
down the line without it

01:02:59.713 --> 01:03:02.484
or the American Revolution
wasn't revolutionary at all

01:03:02.484 --> 01:03:03.854
because it changed nothing

01:03:03.854 --> 01:03:05.177
for actual people who lived there.

01:03:05.177 --> 01:03:06.965
See I'm still arguing for myself.

01:03:06.965 --> 01:03:09.701
- And I mean this is why
this framework is really

01:03:09.701 --> 01:03:11.597
valuable because right when I first saw it

01:03:11.597 --> 01:03:13.780
I was like man, maybe I could
write like a sentence on this

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.185
but then when you start to
say okay, we could talk about

01:03:16.185 --> 01:03:19.540
national identity which is kind of culture

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.529
and we could talk about politics in power,

01:03:21.529 --> 01:03:24.427
we could talk about work,
technology, and exchange

01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:27.099
in economics, we could talk
about culture of society,

01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:29.292
migration and settlement,
so you have this framework,

01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:31.334
and if you just know,
these are the dimensions

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:33.449
I can talk about on pretty
much any essay statement.

01:03:33.449 --> 01:03:34.451
- [Kim] Exactly.

01:03:34.451 --> 01:03:36.342
- Then all of a sudden
you have a lot to write.

01:03:36.342 --> 01:03:37.826
- Yeah, consider these themes
whenever you're thinking

01:03:37.826 --> 01:03:40.009
about writing an essay
because they will kind of

01:03:40.009 --> 01:03:42.830
illuminate things for you
about where things are changing

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.436
and where things are staying the same.

01:03:44.436 --> 01:03:47.915
- And the graders, unlike
you, are fairly impartial.

01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:49.511
(laughing)

01:03:49.511 --> 01:03:50.696
And they're not gonna--

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:53.244
- Right, because as long as you are making

01:03:53.244 --> 01:03:55.807
a strong argument and
you're providing evidence,

01:03:55.807 --> 01:04:00.216
then they know that you're,
think of them like a jury

01:04:00.216 --> 01:04:02.926
that you're trying to
convince if you're a lawyer.

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:05.998
You are making an argument
and saying here's why

01:04:05.998 --> 01:04:08.847
I'm right and so what
they're interested is

01:04:08.847 --> 01:04:11.166
is are you convincing
them, not are you saying

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:12.619
what I want you to say.

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:14.641
- And how much do things like grammar

01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:17.933
and penmanship, you have
to be understandable?

01:04:17.933 --> 01:04:20.064
- Be understandable,
yeah, other than that.

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:21.382
- Spelling, grammar, you don't ding.

01:04:21.382 --> 01:04:25.028
Be understandable but
the main is your ideas.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:28.312
- Yeah and I think when I took this exam

01:04:28.312 --> 01:04:31.299
more years ago than I care to remember.

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:32.729
- I took it even more years ago.

01:04:32.729 --> 01:04:34.968
- I had this idea that
the graders were like oh,

01:04:34.968 --> 01:04:37.255
I'm looking for all the
things that they did wrong

01:04:37.255 --> 01:04:39.786
so I can mark them down,
but having graded it myself

01:04:39.786 --> 01:04:42.564
what I noticed was that we're
looking for opportunities

01:04:42.564 --> 01:04:45.800
to give people points, the
people who grade this exam

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.146
they are AP US History teachers,
they are college teachers

01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:50.779
and they want you to
succeed so they're actually

01:04:50.779 --> 01:04:52.188
on your side.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:54.793
- So as much as time allows keep writing.

01:04:54.793 --> 01:04:55.840
- Yeah.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.334
- 'Cause there's a lot to write about.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:04:59.256
- And make sure you give context,

01:04:59.256 --> 01:05:03.785
make sure you say who's doing
something, when, and why,

01:05:03.785 --> 01:05:06.253
because for example if
you say what's one thing

01:05:06.253 --> 01:05:09.756
that the Europeans changed
about Native American culture

01:05:09.756 --> 01:05:12.620
and you respond, "disease,"
there's not enough there

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.192
for you to say where was
the disease happening.

01:05:15.192 --> 01:05:16.880
- I actually don't know
the answer to this,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.991
when I took it I wrote it
out, but can you make a table?

01:05:18.991 --> 01:05:20.373
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:22.945
- And write points on either
side and then refer to it?

01:05:22.945 --> 01:05:24.215
Is that recommended?

01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:25.906
- Yeah, that's totally recommended.

01:05:25.906 --> 01:05:27.712
You get 35 minutes to do this question

01:05:27.712 --> 01:05:31.033
and I would say absolutely use
the first five to 10 minutes

01:05:31.033 --> 01:05:33.514
just to make some notes and
an outline for yourself.

01:05:33.514 --> 01:05:36.023
- But even the table itself
could be part of your answer.

01:05:36.023 --> 01:05:37.156
Maybe not, okay.

01:05:37.156 --> 01:05:39.353
- They're looking for
the thesis statement.

01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:40.729
- They're looking for the thesis statement

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:41.795
and the topic sentences.

01:05:41.795 --> 01:05:43.160
But definitely use something like this

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.162
just to structure it.

01:05:44.162 --> 01:05:45.439
- Just to yeah, get
your thoughts in order.

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:47.075
- Alright, we have a couple more.

01:05:47.075 --> 01:05:49.123
I think we're probably
close to out of time.

01:05:49.123 --> 01:05:50.367
- Are we over?

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:51.767
- [Woman] You're over time.

01:05:51.767 --> 01:05:52.766
- We're over time?

01:05:52.766 --> 01:05:53.766
You want to do one multiple
choice just for kicks?

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:55.183
- If you want to.

01:05:56.659 --> 01:05:58.200
- Let's do one multiple choice.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.894
- We're sticking around.

01:05:59.894 --> 01:06:01.693
- We're sticking around,
this is too important.

01:06:01.693 --> 01:06:02.901
- More US History for you.

01:06:02.901 --> 01:06:04.590
- I'm still worked up
about how you can not think

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:06.709
that that was a revolution.

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:09.042
- I'm just devil's advocate.

01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:14.064
- Yes.

01:06:14.064 --> 01:06:18.147
Alright we'll do this one
and then call it a day.

01:06:20.642 --> 01:06:22.705
- Put some tape over there.

01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:23.909
(laughing)

01:06:23.909 --> 01:06:26.742
Alright, you want to do this side?

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:34.110
Okay so this is a typical
multiple choice question

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:36.689
for the AP exam and all of these questions

01:06:36.689 --> 01:06:40.210
they have either a set
of quotes or a graph

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.248
or a political cartoon so
they're never in the void,

01:06:43.248 --> 01:06:45.479
they're always asking you
to refer to something.

01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:49.970
So then they'll be like
two to four questions

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:51.570
that are actually related to this.

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.968
- [Sal] Okay so let's just try to do this.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:55.343
- Okay, so first let's
actually look at our graph.

01:06:55.343 --> 01:06:57.323
- [Sal] You look at the graph first?

01:06:57.323 --> 01:06:58.812
I read the question first.

01:06:58.812 --> 01:07:01.262
- [Kim] Okay, I will look at this graph

01:07:01.262 --> 01:07:03.077
while you're reading this question.

01:07:03.077 --> 01:07:04.573
- The pattern depicted on the graph,

01:07:04.573 --> 01:07:06.574
and I have not seen this question before

01:07:06.574 --> 01:07:09.165
so we're just gonna give
the raw how do you do it,

01:07:09.165 --> 01:07:11.478
let's see Sal get this wrong.

01:07:11.478 --> 01:07:15.929
The pattern depicted on the
graph from 1450 to 1800.

01:07:15.929 --> 01:07:17.229
Alright, that's the years here.

01:07:17.229 --> 01:07:19.776
Best serves as evidence
of which of the following?

01:07:19.776 --> 01:07:20.783
Now I'm gonna look at the graph

01:07:20.783 --> 01:07:22.119
before I look at the choices.

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:23.344
- [Kim] Okay.

01:07:23.344 --> 01:07:24.811
- So let's see, number
of Africans transported

01:07:24.811 --> 01:07:27.022
to the New World between 1450 and 1900.

01:07:27.022 --> 01:07:28.654
- [Kim] Alright so those are our bounds.

01:07:28.654 --> 01:07:32.531
- And then we see very few
were transported prior to 1600.

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:34.451
Which is consistent to
what you were saying,

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:36.014
it wasn't being settled,
it was kind of exploration

01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:38.460
and trying to get riches and stuff.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.332
Then you have more in 1600 to 1700,

01:07:41.332 --> 01:07:42.872
you start having permanent settlements,

01:07:42.872 --> 01:07:45.272
referencing, I'm just thinking
what I just learned from you.

01:07:45.272 --> 01:07:46.977
- [Kim] Yeah, using the
logic of the context.

01:07:46.977 --> 01:07:50.752
- Yeah and then 1700s to 1800s you have a,

01:07:50.752 --> 01:07:54.558
that's the peak of influx
and this is the peak of,

01:07:54.558 --> 01:07:58.509
I'm guessing yeah, settlement,
creation of plantations,

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:02.470
especially in the south,
and then it dies off here

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.446
especially because, actually
before the Civil War

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:07.849
the importation started to slow down

01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:10.665
and then after the Civil
War it was abolished

01:08:10.665 --> 01:08:12.493
so that's why you have this.

01:08:12.493 --> 01:08:13.916
Okay, so now I have, I think I've--

01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:15.287
- [Kim] You've got the context, yeah.

01:08:15.287 --> 01:08:16.871
- So the pattern depicted on the graph

01:08:16.871 --> 01:08:18.669
from 1450 to 1800 best serves as evidence

01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:19.776
of which of the following?

01:08:19.776 --> 01:08:22.304
The replacement of indigenous
labor and indentured

01:08:22.304 --> 01:08:25.155
servitude by enslaved Africans
in New World colonies.

01:08:25.155 --> 01:08:28.156
That just doesn't feel right
because indigenous labor,

01:08:28.156 --> 01:08:30.151
we didn't even talk about indigenous labor

01:08:30.151 --> 01:08:31.533
as being a major.

01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:32.671
- [Kim] Oh yeah.

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:33.671
- Let's see.

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:35.993
- [Kim] One thing I
want to point out here--

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:37.710
- Oh, but indentured
servitude, that's interesting.

01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:40.728
- One thing I want to point
out here is that it says

01:08:40.728 --> 01:08:44.395
1450 to 1800 and that
is not including this.

01:08:46.659 --> 01:08:48.967
- Let me get this wrong,
let me get this wrong.

01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:51.212
Don't help me too much.

01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:54.014
The development of
varied systems of racial

01:08:54.014 --> 01:08:55.435
categoration in the,

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:56.844
now this doesn't refer to that at all,

01:08:56.844 --> 01:08:58.985
that's definitely, I can rule that out.

01:08:58.985 --> 01:09:01.470
I'll definitely rule that out.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.216
The effectiveness of the
abolitionist movement

01:09:03.216 --> 01:09:05.267
in Europe and the Americas.

01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:07.165
So that could speak to
this, but they're saying

01:09:07.165 --> 01:09:08.550
between 1450 and 1800.

01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:09.885
- [Kim] Right, so we are not even looking

01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:10.894
at this right now.

01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:12.208
- We're not even looking
at this so if you just look

01:09:12.208 --> 01:09:13.757
at that part you just
see this upward trend

01:09:13.757 --> 01:09:15.309
so that doesn't imply any effectiveness.

01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:17.571
So let's cross that one out.

01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:19.289
The susceptibility of enslaved populations

01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:20.288
to New World diseases.

01:09:20.288 --> 01:09:22.872
No, this doesn't say whether
people survive or not.

01:09:22.872 --> 01:09:24.554
We're just saying who's coming.

01:09:24.554 --> 01:09:25.954
So that's definitely not it,

01:09:25.954 --> 01:09:27.683
and so the thing that I
was about to rule out.

01:09:27.683 --> 01:09:29.795
(laughing)

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:32.815
I was like indigenous
labor, and I'm thinking

01:09:32.815 --> 01:09:35.043
more Native American labor
which I'm not aware of

01:09:35.043 --> 01:09:36.696
being a major source of labor.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:39.869
- [Kim] In like Mexico
the Spanish used a lot

01:09:39.869 --> 01:09:43.079
of indigenous labor but
yeah, it wasn't as big.

01:09:43.079 --> 01:09:44.539
- Yeah, you're right, and
this is to the New World,

01:09:44.539 --> 01:09:46.472
I'm kind of US centric.

01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:48.586
But you're right, we do read
about indentured servitude,

01:09:48.586 --> 01:09:50.752
you get your trip to the New
World but you have to work

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.832
for seven years et cetera, et cetera.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:55.017
But this is a good example
because this is one where

01:09:55.017 --> 01:09:59.387
A didn't jump out at me,
in fact when I first read A

01:09:59.387 --> 01:10:03.587
I'm like yeah, indigenous labor,
but then these other three

01:10:03.587 --> 01:10:04.941
were way more wrong.

01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:05.995
- Yes.

01:10:05.995 --> 01:10:07.887
- The chart had very
little to do with them.

01:10:07.887 --> 01:10:08.894
- Right and it's best serves as evidence,

01:10:08.894 --> 01:10:12.936
so even if you're like that's
maybe not the greatest thing,

01:10:12.936 --> 01:10:14.877
it's better than all the other choices.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.072
- So this is evidence that I'm doing this

01:10:17.072 --> 01:10:18.074
the first time.

01:10:18.074 --> 01:10:19.073
- [Kim] Yes.

01:10:19.073 --> 01:10:20.313
- Now I'm gonna do the other one.

01:10:20.313 --> 01:10:21.648
I'm in the AP American History.

01:10:21.648 --> 01:10:22.774
Which of the following
contributed most directly

01:10:22.774 --> 01:10:24.890
to the change in the number
of Africans transported

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:27.599
to the New World after 1800?

01:10:27.599 --> 01:10:30.133
So now we're talking about
what contributed to the change

01:10:30.133 --> 01:10:32.152
when you see this downward delta.

01:10:32.152 --> 01:10:34.808
The emergence of a more industrial economy

01:10:34.808 --> 01:10:37.393
in Great Britain and the United States.

01:10:37.393 --> 01:10:39.289
So you're talking about Great Britain,

01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:41.509
we're talking about
transportation to the New,

01:10:41.509 --> 01:10:44.073
contributed mostly to change,
transported to the New World,

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:47.370
so in Great Britain,
industrialization I guess you're less

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:49.971
these large agricultural
plantations, okay,

01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:50.969
I'll think about it.

01:10:50.969 --> 01:10:52.855
The outlawing of the
international slave trade

01:10:52.855 --> 01:10:54.095
by Great Britain and the United States.

01:10:54.095 --> 01:10:55.393
That seems interesting.

01:10:55.393 --> 01:10:58.143
I'll kind of, I'll star that one.

01:10:59.911 --> 01:11:04.175
The increased resistance to
slavery within African nations.

01:11:04.175 --> 01:11:08.271
We didn't talk a lot about
that and I don't remember

01:11:08.271 --> 01:11:10.851
so this one doesn't seem too right.

01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:12.823
The influence of major
slave rebellions in Haiti

01:11:12.823 --> 01:11:13.917
and elsewhere.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:16.756
There were rebellions,
but that shouldn't impact

01:11:16.756 --> 01:11:20.923
the overall, so, and just having
a more industrial economy,

01:11:23.402 --> 01:11:26.584
you still have a very
agricultural country at the time.

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:27.912
In the early 1800s.

01:11:27.912 --> 01:11:30.706
So that might have been more in the north

01:11:30.706 --> 01:11:33.481
and that's why frankly they
were more on the abolitionist

01:11:33.481 --> 01:11:36.091
side so yeah the outlawing of
the international slave trade,

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.273
which makes sense.

01:11:37.273 --> 01:11:38.454
- [Kim] You're right.

01:11:38.454 --> 01:11:39.452
- I'm right, thank you.

01:11:39.452 --> 01:11:40.896
(laughing)

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.797
Alright, well we're all
done, hopefully everyone

01:11:43.797 --> 01:11:45.373
enjoyed this.

01:11:45.373 --> 01:11:46.372
Any parting thoughts for the test takers?

01:11:46.372 --> 01:11:47.622
- Don't stress.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:52.888
The test is not designed for you to know

01:11:52.888 --> 01:11:54.223
every little fact.

01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:58.330
What it's designed to do
is to test your kind of

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.492
historical reasoning,
do you have this general

01:12:00.492 --> 01:12:02.510
overall sense of what's going on and using

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:06.056
that knowledge can you make a good guess?

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:09.142
- I didn't guess, I deduced.

01:12:09.142 --> 01:12:10.176
- You, yes.

01:12:10.176 --> 01:12:11.601
- I deduced my answer.

01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:13.313
- Put on your (mumbles) hat.

01:12:13.313 --> 01:12:14.597
- This was a deduction.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:17.026
- Can you deduce the correct answer?

01:12:17.026 --> 01:12:19.971
So think about the large themes

01:12:19.971 --> 01:12:22.366
and don't sweat the details.

01:12:22.366 --> 01:12:23.366
- Thank you.

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:26.480
- Thanks a lot.
- Good luck.
