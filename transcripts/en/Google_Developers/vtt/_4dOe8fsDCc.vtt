DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don
Dodge, and this

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.600
is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.200
Today, my guest is Alex Moore,
founder of Baydin.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.830
Alex was on our last show.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.870
And it was so interesting that
we invited him back again for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.950
another show.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.050
Today, we're going to talk
about raising money from

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.890
friends and family, angels,
venture capital, business

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.650
models, and that sort of thing--
how you get going.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.310
So Alex, did you raise money
from friends and family?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.480
Did you take the traditional
route-- friends and family,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.575
angels, VCs?

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:39.344
ALEX MOORE: My friends and
family are all pretty broke--

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.550
ALEX MOORE: --so I
actually went--

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.050
Baydin actually went
straight from

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.745
self-funding to angel funding.

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:49.930
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.650
So how did you make the
pitch to angels?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.680
How did you find the angels
that would be interested?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.380
ALEX MOORE: For us, the thing
that made the pitch work the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.960
best was having traction
numbers.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960
So when we actually--

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.250
when we went to raise our round,
we'd already launched

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.940
our product, Boomerang.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.900
We already had, I think, about
70,000 users using it.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.290
And we already had enough usage,
enough engaged users

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.930
that we figured we'd be
able to eventually

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.020
make money from it.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.340
DON DODGE: So you bootstrapped
building the initial product,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.950
getting it launched and
get to 70,000 users

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.170
before you raised money?

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.030
ALEX MOORE: Right.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.700
DON DODGE: How long did
that take you, and

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.870
how much did it cost?

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.640
ALEX MOORE: Well before--

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.910
well, if you don't count the
stuff we were working on

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.300
before we pivoted, it was about
six months of work to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.560
get the product out there and
launched and start getting

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.840
some users for it.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.750
From a cost standpoint, it was
mostly just keeping myself and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.410
the rest of the team fed and
housed and sheltered and all

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.990
those things--

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.810
so basically, whatever it takes
to keep people alive for

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.910
six months.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.410
DON DODGE: So how did you do
your initial user acquisition

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.000
and get to 70,000 users?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.750
That's a lot of users.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.720
ALEX MOORE: Well, we kind of
caught lightning in a bottle

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.960
when we launched.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.880
We got one article that
then turned into

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.030
several other articles.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.590
And it was mostly press-driven
at that point--

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.810
so just getting that initial
press and converting it.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.310
And then we also did a really
good kind of a predecessor to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.710
the launch sites that people
have, where you can tweet to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.490
get ahead in the line.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.620
So we did that also, much more
manually and much more ad hoc.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.640
So you could either sign up to
enter your email address to be

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.500
notified when we were ready, or
you could tweet and move to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.820
the front of the line.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.820
DON DODGE: So you encouraged
potential users to tweet about

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.920
Baydin, and then that
would get them up?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.330
So you sort of gamified the
acquisition process?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.180
ALEX MOORE: Yeah,
a little bit.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.770
And we found that if we said,
you can use it in 24 hours if

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.010
you tweet, or it might be a week
or so before we can get

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.826
the server capacity up-- and in
fairness, we needed to see

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:57.660
all the servers.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080
So we really couldn't let
everybody in all at once.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.395
But gamifying it definitely
helped us.

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.840
DON DODGE: So Facebook did
something similar, where you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.250
had to be from a
certain school.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.540
You had to have a Harvard edu
address or a Stanford edu

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.350
address to get into Facebook.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.960
And they created these
waiting lists.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.560
And that waiting list and
exclusivity sort of encouraged

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.180
more people to get going.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.000
Is that sort of what you did by
saying, tweet about it, and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.830
maybe you can get in?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.790
ALEX MOORE: Yeah, I
think it helped.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.470
I remember back at MIT, when
Facebook launched, we were, I

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.160
think, the third school
to get it.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.960
The thing that made it work
so well is they kept their

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.440
servers alive.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.000
Everybody was on Friendster,
everybody was on Myspace,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.470
everybody was on six of these
things, but the only one that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.510
kept their servers up reliably
was Facebook.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.550
And so I think it's one of
those things where server

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.520
capacity and exclusivity worked
hand-in-hand to make

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.600
things work well for them.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.490
DON DODGE: So let's get back to
how you made the decision

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.740
to raise money and where
you went to get it.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.210
How did you decide
to go to angels?

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.440
And how did you get introduced
to those angels?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.440
ALEX MOORE: We went with angels,
because I was running

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.980
out of money.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.690
And like I said, friends
and family weren't

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.230
really a big option.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.075
We got introduced to the
angels largely--

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:20.670
well, AngelList helped.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.930
It was way back in the early
days for AngelList.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.930
But that was sort of how
we sourced them.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.650
We went to AngelList, we looked
at them, and we found

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.150
out who we wanted to be--

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.580
who we wanted to meet.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.750
And then it tended to be long
intro chains for us that made

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.970
a big difference.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.220
So we'd meet one person.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.440
They'd say, well, this isn't
right for me, but I know who

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.380
it is right for.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.850
And then we'd get an
intro to them.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.730
And then eventually, we'd end
up with the people who ended

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.865
up investing.

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:48.590
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.260
Did you approach VCs?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.690
ALEX MOORE: We did.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.390
At the time, we thought we were
a little early for it.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.380
We didn't necessarily know
whether we had the kind of

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.820
thing where it needed to be a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.310
billion-dollar company or bust.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.300
We weren't sure what the right
shape of our company was going

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.430
to be, so we decided to go
with angels instead.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.510
DON DODGE: So you raised a
little bit of angel money.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.110
That got you funding for what,
six months or a year?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.630
ALEX MOORE: About 18 months.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.830
DON DODGE: 18 months.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.500
And at what point did you
decide, oh, we need to have a

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.830
revenue model, and we need to be
generating cash rather than

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.820
spend all that 18 months just
focused on building features

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.820
and innovation?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.760
When did you make that choice?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.030
ALEX MOORE: It was about six
months after we raised our

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.270
angel round.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.750
And we looked at our numbers
and our growth, and we saw

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.870
basically polynomial growth,
like I talked about last show.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.380
We saw that it wasn't the kind
of inherently viral product,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.540
where users mattered
more than money.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.540
And so we figured, well, let's
see if we can get a revenue

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.460
model in place.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.620
And if anything, that would
probably help us if we need to

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.050
raise money later.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.600
And fortunately, we were lucky
enough to not need to.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.470
We reached profitability
when we turned

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.650
on the revenue model.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.600
DON DODGE: So many start-up
entrepreneurs, when they're

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.510
faced with this problem, they
say the answer is, develop

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.290
more features.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.790
If we have more features, if we
have more innovation, we'll

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.610
attract more users, and that
will eventually lead to growth

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.500
and profit.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.570
Others, like yourself, say no,
we need to focus on a revenue

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.080
model and start generating at
least a little cash so that we

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080
extend our runway.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.100
So how did you go through
that decision process?

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.820
ALEX MOORE: Well, for us,
it was kind of a--

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.500
what really triggered it for
us is we looked at our

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.660
product, and we said, well, if
this isn't going to make any

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.150
money for us, this
probably isn't--

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.120
it's not viral.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.350
It's the kind of thing
where we have to be--

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.970
we know we're adding
a lot of value.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.710
Can we turn it into money?

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.440
And we really wanted to answer
that question for ourselves

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.170
before we poured another
12 months of

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.690
development effort into it.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.570
I think had things-- had it not
worked out, we would have

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.660
had to make a decision between,
do we add more

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.880
features to make it work, or
do we need to pivot again?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.990
But it worked out.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.520
DON DODGE: So how about today?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.310
You've raised your
angel money.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.910
You have a revenue model.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.280
You have users.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.670
You're at cash flow break
even or profitable.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.040
So what's next?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.120
Do you decide to go for venture
capital and shoot for

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.470
the moon, or are you going
for the steady

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.760
growth and cash flow?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.920
ALEX MOORE: The timing for us to
raise venture capital would

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.190
be when it could massively
accelerate the business.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.630
So right now we're doing very
nice growth on our own.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.900
And we haven't found a channel
that looks like we need

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.970
venture capital money
to saturate it.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.890
Every channel we've found, it
seems like we can make work

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.320
with our current budget.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.820
So when we find an opportunity
to acquire customers that

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.890
needs a bunch of VC money,
that's what we'd want to start

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.640
looking at that.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.760
DON DODGE: So what about
your angel investors?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.356
They put their money
how long ago?

00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:55.320
ALEX MOORE: About
two years ago.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.990
DON DODGE: So they
are two years in.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.410
Investors expect a return
at some point.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.470
So how do you deal with
your investors?

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.660
Do you tell them, hey, we're
going to be cash flow

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.390
positive, and we'll distribute
cash, or we're going to have

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.740
an exit at some point?

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.475
Or how do you deal with your
angel investors now?

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:15.840
ALEX MOORE: It's not too hard to
do when you're making money

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.530
and growing nicely.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.800
They've been very supportive.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.300
They're very--

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.710
the investors we have are very
hands-on guys who are awesome

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.490
to work with.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.240
And they've been generally
supportive of what we've been

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.580
doing, because the growth is
there, and we continue to

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.030
invest and do innovations
and things like that.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.690
So it hasn't really been
a challenge for us.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.480
It's just been, every month we
send out updates, and they

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.360
say, hey, it looks good.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.950
Keep doing it.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.510
DON DODGE: How about
employees?

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.300
Have you had to add employees?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.720
And if so, how do you attract
them and tell them the stock

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.560
option story?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.870
ALEX MOORE: Definitely.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.920
We've grown the team from
three up to eight now.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.170
And for us, the thing that makes
Baydin a great place to

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.990
work is the environment and
is what we're working on.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.075
One of the nice things about
working in email is that you

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:08.840
are your own customer also.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.560
So part of what makes it--

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.130
helps us attract customer-- or
helps us attract employees is

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.760
that we can recruit from
our customers also--

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.660
so people who think, hey, this
is really cool stuff, maybe I

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.690
should work on this.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.850
DON DODGE: Hm.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.940
Great story.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.130
Well, thank you.
