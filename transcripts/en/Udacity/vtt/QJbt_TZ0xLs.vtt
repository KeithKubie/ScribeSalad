00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.760
Congratulations.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.080
You made your first step towards
becoming a data analyst.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.240
This course will introduce you
to the world of data analysis.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.660
You'll learn how to go through
the entire data analysis process.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.300
As you dive into data analysis,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.780
there may be times where
you reach your strain zone.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.870
I encourage you to use
the Udacity forms for support.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.980
By the end of this course,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.410
you should have a better idea of whether
data analysis is the right fit for you.
