Good evening allow has.
          During the questioning

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.577
 tonight, and the 
conversation between these two 

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:30.101
guests, we're looking 
for that thread that goes 

00:17:30.102 --> 00:17:37.570
between public service and 
the idea that the rest of our 

00:17:37.571 --> 00:17:40.671
collective experiences 
lead into that and can 

00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:45.585
illuminate that, I've known 
you since we were both young 

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:49.814
girls covering the 
Reagan administration, she 

00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:55.032
brought her spouse 
tonight. Senate majority leader 

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.168
Mitch Mcconel thank 
you for coming. 

00:17:58.169 --> 00:18:03.561
          (APPLAUSE).
          Secretary, you began 

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:10.265
as a banker, and you 
-- your first government job was

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.250
 a White House 
fellow, how did you get from in 

00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:17.501
and then into 
cabinet position and what was 

00:18:17.502 --> 00:18:22.041
the thread that got to 
you head the Peace Corps? The 

00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:25.070
thread is curiosity. 
I'm an immigrant to this country

00:18:25.174 --> 00:18:28.628
. I didn't 
understand so much about America

00:18:28.631 --> 00:18:34.122
. So, when I was a 
banker, I thought I was involve

00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:38.499
ed in a number of 
transactions, if it was a 

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.543
private sector it would be 
four people, myself, the banker,

00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:47.991
 the boreer and most 
of the time it was a he, his 

00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:50.503
lawyer and my lawyer 
and we were able to finish a 

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:54.496
deal in two hours, but 
whenever I did a government deal

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:58.589
 there were would be 
reames of documents 35 lawyers 

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.878
on the government's 
side and it took like months to 

00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:06.137
close the deal, so I 
was kind of curious, why did 

00:19:06.138 --> 00:19:12.003
this happen, why the 
difference? And so, I heard 

00:19:12.004 --> 00:19:14.004
about the White House 
fellowship program and I applied

00:19:14.523 --> 00:19:18.670
 but it was out of 
the sense of love for this 

00:19:18.671 --> 00:19:22.367
country, curiosity of how 
our government functioned and I 

00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:26.209
wanted to understand 
the larger society here in 

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.904
America.
          And then you had been 

00:19:28.905 --> 00:19:31.460
a department cabinet 
position, how did the Peace 

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:36.164
Corps arise out of that, 
and I remember what happened in 

00:19:36.165 --> 00:19:38.997
1919 the year that 
you took over the Peace Corps 

00:19:38.998 --> 00:19:43.245
because I remember 
missing missing Christmas about 

00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:48.961
our four little 
children, it was the when Soviet

00:19:49.384 --> 00:19:54.004
 yet union fell a
apart -- they addressed the 

00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:58.762
nation and congratulateed 
to have the courage to break up 

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:03.152
the Soviet Union. 
You now have a Peace Corp. There

00:20:03.153 --> 00:20:08.013
 were no Peace Corp 
representatives on the ground in

00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:12.872
 those countries.
          President George A W 

00:20:12.873 --> 00:20:16.800
bush had a very good 
feel for world affairs. So in 

00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:23.782
the summer of 1991, he 
already had a feeling that the 

00:20:23.783 --> 00:20:26.359
collapse, I think 
because he never talked about it

00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:30.605
, but he must have 
had a sense that the former 

00:20:30.606 --> 00:20:34.310
Soviet Union was going 
to collapse and that the peoples

00:20:34.751 --> 00:20:38.743
 in the former 
Soviet Union would need help 

00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:43.290
from a people to people 
kind of exchange but they'll 

00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:46.997
require different skill 
sets, they will require a more 

00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:50.683
sophisticated kind of 
assistance, and so I was in 

00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:55.633
California in June of 
1991, and he mentioned his 

00:20:55.634 --> 00:21:00.182
interest in placing me at 
Peace Corps, and he said the 

00:21:00.183 --> 00:21:06.601
people's of the Soviet 
Union, this ever came about, 

00:21:06.602 --> 00:21:12.207
would want, would need 
assistance in adjusting to a 

00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:17.718
more industrializeed and 
to join a communeity, the 

00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:19.548
internal communeity if 
anything like that were to 

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:23.854
happen. I have to give my 
husband some credit -- he wasn't

00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:26.776
 my husband then -- 
I was just going out with him, 

00:21:26.777 --> 00:21:30.223
but he was cute, he 
still is, so I discussed it with

00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:35.636
 him, and he was 
very encourageing of my entering

00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:40.580
 the Peace Corps as 
the director.

00:21:40.581 --> 00:21:43.309
          Reed Hastings, so you 
graduate from body 

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.156
en, you're going to go into the 
Marine core, how did 

00:21:48.157 --> 00:21:55.327
that turn into the Peace Corps 
and then into a enter 

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:58.777
preneural career?
          I wanted to do some 

00:21:58.778 --> 00:22:03.329
form of service and 
the Marine Corps has where you 

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.163
can do summers at 
quantity coand then you get 

00:22:07.164 --> 00:22:14.041
commissioned as second 
lawsuit, then I Lou ten else -- 

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:17.570
I realizeed that the 
system is very well organized 

00:22:17.571 --> 00:22:23.384
and very impressive 
but as a junior person, it's 

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:28.008
following orders a lot 
and I realizeed that may not be 

00:22:28.009 --> 00:22:32.649
my sweet spot, so I 
was able to petition out of that

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.901
 and then join the 
Peace Corps, where you're sent 

00:22:37.902 --> 00:22:42.602
to many different 
places and make it as you go 

00:22:42.603 --> 00:22:47.716
along and it develops 
your leadership muscle in that 

00:22:47.717 --> 00:22:49.841
way.
          Did you get to pick 

00:22:49.842 --> 00:22:52.979
where you were going?
          No you go to your 

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.980
local library and look 
up

00:22:58.437 --> 00:23:02.527
 enpsychpedia, like men of the 
places in the world 

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:09.611
it's a very optimistic people 
and I was at a high 

00:23:09.612 --> 00:23:14.056
school math teacher and had a 
Fantus particular 

00:23:14.057 --> 00:23:16.754
experience.
          Reed you live in 

00:23:16.755 --> 00:23:19.564
California, Silicon 
Valley, many of the students 

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:24.869
watching in Hawaii from 
two locations, so Washington 

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.512
belt way, seems like a 
strange preacher and probably 

00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:33.543
not at times a very 
appealing one, do you think from

00:23:33.936 --> 00:23:37.754
 your point of view 
can you explain how how you view

00:23:38.369 --> 00:23:42.548
 Washington and whether 
a public serves career at this 

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:44.930
moment probably 
doesn't look that appetizerring 

00:23:44.931 --> 00:23:49.305
to some people? I 
think it looks appetizing to 

00:23:49.306 --> 00:23:52.408
many people whether 
it's for Washington or 

00:23:52.409 --> 00:23:55.518
Sacramento for us in 
California. Some people choose a

00:23:55.577 --> 00:23:59.275
 life of a is the 
tear that is dedicated to public

00:24:00.525 --> 00:24:03.372
 service decade 
after decade, you develop a lot 

00:24:03.373 --> 00:24:05.950
of skills and 
connections and can be more 

00:24:05.951 --> 00:24:09.777
effective. Other people 
like myself dabble in it, two 

00:24:09.778 --> 00:24:13.515
years in the Peace 
Corps then in private sector and

00:24:13.774 --> 00:24:20.038
 I volunteered for 
the Board of Education -- you 

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:22.039
became chairman? 
That's right but your supporting

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.170
 the professionals 
like the secretary tear that are

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:29.134
 dedicating their 
liveed so as you realize people 

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:31.525
make different 
choices and that's okay and you 

00:24:31.526 --> 00:24:34.106
work together I 
think there's a lot of different

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:36.778
 opportunityies to 
either do I'll call it small 

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:39.758
tier of occasion 
service that I've done and focus

00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:43.452
 on the private 
sector or long-term in many 

00:24:43.453 --> 00:24:45.485
different roles like the 
secretary tear.

00:24:45.486 --> 00:24:48.624
          I totally agree with 
that and I I think 

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:51.856
it's important to have these 
different paths into 

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:57.657
public service. Federal state, 
local levels, I think 

00:24:57.658 --> 00:25:00.961
our nation benefits when people 
have a diverseity of 

00:25:00.962 --> 00:25:05.457
experience in the private sector
 and volunteer 

00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:09.356
sector and come into the public 
sector all of that 

00:25:09.357 --> 00:25:11.357
is helpful.
          The student that's are

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:15.289
 watching tonight 
from Hawaii should they worry 

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.172
about being put off if 
they see Washington looking 

00:25:19.173 --> 00:25:27.714
chaotic right now? 
Democracy is chaotic and messy. 

00:25:28.734 --> 00:25:33.676
I teach English to 
immigrants from Asia, and they 

00:25:33.677 --> 00:25:38.685
keep on asking me, 
they keep on saying, who is in 

00:25:38.686 --> 00:25:42.621
charge, and I tell 
them there's nobody in charge, 

00:25:42.622 --> 00:25:47.378
then they say you and 
I know each other well enough 

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.552
you can female who's 
in charge in America.  The 

00:25:50.553 --> 00:25:53.147
dynamic aspects of our 
society and the balance of power

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:57.169
 between the 
different branches of the 

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:02.404
federal level, you know 
making laws is like making 

00:26:02.405 --> 00:26:07.586
sausage, democracy is 
messy. We have a nation of 

00:26:07.587 --> 00:26:13.390
people, people talk about 
gridlock, our country is made up

00:26:13.391 --> 00:26:15.391
 of

00:26:17.232 --> 00:26:22.196
 -- Congress is 
made up of senators and 

00:26:22.197 --> 00:26:25.077
congressmen who represent 
where they're from and giving 

00:26:25.078 --> 00:26:29.713
voice to their people, 
the people who they represent --

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.215
 and sent them there
there, so of course our national

00:26:34.274 --> 00:26:37.539
 discourse and 
dialogue is going to be kind of 

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.828
chaotic and messy as 
well.

00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:44.078
          Let me ask both of you
 how do you express 

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:47.907
that to the people, the young 
Peace Corps volunteers 

00:26:47.908 --> 00:26:51.604
that are out there dealing with 
-- you have stories 

00:26:51.605 --> 00:26:55.745
of when you were -- about ways 
in which people's 

00:26:55.746 --> 00:26:58.835
lives were change because you 
were there and 

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:03.151
secretary for you as well, ways 
in which you noted 

00:27:03.152 --> 00:27:08.554
in your tenure lives changed in 
places overseas.

00:27:08.555 --> 00:27:11.949
          Yeah, absolutely, the 
Peace Corp and many 

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.373
things similar to it are great 
experiences to grow a 

00:27:15.374 --> 00:27:19.637
sense of the world. It's 
inevitable if you don't 

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:23.951
grow up in the U.S. and don't 
get a chance to travel 

00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:27.170
you have one view of the world, 
once you live 

00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:31.310
outside of the U.S. and you see 
how broad it is and 

00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:33.964
the wonderful nature of people 
around the world it's 

00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:38.699
very powerful experience, so I 
felt very connected 

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.954
to everyone. And again, you know
, times may look 

00:27:42.955 --> 00:27:47.791
chaotic but they're not that 
chaotic compared to 

00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:52.493
World War II or Civil War or the
 13 years before we 

00:27:52.494 --> 00:27:55.639
had a constitution, so you have 
to have some 

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.470
perspective and you might also 
look at it and say in 

00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:03.415
difficult times is when service 
is most needed and 

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:07.327
most valuable. So I certainly 
would encourage any 

00:28:07.328 --> 00:28:10.003
young person to be involved and 
not think about the 

00:28:10.004 --> 00:28:14.244
last 20 years as a turn off of 
politics.

00:28:14.245 --> 00:28:18.418
          Were there times with 
some of the students 

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:23.003
and the residents that you dealt
 with that you felt 

00:28:23.004 --> 00:28:27.745
you were able to make the 
connection to help them 

00:28:27.746 --> 00:28:30.871
better understand America, the 
1980's were a 

00:28:30.872 --> 00:28:33.297
different time but that that 
different -- 

00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:36.835
          Yeah, but I think you 
really do it as a 

00:28:36.836 --> 00:28:40.824
Peace Corps volunteer by example
, it's not giving 

00:28:40.825 --> 00:28:43.661
lectures on the separation of 
powers or something, 

00:28:43.662 --> 00:28:48.259
it's living your live in a rural
 area and being a 

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.659
decent person and for them it 
breaks down the theory 

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.482
of what America is to make it 
very real and personal

00:28:54.483 --> 00:28:58.028
personal. So the Peace Corps has
 always been about a 

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:02.591
very personal touch, and with 
the sent's leadership 

00:29:02.592 --> 00:29:07.198
around the world I'm sure you 
got -- I got one slice 

00:29:07.199 --> 00:29:12.382
of (inaudible) and --
          Reed is so inspireing 

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:16.935
when he say -- what 
he said about the chaos and to 

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:20.782
think about Civil War
War, 13 years before, I didn't 

00:29:20.783 --> 00:29:22.812
think about that but 
that's really true.

00:29:22.813 --> 00:29:27.058
          So when you ask about 
what's really -- 

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:30.744
what difference we're seeing -- 
you know, when I was 

00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:34.437
director of the Peace Corps and 
I went to visit all 

00:29:34.438 --> 00:29:37.418
these Peace Corps volunteers and
 speak with them and 

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:41.257
there are some who are watching 
now, they tell me 

00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:45.450
and I feel it myself that I 
changed because I went 

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:50.236
to visit them.
          And I -- there's some 

00:29:50.237 --> 00:29:55.075
volunteers here, I 
went to ton graduate, I was 

00:29:55.076 --> 00:30:00.325
single at the time, it's 
like -- they gave me a wedding 

00:30:00.326 --> 00:30:05.341
dress, it's a Matt 
that you wrap around yourselves,

00:30:05.586 --> 00:30:07.857
 I'm sure the 
volunteers understand this -- 

00:30:07.858 --> 00:30:14.992
which were the other 
areas? The hospitality of the 

00:30:14.993 --> 00:30:19.748
local people just 
overwhelming, every single piece

00:30:19.754 --> 00:30:24.793
 Iplace I went the 
tremendous out pouring toward 

00:30:24.794 --> 00:30:31.639
Americans is just so 
so impressive and inspireing.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.041
          And that personal one 
on one with 

00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:42.702
residents may have a softening 
effect if politically 

00:30:42.703 --> 00:30:47.979
a country is not at war with the
 eyewitness, did you 

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.530
have any instances worrying or 
thought to bring 

00:30:52.531 --> 00:30:57.773
Americans home? We did. The 
first responsibility is 

00:30:57.774 --> 00:31:00.767
to make sure the safety and 
security of the 

00:31:00.768 --> 00:31:05.061
volunteer so we did withdraw 
Peace Corps volunteers 

00:31:05.062 --> 00:31:09.871
from the labor of Pakistan at 
the time -- but when I 

00:31:09.872 --> 00:31:12.992
was Peace Corps director one of 
the first things we 

00:31:12.993 --> 00:31:16.691
did was to have an emergency 
plan, it was kind of 

00:31:16.692 --> 00:31:20.276
sad we had to do this but 
because they're spread so 

00:31:20.277 --> 00:31:23.883
far it took about three days or 
even more to gather 

00:31:23.884 --> 00:31:26.954
them together, and so the world 
is changing.

00:31:26.955 --> 00:31:34.750
          Were you able to 
airlift them out? Yes yes yes, 

00:31:34.751 --> 00:31:37.324
we 
had institute ad plan -- to 

00:31:37.325 --> 00:31:41.324
communicate with the 
Peace Corps volunteers faster so

00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:45.873
 they can be 
congregated at one piece for 

00:31:45.874 --> 00:31:49.869
mediate evacuation if 
necessary.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.139
          One question we heard 
from students and 

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.545
from some in the Peace Corps as 
well, asking how -- 

00:31:56.546 --> 00:32:01.855
whether the Peace Corps 
volunteers representing the 

00:32:01.856 --> 00:32:04.466
eyewitness around the world are 
representing the 

00:32:04.467 --> 00:32:09.324
diverseity of the eyewitness of 
women, minorities, 

00:32:09.325 --> 00:32:15.143
was that an issue at all? 
Absolutely. Reed is so 

00:32:15.144 --> 00:32:19.133
interesting but but yeah, 
absolutely. Peace Corps 

00:32:19.134 --> 00:32:24.560
has a hard time recruiting. I 
don't know how but 20 

00:32:24.561 --> 00:32:32.945
years we had difficulty 
recruiting people of color. 

00:32:32.946 --> 00:32:36.363
I want towed make sure that I 
was financially 

00:32:36.364 --> 00:32:38.601
responsible and the thought of 
taking two years off 

00:32:38.602 --> 00:32:42.525
and not getting paid except for 
a very small certify 

00:32:42.526 --> 00:32:46.592
even was not an option. For a 
lot of people in 

00:32:46.593 --> 00:32:49.997
different communeityiesityies --
 I don't think we should be 

00:32:49.998 --> 00:32:53.683
surprised, it's kind of 
difference in the culture 

00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:58.684
diverseity that we have. But we 
have to do a more 

00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:05.128
better job of making known of 
what it's like to be a 

00:33:05.129 --> 00:33:08.719
Peace Corp volunteer.
          Reed, in your 

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.661
experience, especially when 
you come out -- you and the 

00:33:13.662 --> 00:33:18.558
private sector now, are 
there good arguments for young 

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.978
people to get 
involved who might not be 

00:33:20.979 --> 00:33:25.982
traditional Peace Corps 
candidates? Yeah I think it's a 

00:33:25.983 --> 00:33:29.396
great experience for 
somebody who is independent mind

00:33:29.398 --> 00:33:33.217
ed and one of the 
great things the U.S. government

00:33:33.672 --> 00:33:38.793
 does is delay any 
student loan payments -- 

00:33:38.794 --> 00:33:43.488
          Explain that -- many 
of our students have 

00:33:43.489 --> 00:33:47.172
built up debt and if you go into
 the Peace Corps 

00:33:47.173 --> 00:33:51.363
that is deferred. And then the 
Peace Corps is doing 

00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:54.408
a brother job of reentry and 
skill development and 

00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:58.105
things, so it's a remarkable 
program because it's 

00:33:58.106 --> 00:34:00.839
now about 50 years and if you 
think about most 

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.931
programs created, in the last 20
 or 30 years, they 

00:34:04.932 --> 00:34:07.908
get associateed with the 
political party and the 

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:13.300
Peace Corps has been a very 
bipartisanship effort 

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:17.720
that has wide support and it's 
unique in the last 

00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:20.002
100 years.
          Let me broaden that to

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.837
 a bigger aspect 
both of you have worked and 

00:34:23.838 --> 00:34:27.297
currently are in the 
private sector, what are the 

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:33.406
lessons that you from 
the private sector learned that 

00:34:33.407 --> 00:34:38.236
are skill that's you 
could take your Peace Corps 

00:34:38.237 --> 00:34:41.346
volunteers could use and 
skills you took or think now you

00:34:41.497 --> 00:34:45.496
 took with you -- 
let me start with you Mr. 

00:34:45.499 --> 00:34:50.608
Hastings, the private 
sector skills that could be 

00:34:50.609 --> 00:34:52.870
employed when you're 
overseas in a position represent

00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:56.407
ing the United 
States like that.

00:34:56.408 --> 00:35:00.403
          When you're 22 and 23 
and you're on your 

00:35:00.404 --> 00:35:04.808
own in a remote part of the 
world you do a lot of 

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:09.535
stupid stuff, some works out and
 but I look at the 

00:35:09.536 --> 00:35:14.607
miss adventures like this BP 
project, it didn't work 

00:35:14.608 --> 00:35:19.628
out, but this other one which 
was water tanks in 

00:35:19.629 --> 00:35:24.176
local high school did, so you 
got to be relatively 

00:35:24.177 --> 00:35:26.696
fearless and try things and that
 mind set of being 

00:35:26.697 --> 00:35:31.329
okay with some failure and being
 willing to try is 

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.269
tremendously helpful in the 
private sector.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.662
          A as a former 
secretary tear of labor -- 

00:35:36.663 --> 00:35:39.809
          For 8 years right? Yes
.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.818
          All 8 years.
          All 8 years. The 

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:47.642
workforce of the future 
is very interesting to me and 

00:35:47.643 --> 00:35:50.465
very important to the 
country. I think what's really 

00:35:50.466 --> 00:35:54.712
importance now is to 
go into the future the workers 

00:35:54.713 --> 00:35:59.279
of the future have to 
be knowledge workers and Reed is

00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:02.417
 in the area of 
technology, technology is 

00:36:02.418 --> 00:36:09.092
changing so much the way 
we live and work and travel, 

00:36:09.093 --> 00:36:15.206
what's really important 
is the road to work that was so 

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:18.889
valued in the past 
is no longer valuable. Most 

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.757
valuable is creativity, 
inagain knewity and the ability 

00:36:23.758 --> 00:36:26.439
to think.
          The Peace Corps 

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.598
volunteer experience 
that's very helpful. It doesn't 

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:34.135
really matter if you 
want to -- some people may say I

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.824
 never worked in the 
private sector before how can 

00:36:37.825 --> 00:36:42.372
this help? Every 
employer is working for workers 

00:36:42.373 --> 00:36:46.200
for the abdominal to 
be curious, to learn, to adjust,

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:51.221
 be flexible and to 
be createtive and resourceful, 

00:36:51.222 --> 00:36:55.763
and these are skills 
that if one can gain are very 

00:36:55.764 --> 00:37:00.032
helpful in any kind of 
job in public, private -- 

00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:02.840
          And that of course the
 purpose of this 

00:37:02.841 --> 00:37:06.841
program is to encourage young 
people to consider 

00:37:06.842 --> 00:37:10.374
public service, those are the 
kind of skills, the 

00:37:10.375 --> 00:37:16.107
creativity, the being able to 
write and imagine 

00:37:16.108 --> 00:37:19.077
would be important for public 
service job as well.

00:37:19.078 --> 00:37:22.605
          That's absolutely 
right. I mean, pushing 

00:37:22.606 --> 00:37:26.612
yourself to do things that are 
challenging, you know 

00:37:26.613 --> 00:37:30.855
whether it's banking around -- 
and whether it's 

00:37:30.856 --> 00:37:33.592
Peace Corps, I think people 
learn the most when 

00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:36.418
they're in challenging situation
s. And that's what 

00:37:36.419 --> 00:37:39.557
the -- that's what stimulates 
the most learning, 

00:37:39.558 --> 00:37:42.274
it's continuous learning in our 
society today.

00:37:42.275 --> 00:37:46.267
          We had a question 
about public partner 

00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:52.069
private -- private public 
partnership in a time when 

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:56.335
government funds are limited, 
when Americans want 

00:37:56.336 --> 00:37:59.966
government to have a smaller 
role, they want the 

00:37:59.967 --> 00:38:03.157
private sector to pick up some 
of that, where are 

00:38:03.158 --> 00:38:07.564
those public private 
partnerships important for this 

00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:11.826
government now, for the country 
right now, and for 

00:38:11.827 --> 00:38:15.655
next generation of leaders 
coming along? Well-in 

00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:20.211
terms of -- this is a very 
timely question because 

00:38:20.212 --> 00:38:26.639
this administration has one of 
its top priorities 

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.649
the infrastructure of our 
country and how we need to 

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:34.872
rebuild, refurbish, repair the 
existing 

00:38:34.873 --> 00:38:37.566
infrastructure, we do not have 
enough money as a 

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:42.415
country to be able to address 
all of the needs of 

00:38:42.416 --> 00:38:44.704
the infrastructure through 
government funding alone.

00:38:44.705 --> 00:38:48.963
          And we would not want 
to fund direct 

00:38:48.964 --> 00:38:51.099
government funding all these 
different projects 

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.046
because it would have a impact 
on our deficit and 

00:38:55.047 --> 00:38:59.197
potentially dislocate the 
private sector markets as 

00:38:59.198 --> 00:39:05.284
well. There's plentyity, there's
 a lot of private 

00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:08.558
sector money resource that's ra
available and there's 

00:39:08.559 --> 00:39:14.685
states and other places 
municipalities that prohibit 

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:17.248
the private sector from 
investing in public 

00:39:17.249 --> 00:39:20.237
infrastructure, so there must be
 a way in which we 

00:39:20.238 --> 00:39:24.231
can not discriminate against 
private sectors and 

00:39:24.232 --> 00:39:30.274
allow them to participate -- 
          A toll road, a bridge 

00:39:30.275 --> 00:39:32.848
-- it's an effort by

00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:42.986
the federal funding 
would probably be about 200 

00:39:42.987 --> 00:39:46.278
billion and we would 
level that because a lot of 

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:51.384
times -- if you can get 
some government monies, the 

00:39:51.385 --> 00:39:55.074
government moneys is 
kind of like a goodies keeping 

00:39:55.075 --> 00:39:58.058
feel, and it will 
attract and entice other 

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:03.330
resources to come in.
          So if of the 200 

00:40:03.331 --> 00:40:08.556
billion there will be 
opportunity to pregnant private 

00:40:08.557 --> 00:40:15.547
sector funding 
through innovative ways in ways 

00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:18.531
you can get the 
private sector to come in.

00:40:18.532 --> 00:40:24.249
          Just today I came from
 Atlanta, Georgia to 

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:30.374
participate in the opening of I
25, it's a major 

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:36.042
artery in Atlanta, Georgia, the 
bridge on this I25 

00:40:36.043 --> 00:40:40.176
on March 30th erupted in a huge 
fire that resulted 

00:40:40.177 --> 00:40:43.157
in a collapse of this section of
 the bridge, this is 

00:40:43.158 --> 00:40:48.298
a major artery in Atlanta and it
 messed up traffic. 

00:40:48.299 --> 00:40:53.375
But through -- it's not a public
 partnership but 

00:40:53.376 --> 00:40:58.246
through the private sector this 
project came in 

00:40:58.247 --> 00:41:02.344
under budget, ahead of schedule 
and basically 7 

00:41:02.345 --> 00:41:06.484
weeks it was able to rebuild 
this section of the 

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:10.719
bridge, and now Georgia are able
 to be on the move 

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.391
again.
          Silicon Valley anxious

00:41:13.402 --> 00:41:18.758
 to help on public, 
private partnership, you're 

00:41:18.759 --> 00:41:23.682
involvement in education 
in the state of California isle 

00:41:23.683 --> 00:41:25.136
general dare.
          Some of the most 

00:41:25.137 --> 00:41:29.794
exciteing stuff in private 
partnerships is things like the 

00:41:29.795 --> 00:41:33.477
private rocketship 
efforts you would never thought 

00:41:33.478 --> 00:41:37.637
ten years ago that 
several private companies were 

00:41:37.638 --> 00:41:42.749
developing rockets 
and doing amazing things and we 

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.571
have self-driving 
cars and over the next five or 

00:41:45.572 --> 00:41:48.561
ten years trace going 
to be a tremendous revolution, 

00:41:48.562 --> 00:41:51.679
how we all get around 
and people's relationship with 

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.003
cars, all these 
different sectors are in the 

00:41:56.004 --> 00:42:00.231
education side, they're 
doing westbound based learning 

00:42:00.232 --> 00:42:05.678
and what's happening 
in the classroom and provide 

00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:08.063
divideizeed instruction, 
so we're seeing the role in 

00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:11.762
technology and multiple 
different sectors where a long 

00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:14.181
time ago it was 
mostly from the government.

00:42:14.182 --> 00:42:17.572
          Let me ask both of you
 before we go to 

00:42:17.573 --> 00:42:20.698
questions from the audience, a 
little bit about 

00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:24.408
leadership, and there are 
students in Hawaii and in 

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:28.550
the audience here and able to 
see this online, and 

00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:31.934
there always looking for some 
kind of key of what 

00:42:31.935 --> 00:42:36.642
makes great leadership, and I 
wonder he if I can 

00:42:36.643 --> 00:42:42.444
each of you to talk about risk 
of over simplifying 

00:42:42.445 --> 00:42:47.447
things, leadership -- there are 
leadership quality 

00:42:47.448 --> 00:42:50.590
qualities that apply to public 
and private sector 

00:42:50.591 --> 00:42:53.273
that these students should focus
 on.

00:42:53.274 --> 00:42:56.399
          I would say that 
leadership can be learned

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.407
learned. When I was younger I 
always thought leaders 

00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:02.938
are born, leadership can be 
learned. So I think it's 

00:43:02.939 --> 00:43:06.896
really important for young 
people to practice being 

00:43:06.897 --> 00:43:10.064
a leader, and they can do so in 
a very low risk way 

00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:16.212
by volunteering with agency or 
with a cause they 

00:43:16.213 --> 00:43:18.149
feel strongly about and they can
 learn communication 

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.885
skills and they can learn all 
about leadership skill

00:43:20.886 --> 00:43:26.040
skills as well. Having said that
 I think a great 

00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:29.373
quality for leaders to have is a
 sense of integrate, 

00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:32.369
they have to be true to 
themselves, that they're 

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:36.703
true to those that they serve, 
and that there's a 

00:43:36.704 --> 00:43:38.855
pureness part.
          That's a challenge 

00:43:38.856 --> 00:43:43.779
though, sometimes when 
you're own personal integrate is

00:43:43.782 --> 00:43:46.890
 up against a brick 
wall of something that seems to 

00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:51.735
be testing that, 
whole true to it -- 

00:43:51.736 --> 00:43:55.125
          There are very few 
times when most of us 

00:43:55.126 --> 00:43:58.965
are put in that situation, I'm 
very glad to say, but 

00:43:58.966 --> 00:44:02.111
when that situation does come I 
think it's really 

00:44:02.112 --> 00:44:05.955
important to know who you are 
but you stand for your 

00:44:05.956 --> 00:44:11.503
own values and be strong enough 
to stand up for them

00:44:11.504 --> 00:44:16.777
them. Maybe a little too 
influenced by Frank under

00:44:16.778 --> 00:44:19.751
underwood because she knows 
house of cards is coming 

00:44:19.752 --> 00:44:24.746
back in three weeks.
          You may have started 

00:44:24.747 --> 00:44:28.293
Netflex and online 
streaming and all those red 

00:44:28.294 --> 00:44:32.177
envelopes that used to 
come but he's also the godfather

00:44:32.183 --> 00:44:36.549
 of President under
underwood -- 

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:40.573
          Don't lay that at my 
feet. I would say 

00:44:40.574 --> 00:44:43.358
about leadership it's about 
being the best person 

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:46.030
you can be. There's two types of
 people in the world

00:44:46.031 --> 00:44:48.916
world, the people that pick up 
the trademark when 

00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:52.308
they see it lying on the floor 
and people that walk 

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:55.593
by and if you want to be a 
leader you have to be the 

00:44:55.594 --> 00:44:59.837
first person. That's a great 
answer. One more quick 

00:44:59.838 --> 00:45:02.819
question before we start with 
those that have come 

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:08.002
in, the idea of success in life 
is obviously 

00:45:08.003 --> 00:45:10.508
everything that students want to
 inspire but all of 

00:45:10.509 --> 00:45:16.480
us want to inspire, but can you 
learn from setbacks? 

00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:21.890
Absolutely -- that's learning 
experience -- they're 

00:45:21.891 --> 00:45:24.871
the hardest you learn the most, 
wouldn't you agree? 

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:28.484
You said before that you have to
 be ready to fail, 

00:45:28.485 --> 00:45:31.624
and I think the hardest periods 
in your life are the 

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:34.529
time that's you have -- you will
 experience the 

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:39.934
greatest personal growth. And so
 I think for those, 

00:45:39.935 --> 00:45:42.918
for those that are thinking this
, all of us 

00:45:42.919 --> 00:45:48.643
encounter adultyies in life and 
we have to have the 

00:45:48.644 --> 00:45:50.472
strength to be able to prevail 
and have confidence 

00:45:50.473 --> 00:45:54.931
in ourselves and also know that 
this is the time 

00:45:54.932 --> 00:46:00.162
when we are really being tested 
and being made, our 

00:46:00.163 --> 00:46:04.114
character and who we are. It's 
hard though. It's 

00:46:04.115 --> 00:46:07.093
very hard. If I didn't have to 
do it I wouldn't do 

00:46:07.094 --> 00:46:10.939
it, but those times when you 
have the most difficult

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.382
difficultyies that's when I 
learned the most.

00:46:14.383 --> 00:46:18.483
          I think probably 95% 
of people never heard 

00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:24.008
of quickster but your company 
had what some called a 

00:46:24.009 --> 00:46:26.322
desk spiral and look at you now 
was that the learn

00:46:26.323 --> 00:46:29.461
learning -- the key learning 
experience for you? 

00:46:29.462 --> 00:46:33.554
Yeah, that was a major 
experience about six years 

00:46:33.555 --> 00:46:39.629
ago, Netflex was splitting the D
 VD and streaming 

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.673
business and we made a big 
mistake and the customers 

00:46:43.674 --> 00:46:48.076
went from loving us to hateing 
us very quickly and it 

00:46:48.077 --> 00:46:51.219
took many years to earn back the
 trust, and out of 

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.603
that, we really learn ad lot 
about listening to the 

00:46:54.604 --> 00:46:59.154
customers, if we saw something 
that was a long-term 

00:46:59.155 --> 00:47:02.435
strategy, it is just going a 
little bit slower and 

00:47:02.436 --> 00:47:06.686
bringing customers along with us
, and I realizeed I 

00:47:06.687 --> 00:47:11.837
could never do elector politics,
 don't have the ear 

00:47:11.838 --> 00:47:15.391
for it, I'm built for business 
and I encourage 

00:47:15.392 --> 00:47:18.372
people to think about what 
they're good at. For 

00:47:18.373 --> 00:47:23.060
myself, I realize I'm good at 
business so I'm happy 

00:47:23.061 --> 00:47:27.858
paying my taxes and volunteering
 and being very 

00:47:27.859 --> 00:47:29.485
thankful for the service among 
us.

00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:33.289
          When you make a 
mistake apologize is that 

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.136
a good business strategy? 
Generally, yeah. I would 

00:47:37.137 --> 00:47:40.265
say to be Frank, customers don't
 care that much, 

00:47:40.266 --> 00:47:44.967
they want the thing fixed. The 
apology is okay, but 

00:47:44.968 --> 00:47:48.246
if you think the apology itself 
is going to make a 

00:47:48.247 --> 00:47:52.652
big difference, there's deeper 
issues.

00:47:52.653 --> 00:47:57.672
          I'm Asian American, I 
always apologies. 

00:48:00.902 --> 00:48:03.713
Ladies and gentlemen, let's take
 a few questions and 

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:11.013
I'm going to start with a Peace 
Corps volunteer -- a 

00:48:11.014 --> 00:48:16.557
question for Reed lastings, 
let's go to the question 

00:48:16.558 --> 00:48:18.558
-- 

00:48:20.513 --> 00:48:23.638
Hi -- I'm a Peace Corps 
volunteer -- I 

00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:27.952
worked in education sector and 
my question today is 

00:48:27.953 --> 00:48:32.045
for Reed Hastings -- in a world 
where the gap 

00:48:32.046 --> 00:48:35.320
between the rich and the poor is
 rapidly widening 

00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:38.387
every day what do you think some
 of the way that's 

00:48:38.388 --> 00:48:41.138
service work can be useful in 
helping privilegeed 

00:48:41.139 --> 00:48:46.717
people in the developed world 
better understand 

00:48:46.718 --> 00:48:51.040
their piers -- 
          In a worldwide basis 

00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:55.659
equality has declineed 
in the last 30 years, we have 

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:02.783
hello on a fewer on a 
global basis -- on all of the 

00:49:02.784 --> 00:49:04.306
internal work that 
everyone is doing but to get to 

00:49:04.307 --> 00:49:06.734
the question which 
is how do you create more 

00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:12.000
empathy and awareness some 
is to through entertainment, 

00:49:12.001 --> 00:49:14.001
some of our shows

00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:20.947
 about 
elite and very insightful, 

00:49:20.948 --> 00:49:25.355
another of our show 
orange is the new black, it's a 

00:49:25.356 --> 00:49:28.092
sector of the 
population that very people have

00:49:28.342 --> 00:49:33.201
 exposure to women 
in prison, so often 

00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:37.429
entertainment opens people heart
hearts and gets them to connect 

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.418
to what we're doing.
          We have a question 

00:49:40.419 --> 00:49:45.275
from the effort of 
Hawaii, for secretary -- victory

00:49:46.296 --> 00:49:48.296
 -- 

00:49:49.438 --> 00:49:51.438
Victoria.

00:49:52.651 --> 00:50:00.662
We have that question -- 
          I'm a 89 your at the 

00:50:00.663 --> 00:50:06.622
University of Hawaii 
my question as a first Asian 

00:50:06.623 --> 00:50:10.854
American woman and 
former director of Peace Corps a

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.295
 what is the one 
inspirational thing you would 

00:50:14.296 --> 00:50:17.424
like to share with 
minorities looking to share 

00:50:17.425 --> 00:50:23.064
others? Have confidence 
in yourself, don't be afraid, 

00:50:23.065 --> 00:50:27.089
explore. When I was 
growing up I knew so little 

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:30.642
about mainstream America
America. But I had wonderful 

00:50:30.643 --> 00:50:35.887
parents, a wonderful 
family, and they viewed within 

00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:40.925
me a tremendous gift, 
as I mentioned earlier it's the 

00:50:40.926 --> 00:50:44.841
gift of curiosity. 
My parents sacrificed so much to

00:50:44.844 --> 00:50:49.243
 bring us to America
America, and even though they 

00:50:49.244 --> 00:50:52.694
could not envision 
what futures lie ahead of their 

00:50:52.695 --> 00:50:56.128
six daughters, they 
were confident that this country

00:50:57.553 --> 00:51:00.054
 would offer them 
opportunities that they cannot 

00:51:00.055 --> 00:51:02.639
imagine but they knew 
existed.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.347
          You were the eldest of
 six daughters.

00:51:06.348 --> 00:51:09.927
          Yeah.
          Does the eldest have a

00:51:10.925 --> 00:51:13.382
 special 
responsibility? Of course, Asian

00:51:13.391 --> 00:51:16.289
 American families 
I'm the one in charge and I take

00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:20.702
 care of everybody 
-- I don't think all my sisters 

00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:24.385
sisters would agree I'm the 
one in charge.

00:51:24.386 --> 00:51:27.524
          We'll do one more 
question from the 

00:51:27.525 --> 00:51:31.967
University of Hawaii, the 
question comes from a 

00:51:31.968 --> 00:51:39.371
student -- my name is Tyler, I'm
 a senior the at the 

00:51:39.372 --> 00:51:42.889
University of Hawaii -- how does
 your experience 

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:48.158
abroad the Peace Corps attribute
 to your success -- 

00:51:48.159 --> 00:51:51.684
          The experience abroad 
has helped me 

00:51:51.685 --> 00:51:55.980
tremendously in terms of empathy
 and connecting with 

00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:58.961
people you didn't grow up with, 
and with 

00:51:58.962 --> 00:52:02.090
communications it's trying to 
get out of your own 

00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:04.784
skin and understand how a 
message might be receiveed 

00:52:04.785 --> 00:52:08.616
as opposeed to opposeed to what 
you're saying, and so you get a 

00:52:08.617 --> 00:52:12.919
lot of practice with that being 
a high school math 

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.713
teacher in a rule land --
          I would like to open 

00:52:17.714 --> 00:52:21.000
up the floor to 
questions from the audience here

00:52:21.719 --> 00:52:24.541
 in Washington as 
well. I see a couple of hands 

00:52:24.542 --> 00:52:27.683
going up, two or three 
over here and we have microphone

00:52:28.126 --> 00:52:31.824
s coming down -- 
good evening, thank you for 

00:52:31.825 --> 00:52:37.643
joining us and speak up.
          I have a short we for 

00:52:37.644 --> 00:52:41.628
the savings account 
and for Mr. Hastings, you 

00:52:41.629 --> 00:52:46.030
mention the public/private 
partnerships would you be open 

00:52:46.031 --> 00:52:52.081
to -- do you see 
there being I guess some two or 

00:52:52.082 --> 00:52:54.575
three skill thaws 
took from being that match 

00:52:54.576 --> 00:52:59.262
teacher that you say you 
use every day in your current 

00:52:59.263 --> 00:53:01.550
work? I didn't hear 
the question -- would I be open 

00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:09.073
it what? Long 
distance passenger trailtrains 

00:53:09.074 --> 00:53:12.465
and the like.
          I think that would be 

00:53:12.466 --> 00:53:14.028
very interesting to 
explore.

00:53:14.029 --> 00:53:16.304
          Thank you.
          The skills I think 

00:53:16.305 --> 00:53:21.326
what you learn in 
teaching is classroom management

00:53:21.869 --> 00:53:25.870
, public speaking, 
some of those skills are the 

00:53:25.871 --> 00:53:29.565
most useful.
          Public speaking, get 

00:53:29.566 --> 00:53:33.691
that student -- I 
don't see a microphone -- please

00:53:33.983 --> 00:53:35.688
 go find someone 
over here and we'll get a 

00:53:35.689 --> 00:53:38.943
microphone to the next 
question over here.

00:53:38.944 --> 00:53:43.779
          Hi, thank you for come
ing to speak. My 

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:48.472
question is about if you think 
there is a trend in 

00:53:48.473 --> 00:53:53.045
public service towards or for 
the privileged and to 

00:53:53.046 --> 00:53:57.373
get some caught, we see on

00:54:00.401 --> 00:54:04.437
 capitol many internships 
they don't offer a some type pen

00:54:04.448 --> 00:54:07.529
 and within the 
federal government if you try to

00:54:07.932 --> 00:54:11.104
 apply for the 
internship, they don't offer any

00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:16.322
 kind of assistance, 
so my question is you mentioned 

00:54:16.323 --> 00:54:19.768
in the Peace Corps 
there are barriers because some 

00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:23.891
people cannot work 
for free, especially full-time 

00:54:23.892 --> 00:54:29.437
hours what are your 
thoughts on this and how can we 

00:54:29.438 --> 00:54:31.554
fix it, public 
service is very important but 

00:54:31.555 --> 00:54:37.012
there are -- economic 
barriers and it sounds like 

00:54:37.013 --> 00:54:39.013
we've given people the 
vehicle and the keys but there's

00:54:39.248 --> 00:54:42.790
 no actual gas in 
the car to do public service.

00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:45.917
          Practical question -- 
I'm not so negative 

00:54:45.918 --> 00:54:49.202
-- I think this country has 
incredible opportunities

00:54:49.203 --> 00:54:52.506
opportunities. And what I 
encourage in young people 

00:54:52.507 --> 00:54:56.042
and in parents is to believe in 
the goodness of this 

00:54:56.043 --> 00:55:00.127
country and be resourceful and 
find different ways 

00:55:00.128 --> 00:55:02.855
to have different experiences. I
 think there are 

00:55:02.856 --> 00:55:05.546
very few people like myself who 
came to the country 

00:55:05.547 --> 00:55:10.140
with very, very little but I was
 armed with the most 

00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:14.266
wealthy of assets and that is a 
sense of who I am 

00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:20.201
and I was also fortified by the 
love of my family. 

00:55:20.202 --> 00:55:24.312
With those two tremendous 
treasuryies, that gave me 

00:55:24.313 --> 00:55:27.577
the courage to go out and 
explore and do all sorts 

00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:32.867
of things. I was on scholarship 
during my years in 

00:55:32.868 --> 00:55:35.761
College and then as my family 
situation got berry 

00:55:35.762 --> 00:55:40.276
gave the scholarship back and 
now my family 

00:55:40.277 --> 00:55:44.079
establishes scholarships for 
others. I would say the 

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.767
most important thing to say is 
never give up, 

00:55:47.768 --> 00:55:52.791
there's so many companies in 
this country -- when I 

00:55:52.792 --> 00:55:59.844
was heads of theiteed way, I 
never felt I was taking 

00:55:59.845 --> 00:56:04.020
-- I give them opportunity to 
participate on the 

00:56:04.021 --> 00:56:05.559
ground floor bigger than 
themselves and more 

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.842
important than themselves. 
There's so many generous 

00:56:09.843 --> 00:56:14.033
benefactors that want to help 
and there's many ways 

00:56:14.034 --> 00:56:16.233
to connect those in need with 
those that want to 

00:56:16.234 --> 00:56:19.837
give and that's part of the 
function of the social 

00:56:19.838 --> 00:56:23.327
sector, the volunteer sector so 
I really encourage 

00:56:23.328 --> 00:56:27.010
people number one, do not be 
afraid. Because when I 

00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:31.914
first came to America -- if I 
can say to the young 

00:56:31.915 --> 00:56:34.697
person it is don't be afraid. 
There's so many people 

00:56:34.698 --> 00:56:37.996
that want to be of help. Find 
what you love to do 

00:56:37.997 --> 00:56:43.094
and go out and help other that's
 can help to make 

00:56:43.095 --> 00:56:46.081
that happen.
          Can you add to that 

00:56:46.082 --> 00:56:49.062
Reed -- how do you go 
find the resources.

00:56:49.063 --> 00:56:51.335
          I don't have anything 
to add to that one.

00:56:51.336 --> 00:56:55.883
          We have a fiberglass 
moneymicrophone right 

00:56:55.884 --> 00:56:57.601
here -- can you stand -- thank 
you.

00:56:57.602 --> 00:57:05.999
          Hi, thank you for 
talking -- I would like 

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.423
to ask how do you make Peace 
Corps relevant in view 

00:57:11.424 --> 00:57:13.424
of

00:57:15.276 --> 00:57:17.276
 (inaudible) --

00:57:20.665 --> 00:57:23.497
          I believe the acting 
Peace Corps director 

00:57:23.498 --> 00:57:28.197
is here. I hope to see her, the 
Peace Corps is in so 

00:57:28.198 --> 00:57:31.027
many different countries -- yeah
, you should get up 

00:57:31.028 --> 00:57:33.745
and answer this question. 
          (APPLAUSE).

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:42.402
Peace Corps is involveed in so 
many 

00:57:42.403 --> 00:57:45.374
different countries, Peace Corps
 volunteers who 

00:57:45.375 --> 00:57:48.384
understand other cultures, 
understand America can be 

00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:52.664
great bridges of understanding 
an increasing 

00:57:52.665 --> 00:57:57.467
complicated international world.
 Find her afterwards

00:57:57.468 --> 00:58:01.467
afterwards. We have another 
microphone -- please 

00:58:01.468 --> 00:58:04.452
stand -- 
          Hi my name is Liz and 

00:58:04.453 --> 00:58:11.119
I was inspireed by my 
Peace Corps services in Africa 

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:16.384
-- and they are so 
proud of (inaudible) they're 

00:58:16.385 --> 00:58:19.968
inspireed by Americans 
but they love their country, and

00:58:20.216 --> 00:58:23.725
 I would be so honor
honored to get your advice to 

00:58:23.726 --> 00:58:28.205
that as they try to 
create a cultural service in our

00:58:28.937 --> 00:58:30.937
 country.
          Thank you. 

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:38.187
Are you asking for advice? I 
think what you're doing is great

00:58:38.188 --> 00:58:42.825
 -- one of the 
impacts of what the Peace Corps 

00:58:42.826 --> 00:58:45.966
is is change of the 
volume tires so when they come 

00:58:45.967 --> 00:58:50.399
back to the U.S. 
they're's all of these kind of 

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.158
efforts so it's great
great. Thank you.

00:58:52.159 --> 00:58:55.209
          We have a microphone 
over here and then I 

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.196
promise I'll get it down here to
 you.

00:58:57.197 --> 00:59:02.539
          My name is chicken -- 
I'm very proud of 

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.795
you to serve our country for so 
many years,

00:59:08.918 --> 00:59:09.996
 I 
brought my daughter to get 

00:59:09.997 --> 00:59:13.123
inspireed.
          I came to the country 

00:59:13.124 --> 00:59:19.242
22 years ago and I 
went to leadership program in 

00:59:19.243 --> 00:59:23.933
Maryland and I found 
very few immigrants at that time

00:59:23.935 --> 00:59:28.493
 -- to be in those 
leadership programs and offer to

00:59:28.494 --> 00:59:35.473
 do public service, 
and I still find mist -- right 

00:59:35.474 --> 00:59:40.656
now I run a small 
business but encourage commune

00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:45.019
ity to contribute in 
social and political activity in

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.787
 the eyewitness to 
be 100% American but I found 

00:59:49.788 --> 00:59:54.153
myself very challengeing 
to change the mental I'll of 

00:59:54.154 --> 00:59:59.841
people like me to be 
fully participating in the 

00:59:59.842 --> 01:00:01.842
society because maybe my 
language or culture is not fully

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:05.808
 adapted to the 
country, so what is your 

01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:09.583
suggestion to the first 
generation Americans like myself

01:00:09.883 --> 01:00:13.439
 to be able to fully 
participate in the American life

01:00:13.729 --> 01:00:17.878
? Thank you.
          You know I understand 

01:00:17.879 --> 01:00:21.668
there are -- when 
you're first generation, I'm 

01:00:21.669 --> 01:00:24.400
first generation, you 
worry about survival, you just 

01:00:24.401 --> 01:00:27.783
want to have 
financial security. So for a lot

01:00:28.657 --> 01:00:32.643
 of these first 
generation their first priority 

01:00:32.644 --> 01:00:36.482
is to be able to 
financially secure and take care

01:00:36.903 --> 01:00:41.205
 of their families. 
I am confident as their 

01:00:41.206 --> 01:00:43.888
financial situation gets 
better they will become more and

01:00:43.889 --> 01:00:49.735
 more integrated and 
take a larger role in mainstream

01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:52.267
 America. 
          I think as their 

01:00:52.268 --> 01:00:56.969
children of become better 
assimilateed that they take a 

01:00:56.970 --> 01:01:01.102
larger and larger role. 
So I split. You for your effort.

01:01:01.103 --> 01:01:05.075
 I want to continue 
because I think it's important 

01:01:05.076 --> 01:01:11.183
and I have faith and 
hope that as people get more 

01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:13.897
financially secure they 
are turning out, but in the 

01:01:13.898 --> 01:01:18.049
meantime I ask them to 
get involved in their local 

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:21.865
communeity. My parents, 
my mother didn't speak English, 

01:01:21.866 --> 01:01:25.541
they were very 
active in the Chinese/American 

01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:27.274
communeity and I 
thought that was important as 

01:01:27.275 --> 01:01:28.844
well.
          Thank you for that 

01:01:28.845 --> 01:01:31.920
question. We have one 
over -- 

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:36.666
          Hello, I have a 
question for the 

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:40.325
significant, you mentioned that 
when you were head 

01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:46.319
of the Peace Corps you wanted to
 bring the diverseity 

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.559
of America into the corporate 
such as recruiting 

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.707
people from different 
ethnicities perhaps from 

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:56.259
different economic statuses as 
well, what about the 

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.372
diverseity of age, littleian 
Carter was famous for 

01:02:02.373 --> 01:02:06.517
going to India when she was in 
her late 60's, how 

01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:10.356
common is that and this lifelong
 learning but 

01:02:10.357 --> 01:02:14.043
there's lifelong teaching and 
many of our

01:02:17.202 --> 01:02:22.230
 mature old
older people do have the time to

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.288
 volunteer for the 
Peace Corps.

01:02:25.289 --> 01:02:28.106
          I think we have a new 
volunteer.

01:02:28.107 --> 01:02:30.689
          I think that's a great
 observation, and I 

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:36.500
think Peace Corps and again the 
acting director is 

01:02:36.501 --> 01:02:40.921
here, Peace Corps has always had
 a certainly package 

01:02:40.922 --> 01:02:44.744
of more mature citizens but I 
will point out that 

01:02:44.745 --> 01:02:48.030
Peace Corps volunteers work in 
very, very difficult 

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:51.873
positions. And so, some of these

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:59.561
 localityies of 
someone who is more mature 

01:02:59.562 --> 01:03:05.675
begins more importance. 
And the remote areas are-- 

01:03:05.676 --> 01:03:09.635
sometimes the access to 
healthcare facilities could be a

01:03:09.637 --> 01:03:14.171
 factor in the 
recruiting more of mature 

01:03:14.172 --> 01:03:16.203
Americans.
          I don't know what the 

01:03:16.204 --> 01:03:20.436
occurrence numbers 
are, I suspect during your 

01:03:20.437 --> 01:03:25.303
tenure it's -- 
          During the tenure the 

01:03:25.304 --> 01:03:27.304
number of

01:03:29.445 --> 01:03:33.952
 retire es 
or seniors was a small 

01:03:33.953 --> 01:03:39.647
percentage -- it was about 10
10% -- can I say something -- 

01:03:45.774 --> 01:03:50.030
A couple of points on the 
diverseity I want 

01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:53.870
it point out we have made 
amazing strides in 

01:03:53.871 --> 01:03:58.570
representing the face of America
 and 36% of our 

01:03:58.571 --> 01:04:04.867
applicants are represent diverse
 in what we call our 

01:04:04.868 --> 01:04:07.666
on board strength meaning 
volunteer in the field is 

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:13.232
about 28%, from 14% since 2010, 
we have good 

01:04:13.233 --> 01:04:17.073
strategies and it's working. In 
terms of age diverse

01:04:17.074 --> 01:04:20.457
diversity which we recognize as 
a need it's only 

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:25.325
about 7% of 50 produce but we 
have a program for 

01:04:25.326 --> 01:04:29.922
Peace Corps response where a 
short term projected 

01:04:29.923 --> 01:04:33.066
base assignment that's are sort 
of tailorsed to 

01:04:33.067 --> 01:04:35.843
people with experience and 
generally those are older 

01:04:35.844 --> 01:04:40.244
folks so we're very open and 
welcomeing to people who 

01:04:40.245 --> 01:04:44.487
are 50 plusLet me ask you two 
quick follow-ups, when 

01:04:44.488 --> 01:04:47.774
you talk about a short tell me 
targeted program that 

01:04:47.775 --> 01:04:50.202
might be very, very attractive 
to somebody who is 

01:04:50.203 --> 01:04:55.012
just about to refrom work force 
but doesn't want to 

01:04:55.013 --> 01:04:58.608
sit home, are you talking two or
 three weeks, five 

01:04:58.609 --> 01:05:03.737
or six months or does each 
project have a different 

01:05:03.738 --> 01:05:09.525
character? 3, 6, 9, 12 months, I
 want to point out 

01:05:09.526 --> 01:05:16.202
that I think our oldest 
volunteer just left she's 85 

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:18.203
years old. 

01:05:20.286 --> 01:05:25.282
My oldest volunteer now is 80, 
and that's 

01:05:25.283 --> 01:05:27.336
send ago powerful message to our
 partners in the 

01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:31.559
field that you're never too old 
or young to serve.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.399
          May I ask you one 
other question which has 

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:40.963
come in from from a Hawaii 
students asking how can 

01:05:40.964 --> 01:05:46.564
you -- what can you say to 
minorities and non-

01:05:46.565 --> 01:05:50.622
non-traditional volunteers to 
encourage them to go 

01:05:50.623 --> 01:05:54.467
ahead and explore the 
possibility of a Peace Corps 

01:05:54.468 --> 01:05:56.891
service?
          So the first time I 

01:05:56.892 --> 01:06:01.156
would say is talk to a 
recruiter and they're around the

01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:05.141
 United States. But 
I think in the past Peace Corps 

01:06:05.142 --> 01:06:07.763
would be viewed that 
you did after College to get 

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:10.840
away and to have a 
great experience but you were 

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.681
really putting your 
career on hold. I think Peace 

01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:18.632
Corps now is a career 
accelerator, it always has been 

01:06:18.633 --> 01:06:21.915
but we really sort 
of in the 21 century with the 

01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:25.064
Internet and all the 
different projects there's 

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:28.390
incredible benefits in 
terms of leadership development,

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.580
 flexibility, all 
the things that were mentioned 

01:06:31.581 --> 01:06:36.746
and we have benefits. 
We have a scholarship program 

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:39.021
that piece corporate 
volunteers can

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.685
 apply to and adjustment 
allowance to 

01:06:45.686 --> 01:06:48.921
help them get started when they 
re-enter the United 

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:52.367
States. So we have a lot of 
benefits that would 

01:06:52.368 --> 01:06:54.495
serve them. Thank you very much.

01:06:54.496 --> 01:06:57.620
          (APPLAUSE).
          I think we have time 

01:06:57.621 --> 01:07:00.764
for one more question 
from the audience -- you've been

01:07:01.158 --> 01:07:02.327
 very patient 
waiting. 

01:07:02.328 --> 01:07:06.361
          Thank you so much. 
President of national 

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:08.701
Peace Corps association and I 
serveed in the Peace 

01:07:08.702 --> 01:07:10.702
Corps from 88 to

01:07:14.411 --> 01:07:14.669
 91, secretary tear thank you 
for 

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:18.501
your serves in the Peace Corps 
and elsewhere and you 

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:22.342
are very inspireing and this is 
an evening for 

01:07:22.343 --> 01:07:26.244
inspiration for service. Thank 
you for the great 

01:07:26.245 --> 01:07:30.751
recruitment that the Peace Corps
 has now -- over 20

01:07:30.752 --> 01:07:34.430
20,000 that are applying to 
serve in the Peace Corps 

01:07:34.431 --> 01:07:39.143
but with funding for only 7,000 
volunteers, thousand

01:07:39.144 --> 01:07:43.529
thousands of individuals, young 
global citizens 

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.263
don't have the opportunity, what
 can we do about 

01:07:46.264 --> 01:07:49.814
that and the question is for 
either of you, how can 

01:07:49.815 --> 01:07:52.638
we ensure the Americans have the
 opportunity to 

01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:54.508
serve?
          I think what's been 

01:07:54.509 --> 01:08:01.044
amazing about the 
Peace Corps, the number is from 

01:08:01.045 --> 01:08:06.291
2500 to 5,000 down 
to 4 -- it's up to 7 now and 

01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:10.217
over 50 years a stable 
program, and you wouldn't want 

01:08:10.218 --> 01:08:14.544
to grow it too 
quickly, you might see a whole 

01:08:14.545 --> 01:08:19.235
number of effects of 
that and on balance, it's been a

01:08:21.595 --> 01:08:25.101
 by partisan support
support, the founding has been 

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:28.186
reliable compareed to 
many federal programs, I think 

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:31.628
we should be positive 
about what we got in the Peace 

01:08:31.629 --> 01:08:35.616
Corps for the budge.
          Can I go back to the 

01:08:35.617 --> 01:08:39.458
question one of the 
previous -- I think it's also 

01:08:39.459 --> 01:08:43.001
important -- speaking 
from an Asian person perspective

01:08:43.405 --> 01:08:45.702
, I think it's 
importance that we help our 

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:49.687
parents and I say this 
to young people, the parents may

01:08:49.846 --> 01:08:52.512
 not understand what 
Peace Corps is all about, so for

01:08:54.247 --> 01:08:57.381
 the young people 
who at least in the Asian/

01:08:57.526 --> 01:09:00.968
American communeity you 
have to try to convince your 

01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:04.197
parents that this is a 
good path forward. So I would 

01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:08.295
encourage young people 
to explain what Peace Corps is, 

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:10.882
to make a decision 
to build around them so they 

01:09:10.883 --> 01:09:13.564
understand and will 
support that decision.

01:09:13.565 --> 01:09:17.019
          As a moderator I'm 
going to take the 

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.026
opportunity not ask the last 
question -- we have one 

01:09:21.027 --> 01:09:23.826
more videotapeed question from a
 Peace Corps 

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:30.138
volunteer who is in Guatemala 
and let me introduce 

01:09:30.139 --> 01:09:34.341
Susan Gonzalez.
          Hello -- I'm a Peace 

01:09:34.342 --> 01:09:37.911
Corps volunteer 
working on youth development. My

01:09:38.032 --> 01:09:44.858
 question is for 
both -- how do we make 

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:48.398
opportunityies to serve in 
organizes such as a Peace Corps 

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:52.704
more accessible for 
those that come from 

01:09:52.705 --> 01:09:56.078
disadvantageed communeityies?
          We have touched on 

01:09:56.079 --> 01:09:59.459
this but let me give 
you both a chance to sum up your

01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:03.926
 thoughts. I love 
the fact that she's on a rooftop

01:10:04.073 --> 01:10:09.477
 -- with a dog 
barking and a true Peace Corps 

01:10:09.478 --> 01:10:14.028
experience. If you 
could sum up how you think the 

01:10:14.029 --> 01:10:17.414
skills that you have 
been able to learn from not only

01:10:18.119 --> 01:10:21.419
 the leadership but 
in business would translate into

01:10:21.563 --> 01:10:25.779
 bringing some of 
those less tray decisional 

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:29.327
volunteers into -- 
starting with you -- I think 

01:10:29.328 --> 01:10:32.174
Reed needs to answer 
this because he's so 

01:10:32.175 --> 01:10:34.075
extraordinary successful and 
people don't think of the 

01:10:34.076 --> 01:10:36.886
transition from Peace 
Corps into the business sector 

01:10:36.887 --> 01:10:42.067
so I think you would 
have a lot of encouragement to 

01:10:42.068 --> 01:10:43.719
offer.
          In answersing the 

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.914
Peace Corps in the least 
ten or 15 years has made a big 

01:10:48.915 --> 01:10:52.841
effort in 
diversifying, finding great role

01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:56.528
 models where it's 
not just white men and white 

01:10:56.529 --> 01:10:59.094
women talking about how 
great the Peace Corps was 

01:10:59.095 --> 01:11:02.394
because people follow the 
role models that they see. So as

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:07.927
 we have more 
volunteers like Susan, I think 

01:11:07.928 --> 01:11:10.322
it's natural that 
it's spreading I think it's a 

01:11:10.323 --> 01:11:13.766
really big success.
          Last thing -- life 

01:11:13.767 --> 01:11:18.577
skills that Peace Corps 
volunteers learn is very helpful

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:25.184
 and applicable to 
all aspects in life and also any

01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:27.829
 chosen occupational 
career, the quality, flexibility

01:11:28.689 --> 01:11:31.507
, curiosity and 
being resourceful, these Peace 

01:11:31.508 --> 01:11:35.209
Corps volunteers are 
thrown into pretty interesting 

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:37.632
and unexpected 
circumstances and situations, 

01:11:37.633 --> 01:11:43.281
and they have to learn 
how to adjust and be problem 

01:11:43.282 --> 01:11:45.874
solveers.
          We're going to get you

01:11:45.876 --> 01:11:49.723
 back as a second 
term. You have such passion for 

01:11:49.724 --> 01:11:52.859
it.
          I'll go back as a 

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.016
Peace Corps volunteer. 
Thank you for the Internet world

01:11:56.025 --> 01:11:59.526
 we live in a world 
where we all think we know much 

01:11:59.527 --> 01:12:02.660
more about the world 
that we used to but there's 

01:12:02.661 --> 01:12:06.356
nothing like boots on 
the ground and living within 

01:12:06.357 --> 01:12:09.331
another culture to not 
only appreciate what they are 

01:12:09.332 --> 01:12:13.028
going through but what 
the United States has in terms 

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:18.037
of values, standards, 
business practices and human to 

01:12:18.038 --> 01:12:20.713
human contact that 
really makes it exceptional. 

01:12:21.577 --> 01:12:25.982
Thank you so much.
          And thank you all for 

01:12:25.983 --> 01:12:28.183

01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:57.117
students in Hawaii on the two 
campuses and the many 

01:12:57.118 --> 01:12:59.844
Peace Corps volunteers around 
the world, we can't 

01:12:59.845 --> 01:13:07.075
see all of you but we feel your 
enthusiasm. We'll be 

01:13:07.076 --> 01:13:10.056
putting forth two more programs 
over the next two
