1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,300
No close enough.
I'm sure there's no thrill for you.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,330
But do you think that being
in these incredibly tense
environments ramps life up

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,190
in a way that you don't get outside of
it? Like did you, did you read tribe?

4
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,020
Sebastian younger look, yeah. And
I met him a few times while he was,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,140
he was when I was having a few problems.
He was, he was very helpful. He was,

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,340
wasn't he really good guy? Yeah. I
really liked that guy. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,420
Before I met him.
And he's got that picture in vanity fair,

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,580
like posing with the dog tag and
it's like a muddle looking picture.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,420
Guys were tossed her. Yeah. Yeah. And
then I met him and he was the nicest,

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,790
most humble, considerate
guy. He's, he's fantastic.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,770
And I really like that book
as well. Yeah. I couldn't,

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,270
I couldn't be a bigger fan of his, as
a human to just do, just very genuine,

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,760
really there when you're talking to them.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,240
But that's sort of his take on it is
that, um, and if you're listening,

15
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:54,450
I know I talk about that book
too much. Uh, I just love it,

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,640
but his take on it was that these
people are experiencing life in this

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,390
incredibly extreme environment and then
they come back to the rest of the world

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,610
and it just doesn't feel real anymore.
So it's not,

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,400
it's not thrilling when you're there,
but it is real drama.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,560
You're seeing life and death
drama right in front of your face.

21
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,400
So when you come back,

22
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,250
you think you really want to see
this person and see this film,

23
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:17,090
try out this new restaurant and
then you get back and you just eat.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,730
Just don't care. It's just feel flat.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, when,

25
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,420
when I was getting the PTSD treatment,
numb, numbness was the word that came out.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,910
More numbness to everything, like
numbness to the danger when you're there,

27
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:30,540
but numbness back here for the things
that should be pleasurable and should be

28
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,340
providing some kind of relief as well.
Now,

29
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,450
how did the pts PTSD treatment
get organizes through maps?

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,420
Are you part of that study? Yeah,
we did a did a short film about,

31
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:42,000
about Rick Doblin and this, this,
you know, there's this effort to,

32
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,140
to get MDM illegal. Um, but I'd
been in denial for years and years.

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,010
Then a new producer joined vice guy
called Steven Bailey and we had the first

34
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:51,270
idea where he was pitching some,

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,420
some of the first meeting when he
was pitching some of his ideas and he

36
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,660
mentioned, you know, this breakthrough
therapy using MDM may for PTSD.

37
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,220
And I just in voluntarily put my hand
up and said I'll do it straight away.

38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,780
And I was like, gave me an
excuse to actually, you know,

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,210
get some help and see if actually done
MTMA recreationally before that. I mean,

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,990
yeah, I came of age in London in
the 90s, you know, he was like,

41
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,100
it was like having a pint of beer.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,480
Then what is the difference between
doing it in a therapeutic environment?

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,790
I mean, it's, it's, it's
Mtma assisted therapy, right?

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,190
The emphasis is on the therapy.

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,580
So you're lying in a bed if you fasted
for 24 hours before the therapist knows

46
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,580
you and knows your issues. Um,
so knows how to like politely,

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,150
gently nudge you towards the right topic
of conversation, but always makes it,

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,210
makes you actually get to the
conclusions. Um, you know,

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,620
there are times when I would ask him, why
is this happening? Why do I think this?

50
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,620
And He'd put it back on me and make
me put two and two together. Um,

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,110
sometimes you listen to music,

52
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,180
sometimes you put an eye
mask on and you don't sleep,

53
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,760
but you just have a quiet
20, 30 minutes. But it's a,

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,840
it's a very intense seven to eight hour
therapy session and the MD may just

55
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,190
enables you to get the benefits.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,770
And all of the veterans and
first responders who took
part in the first round of

57
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,460
trials had been therapy resistant.
Um, and I think the first round,

58
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,920
I think 72% of them got the benefits.
And we're considered PTSD free after,

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,590
after the three month trial.
So during the three month trial,

60
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,250
how many experiences do they have? One
a month. One a month or three? Three.

61
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:20,530
Totally. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the best,

62
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,440
the best example I can
give of how this works,

63
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,240
I had the first veteran I
met had been through it.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,190
He had one session and he'd lost some
friends in Iraq and it felt guilty about

65
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,510
it and always thought maybe if I had done
something different I could have saved

66
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,344
them.

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,410
And he imagined being them in in the
first Mbma session and they were saying to

68
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:41,170
him, why are you ruining your
life? You're alive, you're healthy.

69
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,660
We want you to have a fun,
productive,

70
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,390
full life and enjoy your
friends and enjoy your family.

71
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,900
And he said that gave him permission
and that was what he needed.

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,870
He didn't even do the second two sessions.
Wow.

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,350
That's a what an interesting
way of looking at, of course.

74
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,341
And that word permission,

75
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,180
because there is so much guilt and just
getting permission to just give yourself

76
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,680
a bit of a pattern. The survivors of
your braking is real. Oh yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,060
A lot of people that come back from the
war that lost friends have that horrible

78
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,010
feeling that it should've been them.

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,660
That they're not as good as the person
who died or that somehow or another them

80
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,000
being alive is the reason
why their friend was dead.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,140
Irrational thoughts or maybe I didn't
really experience it because I came out

82
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,180
unscathed. Um, yeah,

83
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,480
which is one of the reasons why I didn't
seek treatment for years and years and

84
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,010
years cause I've got friends
who've lost their legs.

85
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:31,780
I've got friends who were
kidnapped and killed, you know,

86
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,020
so maybe I've only just dipped my
toes so there's nothing, nothing.

87
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,130
I've got nothing to complain about.
What was your number one issue?

88
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,320
Um, I think the numbness to danger and
to, to pleasurable things back here.

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Um, I mean like my, my
camera man in Mosul,

90
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,200
we were there when the Iraqi army
beat Isis and it was, I mean,

91
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,920
it was house to house fighting. We were
stepping on bodies to get through rooms.

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,110
And at one point,
um,

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
as with we were with three or four Iraqi
soldiers trying to get to the river to

94
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:03,130
cut off these two isis positions and
they've got a radio message saying there's

95
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,040
a suicide bomber and a gunman running
down the street towards you now.

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,750
So we stepped into this,

97
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,570
what used to be a shop that was
all blown up and smashed a bit.

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,740
And I sat down as the two soldiers tried
to shoot this suicide bomber as he was

99
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,570
running towards us and someone said,
IED IUD.

100
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,950
And right next to me under the rubble
was an IED. The day before, I think,

101
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,860
or two days before to French journalists
and Curtis journalists who had been

102
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,150
killed when they stepped on an IED
trying to get out and have ea Manzano,

103
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,170
my camera man just said,
you looked bored. Um,

104
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,280
and he filmed it like we got that moment
on camera and I remember just looking

105
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,900
so bored and I couldn't give a shit
about the suicide bomber, the IED.

106
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,560
I was just bought out of my brains.
And that's when I thought this is,

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,920
this is not a natural reaction to,
to what's going on around you right now.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,260
What did you think your natural reaction
should have been? I mean, blood rating,

109
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,010
racing, heart rate, increasing, you
know, um, vigilance, um, you know,

110
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,440
and what did you think at the time
was the cause of you being numb?

111
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,030
Like while it was happening, I hadn't
really thought that much about PTSD.

112
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,650
I just thought it'd
become so used to this.

113
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,120
And one of the things that came up in the,

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
in one of the last sessions I did was
I didn't think I was him as important

115
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,330
enough to get to get shot and hurt and
have medics rush over to help me and

116
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:19,810
maybe a helicopter take
the out and, you know, um,

117
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,510
I know that sounds ridiculous now,
but I think part of me thought, yeah,

118
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,090
you're not important enough to have
something so dramatic happen to you.

119
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,780
You're just, you're just witnessing
other people in these dramas.

120
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,723
Wow.

121
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,810
To be right next to an IUD and not
freaking out is pretty crazy. Yeah.

122
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,080
With a suicide bomber riding down the
street towards, I mean that's, and also,

123
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,190
you know, people, people,

124
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,340
one of the reasons you feel guilty is
you do get respect for being brave.

125
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,440
And I would say it wasn't bravery.
I wasn't scared and then did it anyway.

126
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,910
I wasn't scared. I was just
numb and just, you know,

127
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,920
kept looking at respect from other
journalists, from the soldiers.

128
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,660
Like who are you getting
respect from? Yeah. Or,

129
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,530
or people that watched the films
or, yeah. And uh, it doesn't,

130
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,800
it doesn't feel like bravery.
It just feels like you're,
you know, you've, you've,

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,710
you've become stupid about
the risks you're taking.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,910
So talk me through this therapy.
So you're fast for 24 hours,

133
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,920
you take the Mtma and then they just
start talking to you about the things that

134
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,360
are troubling.
Yeah.

135
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,960
So you take 125 milligrams and then
when that hits about that a lot,

136
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,800
I think it's a good dose, but then
when it hits, you take another 75.

137
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,300
So overall that, that's a
good dose and that keeps you
up for, you know, six, seven,

138
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,540
eight hours. Um, and then, you know,

139
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,930
the therapist would ask
very brief question. Just,

140
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,130
just knowing what direction to push me.
And I remember the first session, I mean,

141
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,010
I'd thought because of
what I now know was PTSD,

142
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,270
I'd thought because of the job I do and
because there was this kind of darkness

143
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,163
in there,

144
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,530
I didn't get involved with anyone
seriously for a very long time and even

145
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:58,130
thought I'm not going to have a family
and kids and house and dog and you know,

146
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,050
I just just hadn't even thought about it.

147
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:03,350
Just assumed that that's not
for me because of the job I do.

148
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,300
And very early on in that first session
after I resisted it for about an hour

149
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,301
and a half,

150
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,780
like was really resisting it for a long
time and thinking it was even a placebo.

151
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,790
Um, but, but there was this wave of
relief. I've just, of course you can,

152
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,860
of course you can have all that.
And it,

153
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,230
it felt like a revelation
because I thought I,

154
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,660
that had been close to me for so long. I
know, seven, eight years, maybe longer.

155
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:28,430
I just thought now that you can't do that,

156
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:30,890
that's not for you or you can't put
someone else through that with you.

157
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,950
What is it particularly about MDM may,
what is it about,

158
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,690
I mean I've done it but
I've only done it once.

159
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,050
The is it just because of the fact that
it just alleviates the insecurity and

160
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:43,610
allows you to look at things
in a more natural sense?

161
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,060
You look at everything as if we're just
talking about having coffee or water,

162
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,090
everything is just easy to think
about on a dress and talk about. Um,

163
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,700
and I think I'll probably
explain it badly,

164
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,820
but I think the science of it is you
have five networks in your brain and,

165
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,790
and I was basically in fight or flight
mode so much that that was the only mode

166
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,110
on you. So even when I'm back in New York,
if someone walks up to close behind me,

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,450
I'm expecting a confrontation.
I'm in fight or flight mode all the time.

168
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:11,640
So your brain is ignoring the other
parts of your brain that provide context.

169
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,670
And that say that bang outside
is just the car back firing.

170
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:19,470
It's not an id or someone shooting to
the Mtma just allows your brain to,

171
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,630
you know, all the parts of your
brain to communicate. Again,

172
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,910
you're not just in that
fight or flight mode.

173
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,800
So once you get out of
that fight or flight mode,

174
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,940
you can then address things that, that
you couldn't even begin to address before.

175
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,200
And once you've had these experiences
for you, it was three experiences.

176
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,340
They're profound enough that
you retain the benefits. Some,

177
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:42,720
I mean it looks like I'm in the 25% that
still have PTSD after the three months,

178
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,670
but it still helped enormously.
I mean,

179
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:49,020
the next day they got me to sit down
and do a video diary and I was kind of

180
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,900
saying, yeah, I thought this
near, this was a revelation.
And I said, you know what,

181
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,530
I'm just,

182
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,180
I'm just smiling now in a way that I
don't feel like I've smiled for years.

183
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,330
Like it feels like my whole face is
smiling and this is the next day,

184
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,430
which is usually a little wrecked.
Yeah,

185
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,710
I think it's two or three
days when you have the,

186
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,910
what we used to call a moody Tuesday, two
or three days. Yeah. But there with this,

187
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,650
there, there's no, there's
no come down. Um, with this,
it's, it's, you know, there,

188
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,250
there,
there's no downside how they give you,

189
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,640
they give you five HTP or
anything while you're, um,

190
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,700
nothing apart from the MD may or may
not. Wow. You have, you have juice,

191
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:24,210
you have water throughout.
Um, I mean maybe they come
down is related to, you know,

192
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,350
people that used to take it
with just dance and sweat.
Right. All nightly hydrate.

193
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,060
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe it's a
Shitty Mtma maybe you just feel shit.

194
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,140
Yeah, I mean the, yeah.

195
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,410
The ecstasy they would've sold in London
would have been the rat poison and

196
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:41,310
breeze block dust and
all kinds of, yeah. Um,

197
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,000
so I know they're having very
positive results with this.

198
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,920
And are they planning on implementing
this to the public in any terror short

199
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,000
term?
I mean,

200
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:53,430
is this something that like people
that are listening to this right now,

201
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,650
it's just going to be
available to them fairly soon?

202
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
It looks like it should be legal by 2021,
2022,

203
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,790
the third round of officially FDA
approved trials start soon. Um,

204
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,730
that's the first one that involves
people other than veterans and first

205
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,660
responders. If that gets as good
results of the first two trials,

206
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:12,060
which I'm sure it will then,
then I think it's going to be,

207
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,490
and because FDA gave it
breakthrough drug status,

208
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,160
there's nothing that you know
anyone can do to stop it.

209
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,380
It will be legal by 2021 2022.

210
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,320
That's very good news for a lot of
people that are suffering. Yeah.

211
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,950
It's so difficult for people
to change perspective just to,

212
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
to have a break from the normal sort of
momentum of your life and to be able to

213
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,990
stop and analyze.
Yeah.
