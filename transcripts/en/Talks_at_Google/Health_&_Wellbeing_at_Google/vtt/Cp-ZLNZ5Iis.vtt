[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.362 --> 00:00:08.070
NADIM SAAD: Thank you,
Rob, and thank you

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.950
all for coming here
today and for taking

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.430
an hour of your busy schedules.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.254
Reality is five years ago,
I would have never wasted

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:19.920
an hour of my time
attending a parenting

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.130
presentation because I parented
the way my parents did,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.660
quite strict.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.730
But I thought I turned
out OK, so why would

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.770
I do things differently.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920
Until one day an
event at home actually

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.440
made me really wonder if
I was doing things right.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.320
So it was a Saturday.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.120
My four and a half year
old daughter, Noor,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.740
was serving herself some salad.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.070
She dropped a salad
leaf on the table.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.330
I just asked nicely, oh, Noor,
could you please pick this up.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.340
She ignored me.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.660
I said Noor, you dropped a
salad leaf, please pick it up.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.760
She ignored me.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.540
Then I used my default method
at the time, my technique

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.170
to get my children to do things
which was counting to three.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.620
Anyone else count to three?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.170
Show of hands?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.930
Usually about 90% so
the rest are probably--

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.452
And I went OK, Noor,
I'm counting to three.

00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.681
I said one.

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.340
Ignored me.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.250
I said two.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.500
Ignored me again.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.230
I went, Noor, you don't want
me to get to three, do you?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.321
Two and a half.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.390
Two and three-quarters.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.040
And then I got to three.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.120
And the reality is I had no
idea what I was going to do.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.640
The only thing I
knew was my authority

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.310
was based on that and the
fear of getting to three.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.550
And it used to work so well
and suddenly it didn't.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.560
Unfortunately I did not
react the best way possible.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800
I actually started
screaming and shouting.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.460
And I pulled her up,
put her in her room.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.220
Lecturing her, how dare
you let me get to three.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.430
Do you realize what that means?

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.410
But I realized that day that
actually my whole authority

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.500
was based out of the fear
that my children had.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
And they were doing
this out of fear

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.500
so I was really
managing my fear.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.250
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.430
and how much parallels there
are between leadership skills

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.510
and parenting skills.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.500
So the outline for today
is actually explain to you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.370
how I learned that parenting
skills can be improved.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.470
Then I'm going to talk to
you about what parenting

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.460
and leadership have in common.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.210
Then we're going to
actually work together

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.900
on defining what the key
leadership skills are.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.880
And finally, I'll
show you how to apply

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.680
some of these workplace
skills at home.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.110
So I'll share with you
five very effective tools

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.890
to replace the typical
basically, well, the one, two,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.030
three, the parenting by fear or
parenting by rewards actually,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.550
because it's the carrot
and stick approach.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.177
My objective here
today is really

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:57.760
to give you alternatives
to the carrot

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.630
and stick approach that are
so ingrained in our culture.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.700
Because it's all
about usually rewards,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.950
punishment, threats, and
management basically by fear

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.060
or rewards.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.850
So hopefully you'll leave here
with an alternative to that.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.080
So how did it all start?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.080
Well, I already explained,
I was a stricter parent.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.350
And my wife was actually a
lot more, let's say, lenient.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.315
I sometimes say permissive
although she doesn't like it.

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:25.440
And so that's how our daily
interactions look like.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.380
And the problem is actually
the more, the harsher I was

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.840
and the kinder she was.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.430
So I had, I had clearly
had the bad cop role,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.570
she had the good cop role.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.510
Anyone else experience
this at home?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.830
Yeah, about 60%.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.500
Well, actually it's-- the
research shows that it's 75%

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.100
of parents argue
about how to parent.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.290
And more than 50%
of these arguments

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.390
are about how to
discipline children.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.760
So that's what we
experience on a daily basis.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.430
And it was, I mean it almost
got to break point, particularly

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.940
after the incident, the salad
leaf incident that I mentioned.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.180
And thankfully, my wife
reacted very well to that.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.370
And she actually started looking
for things she could do better.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.149
So she stopped blaming me
for being the strict parent

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.950
and the harsher parent.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.130
And she started looking
at ways she could improve.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.070
And she actually
started proving to me

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.800
that she could get obedience
and respect without having

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.660
to shout and punish.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.150
And that's finally, she had--

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.710
I was listening.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.189
So instead of just
telling me oh,

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.980
here's this parenting
book you should read.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.146
And I'd tell her oh, please
give me an exact summary

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.310
and show me how it works.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.770
I don't have time for this.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.720
Well, finally she
actually did it.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.050
And she showed me
that-- so she became,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.680
she actually set better limits.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.760
She became more consistent.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.480
And it really changed
the whole family dynamic.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.670
And so I became interested
in and I became softer.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.130
And so I started
looking at the research,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.960
becoming interested
in the subject.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.880
And I realized
how much parallels

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.340
there were between
leadership and parenting.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.730
And actually that parenting
skills, like leadership skills

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.682
can be learned and can be honed.

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:12.890
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.814
So first, let's start
with leadership.

00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:19.480
Obviously there are
so many definitions,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.130
so I picked one that's
actually quite broad,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.070
but I think really shows what
we want to do with our children.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.474
It's from Dwight
Eisenhower and it says,

00:05:28.474 --> 00:05:30.140
leadership is the art
of getting someone

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.240
else to do something
we want done

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.964
because they want to do it.

00:05:33.964 --> 00:05:35.630
Isn't that what we
are trying to achieve

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.274
on a daily basis
with our children?

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:39.440
Wouldn't it be great if we
had tools to actually get

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.810
them to do things because
they want to do it,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.464
not because we're telling
them over and over again,

00:05:44.464 --> 00:05:45.380
you've got to do this.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.810
Please do this, do that,
et cetera, giving them

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.210
orders all day long.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.340
Well, so that's very
much, actually leadership

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.057
and parenting have
a lot of parallels.

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:55.640
And what they have
in common, I really

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.560
like this quote from Simon
Sinek, who you probably

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.940
know, author of
"Start With Why",

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.030
it's "Great leaders are able
to inspire people to act.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.790
Those who are able to
inspire give people

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.520
a sense of purpose
or belonging that

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.220
has little to do with
any external incentive

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.290
or benefit to be gained."

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.430
If you replace the word
leaders with parents, here.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.209
So great parents are able to
inspire the children to act.

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:20.000
Those who are able to
inspire give children

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.340
a sense of purpose of
belonging that has little

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.800
to do with any
external incentive

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.540
or benefit to be gained.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.510
And this is really very
much, that's exactly what we

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.270
were saying about moving from
the carrot and stick approach

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.190
to the inspiring and
leading by example.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.081
Another great quote from
Jack Welch, former CEO of GE

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.580
is "before you are
a leader, success

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.720
is all about growing yourself.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.095
When you become
a leader, success

00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:47.690
is all about growing others."

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.240
Again, if you replace the word
leaders with parents here,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.010
is before you are
a parent, success

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.260
is all about growing yourself.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.127
But when you become
a parent, success

00:06:55.127 --> 00:06:56.710
is really about
growing your children.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.540
So the last quotes
I'm going to show

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.840
you are about why leadership is
actually here, in this sense,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.520
is different from management.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.630
So because I spoke
about management by fear

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.380
and that's exactly, we want
to replace it with leadership.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.580
And so management is about
arranging and telling,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.000
while leadership is about
nurturing and enhancing.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.935
And as Klaus Balkenhol,
Olympic champion

00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:23.060
said, "there is a difference
between being a leader

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.350
and being a boss.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.530
Both are based on authority.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.730
A boss demands blind
obedience, while a leader

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.910
earns his authority through
understanding and trust."

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.510
So why don't we give a
go at actually defining

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.190
what the key leadership skills.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.030
What have you experienced,
either as a manager--

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.700
and actually something that's
worked really well for you

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.290
in inspiring your teams.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.420
Or if you've been
basically, you've

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.880
had managers and leaders who
have really inspired you,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.380
what are the key
things that they've

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.980
done well that you remember?

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.293
AUDIENCE: Great communication.

00:07:58.293 --> 00:07:59.626
NADIM SAAD: Great communication.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.900
You can shoot, I can do several
things at the same time.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.220
AUDIENCE: Being emphatic.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.528
NADIM SAAD: Empathetic.

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:14.930
AUDIENCE: Having a plan.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.680
NADIM SAAD: Sorry?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.679
AUDIENCE: Having a plan.

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.160
NADIM SAAD: Having a plan.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.059
Right.

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:20.059
AUDIENCE: They show you.

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:23.320
So they're an example
of what they're asking.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.330
NADIM SAAD: Can I call
this leading by example?

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.512
Yeah.

00:08:27.512 --> 00:08:28.498
AUDIENCE: They listen.

00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:34.640
NADIM SAAD: Listening,
empathy, empathetic listening.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.669
Yeah, it's a different--
actually if you don't mind,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.580
I'll later put this into
emotional intelligence.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.190
Empathetic listening are
very much about being--

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.690
yes?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.620
AUDIENCE: Stay
calm during crisis.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.120
NADIM SAAD: Stay
calm during crisis.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.034
Anything else that
comes to mind?

00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:01.172
AUDIENCE: They know
when to delegate.

00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:02.130
NADIM SAAD: Delegation.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.035
So--

00:09:04.035 --> 00:09:07.430
AUDIENCE: They're inspirational.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.140
NADIM SAAD: Inspirational.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.574
AUDIENCE: Having a
purpose or vision.

00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:13.865
NADIM SAAD: Vision and purpose.

00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:18.399
AUDIENCE: Have fun.

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.982
NADIM SAAD: Sorry,
I didn't hear that.

00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:21.400
AUDIENCE: Have fun.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.410
NADIM SAAD: Have, fun, OK.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.000
OK, fun, can I also say
positive attitude in there?

00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:31.335
AUDIENCE: They serve
as your advocate.

00:09:35.626 --> 00:09:37.500
NADIM SAAD: Sorry, I
have space for two more.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.182
AUDIENCE: They serve
as your advocate.

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:40.057
NADIM SAAD: They're--

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.310
AUDIENCE: Serves as an advocate.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.060
NADIM SAAD: Serve?

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.480
AUDIENCE: As an advocate.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.900
NADIM SAAD: Advocate, they--

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.400
sorry.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.025
AUDIENCE: They advocate
for their team.

00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:49.615
NADIM SAAD: They advocate
for their team, yeah.

00:09:49.615 --> 00:09:51.980
AUDIENCE: A safe place to fail.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.570
NADIM SAAD: And I heard
safe place to fail.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.530
Yes, very good.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.030
AUDIENCE: And also
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:05.992 --> 00:10:07.450
NADIM SAAD: Well,
I absolutely love

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.120
doing this exercise every time.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.680
This is a great list.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.340
And you'll see, no surprise,
I'll have my list at the end.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.410
It's the same.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.320
So thank you very much.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.650
And actually I'm going to
hopefully show you five tools,

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.540
well, not hopefully.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.672
I'm going to show you five tools
that use all of these skills

00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:27.880
and how to find them at home.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.990
So the first one
is about strategy

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.990
and anticipating issues.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.750
I'd like to share
with you a story of,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.270
so we had just moved home.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.310
I had a six-year-old and a
four-year-old at that time.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.320
And they were
arriving half an hour

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.060
late for breakfast,
which meant no breakfast.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.540
We didn't have time so we
had to just rush to school.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.720
So I sat them with, sat
down with them on Sunday.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.530
And I asked my
six-year-old, Noor,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.470
how long do you need to
get dressed in the morning?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.950
She answered, two minutes.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.430
I said, OK, so you're actually
currently taking half an hour

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.830
for something you could
do in two minutes.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.630
OK, so what can
you do differently?

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.213
And she actually
came up with the idea

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.770
that why don't we
write down timings

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.410
so that we actually know what
time we should be going down.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.560
I said that's a great idea.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.200
Let's do it.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.650
It was actually a two hour,
in the end, a two hour

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:29.417
activity where the kids,
I took photos of the kids

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:31.250
as they were doing the
different activities.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.580
So making their bed,
brushing their teeth,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.890
their hair, getting dressed.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.400
And then we put it in order.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.270
They actually ordered
the way they wanted.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.770
And we put timings, they didn't
really have a sense of time,

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.395
particularly
four-year-old at the time.

00:11:45.395 --> 00:11:47.020
But I helped them with that.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.020
Turned out actually to
be one of the best things

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.350
we've ever done.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.970
Because the next day, they
arrived half an hour earlier

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.020
than usual.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.860
We had lots of time to have
breakfast and have lots of fun.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.370
Anyone actually
already uses routines?

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.630
Creates a routine?

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.482
Yeah.

00:12:05.482 --> 00:12:06.600
Yeah, kind of.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.080
About 20% to 25%.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.150
Do you involve your children in
doing in creating this routine?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.290
Yeah.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.250
Quite, some yes, some no.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.270
Well, it's very much, it
is very much valuable.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.440
And so the idea of
creating routines

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.770
is really steps and schedule
to make them the boss.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.110
So with younger
children as I just used,

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.420
you can have photos of
these different steps

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.630
and I'll ask them to
reorder them as they want.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.650
With older children, agree
on a schedule with them.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.360
What's important about this is
really about using this as--

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.230
so the routine becomes
the boss as in,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.270
what are you supposed to
do now, instead of oh,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.490
you still didn't
brush your teeth.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.274
What have you put
in your schedule?

00:12:47.274 --> 00:12:48.690
What have you put
in your routine?

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.390
And automatically it gives
an ownership and empowerment

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.132
to the children to
want to do things.

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:55.840
And so it removes a
lot of the resistance

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.410
that we experience
in the morning.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.150
The other one about
being strategic

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.060
is redesign agreement's
is realizing

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.610
where are our key issues.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.190
And often, it's going
to be a supermarket

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.000
or when we go to a
friend's house, you know.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.500
And it's all about
agreeing with your children

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.960
what's OK with you, so
clarifying expectations

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.010
at any age.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.760
So for younger
children, for example,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.300
you can use what we
call an "I" message.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.610
I take children
to the supermarket

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.330
who will listen to me, who will
not be trying to buy everything

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.210
on the shelf or take it
or touching everything

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.052
on the shelves and et
cetera, what works for you.

00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:35.260
And ideally you involve them.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
So you say for
example, you will help

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.220
me put things that are on your
list, list of your things.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.440
So there are usually actually
very good supermarkets

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.484
in doing this and putting
them at the right height.

00:13:47.484 --> 00:13:49.150
And also for example,
I'm willing to buy

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.510
you one thing under two, three
pounds, whatever works for you.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.060
Just having this expectation,
having clarified this,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.890
and if you want role play.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.650
Role play is great
for example for when

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.900
you go to your friend's house.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.490
And you instead of going
oh, say hello, say goodbye,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.570
say thank you.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.030
I mean how often do we repeat
these things to our children?

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.810
Well, the reality is instead
if we role play and ask them

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.260
so granny is going to say hello,
what are you going to say?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.760
Oh, hello.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.640
OK, she's going to give
you a piece of cake.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.598
What do you need to do?

00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:19.540
Oh, I'll say thank you.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.000
Just going through that with
them, when I'm talking here

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.790
about younger children,
will enable them to get it

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.260
in their long term memory.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.010
And you'll be a lot surer that
they actually do this regularly

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.050
rather than you having to
repeat it to them all the time.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.370
So that's about
being more strategic.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.920
Effective communication,
obviously great communication

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.940
is so important.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.290
And reality is often it's
not all about what we say

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.860
but how we say it.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.770
So can you try
and guess how many

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.810
orders and commands a child
gets every hour on average?

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.060
Is it 5 to 10, 10 to
20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.670
Any guesses?

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.510
AUIDENCE: I would say 20.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.301
AUDIENCE: 30 to 40.

00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.190
NADIM SAAD: 30 to 40.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.700
40.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.514
Wow, first time I guessed
the exact-- it's actually 34.

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:05.370
Very good.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.199
So it's 34 orders.

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.240
How would it go down with
you if you're actually,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.230
your boss gave you
34 orders every hour?

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.720
Yeah, you can imagine.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.590
So it actually
explains very well

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.260
the resistance they have
from the age of two, three.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.080
I mean they've received so many
orders through their childhood

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.889
and so many no's that is
pretty normal for them

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:25.680
to react like this.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.150
So what are the alternatives?

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.070
What is great communication
with children?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.360
It is actually trying to replace
at least 90% of these orders

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.830
with first [INAUDIBLE]
of all questions.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.064
So think about actually
is this new information.

00:15:41.064 --> 00:15:42.980
So every time you say
something to your child,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.840
it's like is this
new information?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.190
Do you think that 90%, about 90%
will probably be new, you know,

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.970
old information?

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.257
And so instead of repeating
yourself, ask them,

00:15:54.257 --> 00:15:54.840
what are you--

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.160
so the same with creative
[INAUDIBLE], you know,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.650
what are you supposed to do now?

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.600
What do we do when we
come out, you know,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.630
when before we leave after
we come back from whatever

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.610
your rules are, they know them.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.490
So put them in thinking
mode a lot more

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.110
and they'll actually be
a lot less resistant.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.220
Question works also very well
when they make a mistake.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.754
What are you going to do now?

00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:16.670
Because usually we tell
them or take them out.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.510
For example, they
spill something.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.030
Take them up, do this, do that,
because we're quite annoyed.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.830
Well actually, giving
them the opportunity

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.830
to correct their mistake
and have a safe place

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:30.270
to fail, you know, is essential.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:35.480
And so that's what is
really replacing our orders

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.130
with so asking questions.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.130
The other one, which is also
questions is limited choices.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.360
Anyone uses limited choices?

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.240
So it's not like, oh, what
do you want for breakfast

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.905
this morning?

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.280
And then you never
get an answer.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.830
Or you reflect because
it creates anxiety.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.720
It's actually much
better to say would you

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.210
like porridge or cereals?

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.430
Would you like juice or milk?

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.100
So all limited choices
actually keep our children

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.939
in thinking mode and removes
a lot of the resistance

00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:01.730
that we experience.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.990
And I'm talking at any age.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.790
You know, we just think
oh, they're old enough.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.623
Come on why am I going
to give them choices?

00:17:06.623 --> 00:17:08.599
Well actually, 10-year-olds,
12-year-olds, they

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.819
prefer choices to hey,
you didn't do that

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.629
or you forgot to do this.

00:17:13.629 --> 00:17:15.420
The other way about
effective communication

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.020
is actually reducing
the use of no.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.109
No is actually one of the most
dangerous words in the world.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:26.030
Research shows that it
reduces the motivation.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.220
It affects us
actually physically.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.740
And it's a word that
we repeat so often.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.590
Often actually we start
our sentences with no

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.450
when we want to say yes.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.920
So I challenge you to try and
start most of your sentences

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.130
with yes, at home and
at work by the way.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.310
And it's yes, and if it
doesn't work for you, it's yes

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.480
and we can do this later.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.590
For example, I
want an ice cream.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.340
Yes, sure, you can
have it at the weekend.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.750
That's our rule at home.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.917
Yes, yes, yes, but redirect.

00:17:54.917 --> 00:17:56.000
You'll see the difference.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.650
Instead of going
OK, no, I want one.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.590
They'll go, oh, OK.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.480
Or ask a question.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.630
Is it time to have an ice cream?

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.180
So really it's
the same tools you

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.810
use at work to
motivate your teams

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.090
or actually have a
good relationship

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.860
with your colleagues.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.380
I challenge you to do
more of this at home.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.940
Other big theme,
leading by example.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.430
And instead of do as I say
and not as I do, you know,

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.680
do as I say and as I do.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.450
And as I was doing research,
I realized the huge defining

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.520
moments for me.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.460
I realized that I was making
it harder for my children to do

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.500
what I was asking from them.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.530
I would often say, stop crying.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.790
Calm down.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.010
Anyone else?

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.710
Stop crying.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.580
Calm down.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.660
Pretty common.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.480
Well actually what the research
shows is that when we do this,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.611
they are probably already in
what we call fight or flight

00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:56.110
mode.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.660
They're already in a state
where they're really finding

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.370
it hard to get out of it.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.730
When we raise our voices and
we say stop crying, calm down,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.260
actually it increases the level
of cortisol in their body.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.520
Instead of coming back to
their prefrontal cortex,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.560
this logical part of the brain
where we want them to be.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.310
They're actually in
their primitive brain,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.150
where we also called the chimp
in some management books.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.100
And so if we actually--

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.870
I realized that I
was making it harder

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.460
for them to do these things.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.350
While what we should
do is actually

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.170
anticipate a lot of
issues as we saw earlier

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.610
and help them get out.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.620
You know, replace the cortisol
with oxytocin, with dopamine.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.740
So the right
hormones to actually

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.120
be wanting to do things.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.780
And so I actually had a big
experience when Noor was five

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.780
and she spoke to me for the
first time in an incredibly

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.210
disrespectful voice.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.106
And I just was going to
just fly off the wall,

00:19:52.106 --> 00:19:54.400
I mean I was so angry.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.420
But I realize that we
were both in our chimp,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.570
in our primitive brain.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.820
So I used what I call ABC.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.010
So A for acknowledge my
feelings, I'm very angry.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.600
B for breathe.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.340
And C for choice.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.530
And actually I made the
choice to remove myself

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.080
from the situation rather
than lecture her and scold

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.180
her right there and then.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.770
And as I gave myself
some time I realized

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.700
that she spoke in
exactly the same way

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.670
as I had been doing
for the last few years.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.040
And the problem is actually
they've got deferred memory.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.720
So it only came out at five.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.780
So for the ones who have
younger children, hopefully

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.450
you can still correct things
so that you don't end up

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.700
having children actually
speak to you in exactly

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.240
the same way you speak to them.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.259
And obviously it's
not respectful,

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:41.800
you can't speak to
another like this.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.310
But ideally we should
be leading by example.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.800
And obviously that applies,
it's easy to apply this

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.895
to stricter parents and
parents who get angry.

00:20:50.895 --> 00:20:52.270
But I also want
to share with you

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.990
a story of a couple who
seemed like the absolutely

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.360
most amazing perfect parents.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.590
And they had a
daughter called Lisa.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.960
And they simply adored
her and they decided

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.330
to give her unconditional love.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.717
So as she was brought up, they'd
take her everywhere with them.

00:21:11.717 --> 00:21:13.300
Until the age of
two, they didn't even

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.727
take a night out together.

00:21:15.727 --> 00:21:18.310
And so when she turned two, they
decided to book a babysitter.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.290
And they told Lisa, oh,
we booked a babysitter.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.780
We really wanted this night out.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.620
She threw a tantrum.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.260
They canceled the babysitter.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.120
Then Lisa turned out
to be this lovely girl.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.730
She grew up to--
always very generous

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:36.910
like giving her lunch whenever
someone else didn't have lunch,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:41.470
always being responsible
for brownies at parties.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.110
But unfortunately
when she turned 14,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.010
she became angry,
resentful and her parents

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:48.970
could not understand.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.520
And so they kept telling her
but we sacrificed everything

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.810
for you, how can you
treat us like this.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:00.587
So they went to see a
psychiatrist, friend of theirs.

00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:01.420
They told the story.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.330
And he said, well unfortunately
you trained her that way.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.150
What do you mean?

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.430
We did everything,
we've been so nice and--

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.570
what do you mean we
train her that way?

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.770
He told them well, unfortunately
actions speak louder

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.420
than words.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.190
And what you've
modeled is actually

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.890
that your needs were
not so important.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.590
And her needs-- you didn't
model how to say no.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.620
You didn't actually develop her
frustration and disappointment

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.300
muscle.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.390
So what's happening to her is
simply that she cannot cope.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.430
She does not have the
coping mechanism of emotions

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.830
to manage her emotions.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.660
And so that was a
huge realization

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.170
for my wife, who actually
tended to be more like this.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.620
And so you can see that from
both sides of the spectrum.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.630
So leading by example
is really about actions

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.910
that speak louder than words.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.610
So how could you implement
this on a daily basis?

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.210
For example, if you want
your children to be grateful,

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.770
you can actually show gratitude.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.670
If you want them to be--

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.150
so for example, if you want
them to know how to fail

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.060
and how to accept mistakes,
you can share your mistakes.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.490
We do that during
our dinners when we

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.410
manage to have dinner together.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.020
We share the mistakes we made
and what we learned from them.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.145
Because we realized that
our children were starting

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:18.654
to be perfectionists, which is
actually very common nowadays.

00:23:18.654 --> 00:23:20.820
So you can implement, you
can really lead by example

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.694
and bring these things
into your daily lives.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.434
So hopefully you won't have,
you will have good followers.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.870
So I want to
actually ask you, I'm

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.450
sure that you have
regular meetings,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.010
interim meetings at work.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.040
Surely that's quite
regular and common.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.341
So what are actually
the goals and objectives

00:23:52.341 --> 00:23:53.090
of these meetings?

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.160
Or why do you have
internal meetings?

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.864
Can you give me ideas?

00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:00.864
AUDIENCE: We talk
through what's happening.

00:24:00.864 --> 00:24:02.030
NADIM SAAD: So talk through.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:05.110
So basically you're discussing--

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.549
AUDIENCE: Like the agenda.

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:07.590
NADIM SAAD: Yeah, agenda.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.089
Sure.

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:13.690
So we're basically, we're
kind of planning, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.648
for a weekend planning.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.859
Anything else?

00:24:22.859 --> 00:24:25.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] .

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.900
NADIM SAAD: Assess performance.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.480
Does that actually
happen on a weekly basis?

00:24:36.847 --> 00:24:37.430
Anything else?

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.528
AUDIENCE: To reach agreements.

00:24:39.528 --> 00:24:40.736
NADIM SAAD: Reach agreements.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.832
So negotiate?

00:24:47.832 --> 00:24:49.100
Yeah, so negotiate.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.140
Would it be solve solutions and
negotiate to agree on solutions

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.010
to problems or just negotiate?

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.164
OK.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.430
AUDIENCE: Highlight problems.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.721
NADIM SAAD: Highlight problems.

00:25:09.504 --> 00:25:12.880
AUDIENCE: Praise
and recognition.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.310
NADIM SAAD: Praise
and recognition.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:22.120
Yes, so can I add to this that
it would be motivating maybe

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.760
as well?

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.520
So you get the motivation to--

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.434
get recognition to motivate.

00:25:27.434 --> 00:25:30.160
AUDIENCE: Setting expectations.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.850
NADIM SAAD: Set expectations.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.190
OK.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.232
I'll-- one last one.

00:25:37.232 --> 00:25:38.690
AUDIENCE: Strengthen
relationships.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.000
NADIM SAAD: Strengthen
relationship, yeah, bonding,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.170
strengthen relationships.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.110
Great, and I like that
we finished on that.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.260
Because when you
see this list, can

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:53.590
you see how it would be useful
to have this at home as well.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.159
Bonding, set expectations,
praise and recognition,

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:57.700
highlight problems,
and address them,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.720
obviously problem
solving, reach agreements.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.490
So now I have a
question for you is

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.500
how many of you
have regular family

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.270
meetings on a weekly basis?

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.560
Great question.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.560
Meals do not count.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.460
It's usually 5%.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.830
Come on, tell me someone
has a regular meeting.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.770
Once a week?

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.660
No.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.250
OK, well this is really the
most important tool in the book.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.070
So thanks for being honest.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.370
And family meetings are
actually run very much

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.260
like a business meeting.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.719
They've got-- and
for doing it once

00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:35.134
a week because
what you don't want

00:26:35.134 --> 00:26:36.580
is actually for
children to think

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.927
that you're only doing them
when there's a big problem.

00:26:39.927 --> 00:26:42.010
Because otherwise they
become reluctant to do them

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.530
while the idea is to
have a real motivation

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.181
to do them because it is
a real bonding experience.

00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:51.490
So elect a chairperson
and a secretary.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.040
The reason for this is because
if you don't, then they

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.110
can go completely--

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.010
you need someone to manage.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.610
But the secretary
is really important,

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.401
and actually children
from the age of five,

00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:06.130
six, love to take the
secretary and actually

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.150
just write the minutes down.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.880
And agenda, of course,
we need agenda.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.920
And actually on the
agenda, we start

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.230
with compliments and gratitude.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.740
So for example, our
five-year-old daughters

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.100
told our three-year-old
daughter at some point, Yasmin,

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.900
thank you for biting
me less this week.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.630
And that actually came from
a previous family meeting

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.430
the week before where
we gave Yasmin ideas

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.630
on how she could bite less.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.271
So it had worked quite well.

00:27:40.327 --> 00:27:42.910
What each family member is proud
of, that's actually something

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.860
that at seven, our daughter
said oh, can I talk to myself.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.542
I'm grateful for
actually having finished

00:27:50.542 --> 00:27:52.000
"Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory"

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.910
and reading so much better.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.310
We said, oh, so
you're proud of this.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.990
Yeah, sure, of course you
can be proud of yourself.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.850
And actually it's a
great moment to show

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.450
what we're proud of as adults
and to lead by example.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.910
And for our children
to know how to focus on

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.859
the positives and not
just the negatives.

00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:07.825
Yeah?

00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:11.206
AUDIENCE: Personal related
like as in only family related?

00:28:11.206 --> 00:28:13.745
Or would you talk
about work [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:13.745 --> 00:28:15.495
NADIM SAAD: So it is
only, so the question

00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:17.500
is about whether it's
work or family related.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.160
It's actually family related.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.310
There's already so much to
talk about on a weekly basis

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.304
or even if you do it
bi-weekly, it's really,

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:27.220
it's really effective.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.890
It completely changes
the family dynamic.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.720
So the next step,
which is really the one

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.370
that every parent
wants to get to

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.750
is the needs, problem solving.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.190
Let's actually address
all the issues we have.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.800
So the way we did
it, so it was--

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.030
so the girls already had an idea
of what a family meeting was.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.700
And that day we asked them
what their needs were.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.620
So that's what's so
important is actually

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.490
for children to feel that they
also have their needs met.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.990
They'll start
probably with oh, I

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.760
want to go to Disneyland
Paris and they

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.520
want to do this and that.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.061
We tell them oh,
sure, we'll put this

00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:01.730
on the agenda for the future.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.450
But right now do
you have any needs?

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.090
So my four-year-old
daughter said daddy, I'd

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.460
like you to shout less.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.920
I was going to go, but I'm
really shouting so much less.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.480
Don't you see the
efforts I'm making.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.380
I mean you should--

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.430
come on.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.120
And then I was going to
go, well you make me shout.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.200
I stopped myself in my
tracks and I said, oh, you

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.560
want me to shout less.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.260
Well, I'd love to
do that actually

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.410
and I promise I'm going to
make a conscious effort.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.780
But so why don't we
actually as a family

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.370
think about what we could
do to have less screaming

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.600
or generally because there
is quite a bit of shouting

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.560
in the family.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.240
So we brainstorm and actually
realize that a lot of shouting

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.440
happened in the morning.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.620
Because, you know, this great
routine that we created.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.520
The problem is now
they had half an hour

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.900
to have all the time to--

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.626
for breakfast and fun.

00:29:51.626 --> 00:29:53.500
Well, we still ended up
being late for school

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.780
because then by the
time we told them OK,

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.720
now it's time to get ready,
to get-- finalize the dressing

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.310
so we can get out the door.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.030
It take 15 minutes instead of
the 2 or 3 that it should take.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.470
So we brainstorm ideas.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.382
And actually I said
you could actually

00:30:09.382 --> 00:30:11.590
wake up earlier so you'd
have to go to sleep earlier.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.006
They said no, no
that doesn't work

00:30:13.006 --> 00:30:14.860
because we wouldn't see then.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.270
You come back late from work.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.019
So no, no.

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:18.060
Let's try something else.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.430
So they actually came
up with a simple idea,

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.750
just remind us by singing.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.170
So unfortunately I had
to sing, "Let us go.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.540
Let us go."

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.270
it was a big "Frozen" mania.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.560
And so I said, really you want
me to do this, I hate singing.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.220
OK.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.480
OK, I'll do that.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.250
Next morning, I
went, "Let us go.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.770
Let us go."

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.140
They put their skates on,
they were like two minutes.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.120
They were ready at the door.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.900
I was like, wow, that
looks like magic.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.650
Well the reality is it's
because they found the solution,

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.760
because they agreed on this.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.600
Whether, I mean we also
use now, thankfully they

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.640
don't ask me to sing too much.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.700
But they asked me for
example to use respect.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.460
So if-- or rewind.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.810
So if they've done
something that they're not

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.480
supposed to do, instead of
immediately lecture them.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.310
They have an opportunity
by saying rewind.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.780
For example, they have an
opportunity to do it better.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.140
And this is the
amazing way for them

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.360
to acknowledge their
mistake and to actually

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.400
practice doing things better.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.460
So and that all came out of our
family meetings and our problem

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.440
solving sessions.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.890
So in summary, the way to
do a problem solving session

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.340
is you say, what
can we do about it.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.130
Then you generate possible
alternate solution together.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.620
Ideally you find more than one
solution so they can really,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.460
you can get buy in.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.460
You know how at work,
if just someone comes up

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.620
with a solution and
you just get on,

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.080
you just think I'm sure
there was a better idea.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.410
And so ideally you find
two or three solutions

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.780
and all agree on
what the best one is.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.570
And after each option you
should ask, how would that

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.790
work for you to really
empower your children

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.780
to choose the best option.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.630
So you will decide together on
the best acceptable solution.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.589
And finally, we ask them how
would you like to be reminded.

00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:08.130
So in they're-- in this case,
they wanted to be reminded with

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.620
the singing or with a word
like respect or rewind.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.740
And then finally, I would
suggest particularly

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.180
with older children to ask them
what the consequence would be

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.116
if they don't end up complying.

00:32:21.116 --> 00:32:22.240
You know, you do tell them.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.550
Look, I totally trust that
we've done this together

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.900
and you've agreed so
you're going to do it.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.410
But sometimes, you know, we
slip in life, it happens.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.290
And so if you agree on a
consequence, and in this case,

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.560
actually the agreement was
in the case of what I--

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.300
the story I just told
you, was that they

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.866
would have to go to sleep
earlier and wake up earlier.

00:32:40.866 --> 00:32:42.365
So it wasn't, it's
not a punishment,

00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:46.180
it's not a-- it's just a simple
natural logical consequence

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.164
of their actions.

00:32:47.164 --> 00:32:48.580
And the more you
do this, the more

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.610
they actually start realizing
that it's not about punishment.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.940
And it's just that in life, you
just have normal consequences

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.650
to your actions.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:01.190
And so that's a great
way to achieve this.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.160
So how do you create
a shared purpose?

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.955
Actually is the final
point is you also

00:33:07.955 --> 00:33:10.280
either do a problem
solving session

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.590
or you do what we call I
mean you try and instill

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.400
a family culture.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.760
The reality is company
culture happens

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.380
whether we want it to or not.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.120
And actually as
you know we spend,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.300
I mean the company spends
so much money on making sure

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.660
that the culture
is communicated,

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.890
that we all are aware of it.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.299
Well, in our family lives,
unfortunately often we

00:33:32.299 --> 00:33:34.590
don't realize that we are
creating a culture whether we

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.280
want it or not.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.760
So my intention
here is just to make

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.422
you realize that by becoming
more intentional about it,

00:33:41.422 --> 00:33:42.130
it's much better.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.260
So how we define
a family culture,

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.130
it's the unique way that
a family forms itself

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:52.320
in terms of rules, roles,
habits, activities, beliefs,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.720
and other areas.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.669
And you can imagine that these
things just happen naturally.

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:00.960
So actually when we become
more intentional about them,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.920
it enables us to decide what
we want to be as a family.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.510
Have more vision and strategy.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:09.239
So fun, sporty, kind, curious,
what are the values we

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:10.800
want to give to our children.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.110
You know, care of
self, care for others.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.090
Effort is good.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:17.515
Whatever works for you,
every family is different.

00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:19.889
But just becoming more conscious
and strategic about this

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:24.330
can make a huge difference to
your children as they grow.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.610
And so ask yourself, what
actions can lead to this?

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.580
Agree during a family meeting
that OK, let's do more of this

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.969
because we want to be
like this as a family.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.880
And try actually if you
have all the children.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.100
Ask them, what do you
think our values are?

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.440
Do kind of what we
call a two minute quiz.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.400
So OK, tell us in three,
four words what you

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.590
feel that we are as a family.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.620
And you'd be surprised sometimes
at the answers they give,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.730
they can give you.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.949
And so ideally you
actually, if you're not

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.170
happy with the answers
then you get an opportunity

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.620
to discuss these and make
sure that you correct things

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.240
before it's too late.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.290
So overall, you want to
finish on a positive note.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.037
Because it's like sandwich
or like feedback, sorry,

00:35:07.037 --> 00:35:08.370
you want to do it as a sandwich.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.220
Positive, so compliments
and gratitude.

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.580
Then you put the problem
solving, the part where you

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.830
know, hey, we've got problems.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.840
Let's solve them.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.390
But you want to finish
on a positive note.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.030
So after problem solving
and family culture,

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.950
we plan activities
and family fun.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:27.110
You know, what we usually
do in work meetings as well.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.920
Play a family game
if you've got time.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.817
Because obviously these
things, sometimes you

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:33.150
skip the problem solving
because we don't have problems.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.970
We just use the family
meeting as a bonding session.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.040
So we have time
for a family game.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.460
And it's a bit cheesy, but we
always finish with a family hug

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.990
and the children love it.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.800
So overall, I wanted
to check with you.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.620
What leadership
skills do you feel

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.770
that we've used actually
coming back to everything

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.000
you've defined?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.920
Well, I mean, I promised
I would show you my list.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.140
Well, here it is.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.490
Vision and strategy.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.040
So family culture,
anticipating issues,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.160
it's very much about
vision and strategy.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.810
Leading by example, I think I
went through that in detail.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:11.580
Effective
communication, you know,

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:15.480
the replacement of
all the negative,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:21.660
the negatives, the orders with
more motivating techniques.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.402
Collaborative as
well as directive.

00:36:23.402 --> 00:36:25.110
You know, it's very
important to actually

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.609
when you do a family
meeting, you're

00:36:26.609 --> 00:36:30.960
asking them to also
collaborate to find solutions

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.700
to their problems,
to empower them.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.820
Emotional intelligence,
ability to listen,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.910
to be empathetic
with our children.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.412
Motivating and inspiring.

00:36:44.412 --> 00:36:46.370
Valuing mistakes as
opportunities for learning.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.536
As we said, you know,
teaching them to fail and lead

00:36:48.536 --> 00:36:50.090
by example.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.060
Positive attitude and
flexibility pragmatism.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.980
Trust and integrity.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.160
And finally, something we
couldn't be parents without

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.930
is determination and commitment.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.570
And I want to acknowledge
you all as parents

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.490
because we have a tough job.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.280
And so hopefully the
session has given you

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.117
a bit more ideas on how to
address these challenging times

00:37:12.117 --> 00:37:13.200
and really find solutions.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.720
And realize that
actually it is all

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.560
about being a leader at home as
we want to be leaders at work.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.600
And by applying
these techniques,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.850
we can really make
our family lives

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.530
easier and more harmonious.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.788
Thank you.

00:37:25.788 --> 00:37:30.492
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:30.492 --> 00:37:31.950
SPEAKER 2: Right,
thank you, Nadim.

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.241
It's quarter past 1:00, and
so we have about 10 minutes

00:37:34.241 --> 00:37:35.130
for questions or so.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.220
And please use the mic
to ask the question.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.052
Any questions from the floor?

00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:45.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was just
wondering about ages where

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.390
you can start some of this.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.740
Because I've got
young children so

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.260
I totally see the benefit of
what you're talking about.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.550
But I also think they are
not going to get it yet.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.350
So when--

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.350
NADIM SAAD: Can I ask how
old your children are?

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.450
AUDIENCE: Two and zero.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.590
NADIM SAAD: Well,
congratulations on the--

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.240
two actually is a
great age to start,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.619
particularly limited
choices, asking questions.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.160
Making sure, basically you want
to remove the resistance that

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.980
comes with--

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.740
I don't know if you're,
I mean autonomy,

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.780
there is this need
for autonomy identity

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.414
that comes in human beings.

00:38:17.414 --> 00:38:18.330
And it comes in peaks.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.910
It comes at two, that's what
explains the terrible twos.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.080
It comes back at 12, which is
adolescence and older people.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.250
It comes back at 40.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:29.940
It explains a lot of
the midlife crisis.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.160
And then again at 80.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.680
So two is really a great
moment to start and apply

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.470
a lot of basically
remove the resistance.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.410
Creating routines, you
know, everything basically

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.780
a lot of the-- leading by
example can start at any age.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.460
I hope you can use
some, I mean we

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.126
have talks that is more
specific for younger children.

00:38:53.126 --> 00:38:54.750
But I hope that some
of the ideas here,

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.340
you can definitely commend.

00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:03.887
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:03.887 --> 00:39:04.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.740
The kind of frustration I
guess that I have with my kids

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.930
is that, and this
could go on by the way.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.280
The frustration, I think is
that the ability for me to

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.340
or the inability of me
to articulate kind of

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.660
do the boring stuff to
get to the fun stuff.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.186
So that brushing
teeth, and I get

00:39:25.186 --> 00:39:26.560
what you're saying
about routine,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.410
but I guess I have
trouble articulating.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.220
Like it'll take you two
minutes to brush your teeth.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.810
And then you get 20
minutes to mess about.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.210
And the whole process to get
them from start to finish

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.706
will take 25 minutes.

00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:39.580
You know what I mean.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:40.913
NADIM SAAD: I totally, totally--

00:39:40.913 --> 00:39:43.060
AUDIENCE: I need help
articulating that to them.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.190
Please, please help.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.810
NADIM SAAD: Yes.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.020
And I agree.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.850
I still get frustrated at this.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.614
Because actually it's
understanding what is age

00:39:51.614 --> 00:39:52.780
appropriate is the hardest--

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.250
was the hardest bit for me.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.424
Realizing that actually
the prefrontal cortex,

00:39:57.424 --> 00:39:58.840
so this logical
part of the brain,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.640
understanding what the
consequences of our actions,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.780
that takes until the age of 25.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.700
That's actually when we
become really adults,

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.670
when our prefrontal
cortex stops growing.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.460
Until then, unfortunately
they don't have hindsight.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.190
They don't realize
that oh, of course,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:19.120
I mean unless we do it
outside of the actions, which

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.540
is why the whole idea of
routines, of problem solving,

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.160
is doing when
they're not already

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.740
in this kind of
resistance and outside

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.730
of the prefrontal cortex.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.240
And so these tools
to remind them

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.100
that we agree that
it's much better.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.308
Because outside, so you do
a problem solving session,

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:38.667
you say, would you prefer
to dress for 25 minutes

00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:40.000
and then have 2 minutes to play?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.541
Or do you have to
dress for 2 minutes

00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:43.190
and actually play for 25?

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.590
They'll go, play
25, dress 2 minutes.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.090
Great.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:46.769
OK.

00:40:46.769 --> 00:40:48.310
And that's where
you're going to say,

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.150
OK, well we have
agreement on that.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.550
What can I do to remind you
that this is what you want?

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.520
They'll give you an idea and
I promise, try it at home,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.020
you will--

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.330
I mean it's not going to
work 100% of the time.

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.640
But it's going to work,
particularly at the beginning

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.570
if you're consistent
about it, because they--

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.040
you empowered them to
decide for themselves

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.070
and you reminded them
in a nice fun way.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.210
So it unfortunately
takes more effort.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.960
But unfortunately
that's what our children

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.751
have to go through.

00:41:17.751 --> 00:41:20.080
We're here to coach
them to really develop

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.370
this prefrontal cortex.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.190
Because what we want is for them
to reach adolescence and not

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.600
make huge mistakes.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.040
And mistakes suffer
from inflation.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.580
So the younger they make
mistakes, the better.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.590
Because when they're
14, 15, and they

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.710
go into a car with someone
who's drunk et cetera,

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.840
you want them to
anticipate, to realize

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.160
the consequences of this.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.410
And so the more we
actually teach them

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:43.900
the consequences of
their actions early on,

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.112
the better-- well, the more
their prefrontal cortex

00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:48.070
is going to be developed
and the better they're

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.390
going to react to this.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.310
So it takes more time,
but it's so worth it.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.860
Because then you get
into this really,

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.040
you have this shared purpose
and this sense of motivation

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.162
to want to do things because
they want to do them,

00:41:59.162 --> 00:42:00.370
not because we're after them.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:02.410
And because you could,
you could be playing.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.910
Come on.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:04.840
Very frustrating, but.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.860
AUDIENCE: I have a
lovely adorable daughter.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.170
Well, until she turned 19
months and she realized

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.300
she can have an opinion.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.640
We are struggling,
me and my wife,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.049
to figure out how do
we negotiate with her.

00:42:22.049 --> 00:42:23.590
She's 19 months,
she can't understand

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.940
what we want to tell her.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.648
But she realized she
can have an opinion.

00:42:26.648 --> 00:42:29.940
She can wake up and say,
I'm not going to sleep.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.970
We don't just let her
cry herself to sleep.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:34.890
But we want to, find out a
way of negotiating with her.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.050
She will say she will not
have breakfast this morning.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.350
She doesn't like the milk
is too cold, it's too old.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:43.340
So it's--

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.840
NADIM SAAD: Thanks
for the question.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.530
It is very much, if I may,
I think the word negotiation

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.500
is in itself--

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.840
I mean, ideally you move
away from negotiating

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.280
with your children.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.870
Because otherwise
everything turns out

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.340
and turns into a negotiation.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.310
So what we want is
actually for them

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.080
to have a sense of control.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.010
That's crucial.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.417
That's so for them
not to be a two

00:43:07.417 --> 00:43:09.500
and just be resistant and
not want to do anything.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.490
But so giving them
limited choices.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.950
So for example, do you
want your milk cold or hot?

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:19.010
So you're anticipating the
issue before she tells you oh, I

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.390
want my milk hot actually.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.400
So you allow her
to make decisions

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.400
based on limited choices,
that will be usually helpful.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.570
But you do not negotiate.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.495
And then if it's actually she
decided she wanted it cold.

00:43:29.495 --> 00:43:31.370
And she then goes no,
actually I want it hot.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.100
Just like oh, next time Darling.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.390
Today you decided cold.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.480
Because otherwise
it's her way for--

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.889
it's her way to control you.

00:43:40.889 --> 00:43:42.680
Because they do have
this need for control.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.100
So don't get me wrong,
it's totally normal.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.045
It's age appropriate.

00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:48.920
But you want to teach
them that they can have

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.360
control, but on your terms.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.134
Otherwise they're
running the show.

00:43:53.134 --> 00:43:55.550
And then you've got a really
difficult life because it all

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.990
turns out into a negotiation.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.865
So limited choices,
asking questions,

00:44:00.865 --> 00:44:02.240
and enforceable
statements, which

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.864
is another one I
didn't really mention.

00:44:03.864 --> 00:44:07.884
For example, children in this
house who want to have dessert

00:44:07.884 --> 00:44:09.550
must have eaten their
meal, for example.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.640
So instead of, if
you don't do this,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.700
you won't get that,
which is very threatening

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.950
and it really
creates opposition.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.280
You try and create
more positive ways.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.480
So as soon as you've done
that, you can do this.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.520
So it doesn't put the
child in resistance mode.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.350
I hope that helps.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.470
AUDIENCE: Next to being,
like giving them control,

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.600
do you have some
suggestions on how

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.580
to let them break rules
and be [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:44.270
Because I mean that's why they
are wired to a certain age

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.570
to them and try to
break the rules.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.470
How would you
suggest to do that?

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.850
NADIM SAAD: So the question
is how often should you

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:54.500
let them break the rules?

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.670
Or should you let them
break the rules at all?

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.040
I mean what's was the question?

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.030
AUDIENCE: So the question
stems from the fact

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.960
that they are wired to break
the rule at some point.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:12.610
And feeling that giving them
too much of this management

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.520
leadership style might then
transform them into anarchists,

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.690
they just want to avoid all of
that when they are teenagers.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:26.660
So how do you allow for an
element of breaking the rules?

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.270
NADIM SAAD: OK, so it's--

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.220
well, that's a tough
one because my wife

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.040
and I would answer differently.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.760
Because she would
allow more exceptions.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.450
Because of my parenting style,
I allow less exceptions.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.650
And I think that's what
we're talking about here.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.110
My view of life is actually
there are rules everywhere

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.940
and actually my
children have to teach--

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.830
have to learn that early on.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:56.150
So I wouldn't allow for
a lot of breaking rules.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.550
To make up for
that, they are not

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.260
allowed to break up many rules,
there are some exceptions.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.340
So I say, OK, you know what,
I'll make an exception.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.550
Go ahead, for example,
break a rule that is not,

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.320
you know, is not
so important for me

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.400
or so choose your battles.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.140
It's fine.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.230
But the rest of the time, I make
it clear that that's the rule.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.780
But to make up
for that rigidity,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.510
you actually create a
lot of autonomy within--

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:22.490
you offer a lot of choices.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.210
You anticipate a lot of issues
by actually having covered it,

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.180
by being collaborative.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.410
So they feel they have a
say and they are empowered.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:31.640
And they feel they've got a
shared purpose and belonging.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.800
As long as you have
this, you'd be surprised

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.872
that children actually are a
lot less intent on breaking

00:46:36.872 --> 00:46:38.080
the rules just to break them.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.705
They break them
because they just feel,

00:46:39.705 --> 00:46:41.780
they're like oh my god,
there are so many rules.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.730
I can't bear all this.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.100
So as long as you give
enough control and autonomy,

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.830
children will actually learn
to make mistakes and it's fine,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.719
but there are
consequences to this.

00:46:50.719 --> 00:46:53.010
So they learn that there are
consequences for mistakes.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.354
It's not big punishment
and oh, horrible.

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.770
It's actually, the idea is not
to make children feel worse

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.020
in order to do better.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.040
It's for them to
always feel good

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.770
and to want to be in this family
and want to do things correctly

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.169
because they see that
otherwise, you know,

00:47:08.169 --> 00:47:09.710
my parents are not
going to be happy.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.825
Or it's not actually counter to
the way the family functions.

00:47:13.825 --> 00:47:15.200
So hopefully it's
that, you know,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.940
it's for you to decide
how many exceptions you're

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.523
going to make.

00:47:17.523 --> 00:47:19.490
But if you make too
many, then you're

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.065
letting them run
the show and not

00:47:21.065 --> 00:47:22.940
realize there is a
consequence and that there

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.540
are rules while you want
to teach them the rules.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.810
AUDIENCE: So sometimes breaking
rules or at least perceived

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.640
rules can be a good thing.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.420
Are you concerned or
is there any evidence

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.082
to show or counter
evidence that you're

00:47:40.082 --> 00:47:41.540
going to end up
raising a child who

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.490
isn't capable of breaking rules
when we see rules as an adult?

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:50.800
Because I want my son to be
able to break rules sometimes.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.610
NADIM SAAD: Totally,
again, it's--

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:56.420
I mean, it's a similar
question and I understand that.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.150
And it's funny because I rarely
get these kind of questions.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.320
And clearly Google
is very much, it

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.570
is part of the Google culture.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:03.611
And I think that's great.

00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.110
I think it's, you
know, you want to be--

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:10.370
to question, you know, the
rules and then otherwise you

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.846
can't actually create a lot.

00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:14.720
I think it's about
finding this right balance

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.553
as I was explaining.

00:48:15.553 --> 00:48:20.000
But really it's offering
a lot of autonomy

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.880
and a lot of opportunities
to do things differently

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.190
and to decide what
the rules are.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:29.030
So for example, in the
problem solving session,

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.700
you're not imposing your
rule on your children.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.800
You're telling them,
OK, that's what we

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.650
want as an outcome as a family.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.947
So what are the right rules
for our family to achieve this?

00:48:39.947 --> 00:48:41.780
And sometimes you'll
go against your feeling

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.560
like, oh my god, really?

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.570
But you'll go with it.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:45.950
And you'll just
go, you know, OK.

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:48.830
I mean, I don't really
agree but I'll go with that.

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.020
That in itself is
kind of a way to teach

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.744
them to think differently,
to think outside of the box,

00:48:53.744 --> 00:48:55.160
and to find solutions
to problems.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.670
I think that's what
we want to achieve.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.300
Just breaking the
rules for the sake

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:04.670
of breaking them is kind of
goes, it will go against you.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.650
And sometimes, and
it's fine, they

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.240
have to make
mistakes by the way.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.980
So it's not like
that we're going

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.316
to create these perfect kids
who never break the rules.

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:13.940
It's just when they
break them, instead

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.773
of getting angry and
thinking, oh my god how

00:49:15.773 --> 00:49:19.240
dare you do that, it's
actually oh, so sad.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.910
You know what the rules are.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:21.830
So that's a mistake.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.950
It's OK and that's the
consequence that you agreed on.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.494
And then instead of going
no, that's not fair.

00:49:27.494 --> 00:49:29.660
They'll go, yeah, I mean I
decided this consequence.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:30.340
It's fine.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.590
You know, and it's tough.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.910
It can be tough, but it's fine.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.139
I hope that answers.

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.680
AUDIENCE: Right,
thanks for the talk.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.615
My kids are 8 and 12 and
we have some routines

00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:42.270
that work quite well for us.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.205
But then we have some which have
been really non established,

00:49:45.205 --> 00:49:47.300
and which we would like
to change because they

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.300
don't necessarily work out now.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.260
So for example, we
used to always get

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.420
into do some kind of
practice after dinner.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.380
But we find these days that
perhaps everybody's a bit tired

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.837
then and piano practice can
get a bit confrontational.

00:49:58.837 --> 00:50:00.920
And we'd like to bring it
earlier in the day maybe

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.135
before dinner and say then
we're met with big resistance.

00:50:04.135 --> 00:50:07.060
I wonder if you have tips on
how to kind of deal with that.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.060
NADIM SAAD: So is there
resistance because they just

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.910
want to have fun
before and that they

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.350
are used to doing it after
or where does it come from?

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.308
AUDIENCE: Because in
their mind, piano practice

00:50:16.308 --> 00:50:17.914
is always after dinner

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:19.080
NADIM SAAD: OK, so there's--

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:19.520
AUDIENCE: At least
that's what's voiced.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.020
I mean maybe there's
something else.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.740
But yeah, that's the
objection that we're given.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.030
NADIM SAAD: Yeah,
well this is very--

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.210
usually that's very much the
purpose of a family meeting.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.900
Is when it's outside of this
kind of resistance already,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.360
you should do it before.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.190
But you can agree on
why it's better for them

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.392
to do it earlier.

00:50:38.392 --> 00:50:40.850
I mean that's where usually,
when you get-- you get buy in.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.300
It's like any meeting.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.260
To get buy in, they mustn't
be in resistant mode.

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.260
They have to realize
what the intention is

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.914
and why it's better.

00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:51.830
And or otherwise you say
well, the consequence

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:54.020
could be well you have
to have dinner earlier

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:56.040
and maybe then we can't
participate in dinner.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.665
I mean things-- you can actually
make things up so that to make

00:50:58.665 --> 00:51:00.250
sure that--

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.550
I mean it's not, it's
just showing them

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.310
the consequence of
not going that way

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.352
without it being a battle.

00:51:07.352 --> 00:51:09.810
Because that's what you want
to remove and everything we do

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:10.500
is remove those.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.700
This battle, these positions,
that it's a win-lose situation.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.649
Actually everything is
a win-win situation.

00:51:15.649 --> 00:51:17.190
I mean we're doing
this for our kids.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.080
So they have to realize it.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.850
And the more you create this
environment of shared purpose

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:23.800
and we have the
same goals, the more

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.800
you can achieve no
resistance to piano practice.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.050
Actually yeah, it's true
actually, I'm going to do it.

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.530
Invent, I mean do it, be
creative, that's what I mean.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:35.760
And they're going to be your
best creative, you know,

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.780
they're going to bring
the best creative ideas.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.071
So allow them to have these
ideas because maybe they'll

00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:42.050
come up with something
that works for you,

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.340
and that you didn't
even think about.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.870
So to have these conversations.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:47.040
SPEAKER 2: All
right, and with that

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.090
please join me in a
massive round of applause

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:48.840
for Nadim Saad.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.690
[APPLAUSE]
