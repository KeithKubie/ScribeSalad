00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.930
We've just argued that if N is
polynomial, and we take its output, and

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.940
feed that into M, which is also
polynomial in its input size,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.060
then the resulting composition
of M with N is also polynomial.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.260
So, we can add in polytime
to our claim here.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.530
And by this argument we've
proved the following theorem.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.220
If a is a polynomial reducable to B and
B is in P then A must be in P.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.920
Just convert the input to prepare it for
the decider for B and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.070
return whatever the decider for B says.
