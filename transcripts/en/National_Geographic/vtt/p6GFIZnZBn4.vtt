00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.937
( intro music )

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:35.067
( transition music )

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.736
( applause )

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.006
Asher: So I want to start
with two questions.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.176 line:0%
How do you connect to the wild,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.745 line:0%
and when do you
connect to the wild?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.482 line:0%
My relationship with the wild
began as a child

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.851
with something as simple
as a smile.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.554
The smile that you see
on my face right now

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.689
is not the one that
I had as a kid.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.659
Where you see incisors,
I once had fangs.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.727
This led me to
believe I was a bat.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.295
I would run about
the house with a cape

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:04.797
tied to my neck and my hands

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.365
pretending I could fly.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.935
I'm sorry to say that
I never took off.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.636
One of the many
disappointments of childhood,

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:13.606
things that you learn
your limitations.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.108
Few years later,

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.744
I remember reading this article
about fruit bats,

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.312
and a large number of them

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:23.316
are being consumed
by the thousands in Guam,

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.686
and being shipped from
the Pacific Islands to Guam.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.788
This is a commercial outfit.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.323
To think that somebody
would want to consume

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.559
something that I had
been not too long ago,

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.860
was kind of shocking.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.961
( laughter )

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.230
It really did not
resonate with me,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.232
and I figured I needed
to do something about that

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.334
at some point in my life.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.703
But I didn't think to start
then, which I should have,

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.672
and I'm always amazed
by people who start early

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:48.107
because it's never
too early to start.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.375
If you're reacting to something,

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.877
do something right
then and there.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.045
Don't wait for tomorrow,
don't wait for another day,

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.914
don't wait to become something.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.083
You're already everything
you need to be to act.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.053
Anyhow, so going forward,

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.988
eventually I found my way
back into conservation

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:05.058
which I'm really grateful for,

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.560
and I wound up dealing
with numerous species

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.329
through numerous
non-profit outfits.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.865
For me wild is
an implicit part of who I am,

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.401
and how I function daily.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.237
It is part of our biological
and evolutionary development,

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.672
it is a part of our lineage,

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.440
it's where we come from.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.543
It is our past,
it is in our present,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.544
and it should jolly well
be a part of our future,

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.045
and that is why I do what I do

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.647
because it is so important to me

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.817
to evoke this connection
that I feel on a cellular level

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.221
in every individual
I encounter every day.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.725
It led me to dealing with
ivory and rhino horn,

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.360
and all of last year went by

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.962
just tackling this one issue,

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.731
and trying to tell the same
story over and over again

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.833
in as many ways as possible.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.136
These were campaigns
for Elephant Voices,

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.771
Joyce Poole's organization,

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.907
dealing with poaching
in Kenya.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.276
This particular
campaign was supposed to

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.411
cast a light on what's happening

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.847
with the Chinese consumer market

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.783
being the largest stakeholder
in this game.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.150
It is a numbers game.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.853
It is about tipping points,
money and time.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.022
And time is running out

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.224
at the cost of these animals.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:14.861
This particular campaign shows
these two Chinese characters

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.629
which spells China in Chinese,
<i> Zhongguo</i> ,

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.865
and beneath that I've written

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:23.569
"Stop the trade.
Every toss costs a life."

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.005
This got Joyce thrown out
of a TCM Conference,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:27.573
Traditional Chinese
Medicine Conference,

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:29.876
and she called me panicked,
being,

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.612
"Oh my gosh, I can't believe
it had such a huge outcry

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.881
that I had to be basically
evicted from the premises."

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.984
She said, "I don't know
whether this was a good thing,"

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.818
but after a lot of debate

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:41.420
we realized it was a good thing

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.989
because shortly after,

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.491
we started getting e-mails
with images like this.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.827
This was the less
shocking image.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.062
I got e-mails with people
who had tattooed this

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.397
onto their backs and arms.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.732
I was surprised that
a single artwork that I created

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:57.303
could have such deep
impact on people's lives

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.871
that they felt like it
could extend their voice

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.472
and empower who they were

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.942
and what they stood for
in the world.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.978
We started running these
campaigns as open source.

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:07.647
Anybody could print them out

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.782
and use them any which way

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.952
they felt was appropriate
to get the story out there.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.420
There were demonstrations

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.424
completely decentralized,
organized by students, schools,

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.626
and non-profits
around the world,

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.629
all carrying banners.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.697
There were banners
hanging outside people's houses,

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.265
as bumper stickers in cars.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.833
I would get images
daily sent in,

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:31.169
and it was really quite
lovely to see

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.372
that these images could really

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.041
have such a strong reach
across the world.

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.544
Which led me to finding
ways to communicate

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.712
the same story in as
many media as possible,

00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:43.483
as well as to tell every
angle of the story.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.652
So this is to cast a light
on the terror attacks

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:48.621
and the trade in firearms

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.424
because illicit contraband
does contribute to that.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:57.163
It's almost important to educate
the Chinese demographic

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.900
about how each tusk
or rhino horn costs a life;

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.368
it does result in death.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:05.571
Most Chinese people
believe that

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.806
the elephant tusk is like
a tooth, it just falls out

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.542
and it's picked up by somebody

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.943
and delivered to
the marketplace.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.746
I needed to show this in a way,

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:16.949
in places where loads
of eyes would have

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.651
access to these images.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.654
We ran these on mass
transport systems in China,

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.323
as well as
on consumer magazines

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:25.925
in partnership with WildAid,

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:27.593
African Wildlife Foundation,

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.695
and Save Our Elephants.

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.163
Because we want to target people

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.699
who had the purchasing power,
who could have immediate impact

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.101
on what was happening
on the fields.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.036
Because when you
kill the demand,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.238
when you stop the buying,
it stops the killing.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.407
It's not just important
to educate people

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:42.775
about what's happening,

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.644
but also to cast light
on cultural consciousness

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:48.214
and shift perspectives
that are held

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:52.017
for extended periods of
time and get those people

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:54.553
to extend the empathy
that they feel toward one thing

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:55.854
toward the other thing.

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:58.324
Moving from the known
to the unknown.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.760
These two campaigns
which were run across China

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.661
in a similar format
on mass transport,

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.164
as well as on billboards
and magazines,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.300
were to help the Chinese
extend this pride that they feel

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.668
in the conservation success

00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:12.171
that they've achieved
with pandas in China

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:15.107
to African wildlife
hence "The pandas of Africa."

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.076
It was run in a vocabulary
they understood,

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.710
and it went viral in China

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.312
which was a tremendous success

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:22.982
because it was tweeted on Weibo

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.916
and in all
the local social media.

00:06:24.916 --> 00:06:27.286
The Chinese adopted it
as their own message

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.587
because it was
not targeting them

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:29.955
and singling them out.

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:31.190
Instead it was showing them,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.624
"You've done something well,

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.428
extend that positive attitude
towards something else."

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:39.432
For me, I'm haunted
by this crisis.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.567
My dating life is kind of
ruined by it because...

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.102
( laughter )

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.104
...frankly when I go out
on a date with a stranger,

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.739
I'm thinking all the while
about the one

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.641
that's lost every
fifteen minutes.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.176
By the time we get
to dessert I'm like,

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:51.977
"Is this guy worth
six elephants?"

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.279
( laughter )

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.047
When you're weighing
it like that,

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.915
it's very hard to sit through
that evening.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:06:58.116
( laughter )

00:06:58.116 --> 00:07:00.953
It also ends up affecting
me during my sleep cycle,

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.788
it ruins my REM
cycle continually.

00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:04.623
Or sometimes I actually end up

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:06.392
strategizing solutions
and taking notes.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.893
I always sleep with
an iPhone by my bed,

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:09.461
or a notebook
because I never know

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.029
when a sketch is
going to occur to me.

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.531
Not to mention bathroom breaks.

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.832
If I wake up in the
middle of the night,

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:15.267
and this was one
particular situation,

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.870
is a sequence that actually
unfolded one evening.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.271
I woke up at three
in the morning,

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.440
I went to the loo, sat down,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.608
and as I'm peeing I'm
looking out the door,

00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:25.243
and I see a tile on the floor -

00:07:25.243 --> 00:07:26.879
tree rings in this wooden tile.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.447
And I'm immediately thinking

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:31.918
about geological time
and about the Giant Sequoia

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:33.619
that I first encountered
as a child

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.521
in the British Natural
History Museum.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.190
About how these species
encompass our stories

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.726
and assimilate us in
such a profound way.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:45.831
This particular sequoia ring
started out its life in 557.

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.701
From there, moving forward,
it has assimilated

00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.570
the rise of Islam,
spread of Christianity,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.305
it has seen so much down

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:55.908
to the birth and
death of Gandhi.

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.944
When we cut a tree
like that down,

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.646
we're cutting this huge
part of our history down.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.315
So when a species goes extinct
it's not just about

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:06.719
that one individual species
that's going off our radar,

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:09.989
but about the fact that
this huge part of our story

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.557
has just gone missing.

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:14.026
And that is
such a terrible loss to me.

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:17.929
Immediately I got to the desk,
didn't go back to bed,

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:19.565
started sketching out a rhino,

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.933
juxtaposing this
tree ring into it,

00:08:21.933 --> 00:08:23.636
and then trying to
find ways in which

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:26.405
I can show how time
is lapsing for the species.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.774
The primary horn
became a sand timer,

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:31.043
but a blood timer so
every drop that falls

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.846
is adding to that
narrative of loss.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.815
The secondary horn
is a metronome

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:39.352
with a AK-47 going back
and forth, keeping count.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.522
The eye of the rhino
has a clock

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.290
that reads a second before
midnight because if you

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.026
compress geological time
into twenty four hours,

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.862
we came onto this planet
a second before midnight,

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.331
and we've had this
immense amount of impact,

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:55.601
changed the face of this
planet within that second.

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:58.070
How do I extend
the same narrative

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.306
on to yet other ideas?

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.874
This was about elephants,

00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:05.077
hence burning of the ivory,
the stockpiles.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.146
Thinking about how
that connects to China.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.982
Incense clocks were
what they used back in the day,

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.283
so burning of incense.

00:09:11.283 --> 00:09:12.918
Then thinking about
how the target

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.186
swings back and forth

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.655
just waiting for them
to be culled down.

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:19.325
Moving that forward, how can we
evolve this into a solution

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.494
that's about having a rise
in our energy consciousness?

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:24.396
Not just moving to
new energy economies,

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.565
but also finding this deeper,

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.467
spiritual connection to nature

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:32.304
to see if we have the capacity
to re-wild ourselves.

00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:33.939
Despite being disconnected,
despite living

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.341
in the cities that we live in,

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.476
if there is an honest way
in which we understand

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.478
that the rhino is a part
of who we are,

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.047
that the elephant is
a part of who we are,

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.883
and we cannot live without
them in this world with us.

00:09:44.883 --> 00:09:47.285
This particular campaign
I ran in New York

00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:48.954
to raise funding.

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:50.255
It was crowd sourced,

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:52.391
so every time a donor
contributed

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.659
to this particular campaign,

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.461
I would replace
a graphically illustrated hand

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.861
with an actual human hand.

00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:58.497
When I finished raising funding,

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.399
I had all the human
hands up there,

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.102
and this is the power
of us coming together.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:04.936
All of this resulted in me

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:07.239
getting a billboard up
in Times Square, on Broadway,

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:10.309
between 46 and 47th,
in partnership with loudSource,

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.478
and March for Elephants,
for a month.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:14.012
It ran twenty four seven,

00:10:14.012 --> 00:10:16.182
and I'm going to play
the spot for you.

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:22.087
( gunshot )

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:25.324
( groaning elephant )

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.861
( gunshots )

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:40.839
( tapping )
( elephant groaning )

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.576
( applause )

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.315
Asher: The acousticscape
for this particular animation

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:52.717
was acquired from
Elephant Listening Project,

00:10:52.717 --> 00:10:54.186
Katy Payne's work.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.087
This was an actual recording

00:10:56.087 --> 00:10:58.424
of a poaching incident in Gabon.

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.559
You hear the shots being
fired in the beginning,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:03.028
the elephants groaning,
succumbing to those shots,

00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:04.430
and then you hear the poachers

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.098
hacking into their faces,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.133
and the sound of that ...
( tapping )

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:11.370
that's the axe hitting against
the bone and also the tusk.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.139
You hear them
groaning even after.

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:16.208
That's because they're alive
and conscious for this.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.809
You actually see
elephants in Africa

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:20.512
stumbling about with
completely caved in faces

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.247
because they've eaten in
with an ax,

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:23.782
and it's still alive.

00:11:23.782 --> 00:11:25.250
You have to wait for
that elephant to fall

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.186
before you can even handle
what's happening with it.

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:30.088
It's a pretty grisly trade.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:31.557
It's really brutal and bloody.

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.091
Oh, by the way, that
particular campaign

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.027
got over 1.5 million views.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.862
That's 1.5 million
eyes that were reached,

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.396
minds that were reached

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:40.799
and hopefully changed
in some way by that campaign.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:42.334
I did have a lot of
people come up to me

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.202
and ask me what ivory was

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:46.639
which was a little shocking.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.673
It's the world we live in,

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:50.509
so the need to educate,
I cannot underscore that enough.

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:53.178
If you know,
transmit that knowledge.

00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:54.846
It has to happen now,
use social media.

00:11:54.846 --> 00:11:58.083
I mean taking a selfie is not
just about who we are today,

00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.685
but who we are has that power.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:02.721
Becoming that selfie
means that you have

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:05.024
a stand in this world, you
have a place in this world,

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:07.293
and therefore you need
to speak up through it.

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.561
Use yourself as a vessel.

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:11.763
Moving forward,
it's not just about

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:15.167
the megafauna that is going
extinct because of our actions.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.736
It's also the habitat
lost that's resulting

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.404
in compromised living situations

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:22.441
for all of these
incredible animals.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:25.277
This particular campaign
was illustrated in charcoal

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:26.678
because the charcoal trade,

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:28.747
I don't know how many of you
know about this,

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.483
is pretty rampant
in African countries.

00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:37.122
They fell over 400,000
acres in just Tanzania

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:38.657
to produce charcoal

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.625
because it's the main
energy source

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:42.995
for most Tanzanian households.

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.663
That's how they
light their stoves.

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.398
Because most
Tanzanian households,

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:49.101
the majority of the population
lives off grid.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.604
This basically results in
loss of habitat

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:54.373
for the African wildlife.

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:55.841
Cheetahs that are basically

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.943
disintegrating before
our very own eyes.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:13:00.012
These animals need
a lot of space.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.714
They need the acres
to survive.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.683
I was also in the
Serengeti recently

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:07.318
working with Frankfurt
Zoological Society very closely.

00:13:07.318 --> 00:13:10.622
I got the opportunity
to talk to poachers,

00:13:10.622 --> 00:13:12.023
from the poachers,

00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:14.092
and also install this mural

00:13:14.092 --> 00:13:16.394
in the Frankfurt office
in Seronera.

00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:19.932
The mural actually speaks to
how I embed data

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.700
into a particular artwork.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.368
Because the composition
was not just about

00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:25.136
creating something beautiful,

00:13:25.136 --> 00:13:26.905
but about how much information

00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:29.274
I can embed in a given layout.

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:30.275
In this particular case,

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.444
I wanted to show the Serengeti
highway coming up.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:35.380
I wanted to cast a light
on demographic momentum

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.882
in the upcoming years.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.917
Because if you look
at the skyline

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:40.485
that I've illustrated,

00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:42.954
you can actually see
from 12 million the population

00:13:42.954 --> 00:13:44.290
when it peaks at Empire State,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.925
is going to be at 200 million
just in Tanzania.

00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:48.126
Where is this
population going to go?

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:49.327
How is infrastructure going to

00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:50.596
develop in the coming years?

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.831
How are we going to stop
the wild from getting

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.234
infringed, fenced in,
and fragmented

00:13:56.234 --> 00:13:59.204
like it has everywhere
else in the world?

00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:02.107
These are the questions
I wake up to every day.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:04.643
The reason why I do
campaign after campaign,

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:07.212
image after image,
day in and day out,

00:14:07.212 --> 00:14:10.082
is because I want to change
the one thing that I know

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.551
will have the most impact
in the world around me.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.619
And that's you.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.986
Thank you.

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:17.256
( applause )

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.658
( outro music )
