00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.399
 Energy is very amazing! So amazing that we as a human species use about 15 TW in 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.309
 No moment! This is equivalent to 15 trillion watts. Note that this light bulb is normal 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.490
 Consume approximately 100 watts. One terawat can supply 10 billion 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.199
 At the same time 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 Of the world's energy, the United States consumes about 25%, while Google alone consumes almost 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.859
 0.013% This is enough energy to run 20,000 homes continuously 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.190
 Food also contains energy, which is measured by calories or joules. One calorie of food is equal 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.050
 Approximately 4,200 joules of energy. So how long will it take you to the socket 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.649
 To get what is equivalent to a day of dietary energy? For example, the normal diet of a man 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.170
 2500 calories, we will find that our bodies need about 10,000,000 joules of energy per day 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.399
 Let's take something like your laptop, which charges about 50 joules per second 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.350
 It will take the equivalent of 55 hours to ship yourself. On the other hand, if shipped from a power outlet 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.570
 A microwave with an estimated 1500 joules per second, will take 1.9 hours! 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.860
 The most amazing is the fact that this amount of energy costs 33 cents 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.920
 In North America. 33 cents a day to charge power. Unfortunately, we can not 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.730
 Connect ourselves to the electrical socket 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.750
 But if you take all that energy, how big is the possible explosion? Well, one calorie 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.190
 May equal 1 gram of explosive TNT. So if you ate 2500 calories 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.750
 in a day. You'll see the equivalent of 44 grenades from World War II bombs. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.100
 A huge explosion! 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.510
 But it's no secret that energy can do harm, in the end we've all tried it 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.600
 Electric shock. But how much electrical shock is needed to kill a human being? 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.500
 Surprisingly, it is few 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380
 7 ml amp, for at least 3 seconds 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.440
 I would be accurate. This is equivalent to AAA batteries directly to the heart. As you see electricity 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.000
 Kill by stopping the movement of the heart. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.670
 But our bodies built protection like your skin 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.980
 So do not go to the heart directly. However, shocks such as lightning, balance fluctuations 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.520
 In fact, the lightning bolt could hit 1 billion volts! And the reason that some people escape from lightning 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.620
 Depends on the path taken in their bodies. If not reach the heart 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.740
 He may come out alive 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.070
 Which proves to you the power and splendor of nature. What surprises you more 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.470
 That every minute, sufficient amount of sunlight to the surface of the earth is sufficient to need 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.450
 The world of energy for a whole year, that's right, almost 174 beta-watts of power up 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.830
 Earth from the sun! Of course, the biggest challenge is finding effective ways 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530
 To harness solar energy appropriately 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.670
 All this energy and heat is an effective factor in the formation of wind; sometimes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.550
 Be too strong to be hurricanes. But not only wind turbines can benefit 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.650
 Of the wind power to produce energy, scientists have proved that it is in sufficient quantities 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.470
 It can prevent hurricanes. In a simplified way wind turbines remove some wind energy 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.230
 To produce energy. The simulation showed theoretically that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.090
 If enough wind turbines are put together in danger zones 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.980
 Will significantly reduce wind disasters 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.690
 But regardless, is aerobic energy worth all this trouble? Click here and scan the AsapTHOUGHT sections 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.890
 As we explore how air turbines really work, how much energy can they produce? 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.350
 And the new technology that will change our future, I mean, can the world 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.390
 That depends on wind energy? 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 We went to the GE Global Research Center in Germany, the leader in aerospace energy to explore. 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.900
