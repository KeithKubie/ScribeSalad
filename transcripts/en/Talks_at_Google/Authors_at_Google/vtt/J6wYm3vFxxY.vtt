SUE RUNSTROM: My
name is Sue Runstrom.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.270
I'm hosting Dorie Clark, and
very happy to be doing that.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.730
Dorie Clark is an adjunct
professor at the Business

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.870
and her new book, right
back there, "Stand Out."

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.080
A former presidential
campaign spokeswoman,

website at dorieclark.com.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.050
Welcome, Dorie Clark.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.490
DORIE CLARK: Thank you, Sue.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.180
And hello, Google.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.870
We live in a world today that
is getting faster by the minute.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.670
The average employee gets
more than 100 emails per day.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.810
And that rate is
growing by 15% a year.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.290
Very soon, it's going
to be unsustainable, .

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.365
If it's not already you
guys here at Google probably

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:21.840
are already in the
forefront of that.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
We live in a world where,
in the past minute that Sue

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.260
has been introducing
me, 100 hours of video

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
was uploaded to your very
own product, YouTube.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.830
With all of that,
people and information

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.440
is streaming at you.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.620
20 years ago, it may
have made good sense

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.710
to follow your mom
or dad's advice

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.130
to just keep your head
down and do good work,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.670
and that that would eventually
be noticed and rewarded.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.220
But these days, with
people being so bombarded

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.740
with information, with Tweets
and meetings and emails

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.670
and text messages and SnapChats
and Instagrams coming at them,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.150
it's too much for
people to take in.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.900
If we don't find a way to
take control of our careers

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.970
and to stand out, we
risk being left behind.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.750
That's why I wrote
the book, "Stand Out,"

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.960
because I wanted to
try to understand.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.480
Among the people who are
considered the very best

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.100
in their field, how
did they get there?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.980
How did they come
up with the ideas

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.470
that they became known for,
and how did they actually

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.730
get recognized and build
a following around them?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.700
So I spent a couple
of years interviewing

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.250
about 50 top experts
in a cross-section

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.840
of different fields, everything
from genomics, to real estate,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.980
to urban planning, to
business, to productivity,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.500
to try to understand what
enables the top performers

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.980
today to really get noticed and
have their true talents seen,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.540
so that hopefully,
we could apply

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.730
some of those same lessons to
regular professionals today.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.630
One of the first things
that I wanted to talk about,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.950
because I've been traveling
around the country

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.130
in the past couple of months
since "Stand Out" came out,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.487
is the fact that sometimes,
when I'm having conversations

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:15.445
with people about this,
they say, oh, you know,

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.200
this is great.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.630
Yeah, I get it that
we need to stand out,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.390
that it's important to
have breakthrough ideas.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.200
But that's something that's
good for other people.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.810
That's not me.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.180
I'm just a regular person.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.020
I'm not a genius.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.640
I don't know that I
can really do this.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.980
And one of my very
favorite examples,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.190
actually, is
Starbucks, something

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.870
that even just walking here
from the T, you see a million

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.180
of them on every corner.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.180
Howard Schultz
didn't invent coffee.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.090
He didn't invent coffee shops.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.510
What he came up with was
a slightly different way

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.800
to do a coffee shop.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.830
And yet that was enough to
create a multi-billion dollar

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.790
worldwide empire.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.000
You don't need to be Einstein.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.850
You don't need to create
the theory of relativity

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.860
or to discover a new element
on the periodic table.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.329
What you need to do is find
a slightly different way

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.060
to look at the world.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.430
And fortunately, because
of your unique experiences,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.720
because no one sees the world
exactly the way that you do,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.550
that's something that actually
is eminently possible.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.980
One of the people that I profile
in "Stand Out" is this woman.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.120
Her name is Rose Schumann.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.930
Rose grew up in
suburban Maryland,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.590
and when she was 18 years
old, she took a family trip

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.320
to Nicaragua because that's
where her stepmother was from.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.290
It was shortly after the
end of the Contra War,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.350
and Rose went down
with her family.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.620
And she had never
seen anything like it.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.320
She grew up in a comfortable
suburban environment,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.470
and she was exposed,
for the first time,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.640
to a country where all of
the institutions that we take

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.770
for granted weren't operating.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.790
There was one
operative streetlight

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.360
in the entire country.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.020
There was poverty
unlike anything she

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.970
had ever seen before.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.830
And she decided that she wanted
to do something about it.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.750
And so she did.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.780
She went off to college.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.410
She studied development.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.010
She got a job after she
graduated in an NGO,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.080
and she started
working on the problems

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.450
and rolling up her sleeves.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.510
Now one of the most common
myths about innovation,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.880
about creativity, about coming
up with breakthrough ideas,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.040
is that the people who have them
have these bolts of insight.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.890
Suddenly the muses are
whispering in their ear,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.580
and they know what they have to
do, and then they go and do it.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.260
And sure, I'm sure in some
cases it works like that.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.550
But for the vast majority
of people-- and I

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.090
think this is really important--
the vast majority of people,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.750
you don't start with a brilliant
idea and then execute it.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.540
When I interviewed
these 50 top thought

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.720
leaders to try to
understand what

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.330
made them tick, what I
heard again and again

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.580
was actually the
opposite of that.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.230
You start by caring
about something.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.020
You start with curiosity.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.100
You start by having a
passion to explore something,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.730
and in the process of diving
into it, learning about it,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.400
seeing what it's made of and how
you can make a contribution--

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.170
that is how you can determine
where you can have an impact,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.650
and what kind of
change you can make.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.660
In Rose's case, she
had been working

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.220
on these issues
for several years

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.860
before lightning struck her.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.120
One day she was walking around,
and she saw one of these.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.220
She saw a call box like you'd
see at a transit station.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.070
Pretty simple.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.390
Push a button, talk to somebody
on the other end of the line,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.520
ask a question, or
make a complaint,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.640
get your problem solved.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.420
And Rose saw this,
and she realized

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.100
that this problem that had
been in the back of her mind

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.990
for so long-- how do you get
the power of the Internet

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.760
and bring it to the
world's poorest one

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.760
billion people-- that might
actually be how to do it.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.520
There's a lot of
strategies that people

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.960
have talked about, about how to
bring the Internet to the poor.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.040
But they involve a lot of steps.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.370
You have to give them laptops.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.880
You have to keep the laptops
safe from the elements

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.545
or from theft.

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:41.739
You have to make sure that
people are literate so

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:43.030
that they can use the Internet.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.790
You have to make sure they're
literate in a language that

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.040
exists on the Internet.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.560
You can't really take all
of those things for granted.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.070
But Rose realized, with a
simple push of a button,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.490
if you could wire it up so that
people could talk to someone

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.690
who spoke their language on the
other end of the line, that's

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.640
how they could get access
to the full power of what

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.100
the Internet could offer.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.600
So she launched an
initiative called

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.830
Question Box, which
today is operating

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.760
in many cities in
India and Africa.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.980
That was a lightning
bolt in some ways.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.690
In a moment, looking around,
paying attention, she saw it.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.890
But you hardly ever start
with a lightning bolt.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.880
You start by caring.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.030
You start by looking at
your own experiences,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.190
the way that you see
the world uniquely.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.750
If Rose hadn't
been to Nicaragua,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.049
if she hadn't taken
that family trip,

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.289
she probably never would
have dug deeply enough

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.990
to find that solution.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.180
For all of us, we have
things that we've studied,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.850
passions, hobbies, cultural
backgrounds, things

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.650
that we've experienced.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.700
Oftentimes that's
the starting point.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.115
So in the course of researching
"Stand Out," I discovered

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:03.690
that there are five
principal areas of finding

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.230
your breakthrough idea,
five chief ways that,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.970
with all of these thinkers-- you
don't have to do all of these,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.230
but it's a bit of a
smorgasbord, where people

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.910
draw from one or
maybe two, and it

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.070
begins to inspire a cascade of
the kind of breakthrough ideas

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.270
they get known for.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.810
So I wanted to share with you
some of the stories about them

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.120
in hopes that maybe some of
them might be a trigger for you

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.180
to go deeper and develop
further some of the ideas

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.090
that you are nurturing.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.660
This gentleman is
named Eric Schott.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.100
He's actually someone
I used to consult for.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.010
He's the head of the Genomics
Research Institute at Mount

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.260
Sinai Hospital in New York.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.410
What's significant
about Eric, and part

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.560
of why I included
him in "Stand Out,"

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.480
is that today he's actually
one of the most cited

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.540
scientific researchers
in the world.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.420
He's done more than
200 peer reviewed

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.150
papers on almost any
disease imaginable.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.110
The reason he's
been so successful

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.220
in the world of biology,
interestingly enough,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.070
is that he didn't
start in biology.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.300
His initial training was in
math and computer science.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.740
And, as you guys
might appreciate

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.250
more than most, that gave him
a quantitative way of looking

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.460
at the world, a
quantitative orientation,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.370
so that when he entered
biology later in his career

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.200
and he looked at it, he realized
that the power of big data--

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.980
which was just
starting to become

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.410
possible thanks to the rapid
progress in genetic sequencing

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.670
that was happening in the late
'90s and early 2000s-- people

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.650
weren't taking
advantage of that,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.010
because classically
trained biologists

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.610
hadn't needed quantitative
skills in that way.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.310
But because Eric had come
from a different world,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.780
he saw the potential
and dove into it.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.920
And it enabled him to make
breakthroughs much faster

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.190
than almost anyone else.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.930
One of the key elements
when it comes to innovation

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.620
is combining disciplines,
combining perspectives.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.100
It becomes incredibly
hard if you

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.780
are too steeped in
one methodology,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.020
whether it is the methodology
of a discipline, or even

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.170
just the methodology, the
ideology of one company,

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.520
one way of looking at the world.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.720
If all you know is one thing,
it becomes very, very hard

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.130
to tell the difference
between doing something one

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.920
way, because that is the best
way or the only way that works,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.730
and doing it one way
because it's habit.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.670
If you bring different
perspectives together,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.970
you're able to question and
to see what is mere habit

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.050
and what, if the circumstances
have changed in the interim,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:56.930
might be ripe for disruption
and more productive change.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.790
The second thing that I learned
in talking to these thought

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.320
leaders about how to
develop breakthrough ideas

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.810
is the importance
of what I will call

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.730
tackling a worthy challenge.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.380
Now I do a lot a
podcast interviews.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.220
I've done well over 100
of them since the launch

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.020
of "Stand Out," and one of
the questions that they often

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.640
ask in the podcast is, "Who are
the entrepreneurs that people

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.140
admire?"

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.130
And I've listened to
lots of other podcasts,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.120
and so I've heard a
cross-section of answers.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.810
And I'd be curious
what you guys think,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.060
but when other entrepreneurs
and writers are interviewed,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.950
what I hear on these podcasts,
and in write-ups, probably nine

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.180
times out of 10, if they are
citing a living person who

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:51.230
is their greatest inspiration,
they always cite Elon Musk.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.860
And the reason I think they do
that is that he is someone who,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.470
probably more unabashedly the
most, is willing to aim big

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.030
and to think big.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:10.430
Solar power, exploring the
heavens, electric cars.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.570
Those are challenges so big
they get people excited.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.764
That's what fuels
Google, in many ways,

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.680
all the exciting initiatives
that you guys are

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.190
doing with Google X and beyond.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.130
They're projects that
attract the greatest minds.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.740
People want to be
a part of them.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.720
Peter Diamandis, who's a
business author and Silicon

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.620
Valley thinker, has
a saying that I like.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.390
"The fastest way to
make a billion dollars

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.190
is to help a billion people."

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.370
There's a power in a big idea,
because it becomes easier

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.180
to get other people
on board with you,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.960
to get other people excited, to
give you funding, to help you,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.230
to join with you.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.630
You get the talent you need,
and that creates momentum.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.540
This woman here is named
Rita Gunther McGrath.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.930
She's a professor at Columbia.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.900
And a couple of
years ago she wrote

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.930
a book called "The End of
Competitive Advantage."

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.910
And the book has been lauded.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.750
Rita, in fact, has been named
one of the top 10 management

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.550
thinkers in the world.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.250
And part of the reason for
that, and part of the reason

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.950
I talk to her about this,
is that in her book,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.920
she took on one of
the most cherished

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.020
ideas in management
thinking, the idea

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.470
of competitive advantage

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.500
Michael Porter, and
others, for a long time--

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.600
for decades-- the
wisdom in business

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.730
was that you needed,
as a business,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.070
to find a competitive advantage
and then keep it at all costs.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.000
What is your sustainable
competitive advantage?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.300
Rita McGrath was one
of the first thinkers

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.260
to begin to probe that idea in
light of the changes, massively

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.290
disruptive changes that
we've been experiencing

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.430
in our economy.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.770
The fact that in the
pace is picking up.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.380
It's been picking up so
fast that even regular,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.600
everyday customers
are seeing it.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.620
People who carried a BlackBerry
five years ago almost

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.120
certainly don't have
a BlackBerry today.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.330
People who shopped at
Circuit City, people

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.940
who shopped at Borders are
not shopping there today.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.660
We see it with our own eyes.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.410
And Rita was one
of the first people

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.710
to write a detailed
book about what

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.020
to do in that new environment.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:31.210
When sustainable competitive
advantage is gone,

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.890
how do you bake innovation
into everything that you do?

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.500
What's the next step?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.460
That's a question that
people care about.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.960
If you can ride the
wave, if you can

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.560
find an idea that people
are already interested in--

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.600
that people are already talking
about and want an answer t--

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.420
and begin to make a move towards
solving it, the power of that

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.960
will bring people along with
you and help your idea gain

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.780
traction.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.140
Now another strategy,
a third strategy

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.090
that I discovered in the course
of talking to these experts,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.540
is the niche strategy.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.150
This gentleman here
is named Sophal Ear.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.070
Today he's a professor
at Occidental College

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:19.180
in Los Angeles, but he
didn't start out there.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.320
When he was a baby, his mother
rescued him and his four

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.830
siblings, and they
escaped together

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.990
from the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.480
She was able, amazingly, in
the midst of all the killing

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.090
and genocide going on, to
get her entire family out.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.480
And first they were
refugees in France,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.010
and then eventually they
made it to the United States.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:48.740
Sophal grew up and
did well in school,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.370
pursued an academic
career, and decided

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.570
to become a political scientist.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:59.250
But in academia, as you guys
know, the foundation of Google

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:04.270
is page rank, and where
does page rank come from?

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.700
Well, it was inspired
by academic citations.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.089
The more citations you have,
the better off you are.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.910
And if you are an aspiring young
academic, where the incentives

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.790
are is, you want to write
about a topic that is sexy,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.460
that everyone is talking about,
so that everyone will cite you.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.869
That's the sheer mathematics
of getting jobs in academia.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.450
So if you're a political
economist, what do you study?

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.310
China, maybe, India, Brazil,
some of these burgeoning,

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.750
growing economies.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.560
But Sophal wanted to
do something different.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.380
He wanted to understand
his homeland.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.590
That is why he was
doing what he was doing.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.980
He wanted to
understand it and he

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.580
wanted to find ways to
give back because, he says,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:56.270
I was lucky to get
out of Cambodia alive.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.910
So he became a
Cambodian specialist.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.160
It might seem like the kiss
of death for a young academic.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.650
Cambodia's an interesting place,
but it's certainly not yet

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.410
a superpower.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.310
But what Sophal's
example shows, and part

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.950
of why I wanted to include
him in "Stand Out,"

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.520
is that sometimes,
counterintuitively,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.050
the narrower you go at first,
if you keep the orientation

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:29.180
that the first door you enter
isn't the last door-- it's just

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.900
a hallway, and there are
doors off of it-- if that's

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.580
how you begin thinking about
your professional life,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.610
you can go in a lot of
surprising and powerful

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.140
directions.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.280
Sophal wrote his dissertation
about foreign aid in Cambodia,

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.080
and so he developed an expertise
in foreign aid generally.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.215
That was great, but
perhaps more surprising

00:18:51.215 --> 00:18:53.340
is the fact that one of
the things that he ended up

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.140
studying in the course
of studying Cambodia

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.260
was livestock.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.250
He had to write a paper
because his adviser was

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.452
advising an agricultural
commission for the UN.

00:19:05.452 --> 00:19:09.730
It might seem pretty random,
but when the bird flu epidemic

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.190
struck, it turned
out that Sophal

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.190
was one of the few experts
operating in America

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.710
who actually had deep
familiarity with southeast

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.900
Asian livestock practices.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.610
And he became a noted
expert on avian flu.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.850
In fact, starting
again with Cambodia,

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.975
Sophal was able to give a
very popular Ted talk-- which,

00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:33.440
if you guys haven't seen
it, I recommend it--

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.780
about criminal justice.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.140
And his entry point was
the Khmer Rouge tribunals.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.020
You start with Cambodia, but
you end up with the world.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.810
If you can establish
an expertise

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.110
in a narrow enough
area-- there's

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:55.200
a phenomenon in psychology
known as the halo effect,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.420
and essentially what
it says is that if you

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.060
come to be recognized as
having expertise for one thing,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.230
you will be viewed,
in general, by people

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.880
as talented and smart and good.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.310
This is why we
get the phenomenon

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.700
of actors who get
to be politicians,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:18.550
or business leaders who get
to move into other fields.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.670
It's because people generalize.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.170
And so if you are able to
own a niche and go deep,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.860
that gives you a powerful
base, a powerful toehold

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.996
to expand out and develop
your brand as someone

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:33.120
who's really knowledgeable.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.510
Another area-- which I
think often gets overlooked,

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.880
but I think, particularly
in a place like Google,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.950
can be really powerful-- is
research, doing research.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.520
When I talk to people
sometimes, when

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.990
I'm advising businesses and
professionals about this,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.580
they say, oh, that's great.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.540
Sure, of course
research can be helpful.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.540
But I don't have time
to do a doctorate,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.490
or I don't have the money
to do a national survey.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:01.200
Of course.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.960
I mean, those things are great.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.770
But research, even
on small levels,

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.940
can be incredibly useful
and powerful as a tool.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.540
It could be case studies.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.660
It could be reviews.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.390
It could be white papers.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.070
It could be somehow just
going deep to provide

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.360
some kind of quantitative new
information, or qualitative,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.710
for that matter.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.160
And my favorite example of
this is this gentleman here.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.200
His name is Michael Waxenberg.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.040
And Michael, I discovered,
was an IT manager

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.050
for a financial
services company.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:39.960
That was his job.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.060
It was and is his job.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.220
But completely
inadvertently, he was

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.870
able to develop a really
lucrative and enjoyable

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.860
sideline for himself.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.990
It all started
about 15 years ago.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.360
He was living in New York
City with his family,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.110
and he had just gotten
the announcement

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.750
that his condo, the apartment
that he was living in,

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.520
was going to be condo-ized.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.560
And he had to make a decision
about whether his family would

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.770
buy their unit.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.090
So Michael, he was
a data-driven guy.

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.210
He wanted to make a good
decision about this.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.960
So he started going to open
houses and visiting them.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.650
That's not very different
than what you or I might do.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.450
But what he did do that
was very different was,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.020
he started writing
reviews of the properties

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.090
that he visited, not quick,
one-line, "This place is great,

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.650
this place sucks."

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.090
Really detailed reviews.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.900
It started out more
for his own benefit

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.660
than anything, just so he
could keep them straight.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.830
But instead of keeping that
information to himself,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.230
he posted it publicly
on a real estate

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.250
website called Street Easy.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.320
And as a result, as he
posted more and more, he

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.990
started getting emails off the
website with people saying,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.040
I love your reviews.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.980
They're fantastic.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.390
Will you represent me?"

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.890
And he had to write back and
say, well, thank you so much,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.810
but I'm not a realtor.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.580
And so he started
advising people just

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.390
for fun on the side, but they
couldn't give him any money.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.270
He wasn't licensed.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.140
They'd give him boxes of
chocolates or bottles of wine.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.430
But he couldn't really
do anything with it.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.210
But more and more people
started coming to him.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.730
And eventually a realtor
approached him and said, look,

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.640
you already have a client base.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.860
If you haven't done
this yet, I will sponsor

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.360
you to become a realtor.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.050
And so Michael got his
license, and now, for years,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.740
has been operating, with
no marketing whatsoever,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.590
a side business as a real
estate agent selling houses

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.280
here and there and
having people come to him

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.450
on the strength of his reviews.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:49.460
Now for me, what's critical
here, this didn't cost money.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.370
It took a little time.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:56.070
But it's nothing that
any of us can't do.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.214
Sometimes people think
research, and they

00:23:58.214 --> 00:23:59.630
think it has to
be technical, they

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.390
think it has to be complicated.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:05.990
But whether it's a review
of real estate, whether it's

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.580
writing up and in-depth
report about something,

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.380
we live in a world now, the
Internet world, where everyone

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.250
has an opinion, where, in
fact, half of what you look at

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.344
is someone's opinion
about someone's opinion

00:24:19.344 --> 00:24:21.260
about someone's opinion
about the Kardashians.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.080
What we need more of is facts.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.810
What we need more
of is people who

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:34.000
are doing what Michael did
with thoughtful research,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.290
thoughtful, primary
source research.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.860
That's something that with
a little time and effort,

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.200
any of us can do.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.330
Finally, the fifth
strategy that I discovered

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.070
in the course of
writing "Stand Out"

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.572
was what I call
creating a framework.

00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:51.030
Some of you guys
may know this guy.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.360
He has a lot of devotees.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.240
His name is David
Allen, and he is

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.290
the powerhouse behind Getting
Things Done, the productivity

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.780
system.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.480
Now part of what I would argue
makes David Allen and Getting

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.960
Things Done so popular, so
powerful, is the fact that just

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.660
about everybody these days has
some kind of productivity tip

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.710
about, oh, do this with your
inbox, or do that with your

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.540
To Do list.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.020
David Allen has a system.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.630
He has a thorough system
that helps you understand

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.670
and explain not just,
here's what to do now,

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.550
but to put productivity
into context.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.410
We often think, oh, people have
been doing this for decades.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.970
People have been doing
this for hundreds of years.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.360
Everything that should have
been said has been said.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.400
But not really.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.700
It wasn't until 30 years
ago that Robert Cialdini

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.650
developed the six principles
of influence and persuasion.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.950
People have been
studying persuasion

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.750
from the beginning of time.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.770
I mean, you look back
hundreds of years,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.020
you see Machiavellis'
"The Prince."

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.290
People care about what
it takes to persuade

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.500
someone of something.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.940
But Robert Cialdini, a
great, eminent researcher

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.890
from Arizona State University,
was able to be the first person

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.250
to say, you know what?

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.140
When it comes to
influence and persuasion,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.810
there's actually only
six ways to do it.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.420
Here's what they are.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.670
And it turned out
that was so helpful,

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.670
that was so instructive, almost
any time now that influence

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.250
and persuasion is
mentioned, Robert Cialdini

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.010
is mentioned along with it.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.595
Now, with David Allen,
any time somebody

00:26:39.595 --> 00:26:41.970
says, oh, I'm so stressed out,
I have way too many emails

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.640
to respond to, people
say, have you thought

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.460
about Getting Things Done?

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.860
If you can create an
explanatory framework--

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.130
whether it's Maslow's
hierarchy of needs

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.050
or Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's
five stages of grief,

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.560
anything like that--
those are famous examples,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.030
but even on the
microscopic level,

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.140
if you can create structures
that help people understand

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.840
a task better, a job
better, a field better,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.000
that can be enormously powerful.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.180
In fact, going a
little meta, that's

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.520
what I'm trying to
do with "Stand Out,"

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.410
is to try to help explain
the strategies of how

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.280
to become a recognized
expert in your field.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.280
But of course, coming
up with the idea

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.420
is only half the battle.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.820
It's only the first step.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.630
And so I wanted to
just touch briefly

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.150
on this question
of how do you build

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.760
a following around your idea?

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.850
How do you get it known?

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:42.560
How do you get it
recognized by other people?

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.030
I'll argue, based on
the research that I

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.110
did interviewing these
top thought leaders,

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:50.750
that it is a three-step
process to share

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.780
your idea with the
world and really

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.960
begin to have it gain momentum
and be fully recognized.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.180
The first step is building
your network, the second step,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.810
building your audience, the
third, building your community.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.690
I'll tackle them in turn.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.960
This woman is Kari Anderson.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.360
And I profiled
her in "Stand Out"

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.370
as kind of the exemplar
of building your network,

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.840
because she had-- I've known
her for a number of years,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.710
but it actually
wasn't until I started

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.000
talking to her for this
book that I discovered

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.120
the story that she had that
I thought was so remarkable,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.050
I knew I had to share it.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.560
Kari, it turns out,
used to be a journalist.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.700
And in 1989 she created a
kind of mastermind group

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.620
of fellow journalists, where
they would get together

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.910
monthly, trade ideas about
stories, about the profession,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.880
about how to do
their jobs better.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.020
And it was so powerful for her,
it was such a good experience,

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.550
such a good learning experience,
that a few years later,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.910
when she had shifted over to
become a professional speaker,

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:57.340
she started a second
mastermind group, in 1994,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.170
of fellow speakers to do the
same thing, just half a dozen

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.330
or so people meeting once
a month to trade ideas.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.210
Now a lot of people do
with something like that.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.800
But what I thought
was amazing was

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.870
that it turns out Kari is still
meeting with these groups.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.690
20 and 25 years later,
she's meeting monthly

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.180
with the same people.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.700
And she says that
this has actually

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.800
been one of the most singular
professional experiences

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.690
of her life.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.060
Now the moral of
the story is not

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.940
that we all need to start
mastermind groups that

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.310
last a quarter
century, although I'm

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.360
sure it would be beneficial.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.350
But what I take
from her experience

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.450
is that the most
important thing, the most

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.040
important step-- and I
heard this again and again

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.450
from the thought leaders
that I profiled-- you have

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.470
to start with a base of people.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.170
You have to start with a small
base of trusted colleagues

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.660
that you respect and listen
to and have honest connections

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.940
with, so that they
aren't afraid to tell you

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.130
when your idea is
amazing, and they

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.140
aren't afraid to tell you
when your idea is bad,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.690
so that you can refine it.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.120
And by the time you
share it with the world,

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.280
by the time you begin
building a broader audience,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.530
it's in as good a shape
is it can possibly be.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:23.160
Too few of us have this,
because we're responding

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.840
to stimuli all day long.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.470
Maybe we need to listen to
David Allen a little bit more,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.800
because for a lot of us,
the people we hang out with,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.884
the people we spend time with,
it's the people who email us.

00:30:33.884 --> 00:30:35.050
Who do you have coffee with?

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.090
Who do you have lunch with?

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:36.850
Well, guess what?

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.100
For a lot of us,
it's whoever asks.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.910
That's not how it should be.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.520
We need to be more
deliberate about thinking

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.720
through, who are the
three people, the five

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.870
people, the eight people that
we most want to be spending time

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.110
with, the people that we want
to learn from, the people

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.280
we truly respect and
who raise our game?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.460
If we can be proactive about
spending time with them,

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.100
that is one of the most
important career moves

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.900
that we can make,
because they can

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.230
provide us with the insights
and support that we need.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.640
That's the first step.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.840
The second step, of course--
because if an idea is going

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.020
to spread, it can't
just be with people

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:21.730
you know-- the second step
is building your audience.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.120
And fortunately these days,
we have more ability than ever

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.760
to do something like that.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.810
We are able to blog about
it, to give speeches

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.980
like this about it.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.970
We can Tweet, we
can go on Pinterest,

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.030
we can share it on social
media, we can do webinars,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.600
we can have podcasts.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.230
There's a million
ways of spreading it.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.780
But still we have
a lot of people

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.450
who are shy about
standing out, people

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.380
who are nervous about
sharing their ideas for fear

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.710
that they might be shot down.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.230
But first of all, if you have
this trusted group of advisers

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.510
who have given
you feedback, then

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.930
by the time your idea reaches
the place where you're

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.670
able to begin sharing
it with the world,

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.421
you've already had some
smart eyes looking at it.

00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:11.920
There's already a
pretty good chance

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.560
that your idea has
some merit to it.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.370
But really the way that
I think about this--

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.750
and I take the image
from a conversation I

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.600
had with a thinker named John
Hegel from Deloitte Center

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.100
for the Edge.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.380
He said that putting
your ideas out there,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.290
whether it's blogging or
using some other method,

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.600
it's like putting a light out.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.570
It's like sharing a
beacon and putting it out

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:44.390
there so that like minded people
can see it and come to you.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.350
In this noisy,
crowded world, we have

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.350
to make ourselves discoverable.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.480
There are-- with seven
billion people in the world,

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.090
there are people who care about
the things that you care about.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.350
There are people who see the
world the same way that you do.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.650
There are people
who need your ideas.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.830
But it's loud.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.240
There's a lot of
material out there.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.020
They have to be
able to find you,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.370
and they can't do
it unless we're

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.260
willing to step up
and share our ideas.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.770
And it could be something
as simple as putting out

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:23.290
a blog post on LinkedIn in
or starting a Twitter account

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.540
where you don't even have to
put out your own ideas at first.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.640
It can just be
curating what you think

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.470
is interesting around
subjects you care about.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.810
But it's beginning to find
a way to put the pings out

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:41.320
into the universe, to see
if you get an echo back.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.890
Now we're all busy.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.790
And one of the challenges-- I
hear this talking to people all

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.490
the time-- is, OK,
Dorie, that's great,

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.390
but how do I have time
to create content, or be

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.160
active on social media,
or any of these things

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.160
when I have a crazy
job and I'm busy

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.800
and I'm being stretched
too thin anyway?

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.590
And I respect that.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.620
I think that it's true for
most of us, if not all of us.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.342
I think the key
here, and something

00:34:07.342 --> 00:34:08.800
that I want to
highlight, something

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.510
that I talk about in "Stand
Out," is the power of leverage.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.150
Some of you may
recognize this guy.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.620
He's fairly well
known in the tech

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:21.010
space, Robert Scoble, well-known
opinion leader in technology.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.130
And when I interviewed
Robert for this book,

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:25.980
he told me something
interesting.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.870
He's somebody who gets hundreds,
if not thousands, of emails

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.370
a day.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.310
He's constantly being
contacted by startups

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.770
that would like to talk
to him or get his advice

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.969
or have him feature
them in some forum.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:42.100
And what he says,
what he told me,

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.400
is that when someone
asks him a question,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.420
when they email him a question,
he writes back and he says,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.659
I would be happy to answer your
question, but not on email.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.530
What he tells them
instead is that they

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.960
should post their question on
Quora, the question and answer

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.580
website, and that he
will answer it there.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.450
And the reason he
says he does it

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.040
is that, he says, if I
email someone the answer,

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.360
I've helped one person.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.110
But if I put the
answer on the Internet,

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:19.800
I'm able to help five people
or 50 people or 500 people.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.510
That's how we need
to start thinking.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.890
All of us have
too many meetings.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.480
All of us suffer
from too little time.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.300
If we can begin to
think strategically

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.640
about how we can leverage our
impact, leverage our ideas,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.260
share them with more people
with the same amount of effort,

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.360
that's what it's going to take
to enable our ideas to really

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.980
grow and spread.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.550
Finally, what I discovered
in the course of researching

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.780
"Stand Out," is that when
you start with building

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.030
your network, you
start small, you

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.150
start with this
close-knit, trusted group,

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.980
you move to building your
audience, going one to many,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.750
talking to a larger group.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.930
Those are all important steps.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.100
But when an idea
fully takes shape,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.080
when it begins to
grow to a level

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.950
where things are
happening on its own,

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.830
where the dominoes
are falling, what

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.740
happens in that moment is
that your audience, which

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.820
has been listening to you,
starts talking to each other.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.940
And that is the moment where an
audience becomes a community.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.390
So one example,
perhaps, near and dear

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.410
to some of your tech
hearts, "The Lean Startup."

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.360
This is Eric Ries, the
author of that book,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.830
bestseller a couple
of years ago.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:45.940
Today there are more than
750,000 people worldwide

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.710
who are registered for
Lean Startup meetup groups.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.000
That's more people,
certainly, than Eric Ries

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.480
could address in a room,
maybe even in a year,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.480
maybe even in a lifetime.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.380
It's a huge number of
people who are voluntarily

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.510
organizing around that idea.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.210
And what I discovered
in the course of writing

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.220
and researching "Stand
Out," is that if you

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.710
want your idea to go viral,
if you want your audience

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.620
members to start talking
to each other about them

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.600
and forming a community
around your idea,

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.780
two things need to happen.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.580
There's a technical element.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.290
You want to try to find a way
to make it easy for people

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.550
to talk to each other.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.220
Maybe it's by having a
conference like The Lean

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.240
Startup does every year.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.600
Maybe it's by having meetup
groups where people can

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.650
get together around the world.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.710
Eric Ries will
sometimes call in.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.290
He'll do Skype calls with new
chapters to encourage them.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.650
Maybe it's creating an
online message board,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:49.220
or a Google Groups, or some
form of online discussion,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.510
of Facebook page,
whatever it is,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.160
but some way that people can
be in touch with each other

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:58.100
directly and have those
conversations without you,

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.120
because an idea will always
spread farther if you're not

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.510
the only one saying it.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.710
But that's the
technical element.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:11.390
Even more than the technical
is the philosophical.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.870
If your idea is really going
to spread, from the beginning,

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.480
something important needs
to be baked into your idea.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.600
And that is, it
has to have value

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.660
for people other than yourself.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.630
The reason that people
are going to spread ideas

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.530
is that they feel that it's
relevant to their own lives.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:32.970
They see themselves in it.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.050
They feel that it's helpful.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.560
For Eric Ries, it's not about
supporting him or making

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.350
his book a bestseller.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.000
That's nice, but what
people care about

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.350
is making it less likely that
their startup is going to fail.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.840
They're having
these conversations

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.290
because they want to
be more successful,

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.590
and they view that as a tool.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.120
If your idea has utility
for other people,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.320
if other people can see in it a
way to better their own lives,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.520
they want to share that
message, and they're

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.980
going to be excited to do so.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.130
And that is how you
can build a movement.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:15.400
In today's society,
moving faster than ever,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.710
it is increasingly
critical to stand out.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:24.020
In fact, standing out
is no longer optional.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:28.580
We need to find ways
to make an impact.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.810
In an Internet-driven society,
there's a race to the bottom.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.930
People are being commoditized.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.340
They're looking for the
lowest price option.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:45.080
And we need to give employers
and customers a reason

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.150
to choose us specifically.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.024
We have to find a
way to stand out.

00:39:51.024 --> 00:39:52.690
It doesn't mean that
every single person

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.730
has to be a world
expert in something.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:01.120
But it does mean that,
whether it's in our company,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.370
or in our department,
or in our community,

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.930
it's increasingly
essential for us

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:10.790
to ask, what can I do
that no one else can do?

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.010
What can I do better
than anyone else?

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.510
How can I bring my
unique experiences

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:22.630
to bear on this problem
or on this challenge?

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.480
We used to live in a world
where what mattered most

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.240
was how you were similar
to everybody else.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.610
Did you think the same way?

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.670
Did you toe the company line?

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.720
What matters most today is
the differences you bring

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.010
and the fact that you do
see the world differently

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.390
than everyone else.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.897
That's the power
of standing out.

00:40:43.897 --> 00:40:44.730
Thank you very much.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.420
Anyway, now that I know
that there actually

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.230
is time for questions,
I would love

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:00.135
to take any of your comments,
if you would like to have them.

00:41:00.135 --> 00:41:00.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.670
You talked about how
having a broad experience

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.814
can help you come up with
new and interesting ideas.

00:41:08.814 --> 00:41:10.980
But you also talked about
finding a niche and diving

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.480
deep.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.697
How do you sort of
balance those two aspects?

00:41:13.697 --> 00:41:15.030
DORIE CLARK: Fantastic question.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.990
How do you balance
the distinction

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.060
between going broad and drawing
from all kinds of experiences,

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.310
and also niching down.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.030
So number one, you don't
necessarily have to do both.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.675
You could choose
either approach,

00:41:27.675 --> 00:41:30.160
and either one could
be a winning approach.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.270
But let's say you
wanted to do them both.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.340
So I'm going to
make up an example.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:42.750
Let's say you work at Google,
and you have a special passion.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.390
All your life you have been a
really serious jazz musician,

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.320
and that's something that's
pretty distinct from everyone

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.050
else here, let's pretend.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.240
So if that's the
case, that would

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.320
be drawing in those things,
what can you do to niche down?

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.816
Let's say you decide-- I
mean, I know within Google,

00:42:02.816 --> 00:42:04.190
one of the great
things that I've

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.990
heard from the many friends that
I have working in the company,

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.700
is that there's a
lot of opportunity

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.000
for people to move
around into different job

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.310
roles, different offices
in a lot of ways.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.797
After rotations,
in certain areas,

00:42:16.797 --> 00:42:18.630
you can sort of raise
your hand and say hey,

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.850
I'm interested in
moving over here.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.230
Maybe, because of
this background,

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:28.250
you have decided that there's a
particular niche that you might

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.000
be able to dive
deep on, that you

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.870
have a special relationship to.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.870
Let's say wearable
technology for musicians,

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.790
and how that could improve the
sonic experience if they're

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.880
wearing some whatever whatever.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.130
And I don't know enough about
either technology or music

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.300
to be able to get more
specific than that.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.170
But it's by bringing together
the different elements

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.430
of what excites you
and what's different,

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.960
where, because you're doing
this digging and exploration,

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.640
you can start to see, in the
process of looking into it,

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.820
where there might be elements
that could be helpful.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.220
You could do the same thing with
running or sports or whatever.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:14.000
But there's places
that you can go deep,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.140
and because you have
ties to that community

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.140
and a special understanding
as a practitioner,

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.140
you have immediately
more credibility,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.510
and probably more
knowledge starting

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.630
in on it, that can give you an
advantage when you niche down.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.200
Did that answer your question?

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:29.700
Great.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.360
Thank you.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.303
Hi.

00:43:31.303 --> 00:43:32.250
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.610
So how do you avoid
the selection bias that

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.500
comes with just looking at
people who succeeded, and then

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.070
maybe something that
most of them did

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.820
is actually a thing
that most of the time

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.870
doesn't work well for
the people that do it,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.203
but you're not looking at the
people who didn't succeed,

00:43:48.203 --> 00:43:50.857
so you don't know-- how
do you avoid that issue?

00:43:50.857 --> 00:43:52.190
DORIE CLARK: Fantastic question.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:54.960
You don't, is my answer.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.660
One of my goals is, I
actually started my career

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.190
as a journalist, and so
my ambition from the start

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.960
was to go deep and to tell
interesting qualitative

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.420
stories about the people who
are the most successful today.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:16.180
I agree with you entirely that a
cross-sectional study of people

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.850
who have succeeded,
people who have failed,

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.680
you know, the sort of
big picture, big data,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.430
even-- maybe we can
get Eric Schott on it--

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:28.750
look at success and failure
today in a variety of fields

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.200
would be a really interesting
and worthy problem to tackle.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.140
It was not the problem
that I tackled, however.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:40.250
For me, I was really interested
in going deep and having

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.440
a more qualitative view of some
of the people that I think,

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.190
personally, are
pretty interesting.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.430
If any of you guys follow
business literature,

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.790
I spoke with Dan
Pink, with Tom Peters,

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.590
with Robert Cialdini
with David Allen,

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.300
as I mentioned, with Seth Godin.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.760
So they were pretty cool folks.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.860
And then in other fields, I
also drew from them as well.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.440
But great point.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.350
Absolutely.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.300
I was mostly trying to
tell a different story.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.389
Yes.

00:45:11.389 --> 00:45:11.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.250
Thanks for your talk.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.540
And a lot of the factors
that you point out I

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:21.220
can sort of see in play when I
look at some successful people.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.070
But I'm interested
in some factors that

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.610
also seem to often pop up
that you didn't mention,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:27.780
and curious where
you fit them in,

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.340
things that I often see pop up.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.610
The role of luck.

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.860
You mentioned with a
couple of your people

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.700
that oh, all of a
sudden, out of the blue,

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.384
there was the avian flu, and
then bang, he was a superstar.

00:45:38.384 --> 00:45:39.550
So there's the role of luck.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.910
There's the role of not
just your social network,

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.050
but having the right people
in your social network,

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.800
the powerful people,
the ones who actually

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.800
make the key decisions.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.740
And finally, there
is this dynamic

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.374
that everybody else is
trying to stand out, too,

00:45:53.374 --> 00:45:55.790
and so you're sort of in a sea
of competition of everybody

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.410
trying to stand out, which
you sort of alluded to.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.720
But beyond the general
advice, how do you

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.170
pop out to the top of that?

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.110
So a lot of factors at play.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:05.861
What do you think?

00:46:05.861 --> 00:46:06.818
DORIE CLARK: Fantastic.

00:46:06.818 --> 00:46:07.470
I love it.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.120
So interestingly
enough, I actually

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.410
have nearly a whole chapter on
the role of luck in the book.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.260
So I hope you've been
able to grab a copy.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.640
But I'll tell you guys
briefly, luck is actually

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.300
one of the more interesting
elements of this,

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.640
and one that oftentimes I
actually close the talk with.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.010
So here in Cambridge,
actually, very close to here,

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:34.450
there's a venture capital
firm called Cue Ball Partners.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.590
It's run by a guy named Anthony
Chan and some of his partners.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.220
A few years ago they wrote a
book called "Heart, Smarts,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.930
Guts, and Luck."

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.300
It came out, actually, from
Harvard Business Review

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.950
Press, which published my
first book, "Reinventing You."

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.300
And interestingly
enough, so they

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.380
did a pretty wide-ranging
study of entrepreneurs

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.660
who'd been successful.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.300
And they broke people down
into four personality types,

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:01.800
actually.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.341
And you can even go
to their website.

00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:05.660
They have something called
the EAT, the Entrepreneurial

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.180
Assessment Test, which
is kind of fun to take.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.260
And it shows you what your
dominant personality type is.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.490
The first three, to me, make
fairly intuitive sense, right?

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.530
Hearts driven, smarts
driven, guts driven.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.030
We can all imagine
scenarios where

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.260
people are able to succeed
because of those qualities.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.410
The one that was a little
bit more mystifying

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.160
was luck driven.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.910
What does it even mean?

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.280
But it turns out if you peel
it back, interestingly enough,

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.510
the research begins to
show, of course luck

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:41.740
is something we can only
attribute post facto, right?

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.890
You don't know in the moment
that something is lucky.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.640
It's kind of like, oh,
after it plays out,

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.070
then it becomes lucky.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.780
What does it look like
in the moment, however?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.160
It turns out that
lucky entrepreneurs,

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.970
or top executives, are
people who actually

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.700
have a different personality
type than the other types

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.550
of successful professionals.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.840
They are typically
more laid back,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.360
and they exhibit, in large
quantities, two really

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.260
important attributes
that all of us

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:16.910
can develop more
of in our lives.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:20.660
One is curiosity, and
the other is humility.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.240
And the reason that this plays
in is, so many of the people,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.885
so many of the
successful professionals

00:48:25.885 --> 00:48:29.840
that they profiled,
they have a mission.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.340
Part of what makes
them successful

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.430
is they're so focused, they say,
I'm going to go to this meeting

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.742
and I'm going to meet the
head of marketing for Ford.

00:48:37.742 --> 00:48:39.200
Or I'm going to go
to this meeting,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.908
and I'm going to meet
venture capitalists

00:48:40.908 --> 00:48:44.430
who will give me my Series A
funding, or whatever it is.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.280
But they have this
idea in their head,

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.990
and if they don't see
things that loo like that,

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:56.530
they will barrel through,
whereas a lucky entrepreneur

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.120
or executive is
someone who is far more

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.160
willing to just sit back and
say, oh, this person seems

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.660
interesting.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.240
I'll talk to them.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.090
And they wait, and they
see how it plays out,

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.740
and they have the conversation.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.360
And they are curious
enough to want

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.840
to learn about that person,
and they are humble enough

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.450
to realize that
they have something

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.680
to learn from that person.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.110
And years later, that is what
plays out and turns to luck.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.300
So I think that that's
one of the coolest things

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.720
that I learned from that
book and from that research.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.970
Also, Richard Wiseman
is a psychologist

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.990
who's done a lot of
research into luck.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.470
One suggestion
that he has, which

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:39.140
you guys can apply
if you're interested,

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.950
there's a factor that comes into
play with almost all humans,

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:47.840
which is that we
really tend to be drawn

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.570
to people who are like us.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:51.340
This is natural.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.090
It's not necessarily good
in terms of diversity

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.660
or innovation or whatever.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.090
And so Richard Wiseman
actually talked about somebody

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.570
that he interviewed.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.430
And this guy, the way
that he broke out of that

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.140
is that he made a
rule for himself,

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.740
if he was going to a networking
event or a cocktail party,

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.490
that he would pick
a color in advance,

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.010
and he would only talk to people
wearing that color so that he

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:16.200
would be forced to choose
different people than he might

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.890
normally to talk to.

00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.390
And that's a way to
increase our luck.

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:25.090
So I think it's a
really rich topic.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.380
Let's talk more afterwards
about your other points,

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.280
but I love them.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.430
Really good questions.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.337
Ma'am, what was your
question or comment?

00:50:31.337 --> 00:50:33.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for this talk.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.744
It's really great information.

00:50:34.744 --> 00:50:36.660
So I'm just following
up on something you just

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.610
said about being
flexible and open,

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.640
which is kind of the natural
way that I approach things.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.610
But when you first said
earlier about being deliberate,

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.700
I said, uh, that's what
I need to introduce.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.950
So how do you reconcile being
flexible and seeing what's

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.430
out there, and allowing yourself
to see the possibilities

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:57.160
with being deliberate
and actually moving

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.870
in the direction
that you want to go?

00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:59.620
DORIE CLARK: Yeah.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.680
So it's an important question.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.070
And in many ways, it's similar
to the going wide versus going

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.640
narrow.

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.050
I would say in
general, we can play

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:14.120
choose to play to our strengths,
whatever our strength is.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.550
However, there is a way
to bring them together.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.990
I mean, certainly in terms of
a lot of the career research

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.260
that I do, one piece
of advice that I

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:26.590
would give to the
professionals that I

00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:28.840
counsel and work with in
my consulting business,

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.360
is, have a plan.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.340
But treat it as a hypothesis.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.910
It's something that
you're moving toward so

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.990
that you are moving
towards something,

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.300
so that you have some
degree of forward momentum.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.780
But don't allow
it to lock you in.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.780
If you see something over
to the side that is better,

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.320
or is more interesting, or is
something that you literally

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.340
just could not have predicted
because you couldn't have even

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:55.430
seen it until you reached the
halfway point in your march

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.660
toward that new thing, then
feel free to veer off and go

00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.740
do that.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.220
But always have something
that at least provisionally

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.030
you're working
toward, so that you're

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.840
able to enjoy the benefits
of forward momentum

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.555
and seeing things
from new vistas

00:52:09.555 --> 00:52:12.273
that you previously
wouldn't have been able to.

00:52:12.273 --> 00:52:13.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.110
DORIE CLARK: Thank you.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:22.380
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about doing, promoting

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:27.110
an idea on your own like
through a startup versus taking

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.760
advantage of the momentum of
being at a place like Google.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.718
So, say if you think
about, like, I don't know,

00:52:31.718 --> 00:52:32.930
self-driving cars.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:37.187
The reason why Google can make
such awesome self-driving cars,

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:39.395
as compared to, say, the
ones that you see prototyped

00:52:39.395 --> 00:52:42.740
in academia, is because
Google just has more data,

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.634
and they have more people,
and they have more resources,

00:52:45.634 --> 00:52:47.300
and they have more
of everything, right?

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.110
And infrastructure.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:53.660
And so if have
this awesome idea,

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.700
did you see anything about
whether it makes more

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.140
sense for me to try to build
up a startup on my own,

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.740
and own the idea to
give it credibility

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.490
so that then I can make it into
something huge, or sell it?

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:09.050
Or is it more practical
to try to pitch it

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.700
to a company earlier?

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.160
But then how do you
build credibility

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.890
around the idea instead of
having somebody just toss it

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.110
on the back burner?

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.360
So I guess going on
your own versus working

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.720
with a big company.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:23.470
DORIE CLARK: Yeah.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:24.530
Really important.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.780
So there's actually a
couple of questions at play.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.680
One is the personal
branding question.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.720
How do you get known
and get credibility

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.030
as being the driving force
behind a certain idea?

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.570
And then the other
is the question of,

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.660
where is the best home
for that idea in terms

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.180
of operationalizing
it, and actually making

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.240
sure that it has the resources
necessary to be successful.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:56.950
In the Silicon Valley ecosystem,
acqui-hires are a big thing

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:01.360
now, where companies,
as you guys well know,

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.450
large companies will
snap up a smaller company

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.240
because they want the
development talent.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.050
And they will shutter the
projects with impunity,

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:12.820
and say, OK, fellas, now
you're working on this.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.700
And that's a real thing.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.860
So I think that in a
technical sense, about what

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.120
is necessary for the
success of an idea,

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.740
I think that it's important
to keep in mind a few things.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.860
Number one, is it feasible
to do the idea on your own?

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.090
Sometimes, literally,
it's not, because you

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:34.800
need to have data or
access to other resources

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.930
that only a big
company could provide.

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.140
If you realize that in
three months, or six months,

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:43.470
or a year, you were going to be
hitting a wall that you can't

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.160
surmount because you literally
don't have access to the tools

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.890
you need, then it probably
does fundamentally

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.050
need to be done within the
confines of a larger system.

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:58.450
If you do decide to
partner with a company,

00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:59.910
then it's a question
of making sure

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.760
that you have contracts
and legal protections,

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.910
as much as you possibly can,
that validate this idea is not

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:09.990
going to be shuttered,
and that you have ways

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:13.050
of protecting it and keeping
it as an ongoing concern,

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.430
perhaps with a sort
of special mandate.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.140
When it comes to
your personal brand,

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.640
one of the things
that I'll advise--

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.300
and I'll just wrap up because
we're getting the curtain

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:28.570
warning here momentarily-- but
one of the things that I think

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.360
is important for all
of us to be aware of

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:36.590
is the amazing resource
that is content creation.

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.090
Sometimes people come to me
and they say, well, you know,

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:40.510
I have these great ideas.

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.280
But I don't want to talk
about them because someone

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.240
might steal them.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.660
And you hear this
a lot from people.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.860
And so my asterisk
on this, OK, sure.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:54.490
If you have this amazing,
patentable engineering

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.720
innovation, great.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.700
Go patent it, go do that,
go protect that first.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:00.260
But if you have
an idea, and it's

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.660
an idea about the nature
of leadership or something

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.160
like that, you can't patent it.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.947
But it doesn't go anywhere
if you don't talk about it.

00:56:10.947 --> 00:56:13.280
Is there going to be a risk
that someone might steal it?

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.110
Maybe.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:18.390
But I will tell you the very
best insurance against it

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.950
is for you to be everywhere
talking about it, because if I

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.090
came to you and
said, hey, I have

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:27.550
a really great idea for a book
about women's empowerment.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:31.050
It's called "Lean In," you
would laugh in my face,

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.890
and you'd say, I
think that's been

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.610
done by Sheryl Sandberg, Dorie,
and it doesn't go any further.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.010
Everyone knows that's her idea.

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:44.280
And so the antidote to
anyone stealing your ideas,

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.596
or your idea dying, for that
matter, is to get the word out.

00:56:48.596 --> 00:56:50.970
And so I would say if you want
to be known and associated

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.680
for something, go
nuts with blogging,

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.570
with content creation,
being out there,

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:59.140
touting it, so that your name
is almost inextricably entwined

00:56:59.140 --> 00:56:59.660
with it.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.070
And then that way, whether
you get acquired, partner

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.220
with somebody, or not, you're
going to be known as the go

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.640
to person behind that idea.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.010
So thank you so much
for your question.

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.510
Thank you, everybody,
for having me.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:13.770
And have a great day.
