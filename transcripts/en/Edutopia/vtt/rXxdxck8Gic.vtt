00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:10.096
&gt;&gt;Somebody just take that.

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:13.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For most students,
technology is a tool that saves time

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:18.326
and helps them research,
explore, create.

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:19.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Get a little
bit of the tree.

00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:23.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For disabled
students like Susanna Martini,

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.916
technology is all of those
things and much more.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:29.146
It is a lifeline.

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:35.576
&gt;&gt;Susanna: Assistive technology is
the major foundation of my life.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:39.106
Without it I could not
exist as I am today.

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.766
I mean without a computer
I couldn't do my homework.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:43.266
&gt;&gt;Move left one word.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.266
&gt;&gt;Without my chair I
couldn't get around.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.366
Without my cell phone I
couldn't, you know, call for help.

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:51.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Active since she
was born with cerebral palsy,

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:55.666
Susanna refereed soccer matches
from her wheelchair in high school.

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.406
A sophomore at the University

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:01.566
of Washington she uses
voice activated software

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.356
to complete her written assignments.

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:05.766
&gt;&gt;Susanna: Because computers
involved electricity.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.816
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: We all know how
technology has improved

00:01:08.816 --> 00:01:11.066
in the last few years
all sorts of technology.

00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:14.206
What most people don't realize
is that assistive technology,

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:15.796
technology that helps people

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:19.546
with disabilities use computers has
been progressing at the same rate.

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:22.286
&gt;&gt;Susanna: Answer, air pressure
prevents this from happening.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:24.386
Source: Steven Hawking.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.696
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: Even though there's a lot
of technology available for people

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:30.526
with disabilities, it
isn't implemented that much

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.556
in our school systems today and
there are a lot of reasons for that.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.686
One is that people who work
with students with disabilities,

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:40.916
this could be teachers, lab
managers, parents, often aren't aware

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.976
of the technology that
is available for them

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.186
and then technology is not always
included in the planning process.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:49.876
&gt;&gt;Susanna: Back in high
school they didn't understand

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:55.386
that I needed a laptop and I needed
a desk that could raise and lower

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:56.426
and I didn't have those things.

00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:01.346
&gt;&gt;I got a laptop after my mom made
them get me one because she knows how

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:06.356
to get through the red tape but
it's really necessary for anybody

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:09.706
who has a disability to get what
they need assistive technology wise.

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:12.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So the elevator
controls what we call pitch.

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:14.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The University

00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:17.456
of Washington's Disabilities
Opportunities Internet-working

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:22.846
and Technology program or DO-IT helps
students get the technology they need

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.566
and holds summer workshops to
help them prepare for college.

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.176
&gt;&gt;On this one, I agree
that you found the rule.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:32.446
&gt;&gt;Vishal: I use my laptop that
I got from the DO-IT program

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:40.066
and I use on-screen keyboard to type
and to print and to surf the web.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.456
&gt;&gt;Now I'm ready for
a bigger challenge.

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:45.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Vishal Saraiya
was elected President

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:47.306
of the Summit K through
12 student body.

00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:50.216
&gt;&gt;I'm Vishal Saraiya and
I hope you vote for me.

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:52.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And is planning
to attend college next fall.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.396
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: If they have access

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:57.206
to computers they can take their own
notes, they can take their own tests,

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.016
they can write their own
papers, they can use the Internet

00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:01.176
and do their own research.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.476
These are things that they
couldn't do in another way.

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.606
They need to practice
these independent skills

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.446
so that they can move on to
college and on to careers.

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:11.696
&gt;&gt;George: What was your favorite part

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.286
that you learned about--
okay, go ahead.

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:16.576
&gt;&gt;Student: The Northwest Indians.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Studies show that the
earlier children are introduced

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:24.326
to assistive devices the
quicker they master them.

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:25.996
&gt;&gt;Carlos: This morning I was mad.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.816
&gt;&gt;George: Why were you mad, Carlos?

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:31.906
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Because I
didn't want to get

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.886
up in the morning to go to school.

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:35.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So at Redwoods
Heights Elementary

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:39.436
in Oakland California the
learning begins in preschool.

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:43.496
&gt;&gt;George: By introducing
kids to technology early,

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:47.296
it gets them better prepared and
makes it easier down the road

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:51.476
and then they can spend the later
years of their school years focusing

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:54.086
on content material
and the curriculum.

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:54.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Bird.

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:56.876
&gt;&gt;George: Okay, what else?

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:01.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The first task is to
determine the best way for the child

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:05.136
to access a device whether it's
the touch of a finger, a nod,

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:06.876
or the twitch of an eyebrow.

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:09.276
&gt;&gt;George: It took us three
years to figure Adrian out,

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:13.066
he couldn't move any parts of
his body except his eye brow

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:15.936
and so we determined that
that was the switch site

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.866
and then we determined which
type of device would be used.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: First the
device scans the rows.

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.316
And then when he twitches
his eyebrow it begins

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:28.806
to select the column so
row, column scanning.

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:31.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The devices are
personalized with various icons,

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:35.916
phrases and voices and can be
programmed to let children share news

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:37.316
from home with their classmates

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.706
or tell their parents
what they did in school.

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:42.396
&gt;&gt;Student: We are learning
about the solar system.

00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:42.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Where?

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:44.046
Which class?

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:44.676
That's right.

00:04:44.676 --> 00:04:46.866
&gt;&gt;George: Can you name
some of the planets for us?

00:04:47.256 --> 00:04:48.096
&gt;&gt;Student: Mars, Jupiter...

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:51.396
&gt;&gt;George: I think we give something
that's priceless, a voice basically.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:52.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Pluto.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.806
&gt;&gt;George: A lot of our kids are
bright and we give them that power.

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:59.166
Who knows the next one could
be the next great physicist.

00:04:59.796 --> 00:05:02.026
Or next great scientist.

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:05.706
I mean we've got some wonderful
kids with some wonderful minds.

00:05:07.586 --> 00:05:08.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For one student

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:11.976
at Spokane's Mead High
School technology is the key

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.536
to pursuing his passion.

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:19.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lukas Bratcher
loves to play his Euphonium horn

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:27.526
in the school jazz band, concert
band, and even the marching band.

00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:35.606
That Lukas can play anywhere is
a testament to his perseverance

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:38.406
and the support of many people who
help make his playing possible.

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:42.546
It has been an uphill battle ever
since he was born with a condition

00:05:42.546 --> 00:05:45.106
that renders his limbs
nearly useless.

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:51.046
&gt;&gt;Lukas: It's called amyoplasia
arthrogryposis multiplex congenita

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:58.116
and it's throughout my four limbs
and it's basically I have stiffness

00:05:58.116 --> 00:06:00.496
in my joints and some of
my muscles aren't there.

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:02.936
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's another
name for one over sin-theta?

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:03.406
&gt;&gt;Lukas: Cosecant.

00:06:03.406 --> 00:06:04.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Cosecant theta.

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:07.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lukas hasn't let
his disability prevent him

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:09.236
from participating fully at school.

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:12.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's one
over cosine theta.

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:12.486
&gt;&gt;Lukas: Right.

00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:15.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He takes four
advanced placement classes.

00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:18.276
And does his homework on
a laptop without the aid

00:06:18.276 --> 00:06:20.916
of the voice recognition
software the school provided.

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.536
&gt;&gt;Lukas: How about we
move the knight there.

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:26.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lacking manual dexterity,

00:06:26.866 --> 00:06:30.866
Lukas learned to play music his
own special way to the amazement

00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:32.276
of his first band director.

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:36.146
&gt;&gt;Lee: He looked very eager and
excited about being a member

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:40.326
of the band and quite
honestly my thought

00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:44.486
at that time was oh my goodness,
how could this possibly work?

00:06:45.596 --> 00:06:49.056
And as we took the students
through their method book I noticed

00:06:49.056 --> 00:06:52.306
that occasionally he
would play on his horn.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:56.556
His hands were not able to activate
the valves on the instrument

00:06:56.556 --> 00:07:01.086
so it was apparent to me that what
he was doing was just being selective

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:02.796
about the notes that he was playing.

00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:07.026
&gt;&gt;He was willing to just sit there
and just wait for that one note

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:10.656
to come along in the music and
when it came he played it with all

00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:13.986
of his heart and enthusiasm
and capability

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:15.586
to make the best sound that he could.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:19.336
That was enough for him, initially.

00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:23.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But Lukas knew
he could do more and that's

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:25.626
when serendipity led his mother

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:28.146
to the instrument repair
shop of Robin Amend.

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:29.736
&gt;&gt;Robin: I love repairing.

00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:31.036
It's always different.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.486
You're always working on
a different instrument.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.876
There's always different problems.

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:38.206
My grandfather was a
vaudeville musician.

00:07:38.206 --> 00:07:41.216
He lost his arm in a
lumber mill accident.

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:44.236
He put an ad in the Portland
paper asking one-armed people

00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:45.756
if they're interested
in learning music.

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:48.686
He taught them how
to play instruments.

00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:51.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The senior Amend also
patented a device that allowed people

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:56.246
with missing hands to play the piano.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.436
&gt;&gt;Robin: I'd always wished
that I could make something

00:07:59.436 --> 00:08:02.546
that could make a person who had
lost an arm be able to take the place

00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:06.306
of their fingers and then one night
I woke up in the middle of the night

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:09.106
and I realized that
joy sticks aren't just

00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:11.036
for putting electrical
things on screens.

00:08:11.036 --> 00:08:12.866
Joy sticks can do other things.

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:14.436
Joy sticks can do mechanical things.

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:20.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Amend's dream became
a small box with a joy stick

00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:24.876
that triggered solenoids and
operated the valves of a horn.

00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.806
Learning a new way of playing
was exhilarating and frustrating

00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:31.336
for Lukas and just as
he was getting the hang

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:34.386
of playing it, someone took his horn.

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:36.586
&gt;&gt;TV Newscaster: Call Crimecheck
if you have any information.

00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:41.016
&gt;&gt;Kristy: It was stolen in the
morning and by five o'clock

00:08:41.116 --> 00:08:45.506
that same day I was getting
the first call on my cell phone

00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:48.656
from an anonymous person
that said that they wanted

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:53.486
to contribute monetarily to a fund
to either replace it or as a reward

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:56.766
for it and from that point
on it just snowballed

00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:02.496
into this huge wonderful thing where
the community raised 6,000 dollars.

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:04.866
&gt;&gt;Andrew: I wasn't quite
sure where the optimum spot

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:07.156
for the solenoids was going
to be so I want to be able

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:08.266
to have it slide up and down.

00:09:08.906 --> 00:09:11.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The loss of the
first horn became a blessing

00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:14.546
when mechanical engineer
Andrew Coleman joined Amend

00:09:14.546 --> 00:09:17.316
to design a second more
responsive joystick

00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:19.476
and horn which Lukas uses today.

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:24.206
&gt;&gt;Lee: When I heard and
saw Lukas perform recently

00:09:24.206 --> 00:09:32.376
at a concert it reminded
me just how far we've come.

00:09:32.376 --> 00:09:34.736
And through the efforts
of all the people

00:09:34.736 --> 00:09:39.746
that have been supporting him
we caught on to his dream.

00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:42.726
&gt;&gt;Sheryl: Technology has
changed all of our lives,

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:46.936
but for these students
technology truly changes their life

00:09:47.116 --> 00:09:49.506
and the opportunities that
they'll have in the future.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:54.176
&gt;&gt;Susanna: I think assistive
technology is going to allow me major

00:09:54.176 --> 00:09:57.036
in communications and get a
minor in disabilities studies.

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:01.596
I actually want to be a news anchor.

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:05.996
&gt;&gt;I'm hoping to go to
college on a music scholarship

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:09.176
and study music an be a musician.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:12.236
I love to play.

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:15.576
