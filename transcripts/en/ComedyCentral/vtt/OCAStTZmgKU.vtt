Oh, hey.

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:06.873
Uh, yeah, uh...noth--

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.941
It's little a Blu-ray,
Blu-ray disk system.

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:10.576 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Blu-ray disk system, huh?
- Yeah, you know.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.712 align:start position:0%
Yeah, is it worth going
to jail for that?

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.514 align:start position:0%
For a $700 DVD player?

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
Seven hundred dollars?
No, man.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.051 size:84% position:58%
They dropped these down to,
like, 250, 269 right now.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.052 align:start size:69% position:31%
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.053
This is cheap as hell.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.321 align:start position:0%
Now, if I watch
Blu-rays on my tube...

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.589
...is it gonna have letterbox

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.124 align:start position:0%
or is it gonna be full
frame like standard?

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you, wha-what
you asked for was a 16x9...

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.561
- Hey, guys.
- ...or 4x3.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:29.695
- I do not know.
- Hello, officer.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.030
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.799 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What you got there?
- Oh, a little Blu-ray player.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.367 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Blu-ray player.
- Brand-new Blu-ray player.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.835 align:start size:66% position:34%
Oh, a Blu-ray player.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hey, I got a question.
- Yeah.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.206 align:start size:75% position:25%
Do those things play
on plasmas or just CRTs?

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
No, no, these play
on plasma, CRTs, DLPs...

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.945 align:start size:69% position:31%
- He says--
- LCDs.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.213 align:start size:75% position:25%
Any kind of
format you have.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.948 align:start position:0%
How much did you pay
for that one right there?

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.083 align:start size:91% position:9%
- Oh, this one right here?
- Yeah.

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.651 align:start size:91% position:9%
Oh, this was free for me.
I stole it.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.352 align:start position:0%
Uh!

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Hey, junior?
- Yeah?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.723 align:start size:63% position:38%
You still got that
8-track tape player?

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.692 align:start size:97% position:3%
Yeah. I don't think those will
work on a Blu-ray, though.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.461
Oh...[bleep]
