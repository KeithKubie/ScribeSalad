00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And, yes, I don't have trust in this.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The reason is from a 2100 square foot home that's clearly small than this one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the price has decreased. It'd gone down.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Do we believe that in general between a 2100 square foot home and a 2300 square foot home

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the price should go down?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Do we actually believe that in a scatter plot like this the functional relationship between

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
size and cost goes like this?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Or do we instead believe it should go like this?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The deviations from that linear graph is what's  called "noise."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, noise might not be the best term, but it's the term that statisticians use.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It might be that one of them has a great view.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The next one has an old house.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This one has coastal access, which makes it more expensive.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This one really requires a new kitchen.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There might be factors that really effect the house price beyond the size.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But if those factors are unincluded, to a statistician that's called "random noise."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But coming back to my original question, I think we don't believe the red curve.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's  talk about bar charts as one way to alleviate the problem.
