00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.530
Let's look at other 2D
image transformations.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.500
Again, let's look at this simple
equation that we're looking at.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's say I create
the simple equation here,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.962
which basically takes a scale in x and
y directions, Sx and Sy.

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:18.062
And basically what that means is
that this image now would be scaled.

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:20.325
But the parameters Sx and Sy and

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:25.318
they would of course be scaled around
the origin point of the image, 0 and 0.

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:27.810
I mean, there would be a linear
scaling in that direction.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.350
Here is an interesting transformation,
M matrix.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.430
What would happen when I applied this?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.830
If you think about it,
basically what it's going to do,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.590
it's going to flip
the image in one direction.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.090
So basically, what it's going to do is,
when I have the y-axis going this way,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.940
it's going to flip all of
the values on the, this side.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.100
That is the right side of the image,
to the left and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.370
all the left ones to the right.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.100
So basically,
that'll be a mirror operation.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.760
If I put minus 1 on both of them, that
would be a mirror over the origin, so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
basically it will flip both an x,
axis and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.050
the y-axis to generate
a mirror flipped image.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.550
Here is another interesting one which
basically now I put the terms on the two

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.794
off diagonal terms, and
we would refer to this as shear, so

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:14.010
shear in x and shear in y would give
us and image that would be sheared.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.910
That basically would kind of have
the impact of kind of having top row of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.660
the image,
kind of move towards the left.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.920
And, I'm sorry, top part of the image
moving towards to the right and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.990
bottom moving to the left.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.480
We'll show examples of that in a bit,
too.
