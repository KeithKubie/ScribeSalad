at every one of our projects and we're
 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.469
at every one of our projects and we're
going to look for opportunities to put

going to look for opportunities to put
 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.420
going to look for opportunities to put
those on the outside actually if we did

those on the outside actually if we did
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.100
those on the outside actually if we did
it right we'd say we should look for

sources of innovation and that becomes
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.399
sources of innovation and that becomes
part and parcel to this notion of a

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409
part and parcel to this notion of a
 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.129
part and parcel to this notion of a
constant innovation model and so in the

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139
constant innovation model and so in the
 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.259
constant innovation model and so in the
open innovation world these sustainable

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
open innovation world these sustainable
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.539
open innovation world these sustainable
businesses are focused much less on

having to invent every piece of what
they do and much more in creating a

they do and much more in creating a
 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.420
they do and much more in creating a
sustainable structure with which they

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
sustainable structure with which they
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490
sustainable structure with which they
can constantly innovate so when you look

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
can constantly innovate so when you look
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.140
can constantly innovate so when you look
at businesses that are now really

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
at businesses that are now really
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.670
