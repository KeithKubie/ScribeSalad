00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.860
Let’s say you want to become pope, head
of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.950
1 billion faithful.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.060
What requirements must you have for this lofty
position:

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.400
1) Be a catholic and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.720
2) Be a man.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.210
Which seems a little thin… and, while it’s
technically possible for a regular Sunday

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.419
Catholic to become pope, the last time this
happened was essentially never because becoming

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.240
pope isn’t like becoming president, you
can’t just run for office.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.789
Selecting the pope is an inside job and the
men who do it are the cardinals, and while

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.829
in theory they can select any catholic man
to become pope, in practice they prefer to

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.060
elevate one of their own.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.719
The last time a non-cardinal become pope was
more than 600 years ago.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.829
So, while it isn’t an official requirement,
it’s an unofficial, official requirement.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.070
Thus in order to be pope you’ll first need
to be a cardinal and to do that you’ll need

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.519
to start climbing the catholic corporate ladder.*

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.100
Step 1: Become a Priest.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.670
Unlike some churches where you can fill out
a form online and – poof – ordained.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.949
The Catholic Church treats becoming a priest
as a real, you-need-training profession.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.379
So you’re going to require a lot of education:
usually a college degree in Catholic Philosophy

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.130
and then a masters in divinity.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.699
In addition to your educational qualifications,
you must also be:

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160
A man
Unmarried,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.909
Willing to remain celibate forever.†
If you meet these requirements, and have been

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.810
working with the church, then you can be officially
ordained as a priest.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.920
Which basically means you get to run a Catholic
Church, or work with another priest who does.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
But, you want onward and to do that you need
to take the job of the man who just made you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
a priest.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.951
Step 2: Become a Bishop
Bishops are a much more select group: while

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:24.619
there are about 400,000 catholic priests world
wide, there are only about 5,000 bishops.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.869
While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals,
from which they oversee a number of local

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:29.869
churches.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.130
To advance your career you must wait for a
bishop in your area to be forced into retirement

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.561
at age 75 or die sooner than that – freeing
up space for you.

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.979
But you can’t just apply, because there’s
already a secret list of potential bishops

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.130
that’s updated every three years based on
who the current bishops in your area think

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.400
would make a good replacement for one of their
own.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.810
To be on that list, in addition to the obvious
requirement of being a pious person, you should

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.810
also:

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.500
Be least 35 years old
Have been priest for at least five years

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.120
Have a doctorate in theology (or equivalent)
Assuming you’re all these things, your name

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.039
may, or may not be on the secret list.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.340
The local bishops then give that list to the
pope’s ambassador for your country, known

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.930
as the Apostolic Nuncio.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.500
The Nuncio picks three priests from the list,
does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.840
and selects the one he thinks is best.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.480
But it’s not over, because the Nuncio sends
his report to Vatican City and the congress

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.650
of bishops who work there reviewing potential
appointments from around the world.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.379
If the congress of bishops doesn’t like
any of the three candidates, they can tell

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.620
the Nuncio to start over: returning to the
list, picking another three candidates – doing

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.790
more research, more interviews and sending
off the results.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.760
When the congress of bishops is happy with
one of the Nuncio’s candidates that name

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.250
is given to the pope, who can reject the candidate
and start the whole process over.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.730
It shouldn’t be a surprise that from a vacancy
to a bishop’s replacement can take months

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.510
and, on occasion, years.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.290
But assuming that a bishop in your area retired
(or died) at the right time and you were on

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.610
the secret list of good priests and the Nuncio
picked you and you made it through his interview

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.090
and the congress of bishops approved you and
the pope didn’t veto you – poof now you’re

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.090
now a bishop.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
But you’re still not on top.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.130
The penultimate promotion is…

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.800
Step 3: Become a Cardinal.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.269
Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits
to match cardinals are not the bosses of bishops,

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.769
they are bishops, just with an additional
title and additional responsibilities – the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.230
most notable of which is electing the new
pope.‡

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.909
The only way to become a cardinal is to get
to current pope to appoint you as one – and

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.760
of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever
cardinals.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.710
But let’s say your ambition doesn’t go
unnoticed by the pope and he makes you a cardinal

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.569
– now it’s time to play the waiting game
for his death or retirement – and with popes

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.340
death is vastly more likely.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.569
When either happens the cardinals under the
age of 80 are brought to Vatican City where

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.530
they are isolated from the outside world – presumably
by taking away their cell phones and tablets

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.830
and carrier pigeons.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.290
Once sequestered, the election of a new pope
can begin.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.680
These elections are never exactly the same
because the ex-pope leaves instructions on

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.939
how he wants his replacement to be picked,
but in general it works like this: four times

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.879
a day the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel
to vote – to become pope one of them must

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.189
get a 2/3rds majority.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.870
There’s a big dose of musent-be-too-hasty
here as the cardinals don’t just raise their

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.260
hands, or use a modern preferential voting
system, but instead write down one name on

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.319
a piece of paper stand before the alter and
say a long latin phrase, before officially

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.670
casting the ballot.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.860
Once all the cardinals have done this, the
votes are counted and then burned.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.709
This why TV news stations covering the election
of the pope use super-modern-hd-livestreaming

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.180
cameras to look at a chimney.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.299
If the smoke is black, no new pope.

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.170
The high victory threshold, and tediously
slow voting process, is why it takes so long

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.319
to elect a new pope.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.760
It’s usually at least two weeks of voting
four times a day six days a week (with one

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.630
day a week for prayer) but the record length
is three years.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.720
Assuming you, eventually, win the support
of your fellow cardinals, you have one final

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.480
thing to do before becoming pope: pick yourself
a new name.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.850
There is no formal rule, you can name yourself
anything you like but it’s tradition to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.470
take the name of a previous pope.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.010
Upon your acceptance of the job, the final
ballots are burned clean to make the smoke

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.010
white and announce to the world that a new
pope has been selected.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.760
So that’s the career path: be born into
the right half of the population, become one

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.510
of a billion catholics, then one of 400,000
priests, then one of 5,000 bishops, then one

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.560
of 200 cardinals, wait for the current pope
to die or retire, and convince 2/3rds of your

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.050
fellow cardinals to select you as the one,
the only pope.
