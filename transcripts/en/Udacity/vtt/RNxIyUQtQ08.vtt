00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's my answer, so I took all the i, j, w pairs from the horizontal plays

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and just reassembled them with the i, j, putting in the indication that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they're going in the across direction and keeping the same word.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Then I do the same thing for the vertical plays. They came out in the j, i order.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I reassembled them back in the proper i, j order

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with an indication that we are going in the down direction.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then I took these two sets and just unioned them together.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, I need some definition for across and down. I can do it this way.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I could have just used strings or any unique value that could use a string across and down,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but I'm going to say that across is equal to incrementing one at a time in the i direction

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and zero in the j direction.

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Down is incrementing zero in the i direction and one in the j direction.
