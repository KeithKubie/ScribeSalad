00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:09.008
Despite advances in medicine,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:14.018
cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive.

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:18.188
What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness,

00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:23.559
but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.452
And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction

00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:29.810
of afflicting children 
more than any other type.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.730
This is leukemia,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.705
a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.342
A stem cell is a bit like an infant,

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.651
undeveloped but possessing 
great potential.

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.830
Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.719
like the liver, brain and heart.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.033
But in some tissues,

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:52.993
they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development,

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:57.189
and into adulthood in order to frequently
generate new cells

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.342
and keep up with the body's needs.

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:01.694
One example is the bone marrow,

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.576
where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells.

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:07.698
That includes red blood cells,

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:10.491
which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues,

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.532
platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels,

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.139
and white blood cells,

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:20.250
which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.636
Every once in a while,

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:25.196
something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:28.528
and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA.

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:32.421
Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct,

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.962
but some damaged cells ignore this order,

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:39.778
replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function.

00:01:39.778 --> 00:01:42.344
These are what we know as cancer cells.

00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:46.847
It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer,

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:48.668
but one contributing factor may be

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:53.486
that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications,

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:56.377
while most cancers require many of them,

00:01:56.377 --> 00:02:00.611
allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer.

00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:04.815
Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:06.625
during fetal development,

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.331
further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia.

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:12.110
But though it affects more children
than any other cancer,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.037
adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall.

00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:21.001
Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.531
until they take up 
all available space and resources.

00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:26.622
When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:28.898
the required amount of functional cells,

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.671
the blood becomes depleted.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:32.112
The lack of red blood cells

00:02:32.112 --> 00:02:34.841
means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen,

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:38.661
the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds,

00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:42.930
and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.332
increasing the risk of infections.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.484
To restore the normal 
function of the blood,

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.739
leukemic cells have to be eliminated.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.111
But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors,

00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:54.458
they can't be removed surgically.

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:58.506
Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments

00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:00.490
that include chemotherapy,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.666
a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells.

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:07.972
Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells,

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:11.412
such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines.

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:14.463
And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high

00:03:14.463 --> 00:03:16.683
that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow,

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:19.047
including stem cells.

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:24.285
When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own.

00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:28.269
Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.354
from the bone marrow of a donor.

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:32.993
Once transplanted into the patient,

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:35.915
they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.997
However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process

00:03:38.997 --> 00:03:43.041
requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:46.512
to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells

00:03:46.512 --> 00:03:48.352
as foreign bodies.

00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:49.836
Unlike with blood transplants,

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:51.964
there are thousands of HLA types,

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:56.529
and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.245
If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:05.057
containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors.

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:07.153
The more potential donors there are,

00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:11.652
the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants.

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:16.912
Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.
