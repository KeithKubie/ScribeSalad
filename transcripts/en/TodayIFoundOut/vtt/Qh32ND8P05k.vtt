00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:10.629
The Truth About Clothes Moths

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.809
The common “clothes moth”, “clothing
moth” or to give its street name, Tineola

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.380
bisselliella, doesn’t actually eat clothes.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.470
In fact, clothing moths don’t even possess
the ability to eat- they don’t have a mouth.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.360
Once they become a moth, rather than waste
their time eating, they simply mate, the female

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.170
lays her eggs, and then they die at some point.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.440
Meaning the most damage to your clothes you
could realistically expect from an adult clothing

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.790
moth is a stain if you go postal on one with
a newspaper.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.930
So how did these moths get associated with
eating clothes?

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.000
It’s the moth babies you need to be wary
of, which are able to get proteins they need

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.790
from keratin- in other words, virtually any
organic fibre derived from an animal.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.990
And boy do those things have an appetite.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.990
The full list of things clothes moth larvae
can eat is pretty insane- basically they can

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.910
eat and survive on virtually any natural fibre.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.130
They’ve been known to eat wool, cashmere,
silk, cotton, linen, fur, feathers, hair,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.750
lint, carpets, the bristles of brushes, pet
fur and even dust.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.280
On top of this, the larvae will also, if no
food is present, cut, not eat through non-natural

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:37.499
fibres like polyester to reach your ever dwindling
supply of wool underwear.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:48.929
The fibres the larva eats eventually also
ends up becoming a part of the cocoon it spins

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.189
for itself so it can become a moth and stop
having to eat sweaty boxer shorts and get

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.709
down to the much more fun act of mating.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.140
If their voracious appetite isn’t bad enough,
the larvae are also notably hardy and difficult

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.969
to kill through indirect means.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.180
For example, the larvae and eggs of a clothes
moth can easily survive temperature extremes

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.269
as high as 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees
F) and as low as -8 degrees C (17.6 degrees

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.000
F) for short periods.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.909
As such, it’s recommended that you expose
them to such extremes for at least a half

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.959
an hour to really make sure they’re all
dead.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.920
As explained above, larvae will straight up
chew through whatever they need to in order

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.790
to get to their food, which for the eagle
eyed ones amongst you probably stood out as

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.879
a little odd.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:49.170
If the adult moth sensed a wool sweater in
a wardrobe, why would it lay its eggs on a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.720
spandrels Borat mankini?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.989
Well this is because the larvae and moths
are actually drawn to the moisture in certain

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.140
clothes because the larvae must get the moisture
they need through their food.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.140
This is also the reason dry cleaning your
clothes is an effective moth deterrent.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.079
You might have guessed from this that clothing
moths and their larvae are also attracted

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.049
to dirty clothes, in particular ones dirtied
by sweat, as sweat contains not only moisture

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.379
but salt and other minerals the larvae needs
to survive.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:35.349
But, bottom line, the moths themselves aren’t
doing the damage, it is their children, which

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.890
is also typically true for humans…
