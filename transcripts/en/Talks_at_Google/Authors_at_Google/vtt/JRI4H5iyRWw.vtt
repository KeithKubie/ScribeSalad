00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.269
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So this is a little bit of
background in, some of it's to entice you

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:09.521
to read this book. I got really engrossed
in your story ?

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:10.521
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um.

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:14.510
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and you were born in Louisiana,
Monroe, Louisiana which is not New Orleans

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.189
and yes there's more to Louisiana than New
Orleans --

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.189
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.750
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and you were born to a teen
mom and you were, you called it "farmed out"

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.750
but --

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.760
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.630
&gt;&gt;Commentator: kind of moved around to different
families over the course of your life and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.900
somehow made your way to the West Coast and
to Oakland. And in the face of lots of discrimination

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.610
accomplished what most people would never
dream of accomplishing in their life. At some

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.800
point you were a single mom.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
&gt;&gt;Commentator: You were black. You're a woman
--

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.800
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and you managed to become --

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;&gt;Commentator: a news reporter.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.320
&gt;&gt;Commentator: The first black, female news
reporter on the West Coast. Part of your journey

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:03.640
has really been involved in just transcending
all different mediums from being on the radio,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.209
to TV, to newspapers, everything. And you've
covered the gamut and you're self taught.

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:15.830
And your story is so rich and I'm not gonna
let every, I'll let you tell some of it --

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.830
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.139
&gt;&gt;Commentator: but your story is so rich in
purpose and just a purpose driven life that

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:25.700
you've led. And you've managed to interview
everyone from Frank Sinatra to Fidel Castro.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.509
And I would say that really describes the
gamut of ?

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.509
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.509
&gt;&gt;Commentator: talking to ?

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.509
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.439
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and meeting with some of the
most noteworthy and newsworthy people of your

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.109
time and in fact of our time.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.840
You're currently host of the show 'This Week
in Northern California' hosted by KQED where

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.340
you talk about current topics ranging from
politics and other current events and you're

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.340
a Bay Area legend,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.340
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.409
&gt;&gt;Commentator: winner of six local Emmys and
we're just happy to have you here. 'Never

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.649
In Your Wildest Dreams' is your story and
you had the courage to tell it. So thank you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.321
for being here and thank you for sharing your
story.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.309
Please welcome Belva Davis.

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:06.309
[applause]

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:07.789
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Thank you.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:08.789
[applause]

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: A wonderful introduction. [laughs]

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.170
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Why don't you start by just
telling us what inspired you to tell your

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.580
story, to write your story, and share it with
the world?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.709
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: I think it's because we live
in a time when so many young people are giving

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.090
up. All you need do is look at the national
dropout rate for minority youngsters ?

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.090
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.700
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: and you know that we are living
in perilous times.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.569
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And many of the excuses that
I would hear from young people as I do stories

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.420
about how to get people back on track, how
to bring, keep kids in school longer, were

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.630
a list of stereotypical things that can happen
in a life. And if we give up on those points,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.269
then we are cut adrift from the major society.
And I just wanted to chronicle for any younger

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:13.640
person or even any older person who's thinking,
"I can't do this anymore," that there are

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.890
rewards for hanging in there, for having wild
dreams, for envisioning yourself as whatever

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.120
it is that you think will make you happy.
And if you can somehow along the way convince

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.099
yourself to do the work that it takes to get
where you wanna go, then there you are.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:42.810
So that was my, my main thought, my main motive
as I started to work on the book. I realized

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.840
that my position had been unique. There was
a lot of history in the late 60s, 70s, and

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.230
80s, turbulent times. We, we, --when you put
it all together in a book and you realize

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.510
the sprees of murder, suicides, protests,
head knockings going on that they were totally

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.719
different from today's world.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.719
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:14.609
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And I saw it through the eyes
of a woman who came not from a career as a

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:21.099
prepared journalist but just an ordinary citizen
who happened to be black. Until my face was

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:28.970
known on television, I experienced every,
not every, but I experienced the kinds of

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.221
tough life it is to be black in America.

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:33.221
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:39.979
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And I thought there are stories
to be told even after you break the color

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.960
bar that the, these incidents don't stop --

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.370
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: and they become a little harder
to maneuver, to get around, and to keep your

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.340
self-respect. And so even in writing the stories
I thought, "Well I have a different view than

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.400
my fellow male reporters." And when I started,
I was not just the first black woman. I was

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.120
the first woman street reporter.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.300
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And it was a place where the
standup guys back then were not all welcoming.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.300
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.530
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: So it just seemed that if for
nothing else than the fact that I'm a grandmother

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:28.379
now, that my granddaughter should know what
her grandma's life was like. And if she ever,

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:35.430
ever thought of giving up on herself [laughs]
she would know that she had the muscle to

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.569
do it if she just put her mind to it. [laughs]

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.820
&gt;&gt;Commentator: I think that's wonderful.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.860
I was -- when I was reading the book there
were certainly moments for me, while I didn't

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.090
live in that generation, where I drew parallels
to my own life and people who came before

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.000
me and I saw a lot of teachings from my own
family about how to be resilient --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.110
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.730
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and I can think back to the
1964 Republican National Convention where

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.449
in the story, you talk about -- I want you
to share with this group kind of what that

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:13.620
experience was like, where you had to show
a tremendous amount of resilience and courage

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.400
in order to tell a story ?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.190
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and share with the public.
So why don't you share with us --

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.569
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.639
&gt;&gt;Commentator: a little bit about that.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.789
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yesterday I listened to Tavis
Smiley talk about his life story ?

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:24.789
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um-hum.

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.400
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: in a book called 'Fail Up'.
Well I think of the Republican Convention

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.199
like that. It was a bad, terrible incident
but it inspired me to do something that I

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:42.990
may -- might not have ever done had that been
a pleasant, ordinary, normal [laughs] convention.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:51.639
But it wasn't. It was when America was making
another, well making a very sharp turn politically.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:58.360
It was the Goldwater convention. It was the
year the Dixiecrats I said moved in and co-opted

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.080
the Republican Party, the moderate Republican
Party. It was raucous in every way that you

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:11.599
could think of. The black delegates were treated
extremely bad. One had acid thrown on his

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:19.310
clothes. Others were refused seats even though
they were delegates. Jackie Robinson, the

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.360
famed baseball player, was almost into a fist
fight with somebody. It was that hot.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:34.090
The major media was at war with this group
and mostly because America was changing then.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:44.379
The Civil Rights Act has just been signed
in '64. '63 President Kennedy had been shot.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:50.349
President Johnson seemed akin to picking up
the work that Kennedy had started in making

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:55.590
life more pleasant for African Americans,
Negroes back then.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.879
And as so they were suffering those changes,
echoes of what we hear today from some members

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:06.819
of the Tea Party. They wanted to make sure
that their country didn't change, their neighborhoods

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.860
didn't change, that housing the way they knew
it, all of these things. It was all these

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.710
underlying causes. And so the convention was
revved up. And we were there and we couldn't

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.039
get press passes because they were not available.
We were minority media. But we were in the

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:29.539
rafters sitting quietly, trying to make sure
nobody found us when a mob did find us.

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:30.539
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:35.260
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And from that point on life
was hell there. And eventually we were driven

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.180
out of that hall as people threw debris at
my news director and I. And he was a proud

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:47.590
man who'd been told that he would never be
able to be a radio announcer because Negro

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:54.390
lips were too thick to pronounce words properly.
But he persevered working in black radio and

00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:00.220
as I, my lips started to quiver as we were
leaving. By now we knew it was dangerous to

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:08.530
be there and I could tell the tears were swelling
up inside of me and he said, under his lips,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:16.890
softly to me, "If you cry, I will break your
legs." [laughs]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.350
[laughter]

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.140
And that's how he said it and that's why I
like to measure it that way because it was

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:29.340
humorous enough that it relieved my anxiety.
[laughs] True enough that I thought maybe

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.870
he would. [laughs]

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.870
[laughter]

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:38.180
So anyway we exited. But watching the major
media work, seeing the hatred from that floor,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.650
but seeing their power to tell that story
to America. And I thought to myself in the

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:49.080
car going home, "I wanna do something like
that. I wanna be able to tell people what

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.980
happens to us. Nobody's truly interested in
what happens to us if we don't tell our own

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.151
story." So anyway it convinced me that I could
do this job --

00:09:58.151 --> 00:09:59.151
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:03.320
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: or I should try to do this
job. That's it. And started me on a path that

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.660
turned out to be my life's work.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.210
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Well we're all glad you did
--

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.210
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.320
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and we're all glad you didn't
get your legs broken --

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320
&gt;&gt;Commentator: in the process.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.650
Let's fast forward to today, I mean 1964 there
was clearly division in the parties and how

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.860
do you think things have evolved or changed?
Can you draw some parallels or some differences

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.010
or some improvements?

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:30.760
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: It's like two different worlds
for black Americans today. There's the group

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:37.100
we dreamed of that people fought for, marched
for. And there are many of you here in this

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.690
room that represent the end of that dream.
And then there's the other world where unemployment

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:52.090
is higher than it's ever been, where poverty
is just at an unmeasurable amount, where walls

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.270
are so high that some don't see that they
can climb over them --

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.270
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:05.140
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: but the difference is there
are people like you who they can see ignored

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:12.420
the stereotypical drumming of what it means
to be black in America and say, "You can succeed

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.240
as well as you can fail. You just have to
decide which of those paths you're gonna take."

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.490
And that's the difference. That doesn't mean
that we have done as a society what we should

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.370
have done for them by now --

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.370
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:31.450
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: in terms of investing more
in education, in terms of offering more opportunities.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:40.330
So as a country we need to do more. But as
a people, there's no denying the world is

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.671
totally, totally different. I mean I was,
when I was starting in this business, I mean

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:49.991
I was often asked to leave news conferences
because no one could imagine that I was a

00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:57.210
real legitimate reporter. So today the President
of the country is [laughs] black so [laughs].

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.210
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.620
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: At least they can imagine it.
[laughs]

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.620
[laughter]

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.330
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles] That's great.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:11.180
I was thinking about what other parts of your
story I should ask you about. I said, "I'll

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:17.080
flip the question and say, 'What were the
other defining moments in your life that sort

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.120
of helped to shape the person that you became?'"

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.120
[pause]

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:29.320
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: There were a number of touch
points. I started out working for all black

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.320
programmed or black owned media because it
was the only place I could work. I worked

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.570
in black program radio, I was a stringer for
Jet Magazine, I wrote for anybody who'd take

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:49.200
copy from me. And then came an opportunity
to work in quote unquote major market radio.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:58.640
Got a job in radio, I was Miss KNEW and had
a disc jockey slot on weekends. Thought I

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.310
was sailing along. This is it. And one night
I got a call from my station manager. Lot

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:14.790
of small talk went on. And finally he got
to the bottom line and he said, summarizing

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:20.350
what he said, the bottom line was, "Could
you please sound a little more black.?

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.350
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.520
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Nobody will know you're there.'

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.520
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.740
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And I, I think made one of
the smartest moves in my career. I simply

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.740
ignored it, --

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.740
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.880
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: the question. So that was my
realization that no matter how good I was,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.070
I knew, or how good I thought I was, I knew
why he had hired me.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.070
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:50.100
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And then I pursued again a
different career because radio was not what

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.290
I wanted to be in anymore.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.290
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:59.100
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: So I started, after one review
of a PSA that I did or a Public Service Program,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.500
got a great review that said there should
be a place for me in television. It became

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.560
my mantra and I started banging on any door
and every door I could until one day I hit

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.772
a concrete wall. And that was the day I applied
at the ABC station here in town for a job,

00:14:14.772 --> 00:14:22.230
had an interview, was there, constantly having
to refuel the ol', "I can do it." [laughs]

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:27.670
And at the end of that interview and there's
a long story behind it, you'll have to read

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.670
the book to get there --

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.670
[laughter]

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.760
but there was something interesting with a
famous person [laughs] at that time. But anyway,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:40.451
when we finished our interview he said to
me, "You know we're just not hiring Negresses

00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:47.380
right now, but if we ever decide to hire a
Negress, we will certainly call you." And

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:55.830
I was, I was just so dumbfounded I didn't
know how to answer. And I was afraid that

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.790
the old thing, I didn't have Louis with me
to threaten me about crying --

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.790
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.850
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: I was afraid that was gonna
happen but it didn't. I managed to hold on

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.780
to that because I realized he didn't know
he'd even insulted me.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.370
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And so those were, that was
another defining point. But again I just knew

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:18.570
I was gonna find some way some how to get
into this business if for no more reason to

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.390
let him know that if he wasn't hiring Negresses,
somebody would.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.450
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum. [laughs]

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laugh]

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
[laughter]

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: That's great.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: So those were, those were big
developmental points as I moved forward and

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.730
eventually did land a job over at the CBS
owned station.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.730
&gt;&gt;Commentator: That's great.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.730
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.530
&gt;&gt;Commentator: I think the things that you
did around pageants --

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.230
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.140
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and beauty pageants was also
an interesting story about how do you get

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.140
more black women on TV.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.140
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: And while in the background
it looked like it sort of happens naturally

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.860
and there she was.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.960
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.340
&gt;&gt;Commentator: There was definitely people
who were pushing for that all along. So your

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.930
efforts did not go unnoticed.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:07.240
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well I started [chuckles] -- you
know I was a single mom with a couple of kids

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.490
and trying to figure out how I could be relevant
at a time when the Civil Rights Movement was

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:18.240
just ablaze on everyone's mind and everyone
was doing all they could. And so I turned

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.640
it, even in my conversation with other people,
I would say things like, "Well I was fighting

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.460
racism one swimsuit at a time" --

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.460
[laughter]

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.200
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] to justify it. But,
in actuality, the Miss America Pageant had

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:41.710
a rule in its bylaws, its constitution rather,
that barred the admission for competition

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.560
of anything other than a white woman.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.520
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And it was so insulting that
the local Chamber of Commerce, Junior Chamber

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:55.490
of Commerce, fighting against this in liberal
San Francisco aided me in putting together

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:01.860
a beauty pageant just for black women. And
it was part of a thing from Los Angeles that

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:08.370
had been quite successful. I took on the Northern
California part of it, ended up through the

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:12.959
process the young women, the big prize was
a screen test in Hollywood.

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:13.959
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:17.899
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And we did well. I mean, one
of the winners ended up being nominated for

00:17:17.899 --> 00:17:25.699
an Academy Award, Margaret Avery in 'The Color
Purple'. And some of the singers formed a

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:31.500
group called The Fifth Dimension and went
on, had many hit records. One of the models

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.330
became one of the top models. So it wasn't
a waste of time. But I think for the young

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.980
women who took part and I still hear from
and am friends with many of them now, there

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.840
was more to it than that. They had to take
charm lessons.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.840
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.820
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: They had to go to, to class
to learn to sit, to stand, even how to get

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.861
in and out of a car. And then there was the
talent competition and then we had questions

00:17:56.861 --> 00:18:03.909
that were truly based in modern news of the
day. So it was a good experience for them.

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:09.340
The parents liked it. The girls who came from
out of town camped out at our house to stay

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:15.159
over so that moms could trust them to come
from Fresno and Sacramento to compete. So

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:23.860
it had its great value and when the walls
began to fall, our women were ready to compete

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.860
at any level.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:32.010
But I do wanna note how I noted the Chamber
of Commerce's help. The man who was the producer

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:39.029
of the Miss Universe Pageant also thought
the Miss America Pageant needed some --

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.029
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Okay.

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:44.730
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: kind of lesson and he loaned
us the crown for the Miss Universe Pageant

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.850
for our first Miss Bronze.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:46.850
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Oh wow!

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.089
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: So we're always proud of that.
We have pictures of her with this huge, wonderful

00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:51.089
--

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.089
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.169
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: multi-whatever crown on her
head.

00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:55.169
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:56.169
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:18:56.169 --> 00:18:57.169
&gt;&gt;Commentator: That's great.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:01.429
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] Yeah, so that was
just one of my diversions, a totally volunteer

00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:02.429
effort.

00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:03.429
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:19:03.429 --> 00:19:05.629
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: But one thing that I know did
change lives and it makes me proud.

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:06.629
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Thanks for sharing.

00:19:06.629 --> 00:19:07.629
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:19:07.629 --> 00:19:09.669
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So you have a favorite quote
about dreams.

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:10.669
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:13.620
&gt;&gt;Commentator: You wanna share that with us
and then tell us sort of how that came to

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.720
be your mantra?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:21.419
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles] Well the story of
how -- I wrote it during those days of looking

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:23.000
for a job in television --

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um-hum.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.840
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: because it was such a discouraging
scene. You can imagine I had -- there was

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.260
no woman of color on television and yet I
thought I belonged there. And why did I think

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.559
I belonged there was another thing 'cause
[chuckles] I said before not a trained journalist

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:42.370
just thought it was something that was destined
for me.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:47.080
So I wrote a little thing that I used to carry
around in my, in my date book or in my wallet

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.980
I transferred it from time to time. And it
was a simple line that just said, "Don't be

00:19:53.980 --> 00:20:02.650
afraid of the space between your dreams and
reality." That was the important part. "If

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:09.950
you dream it, you can make it so." I added
that second line as I moved along, but it

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.590
was to get over my fear of the space that
I didn't know about.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.590
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:23.600
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: That I could find no directional
book I could read to tell me how to get over

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.120
that hesitation of going for what you want
and that was it.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.769
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: In fact that's the one place
where Google's in the book. [chuckles] 'Cause

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:37.179
I Googled that one day just for the fun of
it. I don't know some years back. I really

00:20:37.179 --> 00:20:38.179
should have updated it --

00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:39.179
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:40.429
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: but there was at least 60,000
hits on that line. [chuckles]

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:41.429
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Oh good!

00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:42.429
[laughter]

00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:43.429
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:44.429
&gt;&gt;Commentator: We are glad to contribute to
--

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:45.429
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Right. [laughs]

00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:47.039
&gt;&gt;Commentator: the propagation of the use
for your mantra. That's great.

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:50.480
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] Yeah.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.549
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Here at Google, we call ourselves
Googlers here. I don't know if they, they

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:59.000
taught you that term in your lunch or in your
tour. And a lot of us work in different functions.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.240
Some of us are engineers. Some of us work
in sales and finance. But we all are some,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.610
we have a lot of passion around technology.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.610
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:11.360
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So we Tweet and we use social
networks and we access the Internet constantly

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.289
everyday to do everything. And a lot of the
news that we read is via this new medium.

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:19.289
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:21:19.289 --> 00:21:23.120
&gt;&gt;Commentator: And a lot of, you've seen a
lot of press around what was reported around

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.190
Osama Bin Laden first was reported --

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.190
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.320
&gt;&gt;Commentator: online before it was confirmed
in other media.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.610
As someone who's kind of transcended media
for your career, very, very long and successful

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:41.950
career, how do you see kind of technology
and Internet playing into shaping media to

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.009
be better, more informative, or less informative?

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:45.009
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um.

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:50.190
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Tell us what you think or kind
of embellishing or helping things that you

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.190
do in --

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.190
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.190
&gt;&gt;Commentator: journalism today.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.899
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well I think they're two different
worlds and I'm glad that one has one name

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.179
and it's not called journalism. [laughs]

00:21:58.179 --> 00:21:59.179
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Okay. [laughs]

00:21:59.179 --> 00:22:03.720
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] On the other one,
I think it is, it's a spreading of the word

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.789
and that's traditional going back to the earliest
of time when people beated on a drum. ?

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:08.789
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um.

00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:12.529
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: It's the way we communicate
one on one with each other.

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:18.419
What we journalists have to do is educate
people to the fact that if you're reading

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:25.190
an article by a person who calls themself
a 'journalist', you should expect more from

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.249
that person than just the eyewitness account
--

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:30.249
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um-hum.

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:33.429
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: that often would end up in
our reports. It got wrapped into what we did.

00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:39.370
It authenticated what we were doing. That
you should expect more. You should expect

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:46.539
content. You should expect some explanation
from authority figures as to what happened.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:50.980
Even if you know what their words are, you
still should be patient enough to find out

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:57.039
why they were spoken and the context in which.
And that's how I view journalism versus the

00:22:57.039 --> 00:23:04.499
sharing of an experience or an incident. I
think we've always done that. It's just that

00:23:04.499 --> 00:23:07.809
we do it now by the millions instead [laughs]

00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:08.809
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:13.029
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] instead of the few
people who are in our neighborhood. And it

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:21.830
certainly has been helpful in getting the
word out. But I don't think the Tweet in any

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:32.600
way describes what a good journalist can pull
from a person in authority say --

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.600
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.590
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: in terms of questioning them
about the action of the moment. And that's

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:45.990
where I see the division. I, I hope indeed
that we will both find a comfortable position,

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:53.720
that people who, who want to share information
instantly certainly should be able to do that

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.669
and journalists should be able to learn to
use that information in a constructive way.

00:23:58.669 --> 00:24:01.610
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So I'm gonna ask you one more
question on this ?

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.610
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.440
&gt;&gt;Commentator: very topic. But people start
thinking about your own questions and just

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.330
line up right here at the mic in the center.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.200
You said you don't think it defines what a
good journalist can do.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.529
&gt;&gt;Commentator: A lot of people here were aspiring
writers. Some day --

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:15.529
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:17.820
&gt;&gt;Commentator: we may write a book. Maybe
we've written books and we may wanna be on

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.820
TV --

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.360
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and get our 15 minutes or 1500
hours maybe --

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360
&gt;&gt;Commentator: of fame.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.389
What advice do you have for those of us who
want to be writers or journalists someday?

00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:32.779
What does make a good journalist or a good
content? We call them 'content creators' here

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:34.110
'cause we're so technical --

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.110
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.110
&gt;&gt;Commentator: with everything but 'content
creators'.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:42.100
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well there's something that
no technology can replace and that is the

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:50.080
gnawing in the heart, the stomach to produce
information that has value. You've gotta have

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.159
that plus the mechanics of having it done.
So therefore if you wanna be a journalist

00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:01.499
you've gotta really in today's world, competitive
world, you've really got to wanna do it. And

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:05.840
I like to always tell the story that I don't
even know when I started to get paid to write.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.840
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.769
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: When I got my first payment
from Jet Magazine it used to be 'payments'

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:17.590
-- they were five dollars a week. They were
supposed to cover my gas [laughs] from San

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:24.660
Francisco to Oakland to do stories and my
postage to mail the things off and my bridge

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.600
tolls. They calculated in Chicago that should
cost me five dollars a week.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.380
When I got my job in television I didn't even
ask what the salary was. So it was a year

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.840
later almost before I discovered I was being
paid half [chuckles] the salary of the men

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.499
in my unit all because --

00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:44.499
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [unintelligible]

00:25:44.499 --> 00:25:48.590
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: of my union thank God. [laughs]
But that's what happened and of course I didn't

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.889
have to take any action because once that
fact was uncovered, they just automatically

00:25:52.889 --> 00:25:56.460
increased me to what they were paying the
other guys.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:04.700
So you've got to really want to do this work
to stay in it. That is if you wanna do -- I

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.179
like -- to me journalism is politics. [laughs]
It is an understanding of the environment

00:26:10.179 --> 00:26:15.179
in which we live. It is adding to that base
of knowledge that's shared widely. And the

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:25.220
other is whatever it is too and that means
entertainment news or who's fallen out or

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.139
broken up a relationship this week and [laughs]
--

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:28.139
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:26:28.139 --> 00:26:32.909
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs] I mean that's what
headlines address. But I can only give the

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:42.169
advice is to, is to practice to use your skills
that you've gotten, to submit material, to

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:46.749
have a life's plan. I mean mine was never
to do that for free all of my life. But it

00:26:46.749 --> 00:26:51.990
was a learning experience. And today's world
changes so fast I can't even tell people which

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:58.850
direction to move in order to get to the New
York Times, say, today. You don't even know

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.740
if there's gonna be a New York Times [laughs]
--

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.740
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Um-hum.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.321
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: in the future. But you will
if you use your art, you --

00:27:06.321 --> 00:27:10.440
[pause]

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.730
use every opportunity you can to learn. You'll
be ready for when your opportunity arrives.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.730
[chuckles]

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.730
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Thank you. Question?

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.730
[pause]

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:19.730
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member#1: Hi I just, when
you were describing before about two different

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.730
Americas especially for blacks -- what it
was before and how it is now. And granted

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.009
blacks have been, have had the opportunity
to have many more options and just have been

00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:31.059
granted more opportunities overall now. But
it seems as though maybe there's even a bigger

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:49.880
gap now between African Americans for those
who have and maybe for those who are disenfranchised.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:58.299
And it seems maybe the disenfranchised have
somewhat given up. So what do you do and what

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:03.100
did you do just through your whole journey
just to keep pushing and keep fighting and

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.730
just never to give up?

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:11.100
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum. That's my word. Never
give up. [laughs] I think the only people,

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:18.769
the only individual who can defeat you is
the internal one who tells you you can't do.

00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:24.730
And the reason I use the dream analogy because
going back to slavery times even, the dream

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:31.379
was a one thing that you owned that no one
could take from you. So if you can dream it

00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:35.999
for yourself, you can envision yourself, you
can see yourself doing that, you wanna do

00:28:35.999 --> 00:28:44.200
it that bad you usually, unless there's some
flaw, and there are plenty of flaws, you'll

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:54.149
get there or close to it. But I don't think
that anyone can give you a road map today

00:28:54.149 --> 00:29:00.960
to how to get, if your goal is to be a columnist
for the New York Times or even a reporter

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.440
for the Times or the Wall Street Journal,
they can't give you a road map because we

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:12.850
don't quite know what it is that'll get you
there. Probably many of you with your, with

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:20.470
your knowledge of technology today are far
more desirable for a company to hire than

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:25.070
someone who writes about politics 'cause everyone's
written a book somewhere along the lines I

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:32.639
mean about politics. But you still in a mystery
world for many people. And so it's, it's,

00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:39.929
it's using what you learn from wherever you
are to apply it to where you wanna go. And

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:45.129
that's sort of the way I made it by writing
a little bit, talking a little bit, putting

00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:51.220
them together, convincing somebody that it
would work if we, if we did it. I love working

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:57.510
with our interns at, at KQED because I go
through an airport and somebody'll stop me

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:04.610
and say, "Do you remember in 1987 I was the
intern?" [laughs] And blankety blank and,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:09.379
"Oh I'm workin' in London now for blankety
blank." [laughs] And it gives me joy. So I

00:30:09.379 --> 00:30:19.179
think that [pause] that relying on yourself,
preparing yourself, and knowing where you

00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:22.899
wanna go is about the only thing I can say.
[chuckles],

00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:24.090
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Thank you.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.090
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.090
[pause]

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.409
&gt;&gt;Justin Houser: Hi, Ms. Davis, My name is
Justin Houser and I just started here at Google

00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:32.830
in September. I'm a recent graduate of Morehouse
College. I work in People Operations our HR

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:40.549
Department. And the question I have for you
is you talked about some of your notable interviews

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:46.029
so with Muhammad Ali, Frank Sinatra. Did you
have a favorite moment or a favorite interview

00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:47.619
that you just can't forget that you want to
share?

00:30:47.619 --> 00:30:52.590
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Oh my goodness, yeah. I have
many favorite [laughs] interviews, I can't

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:59.399
forget and people that I met. I like to remind
myself of this because I have this list of

00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:05.090
people. Somebody in introducing me one day
read off a list of the people that I had interviewed,

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:10.119
people with some name and note. And I realized
I'd left Bob Hope's name off. Now how could

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:13.550
you leave off Bob Hope's name? I don't know
but I managed to do that --

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.550
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [chuckles]

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:20.639
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: because there were so many
people accessible before the media sort of

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:24.720
got mad the way it is today. [chuckles] I
call it that because there's this gaggle of

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:33.260
folks pulling at you that it was, it was possible
to do that. I think I'm fortunate to have

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:42.269
had the access to Presidents and other high
ranking political figures from other countries

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:45.210
to talk with.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:51.900
I can't argue against the fact that I was
fascinated by Fidel Castro. I had a chance

00:31:51.900 --> 00:32:00.149
to meet him over a couple of times. I've always
thought that, and said it to him to his face,

00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:03.450
but I doubt if he would have been as, would
have been able to do the things that he's

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.710
done, that Jimmy Carter was one of the most
--

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:07.710
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:15.870
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: thoughtful Presidents in terms
of the have nots that I've ever met. I admired

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:21.399
greatly Robert Kennedy because of the change
he made in his life and had a chance to talk

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:27.700
with him about it which was a wonderful, wonderful
experience.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:36.109
I met with and talked with, in awe every moment,
Martin Luther King and he was a great man.

00:32:36.109 --> 00:32:42.149
He took the time to try to 'suade me in my
feelings of guilt by not doing more during

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:52.119
the Civil Rights era. Even meeting Lena Horne
who said to a group of us who were visiting

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:53.120
her one afternoon --

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.120
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.440
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: "No matter what happens take
your naps at this age." [laughs]

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.490
[laughter]

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.120
And she was right. She was entertaining at
the Fairmont Hotel. And every afternoon at

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:10.129
two o'clock, she took a nap because she knew
she needed to be her best. Things, strange

00:33:10.129 --> 00:33:11.510
little things that people say to you.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.830
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Yeah.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:20.070
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: I would not have made the greatest
decision, the luckiest one of my life, were

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.850
it not for Nancy Wilson who convinced me to
marry my husband. We've only been together

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:30.840
for 47 years so she sure didn't know what
she's talkin' about. [laughs]

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840
[laughter]

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:41.399
There are many people that I can talk of as
individuals. The story that lives with me

00:33:41.399 --> 00:33:51.309
today and I still am trying to beat the drum
about it is I went on a trip to Kenya to Tanzania

00:33:51.309 --> 00:33:58.039
after the bombing of the American Embassies
there. Five thousand people injured, 240 dead,

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:10.040
all but 11 of them Africans, 150 people blind
today because of that. So far as I know still

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.100
when my last communication with the woman
who introduced me to that story many of these

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:20.020
were still waiting to be compensated for those
burns and injuries.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.020
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:30.000
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: It was, as you know, the act
of Al-Quada and [pause] our government at

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.640
that time I guess was mystified as to how
they were gonna fight the war on terror. So

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:43.000
they were not helpful in those beginning months
to the Africans.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.440
And I went with a woman to take medical supplies
to the injured. Glad I could go but felt bad

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:56.570
as an American that we, as volunteers, had
to come and bring bandages and prostheses

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.940
and other things to aid these people. So,
for a number of years, I've always beat the

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.990
drum whenever I could for the people particularly
of Nairobi because that's where the major

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:14.980
injuries were. Businesses lost. Families totally
destroyed.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:21.470
And I still feel the pride of the African
psychiatrists and psychologists who went on

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:30.570
the radio to tell the people they shouldn't
blame anyone in, at that time. What they needed

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.600
to do more was to talk about helping each
other which they did.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.450
So that's my soap box that I, I've stood on
for a very long time because it touched me

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:44.350
so deeply to, to have had the chance to be
there and to do something. [pause]

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.310
I'd better stop. [laughs]

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.780
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Thank you.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.250
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.250
[pause]

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:57.080
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Thanks so much
for coming and sharing your wisdom with us.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:04.600
I just wonder what is your earliest recollection
of someone or something that gave you the

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.940
idea of never giving up?

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:12.450
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well that's a truly long story
and I talk about my childhood of --. Born

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:21.320
to a teen mom. Given away as a baby to a relative
who died soon after about when I was three

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:29.300
to four years old. She had died of tuberculosis.
Being transferred around a lot between relatives

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:40.030
always but living, by the time I was 12, I'd
lived in seven different households. I'm talking

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:47.870
about this so you could see that life was
not a bed of roses.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:57.230
Finally realizing at some point by the time
I was, by the time my mother left home, that

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:04.360
I had to be responsible for me and I would
only be giving up on myself if I gave up.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:11.870
So before it was 'Don't be afraid', it was
'Never give up, never give up'. And my dream

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:19.960
at that time was to make someone care about
me. So to do that, I had all kinds of ways

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:26.000
of doing it from getting baptized in the Ouachita
River which I hope will not flood the town

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.430
of Monroe again. I was born during what was
called 'The Flood of the Century' back then

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:36.120
when Louisiana was being inundated with water.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:43.640
So it, it was a tough life but it wasn't so
tough that it defeated me and it was because

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:53.890
I was using whatever tools I had to survive
and to be useful. And I think when I started

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:59.190
hitting these other bumps, they seem minor
compared to [chuckles] what I had been living

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.190
through.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:06.380
I love it in the book. There's a number of
pictures in the center and there's one that

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:11.090
looks sort of middle class 'til you look at
it really closely. It's me standing around

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:16.960
a table with a group of people in formal attire.
And I always like to tell the under story.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.440
That dining room table we're standing around
is the table which I slept under for three

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.590
years on the floor there [chuckles] in my
aunt's dining room as I finished high school.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:32.350
So I think there are ways that you just take
life and turn it around.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.930
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: So would you say
you're a natural optimist then?

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:35.990
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Oh of course.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.990
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.990
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah, I mean I of course I'm
not --

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.990
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [unintelligible]

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.110
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: It could just as
easily --

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.930
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: No, but I know I could have
become a pessimist.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:42.930
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: [unintelligible]
[laughs]

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:48.420
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: No. No. No. I'm always expecting
the best from circumstances and people and

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.241
always saying to my husband, "It's gonna work
out. It's gonna work out." [laughs] I know

00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:57.630
it is. I'm usually the one fretting the most
about it, but I'm also the one that feels

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.630
it's gonna work out. [laughs]

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.630
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Thanks.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:00.630
[pause]

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.630
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Hi, Ms.Davis.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.630
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.630
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: It's an honor
to have you here. This is a little high.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:11.970
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about
the late 60s and early 70s. Here in particular

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:16.620
another Davis professor, Angela Davis, sort
of that experience and sort of how you were

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.620
involved with that, her trial, ?

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.620
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum, um-hum.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.620
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: et cetera. Thank
you.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.240
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well other than being given
the Berkeley beat which I was given as my

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.960
first major assignment in -- of course you
know what went on in Berkeley during the late

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:36.830
60s. That meant that, that I got used to being
regularly tear gassed. That was it. But I

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.420
did have my own gas mask so I was better off
than the students.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.420
[laughter]

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.600
But that I covered lots of those kinds of
situations.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:54.310
And then, there was the Patty Hearst kidnapping
which I also reported, reported on which led

00:39:54.310 --> 00:40:06.140
to an incident in our lives that were as close
to making me think hard about whether I belonged

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.530
in the business or not.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:21.470
Angela Davis was suspected of aiding [pause]
an attempted break out at San Quentin and

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:28.880
she was pursued across the country and finally
arrested. And every day on the noon news at

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:39.280
KPIX, we did some story relating to that incident.
And then one day, we lived in El Cerrito,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:45.950
an El Cerrito police officer came to our door
and I thought it was for a news tip. [chuckles]

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:55.470
Why else would a police officer come? So he
told us that he had heard or they had heard

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:00.900
that there was a plot to kidnap our daughter
in reprisal for the Patty Hearst kidnapping.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.900
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:09.120
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And they thought, these Hells
Angels, non-thinkers, thought that I was Angela

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:17.670
Davis' sister. So therefore if "my people"
as they said, which really were not my people,

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:26.360
[chuckles] who really did all of the work
around that whole thing, the SLA, but that

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:34.440
they were gonna kidnap my daughter. And so
we decided to move. We couldn't convince them.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:39.240
How could I? Couldn't go on the air and say,
'You're makin' a mistake'. So the police encouraged

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.850
us to move which we did. We moved two blocks
from where we worked, where I worked, where

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.320
I'd have access to my daughter. We never proved
whether it was going to happen. My daughter

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:54.270
was given police protection. She never knew
it and we didn't tell her about it for a very

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.650
long time. But at that point I, I wondered
--

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.650
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:03.410
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: indeed if this was the business
that we should be in. And my son didn't escape

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.980
his turn. [chuckles]

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:11.060
I did another series of stories, not to do
with Angela Davis, but about racial profiling

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:20.130
that I ended up on the list of the not very
welcome list at the Oakland Police Department.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:26.840
And it was, it was a good series of stories.
They never proved that I said anything that

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.850
was inaccurate. But that was not the point.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:39.990
But what did happen is that my son was arrested
for making an illegal right hand turn and

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:46.860
held for hours. Never charged basically, but
I got the message and that was the other time

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:54.770
that both my husband and I had to serious
talk as to how far do we go. Our decision

00:42:54.770 --> 00:43:00.260
was not to leave the business but it was for
me anyway to stop being the face of that story

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.820
because now it wasn't me. It was my kid.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:09.730
So Angela Davis. Incidentally, and I have
remained in touch with one another over the

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:10.730
years.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.730
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:18.440
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: She's a lovely, intelligent
woman and has continued her work with prison

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.620
reform all of these years and stayed true
to that. So I have to say that. [chuckle]

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.620
[pause]

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:30.100
&gt;&gt;Commentator: We still have a few more minutes
so if there's other questions. I still have

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.100
a list here too --

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.100
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.810
&gt;&gt;Commentator: but I don't wanna hog all the
time.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.810
Please go ahead.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.810
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [chuckles]

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:36.810
&gt;&gt;Commentator: I've got two people standing
up so go for it.

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:37.810
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:38.810
[pause]

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.810
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Hi Ms. Davis.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.810
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Um-hum.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:46.070
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Thanks for coming.
As a woman and an African American woman,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:52.210
did you find when you started out reporting,
that they gave you different sorts of stories

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:57.470
to report on? And what were those stories
like? And another question. Are there any

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.730
unsolved cases that you covered that you still
wonder about?

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:04.750
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Hum, well my daughter's kidnapping
is one. [laughs]

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:05.750
[laughter]

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.730
That was different [laughs] and so we never,
we never got the real story on that one.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:15.660
Well with me, it was that they were -- the
whole thing was to see how long I could last.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.490
And I love telling the story in the book about
a camera man, in particular whose job it was

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.290
to make sure that I would get out of the business
as quickly as possible. In fact, he didn't

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:31.150
think I'd last two weeks even. And that was
the famous robber chase story that I tell

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:36.250
about a couple of weeks in I don't even think
I'd even been on the air by then. But anyway,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:42.630
there was a live shoot out. Got robbers in
a car shooting. A cop car following it. I

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:47.770
was assigned to go out with him. We get in
his car. It's an old Peugeot, hardly runs.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:54.560
But he is really a darling of the police department.
So in this chase, he moves in front of the

00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:01.810
police car which they didn't like at all.
The robbers are shooting in our direction.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:06.490
He decides to pick up his Bell and Howell
silent camera because he wants to get the

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:13.010
action. And the car is speeding and he tells
me to hold onto the steering wheel. [laughs]

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:21.360
So eventually, he was convinced by whatever
means, the radio was squeaking like crazy,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:28.070
for us to get some sensibility about this
and so we got out of that.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:35.540
And then after that, there were other tests
like that. So I can't complain that I got

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:42.030
all the soft stories, although some did come
my way. I did ask for tough assignments because

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:49.960
I wanted to play the game and to see, and
to see, to show them that I could do it, [chuckles]

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.310
whatever 'that' was.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:56.560
And by the time the next woman got hired,
was -- a woman named Christine Lund was hired.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.030
It's Channel 7. To show you what high esteem
all my good work had done, the news director

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:09.000
there said, "If they told me to hire a puppy
dog to keep my broadcast license, I would,"

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.330
when asked why he hired her. [laughs] So it
made -- neither of us felt very proud [laughs]

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:15.330
of that moment. Yeah.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.330
Um-hum.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:17.330
[pause]

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.280
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: Hi Mrs. Davis.
My name is Charlay. I'm in the Marketing Department

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:34.450
here at Google. A couple weeks ago, we had
the opportunity to watch a screening of a

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.900
documentary called 'Miss Representation' that
talked about how women are portrayed and perceived

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.570
in the media. And one of the things that stood
out is that a lot of female reporters and

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:52.930
anchorwomen today are made out to be very
like kind of sexified and objectified with

00:46:52.930 --> 00:47:02.120
like low cut tops, a lot of makeup, hair.
And there aren't very many women anchors who

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.590
are considered to be serious reporters.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.970
So I was wondering, in your heyday, were you
ever pressured to kind of play up your feminine

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.090
traits and be more about the physical or the
pretty, over emphasizing rather the work you

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:12.243
were doing? So was that ever a factor that
came into play?

00:47:12.243 --> 00:47:15.520
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: I've led a lucky life. I came
along when feminism was really just getting

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.090
on the ground. We were trying [chuckles] to
get women to wear less makeup, to do less

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.400
in terms of grammar, glamour.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.780
I have to tell you now one trip to Los Angeles
and to see the anchor teams and you worry

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:38.030
as about what has happened? But, on the other
hand, if you listen to the reports coming

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:47.620
out of Egypt, Libya, wherever there are the
worst conditions ever, almost always now it's

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:55.100
a woman who's there. Now this is not true
with every woman who's there. But some of

00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:02.180
it is because women who want to do this work,
as I told you, have put themselves in places

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:09.230
in countries where there's news to report.
And they've, so I'm told, they call the news

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:14.870
operations and say, "I'm in blankety, blank,
blank. Would you like a report from here?"

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.020
And it's launched a number of careers.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.020
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Hum.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.130
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And again, it's following my
own philosophy I have to say that's a good

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:26.350
thing. But on the other hand, the networks
have closed their bureaus. And when they had

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:33.780
them they were guys. Now the women are proving
that they can handle the toughest assignments.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:39.390
So we have that group of women who are, some
of who are suffering greatly in some of these

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:46.071
countries 'cause they aren't protected enough.
And the other women who really wanna be in

00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:51.340
show business and that's why they're sitting
at those anchor desks. [chuckles]

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.400
[pause]

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:59.000
&gt;&gt;Commentator: I think we have time for one
more question. I'm happy to ask the last question,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.420
but if there's someone in the audience who
wants to ask the last question you can.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.420
[pause]

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.420
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Okay

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.420
&gt;&gt;Commentator: I'll do it.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:07.420
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Okay.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.120
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So after listening and talking
with you and just sharing with you over the

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:17.630
last couple of hours, last 45 minutes in this
part of the session, it's no secret everyone

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:24.560
can all agree that you've had a tremendous
career and you've taken the road less traveled

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:32.480
on behalf all of us in this room. But whet
our appetites. What should we watch for next?

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.630
What topics are you passionate about? Who
would you like to sit across from and interview?

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:44.350
So when we're following you for the next many,
many years in your career, what can we be

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:45.350
looking for?

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:50.840
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Well, there's one serious answer
and one answer because I dream it and therefore

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840
it's gonna happen.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.840
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Okay.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.490
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: One is that my interest right
now lies with the three strikes law. I, I

00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:05.970
feel there's a lot of unfairness in, it's
in the way it's written, in the way it's been

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:13.970
applied, and it's been applied mostly that
it falls on black males who carry that burden.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:20.320
There's a project here at Stanford where they're
doing all the research to, to prove what I'm

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.710
thinking and I'm following that and reporting
on it. I've had the privilege of going into

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:32.100
Soledad Prison and sitting for an afternoon
in the prison yard with as many three strikers

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:37.530
as would come forward and listen to their
stories and they're interesting stories. We

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:45.240
know the hysteria around why it happened.
But I understand now that there, at least,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.780
are conferences being held to talk about this.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:55.400
And the other of course has to do with our
charming President. [chuckles] My dream is

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.001
and it's I said it's gonna happen --

00:50:57.001 --> 00:50:58.001
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:50:58.001 --> 00:51:02.640
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: I have not had an opportunity
to speak with Barack Obama and I hope I do

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:09.360
before I hang up my spurs [laughs] as the
old westerns used to say. It would be a shame

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.500
to have been around through all of these Presidents
and talk to so many of them and then the hero

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:20.060
of the moment, our century escape. But I'll
keep saying this in public long enough 'til

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.060
somebody --

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.060
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.030
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: one of these days will say,
"Hey Barack, remember that old lady out in

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.030
[laughs]

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.030
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.300
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: And it will come true because
?

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.300
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Yeah.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: one of the reasons, ways you
get what you want is you gotta ask for it.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.500
[laughs]

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: That's right.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: [laughs]

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: That's right. And this will
be on YouTube.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Oh boy!

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: So then if --

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah --

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.500
[laughter]

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: and if --

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Yeah.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: he watches it --

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Alright you hear me. [laughs]

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: he'll be able to see this exact
quote.

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:44.500
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Right. [laughs]

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: [laughs]

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.500
&gt;&gt;Commentator: Well, thank you so much for
being here. For those who are interested,

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.690
you can stay after. She's gonna do a book
signing and we just are honored to have you

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:51.430
in our presence and for sharing your story.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:52.430
Thank you for coming.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.430
&gt;&gt;Belva Davis: Your hospitality couldn't have
been greater.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.430
[applause]

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:55.430
Thank you so much.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.431
[applause]
