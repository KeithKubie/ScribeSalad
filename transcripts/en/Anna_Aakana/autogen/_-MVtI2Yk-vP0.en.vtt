00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Hey guys! You know what I love?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.880
Mac Air giveaways?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.660
wow

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.900
actually, yeah

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.780
that was a pretty

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.060
good guess I am giving away a Mac Air

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.960
What do I have to do to win?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.460
Well, you just have to be subscribed!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.960
Cool. Anything else?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.100
You weren't subscribed to me already?

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.480
...ummm

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.940
There's no reason to be subscribed to yourself! (giggle)

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.100
Oh. Okay. I guess that makes sense

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.660
Anyway! I'll be announcing the winner on August 30th!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.380
Yaaas, hope I win

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.640
I could use that Macbook Air to sell my soul

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.600
Now, we're all plagued by our own unique inner demons

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.000
you know, some of us fall prey to lust

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.200
[sobbing] no you temptatious little bastards, no!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.640
[still sobbing] no, you know how much I love you!

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.220
[sob]

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.020
noooo!

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.740
Some of us drink too much

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.080
Hey, can I have some of your water?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.100
Yeah, of course!

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.960
ah, thanks

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.400
oh, no that's fine you can keep it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.620
I was gonna use it as my chaser, but I'll just use this whiskey (laughs)

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.960
And some of us have inner demons we can't even begin to name

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.820
ANNA: Bee - beezul? Beelzebub?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.200
DEMON: No. [unintelligible, demonic noise]

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.040
ANNA: Dur-murk-dur?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.700
DEMON: No, [unintelligible, demonic noise]

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.440
ANNA: I'm sorry, I don't know if it's like a mortal thing,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.100
but I'm just, I'm seriously not getting it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.760
I'm not trying to be rude I just seriously don't know how to say your name

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.760
Whatever your inner demons may be,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.960
the first step towards taking back control of your life

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.580
is knowing what they are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.420
because you can't fix a problem you don't recognize

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.460
[struggling, demon-like noises]

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.460
ANNA: Please Reverend, can you help us?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.100
We have no idea what's gotten into her!

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.680
REVEREND: A demon from the deepest darkest pits of Hell.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.760
[more struggling noises and a clapping sound]

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.300
REVEREND: The attention whore.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.060
[noises]

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.820
ANNA: Ooh!

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.720
REVEREND: No!

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.180
REVEREND: She thrives off of selfies and likes!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020
To free your daughter,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.840
you MUST change the wifi password

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.200
you MUST take away her cellphone and makeup

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.160
you must render her

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.500
audience-less

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.880
DAUGHTER: [roars]

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.920
REVEREND: May the power of dislikes compel you!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.400
Once you know your own weaknesses and your tendencies

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.600
you can start trying to change your inner dialogue

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.200
so you're not feeding that demon

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.880
words are spells

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.640
so you should stick to positive ones

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
KAWAII

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.080
YASASHII

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.420
UTSUKUSHII

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.680
TENSAI!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
NEKO MO DAISUKI!

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.740
NANDEMODEKIRU

GANBARE ANNA-CHAN GANBARE

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.780
And look, it's gonna be an ongoing battle

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.100
some issues that I struggle with

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.600
are rage, drinking too much,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.580
and being jealous whenever a friend succeeds

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.300
sometimes I have a good grip on one for a while

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.280
and then I lose it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360
sometimes I'm very good at managing all of them

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.660
for weeks at a time

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.620
the most important thing is that you're aware

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.240
and actively working on it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.580
without beating yourself up

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.840
finding healthy ways to manage the issues

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.400
that bring your life darkness and unhappiness

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.760
should be a priority

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880
Ideally it would be a habit

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.240
and remember, it could be worse!

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.040
You could be worse

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.100
you could be a murderer

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.360
[shrieking]

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.060
who has no remorse

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.700
in jail

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.060
[whispering] shank

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.240
and/or Hell

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.920
[shrieking]

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.260
but let me know what inner demons you face

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.860
and how exactly you deal with them

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome Gotham.
