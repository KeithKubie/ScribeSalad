COLT MCANLIS: You
know what, Rito?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.850
I'm really interested for the
next thing in my developer

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.120
advocate role on
focusing on doing videos

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.157
about Android performance.

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.240
MALE SPEAKER: Performance.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.880
Wow.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.860
That's a huge topic.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.170
Really, I think people
will definitely interested.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.290
I think it's something which
is important for Android

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.370
developers to know about.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.240
But honestly, I'm
a little concerned.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.960
You've got this
beautiful head of hair,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.470
and the last person we had
who focused on performance

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.149
ended up tearing it all out.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.440
COLT MCANLIS: I should be good.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.630
This is-- this is genetics.
