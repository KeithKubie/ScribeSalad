00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.140
Looking at Kate's pedigree here, we can see that the trait of lactose

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.360
intolerance doesn't appear in every generation. In

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.440
fact, it looks like it skips generations.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.030
&gt;&gt; I've heard of genes skipping generations

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.490
before, like male pattern baldness, or cystic fibrosis.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Exactly. There are lots of examples of traits

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.900
that do this, but it's important to know there are

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.960
also other traits that do appear in every generation,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.830
where many of the family members show the same phenotype.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.870
&gt;&gt; How do they do that, is there something different genetically?

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.560
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll get to that. But the first thing we

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
need to do is better describe these inheritance patterns. And to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240
do that, we're going to pull on knowledge in all the lessons

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.710
we've had up to this point. Particularly, the idea of an allele.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.540
&gt;&gt; So wait, let's go over what an allele is again.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.360
&gt;&gt; An allele is just a version of a gene that can cause a version of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.390
a trait. For example, one allele may promote

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.910
blue eyes and another allele may promote brown eyes.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.550
&gt;&gt; That's right. And I have two, one from mom, one from dad.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.370
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It's important for us to keep that in mind as we

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.980
go through this lesson, as it's going to be a very key concept. We

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.410
have two copies of every gene. And we can have different alleles of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.380
a gene, but different alleles don't always cause the same kind of trait.
