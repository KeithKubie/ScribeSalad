[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:08.020
CHARITY WORRELL: So thank
you for coming today.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.300
What I loved most in the
book is how authentic

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.250
and how vulnerable
you were, which

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.410
I feel like when someone's
writing about their life

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.740
they don't always want to
write about the scary or sad

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.550
or other parts of it.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.810
And I liked that you went
fair with us in the book.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
So why did you decide to
take that kind of route

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.950
and not make it be all
like roses and fairy tales?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.490
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Roses and
fairy tales are not real life

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.230
and it's boring.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.630
It was scary to
make the decision

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.260
to be so open and vulnerable.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.840
But I just feel like it's
the only way people relate.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.590
And it's something I discovered
a long time ago on a spin bike.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.860
And I started to talk about
personal things up there.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.410
I wouldn't make it subjective.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.860
I would say things in a way that
it would apply to everybody.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.310
And everyone would immediately
relate to what I was saying,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.780
and get a lot out of it and
know that all the challenges

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.550
that we face every
day, we're not alone,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.010
that we're all
facing them together.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.000
CHARITY WORRELL: What made
you ready to write the memoir?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.520
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So a lot of
people throughout the years

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.687
always would say to me--

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:20.520
they would hear my story
and they would say,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.853
you really need to write a book.

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:23.340
And I would just say, oh, yeah.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.330
Never thinking it
would ever happen.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.310
And it really just took one
person who said the same thing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.250
and then I said yeah, yeah,
and kind of dismissed it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.890
And he said, no, no, you
really need to write a book

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.130
and I'm going to introduce
you to a literary agent.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.620
And basically pulled
me, and held my hand,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620
and took me to meet this couple.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.406
And they are literary agents.

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:47.280
And I sat in their living
room and they said,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.540
tell me your story, and I did.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.750
And by the time I got home,
I had a contract in my inbox.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.224
So that's how it happened.

00:01:54.224 --> 00:01:56.640
CHARITY WORRELL: And what made
you-- the way you wrote it,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.320
I really liked it.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.120
You shared personal
things and you also

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.430
made it about how you started
two businesses and all

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.360
the lessons that
you learned in it.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.580
And then you split it into three
parts, which were reinvention,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.229
rejuvenation, and rewards.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.450
Why did you decide to
break it into these parts,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.610
and make it a personal
thing and then

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.830
also throw in the business
aspect and lessons

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.450
that you learned?

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.890
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I think that--

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.230
well, first of all,
the reinvention piece

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.980
is a huge part of
the story, which

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.610
is why I devoted a whole
section to it, because I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.000
have had a lot of
roadblocks along the way.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.570
It was not an easy
ride by any means

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.700
to get to being the
co-founder of both businesses.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.670
But I wanted people to know
and understand and be inspired,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.820
because no matter
where we are in life,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.700
we do all have the ability
to reinvent ourselves

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.730
if we want to.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.810
And I started SoulCycle
when I was 48.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.140
And I started Flywheel
when I was 52.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.850
So a lot of people
are shocked at that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.920
and they can't even
imagine starting

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.120
a business at those ages.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.520
But I wanted to tell
the story and let people

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.770
know that anything's possible.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.980
So rejuvenation came from
just that starting over again.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.600
Starting over again
after you've been

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.480
burned, or hurt, or
blindsided, and knowing

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.316
that you can pick yourself
up and start again.

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:25.440
And what was the last part?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.860
Rewards.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.520
CHARITY WORRELL: Rewards.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.311
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.910
I mean, obviously, for
me, it was just about--

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.500
as I say in the
subtitle of the book--

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.550
it was just about reaping
rewards from this career

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.880
that I made for myself
never ever fathoming

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.520
that I would be here today.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.870
Never went to business school.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.470
Didn't have a clue about
how to run a business.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.930
And really it just
literally all came out

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.285
of following my passion.

00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:56.160
CHARITY WORRELL: And
you started as a dancer.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.035
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I did.

00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:59.402
CHARITY WORRELL: And then
from there something difficult

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:01.860
happened in life-- which I want
everyone to read the book--

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.924
I'm not going to
give everything away.

00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:06.090
You went through something
difficult and that's kind

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.260
of how you found spin.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.714
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:11.130
It's interesting
because no matter

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.380
what you do in life and--

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.000
whether you were a musician or a
dancer or anything growing up--

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.029
and no matter what
path your career takes,

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.800
it's so interesting
in retrospect,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.390
what you bring to your career
that you might have learned

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.710
when you were eight years old.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.030
And so for me, we were talking
about this today, with dancing,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.740
I was constantly
in a dance class.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.590
And I saw how gratifying it
was if the dance teacher said,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.170
great job, Ruth,
or beautiful, Ruth.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.090
And that could just
make my entire day.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.210
And that's just an
example of something

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.290
that I brought to
the spin class.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.120
Because as I said we were
talking about, if someone says,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.670
great job, Charity,
that's all you need.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.430
And it gives you almost a
high for the rest of the day.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.700
And so that was just
one small component

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.790
of this product that came to
be where at the end of the day

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.150
people felt better about
themselves after 45 minutes.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.740
CHARITY WORRELL: So how is your
method different than the--

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.660
when you started
taking spin at--

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.590
was it a Reebok?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.280
RUTH ZUKERMAN: The Reebok Club.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.196
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:05:18.196 --> 00:05:20.310
So is your method the
instructor that you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.860
fell in love with there,
that really motivated you

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.606
and kept you coming back,
or is it kind of your own

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:26.230
on top of that?

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.188
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Well, it
started with the method

00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:29.890
of the instructor
who became my guru.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.670
And we were also talking
about that phenomenon

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.230
where you go to
an exercise class

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.470
and you just really become
obsessed with one instructor.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.960
And I did with this
particular instructor.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.290
And two years in, he got up
in front of the class one day

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.180
and announced that he
was moving to Florida.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.760
And I was like, what?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.070
How am I going to even
continue with my life?

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.040
And that was the
moment when I decided

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.410
I was just going
to start teaching,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.600
because I didn't like any
of the other instructors.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.970
And I had a background,
obviously, in dance.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.040
And I had taught some
group exercise before that.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.060
So I started teaching.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.250
And then my five years
of teaching at Reebok

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.430
is when I really
honed my method,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.660
and added on to what he
taught me, and really spent

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.460
the time observing
what people liked,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.190
what they didn't like, what they
took to, what motivated them.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.420
And those were really the
formative years of my class.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.266
CHARITY WORRELL: And then from
there you formed SoulCycle.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:28.140
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I did.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.650
CHARITY WORRELL: With
Elizabeth and Julie.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.560
And how long did that take
from the thought of you

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.570
guys wanting to have a
spin class of your own,

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.250
because you noticed
that people that

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.402
were going into Reebok to take
spin were only taking spin--

00:06:41.402 --> 00:06:42.360
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Exactly.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.985
CHARITY WORRELL:
--that you wanted to--

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:46.290
you guys, I feel like,
were the pioneers

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.140
of this boutique fitness.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.105
So you wanted to start
this from like when

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:51.480
you thought of it
to how long did

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.870
it take to come off the ground?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.950
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So the fall of
2005, Elizabeth approached me.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.300
She was a rider in my class.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.830
And said, I want to open up
a dedicated boutique fitness

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.870
studio that only has spin.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.060
And are you interested?

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.561
I know nothing about spin.

00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.560
I would love you to be
the face of the business,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.520
and have it be all about your
method, and the way you teach.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.540
And what do you think?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.440
And I mean, within a
nanosecond I was like I'm in.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.730
It was a dream of mine.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.450
I didn't have the
capital to fund it.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.430
She did.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.440
And so that was in the fall.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.410
And then eventually, Julie, who
was also a rider in my class,

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.720
was always interested in
opening a spin business

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.761
and she and I used to talk
about it all the time,

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.360
but neither one of us
had the money to do it.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.270
So I am a very loyal
person, and I felt bad

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.650
that it was Elizabeth and
I, and there was Julie.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.610
So I introduced
Julie to Elizabeth

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.650
thinking she'd be a
great third partner.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.330
And they hit it off.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.760
And in answer to
your question, we

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.740
started really formulating our
ideas in probably December,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.495
and we opened our
doors in April of 2006.

00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:08.370
CHARITY WORRELL: Wow.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.161
That's pretty fast.

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:10.740
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So not that long.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.650
CHARITY WORRELL: And then
it built momentum and then

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.992
there was a dissolution
of partnership.

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:16.950
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Correct.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.741
CHARITY WORRELL: And
you still taught there

00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.160
for a couple of years after.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.199
And then you were approached
by two other riders.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:24.990
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.406
CHARITY WORRELL:
And then Flywheel

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:28.002
was born, which I'm
very happy about.

00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:28.793
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:08:28.793 --> 00:08:29.500
Thank you.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.650
CHARITY WORRELL:
I love Flywheel.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.200
So how did that--

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.850
leaving SoulCycle to
go found a competitor--

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.240
how did that happen?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.590
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So with the way
things went down at SoulCycle,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.970
I was very ready to leave.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.970
And I met, as you said, one
of my future co-founders

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.867
who was in my class.

00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:52.950
[CLEARS THROAT] Excuse me.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.087
The other one, he
never took class--

00:08:55.087 --> 00:08:55.920
CHARITY WORRELL: No.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.628
RUTH ZUKERMAN: --but
he was his partner--

00:08:57.628 --> 00:08:59.220
they were both in
private equity.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.360
And basically, they saw
this business in SoulCycle,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.690
and saw the throngs
of people coming in,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.850
and sat and crunched
the numbers one day,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.160
and said this is
a real business,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.730
and wanted to get in on it.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.490
And so Jay-- one of them--

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.300
he is the one that came up
with the idea of attaching

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.176
a little computer
screen to all the bikes

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:22.050
where you can be
accountable, where you could

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.790
know where your
resistance should be,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.350
what your speed should be.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.560
And they found me and
presented this idea to me.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.000
And initially, I
was a little dubious

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.370
because I thought
so much of my ride

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.770
was about riding,
closing your eyes,

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.800
going inside, tapping
into what was going on,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.275
tapping into the song on
the playlist, a memory

00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:44.370
or whatever it was.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.370
And I thought, well, now if
we have numbers, I don't know.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.610
It's distracting.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.450
And then we can't really
do the mind thing.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.710
And so I wasn't really sure.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.740
And they said,
well, just try it.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.450
Go into a room by
yourself with the bike

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.490
and see what you think.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.420
And that's what I did.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.830
And within 15 minutes I
was like this is genius.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.140
And the other thing that was so
exciting about it was it just

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.600
became such an
obvious differentiator

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.930
between what was to become
Flywheel and SoulCycle.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.840
So here we were starting
second in the market,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.050
but it was such a
different product

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.280
that I absolutely knew
there would be room for it.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.950
CHARITY WORRELL: So how
was it trying to, I guess,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.500
change your teaching
method, because SoulCycle

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.770
is so different than Flywheel.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.890
Was it more difficult when you
had to add in metrics and teach

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.850
by numbers?

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.284
And did that affect
how you taught at all?

00:10:40.284 --> 00:10:42.200
RUTH ZUKERMAN: It
definitely changed the class

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.730
that I had started at SoulCycle.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.310
But I was able to
still incorporate

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.080
some mind body connection
stuff with the metrics.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.650
And I so quickly realized
that it was such a game

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.830
changer in terms of, as I
said, being accountable.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.070
And then what happened was
I started seeing the results

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.080
in people's bodies, in
their joy and gratification

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.720
that they got from
this kind of class

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.880
with these kind of
real-time results.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.454
And so I was a fan
from the get-go.

00:11:16.454 --> 00:11:17.870
CHARITY WORRELL:
I read an article

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.494
that said the difference
between people

00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:21.850
that ride at
SoulCycle and Flywheel

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.010
are that Flywheel
people are masochists.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.380
I was like me.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.505
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Interesting.

00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:31.921
I know some masochists
at SoulCycle.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:33.920
CHARITY WORRELL: I just
feel like it's very type

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.117
A. It's very competitive.

00:11:35.117 --> 00:11:36.450
RUTH ZUKERMAN: It absolutely is.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.530
CHARITY WORRELL: You
have a leaderboard.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.380
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.296
It's very competitive.

00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:42.900
CHARITY WORRELL: It's definitely
why I'm a huge fan of it.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.810
So how do you pick
your playlist?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.810
Is it just your mood or is it
based on the numbers we get

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.590
in class?

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.090
Or how do you decide?

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.240
RUTH ZUKERMAN: It's
so instinctual.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.630
Music has always been a
really huge part of my life,

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.680
especially being a dancer.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.920
Growing up, I don't know
music was my escape.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.290
I had a kind of very
difficult mother,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.910
which I talk about in the book.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.050
And when things got tough,
I would go in my room

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.040
and listen to music.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.060
And I ended up really learning
a lot about all different kinds

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.156
of genres of music through
my father and the music that

00:12:21.156 --> 00:12:23.030
was always played in my
household growing up,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.680
and dancing, obviously.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.440
And so making the playlist
was such a huge part

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.830
of my enjoyment in what I do.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.800
I spend an enormous amount
of time making my playlists--

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.300
too much time--

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.140
but I love it.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.380
And so very mood-driven.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.690
I would typically make
a playlist for my class

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.620
the night before.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.910
And then I would wake
up in the morning

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.951
and leave myself time,
because I would completely

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:50.520
change it the next morning.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.220
So again, way too
much time spent on it.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.620
But it ended up bringing
very successful playlists

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.670
that people really liked.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.305
And making them eclectic
was really important too.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:03.680
So hopefully,
there was something

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.000
for everyone in the class.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.990
CHARITY WORRELL: So
then you had Flywheel.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.410
And you and David and
Jay were cranking along

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.840
and it started to
become successful.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.875
And then Lew Frankfort
became a series B investor.

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:19.840
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yeah.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.870
Series C, actually.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.060
CHARITY WORRELL:
Series C, oh, OK.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.730
How did that change
the dynamics of when

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.902
it was the start-ups to then
becoming a bigger brand?

00:13:30.902 --> 00:13:32.360
How did that change--
did it change

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.180
how you taught or the
dynamics of the relationships

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.320
within that you had with the
instructors or in general?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.330
Because I know when Google--

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.880
obviously, I've heard people
talk about when they were here

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.350
before--

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.780
it became public-- the
difference in the culture

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.870
then when you become this giant
company, which Flywheel now is.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.680
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.540
Huge change.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.690
Lew initially became a
strategic investor-- series C.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.470
And when that
happened, the change

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.620
wasn't felt that obviously,
because we were all there.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.670
David and Jay were there.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.800
And we were still--

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.720
Lew had input on decisions--
but we were still

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.310
making most of the decisions.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.450
It wasn't until 2014
when Lew and his family

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.170
acquired the business that
things really changed.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.440
So within the first two months,
my two co-founders were out.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.650
And that in itself was a
huge adjustment for me.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.970
And just the culture
changed drastically.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.780
Suddenly-- I mean, my original
office that I shared with Jay

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.670
was an electrical closet.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.160
And I mean, we couldn't
even back up our chairs

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.640
without hitting each other.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.540
But it didn't matter.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.910
We didn't care.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.660
And then this happened,
the company was acquired,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.860
and suddenly we're in offices
that are a city block long.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.430
And the whole culture
changed in that it just

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.050
became much more corporate.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.930
So I suddenly was
in this environment

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.330
where I didn't even
understand the language.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.040
It was like I'd be at
a meeting and they'd

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.860
ask us to turn in our--

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.850
hold on-- our strategic
operative initiatives.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.269
And I'd be like, what?

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:16.060
I had no idea what they
were talking about.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.570
And then someone
whispered to me,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.830
it just means what's your plan.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.090
And then I felt, well,
why don't they say that?

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.530
It was just such a shock for me.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.630
And it was a real
growing experience,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.720
which we talked about too.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.500
CHARITY WORRELL: So what
was it like, I guess, when--

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.510
after Lew took over--

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.200
you did talk about
in the book that--

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.930
I'm trying to frame
this correctly.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.560
Not that you were
trying to be forced

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.560
into a different position,
but the expectations

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.309
of what your role were
to be had changed.

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:54.100
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.391
CHARITY WORRELL: And where
you really enjoyed teaching,

00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:58.840
you were now pushed
in this business role

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.930
and that didn't
really make you happy.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.440
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Correct.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.270
I found the whole--

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.850
I found all the changes
to be intimidating,

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.490
because it was just
out of my comfort zone.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:15.130
And right from the get-go,
Lew wanted to mold me

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.240
in a very different way.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.890
And suddenly my days were spent
in meetings after meetings.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:26.590
And a lot of talking and ideas.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.230
But ideas that weren't
necessarily being executed.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.210
But we would just keep
having more meetings.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.460
And I went into this business
exactly for the exact reason

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.430
that I didn't want to be
sitting in a meeting all day.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.110
And so it just became
really difficult.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.950
And I just stood
up one day and I

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.570
said this isn't working for me.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.070
And I had no idea how
they were going to react.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.320
But clearly, they needed me.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.140
So they were open to
what I had to say.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.890
And through that
process, I really

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.320
ended up going
back to what I did

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.450
best, which was being in charge
of everything that went on

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.810
in the four walls of the studio.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.520
And training instructors,
teaching classes,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.250
being back in charge
of the method,

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.710
and all things creative.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.890
That was my happy place.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.732
So I did, through a series
of events, get back there.

00:17:19.732 --> 00:17:21.190
CHARITY WORRELL:
So the other focus

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.290
on the book that I really
liked was you, again,

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.140
talked about a lot
of personal things.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.420
The relationship that
you had with your mother

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.230
and your father.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.180
That was kind of a triangle.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.760
This triangle theme I
noticed a lot in the book.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.700
So it goes from your
mother to your father.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.130
Then with your
husband and Felipe.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.400
Then Julie and Elizabeth.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.523
Then David and Jay.

00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:44.606
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Keep going.

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:45.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.022
CHARITY WORRELL: And
then your twin daughters.

00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:47.970
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.180
It never ends.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.772
CHARITY WORRELL: Have
you noticed this a lot

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.930
when you're attracted
to certain situations,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.110
if there's some kind
of trio that happens.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.980
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Apparently,
that is what happens.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.840
And as I also talk
about in the book,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.240
I started therapy a long
time ago when I was 35.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.560
And I'm 60.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.230
I'll be 61 in March.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.850
So I've had a lot of years in
terms of learning about myself.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:24.820
And I certainly am more aware
than ever of the triangles

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.540
and really hope I
don't have any more.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.437
Really hope so.

00:18:30.437 --> 00:18:32.020
CHARITY WORRELL:
What I really enjoyed

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.700
is you definitely were
not afraid to talk

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.780
about uncomfortable things and
how you reinvented yourself.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.500
And really how at any
age you can do that.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.380
If you're unhappy with
something, you can change it.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.620
And if you're passionate about
something, if you follow that,

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.870
things will just kind of
fall into place, which I felt

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.310
like happened a lot with you.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.510
Do you have any advice
for other entrepreneurs

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.317
who are looking to
start a business?

00:19:01.317 --> 00:19:02.150
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I do.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.570
I think we all want
to do that now.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.430
We all want to be
entrepreneurs and come up

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.290
with the next great idea.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:14.980
And this concept of finding your
passion is spoken about a lot.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:20.020
And I always like to tell people
that you just don't sit down

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.820
one day and find your passion.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.310
And sometimes it comes to
you when you least expect it.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.090
And after I gave up dancing,
which had been my passion,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.400
my whole life, starting
from age eight,

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.290
I never in a million
years thought

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.030
I would ever be passionate
about something else.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.180
And the reason why I
found spin was really

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.290
because through a
lot of years I just

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.960
tried to be open to all
kinds of experiences.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.750
And a lot of those
experiences were negative

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.950
and didn't work for me.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.610
I tried to work in an
office as an office manager

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.172
at a catering company, because
I was interested in food.

00:19:57.172 --> 00:19:58.630
I did that after
I gave up dancing,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.504
because I had no idea
what I was going to do.

00:20:00.504 --> 00:20:02.530
And you know what,
I hated it, and I

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.390
learned that I don't
want to sit at a desk.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.990
So that was informative.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.270
As I was going through
the trauma of my divorce,

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.590
that's when I found spinning.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.950
And I decided one day,
again, to just head

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.920
into that kind of
intimidating feeling--

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.160
spin room at the
gym I belonged to--

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.190
after several weeks of
walking back and forth

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.160
and should I or shouldn't I.
And one day, I don't know,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.960
something in me said, oh,
just go in there and try it.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.770
And I did.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.990
And that was when
I found spinning.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.760
But there was a lot in between.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.410
And so I just think it's
important to have faith

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.290
and know that you will find it.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.220
And it might not happen
when you expect it to.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.880
CHARITY WORRELL: So you
recently left Flywheel.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.050
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I did.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.342
Very recently.

00:20:54.342 --> 00:20:56.050
CHARITY WORRELL: Which
I saw in December.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.590
What are you most
excited to get into next

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.710
or is it just kind
of open-ended?

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.600
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Big breath.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.680
So I'm in my
non-compete period now,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.200
so I can't really talk
about what's next.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.650
And I don't know
definitively what it is.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.680
I'm trying to--
right now my process

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.860
is about having actually
lots of meetings

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:24.460
with different kinds of people,
and figuring out what people

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.430
want, what people still desire.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.130
We're in this age of everything
going digital, obviously,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.070
and people working
out by themselves

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.490
in their home, which is really
kind of the opposite of what

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.300
I've always done.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.620
And so I'm gathering
a lot of information

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.300
about how much of a desire
is there still for the group

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.220
experience, and
working out together,

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.850
and building a community?

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.680
Studying trends right
now and letting that help

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.370
me get to that next decision.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.080
So I really don't
know yet, but it

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.200
will be in fitness, of course,
because that's what I do best.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.460
And we'll see.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.965
It's exciting.

00:22:07.965 --> 00:22:09.340
CHARITY WORRELL:
Touching on that

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.530
a little bit about
working out at home,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.110
I read in the book
that the owner

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.139
or the person that
invented Peloton--

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:16.930
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.925
CHARITY WORRELL: --approached
you guys about partnering.

00:22:18.925 --> 00:22:19.841
RUTH ZUKERMAN: He did.

00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:23.024
CHARITY WORRELL: And was it Lew
that didn't want to go for it?

00:22:23.024 --> 00:22:23.940
RUTH ZUKERMAN: It was.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.300
CHARITY WORRELL: Wow.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.799
Interesting.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:25.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:25.638 --> 00:22:27.782
I mean, missed opportunity.

00:22:27.782 --> 00:22:30.370
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yeah,
he specifically

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.740
said if we're going to
get into that business,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.870
we'll do it ourselves.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.020
And that was his belief.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.270
CHARITY WORRELL: What are
your feelings on the working

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.352
out alone, having the
interactive class as

00:22:43.352 --> 00:22:44.560
opposed to being in the room?

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.018
I mean, I know how
I feel about it.

00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:47.260
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yeah.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.060
Look, I feel like
obviously it was

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.410
a great opportunity for John.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.130
He's done incredibly well.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.852
The company is
valued at $4 billion,

00:22:57.852 --> 00:22:58.810
I think, at this point.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.250
CHARITY WORRELL: Now
they're adding treading.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:00.750
I just saw--

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.600
RUTH ZUKERMAN: They have a
treadmill component as well.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.280
So obviously, there's a market
for it and a need for it.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.950
I still firmly
believe that there

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.580
are enough people out there
who want the group experience.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.720
And truthfully, so much of
the success of both SoulCycle

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.250
and Flywheel was the building
of this exceptional community.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.590
And the community
obviously consists

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.570
of people sharing in
this experience together.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.780
And personally, and
I could be wrong,

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.610
I just feel that in this day and
age of so much disconnection,

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:42.430
and working out alone or
being on our phones all day,

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.340
I feel like human connection
will never really go out

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:45.940
of style.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.360
And I think it's always
an innate need for us.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.130
And I feel for
that reason, there

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.490
will always be a market
and enough people

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.460
out there who want
to go back to that.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.717
And I feel that--

00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:01.800
I'm just going to say it--

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.860
I feel like in this
huge expansion that

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.840
occurred for Flywheel
and SoulCycle,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.520
I think a lot of that got lost.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.820
A lot of the community and that
high touch customer service.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.870
And so I feel like there
is a need to bring it back.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.810
And I do think that
things go in full circles.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.504
So I'm thinking
a lot about that.

00:24:20.504 --> 00:24:21.420
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.910
I definitely think that
there's a lot more energy

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.500
that you get when
you're physically

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.750
in the class than
working out at home.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:32.830
I just, personally for
me, I'm more accountable

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.400
when I have people around me
than it's just me by myself.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.046
And I think a great
instructor also motivates you

00:24:40.046 --> 00:24:41.670
when you're physically
looking at them,

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.753
and they call out your
name, like we talked about.

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:47.430
it motivates you to push
even more to really get

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.289
in the uncomfortable place.

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:51.330
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Right,
because it's the connection

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.410
you have with the instructor.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.360
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah,
and you will go very far

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
for that one instructor.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.510
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.760
CHARITY WORRELL: It's amazing.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.657
It's amazing that I feel
your brand or brands,

00:25:02.657 --> 00:25:03.990
because SoulCycle is like that--

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.380
I know really
popular instructors,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.720
their classes will book up
the second that it opens.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.540
And people will pay extra
to have the early booking

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.830
for that reason.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:20.680
And I feel like Flywheel is just
a different kind of experience.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.590
And it's more
motivating to me when

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.480
I have a really good
instructor, that

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.880
keeps me accountable
physically in class

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.882
than I would by myself at home.

00:25:31.882 --> 00:25:32.840
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I agree.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.734
I get it.

00:25:33.734 --> 00:25:34.650
CHARITY WORRELL: Yeah.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.960
So onto some fun stuff now.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.110
In the book, you
talk about being

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.870
able to travel more after
your children were older

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.570
and you guys have trips
that you take together.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.310
And how much you
love to eat, which

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.240
is also why you enjoy
working out so much.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.346
What has been your--

00:25:53.346 --> 00:25:54.720
obviously, I'm
really into food--

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.100
we talked about this as well.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.743
What has been your most
favorite food experience?

00:26:01.743 --> 00:26:06.400
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Hmm,
I mean, I'm not

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.780
sure there was a specific one.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.930
But because my
partner and I were

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.620
both equally into eating good
food, literally every business

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.440
trip we would take, the
first thing we would do

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.900
is check out the best
restaurants in whatever city

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.500
we went to.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.180
So it was great.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.490
So I had great
dining experiences

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.370
in every city I went to.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.680
Yeah, I mean, the whole
premise of Flywheel,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.651
because of he and I, was all
about working hard, playing

00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:34.150
hard.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.180
And we were never
about deprivation

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.240
or cut out this, cut
out that from your diet.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.750
It was all about eating
whatever you want,

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.320
drinking, and just working
out hard on the Flywheel

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.070
bike the next day.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.528
CHARITY WORRELL:
Being accountable.

00:26:49.528 --> 00:26:51.300
RUTH ZUKERMAN: And
that was our mantra.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.740
Yeah, I mean, it was one of
the reasons why traveling

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.180
was so much fun
is because we got

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.540
to experience so many
different kinds of restaurants.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.140
CHARITY WORRELL: When you
were a part of Flywheel still

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.900
and you were looking
for instructors,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.910
was there some kind
of personality trait

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.230
or what struck you about who
you wanted to bring in to teach?

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.330
RUTH ZUKERMAN: We
certainly hired instructors

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.590
who liked to work hard.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:20.680
And motivate that way by being,
as we said, aspirational.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.380
That was our word when we were
looking for an instructor.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.660
They had to be
aspirational, whether it

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.190
was because of their
own physical prowess,

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.270
or a certain X factor that
was so important-- that

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.550
is so important in
every instructor--

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.030
and that was actually a
part of the personality that

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.190
was really hard to train.

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.230
They kind of either had to have
it or they weren't hireable.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.550
So again, some dynamic
in their personality

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:55.420
that could draw a rider in on
top of their physical strength.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.160
CHARITY WORRELL: Now, I know
that Flywheel recently--

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.169
maybe in the past couple
of years-- added--

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:01.960
I think it was previously
called Fly Beats,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.150
now it's called Tempo.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.600
And that is similar-ish
to SoulCycle,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:13.210
but it just has a little more
resistance than SoulCycle does.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.190
Is that the reason
you added that

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.700
in for people who were more
drawn to that kind of method,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.787
but also wanted the
metrics to go with it?

00:28:22.787 --> 00:28:25.120
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So that was a
really interesting learning

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.750
lesson.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.600
And the reason is,
yes, we decided

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.990
to add it because it was more
about a rhythm ride, which

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.990
is how the SoulCycle
ride is based.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.540
And we thought, well,
we should add it

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.510
and then we can cast our
net wider, and hopefully,

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.730
draw on some of those
riders who specifically

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.130
like that kind of ride.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:49.450
What I realized in retrospect
was I regretted it,

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.780
because I feel like,
do what you do well,

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.830
and really represent
the specialness

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.990
of your product and your ride.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.410
And don't feel that you
have to get everyone.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.770
There are enough people
out there, especially

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.960
in big urban cities--

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.990
New York, obviously-- there
are enough people out there

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.130
to fill your rooms.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.570
And why not just really
stick to what you do best?

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:21.460
And it just started
to dilute the product.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.110
And I wasn't really
crazy about the idea,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.660
to be honest with you.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.640
CHARITY WORRELL:
How did you decide

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.570
which locations you would
add it in to try it out?

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.170
Just the bigger cities?

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.650
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Our
initial way of identifying

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.440
locations was just open
next to a Whole Foods.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.236
It really was.

00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:41.890
That was our formula--

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.450
open next to a Whole Foods.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.854
And it always worked.

00:29:44.854 --> 00:29:46.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.320
We did mostly
choose urban areas.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.340
We did, however--
what we would do

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.030
is we'd find an urban area,
a spot next to a Whole Foods,

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:03.010
and then we would
open in a suburb close

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.130
to the initial studio.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.770
So that we could
format our instructors

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.680
and they could actually
teach at both locations.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.200
And it was a great way to
utilize our instructor team.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.050
So we did add suburban
locations as well.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:25.720
There were exceptions, but some
did really well, some didn't.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.240
We just found the formula of--

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.900
we found it much safer
to open in urban areas

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.590
more than suburban areas.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:38.320
And I think that for some
reason in suburban areas,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.960
even if they were
wealthy areas, people

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.290
didn't want to spend money as
much as they do in the city.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.370
And that was an interesting
learning experience as well.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.620
I was just going to say when--

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.828
I just thought of this--
when we opened in Scarsdale,

00:30:51.828 --> 00:30:54.630
for example, I didn't
think about the fact that--

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.802
and I learned this from
our Scarsdale riders--

00:30:57.802 --> 00:30:59.260
they would say to
me, we don't want

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.880
to pay New York prices, that's
why we moved to Scarsdale.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.520
And it was like, oh,
that makes sense.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.141
So they would
complain all the time.

00:31:07.141 --> 00:31:09.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.346 --> 00:31:12.370
CHARITY WORRELL: What has been
your most favorite experience

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.800
that you've been
able to do because

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.830
of Flywheel or in SoulCycle?

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.810
Like something that
you were like, wow,

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.370
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.750
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Writing the book.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.450
I never in a million
years thought

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.660
I would ever be an author.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.640
But ironically-- and this is
kind of consistent with staying

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.350
open to things--

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.150
when I went through my divorce.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.100
And I was really a
fish out of water.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.770
I had no idea what I was
going to do with my life.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.960
And I decided to take a
course in memoir writing--

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.460
completely randomly.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.960
I knew that I always
liked to write,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.100
but just thought,
oh, that'll be fun.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.610
And so I never, again,
in a million years,

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.130
thought I would ever
write a book or a memoir.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.590
But maybe that
was foreshadowing.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.460
I don't know.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.020
CHARITY WORRELL: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.680
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.020
Thank you for having me.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.950
CHARITY WORRELL: It's literally
have been such a great time

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.220
talking with you today.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.926
I'm going to open it
up for questions now.

00:32:06.926 --> 00:32:08.800
If people want to walk
up to the microphones.

00:32:12.505 --> 00:32:14.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:14.980
Huge Flywheel fan.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.446
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Thank you.

00:32:15.446 --> 00:32:15.945
Yay!

00:32:15.945 --> 00:32:18.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I'd love to hear

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.990
more about the relationship
dynamics of your co-founders

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.090
at SoulCycle, because it
sounds like you were approached

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.006
by one, and that had
brought the other one in,

00:32:25.006 --> 00:32:26.990
and then you wound
up out of the mix.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.560
And having founded a startup
where we had a co-founder

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.380
breakup over time, I'm just
interested to learn how did

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.010
you--

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.690
what were the things that--

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.500
what went wrong and
what were the things

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.450
you were looking
for the next time

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.952
when you started into Flywheel
and maybe even moving on now?

00:32:40.952 --> 00:32:43.160
Like what are some of the
things that are top of mind

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.281
as you think about
your next venture?

00:32:45.281 --> 00:32:46.530
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Great question.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.720
I have to be a little careful
about what exactly happened

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.100
on that day at SoulCycle.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.560
But in retrospect, I've
really learned a lot

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.710
about the dynamic that
the three of us had

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.650
and the mistakes that
were made on my part.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.830
And it's been such a
growing experience for me,

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.550
learning through these mistakes.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:15.110
And as I talk about in the book,
and as Charity so aptly pointed

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.580
out, the whole triangle thing
which started with my parents

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.260
really was replicated in
that business partnership.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:31.040
And I ended up being comfortable
in a role that unfortunately

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.020
was comfortable
for me, which was

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:41.540
a role of taking the backseat,
being overpowered, being

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.870
what felt like bullied.

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:51.770
And quite frankly, not being
strong enough at various points

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.880
of my time at SoulCycle--
not being strong enough

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.350
to stand up for myself.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:02.280
And ultimately, it
worked against me.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.930
And I certainly had a lot
of learning experiences

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.090
to bring to my next
partnership at Flywheel

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.469
that was drastically different.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:14.449
So as I talk about that
question in the book,

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:19.440
it's really about self-awareness
and doing the work

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.219
to get to know yourself,
however that work plays out,

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.254
and not repeating patterns and
not making the same mistakes.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.690
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.130
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Hi.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.340
AUDIENCE: Another huge fan.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.178
You got me through my
pregnancy, and recovery,

00:34:37.178 --> 00:34:38.219
and the last eight years.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.429
RUTH ZUKERMAN: That's awesome.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.720
AUDIENCE: Just thank you,
thank you, thank you so much.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.989
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.489
AUDIENCE: I travel
a lot for work

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:46.199
and I oftentimes
find myself booking

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.630
hotels that are closer
to Flywheel locations,

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.690
because I know that even in
the change of my routine,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.620
I still get the experience
I want in cardio.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.990
And we still feel like
New York and the energy

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.940
you need for the day.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.929
Can you talk a little bit about
how the expansion strategy

00:35:02.929 --> 00:35:04.470
worked with also
making sure that you

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.680
had the same culture, and
energy, and type of trainers?

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.480
They do differ a bit
location to location.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.519
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yes.

00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:12.810
AUDIENCE: But how you keep
the consistency of the brand

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.340
with such a massive expansion.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.110
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So I'm
not going to lie--

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.840
and you actually
just pointed it out--

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.300
when the expansion got to a
certain point and it was really

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.650
big, it was hard--

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.010
it's hard to
maintain the culture.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:34.200
And up until a certain point,
we were able to maintain it.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.970
And I really feel
like that change

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.860
happened when we were taken
over and when we were acquired.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.240
At that point, we had 22
studios, which is still a lot.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.660
And I always say this,
it's not rocket science.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.560
My partner and I--

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.970
Jay-- our third partner stayed
in the background and did more

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.110
real estate and finance--

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.010
but Jay and I were
in the forefront.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:03.410
And I was the face and
Jay was in operations

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.830
and really ran the business.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.950
And as simple as this
sounds, Jay and I

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:11.790
are both very nice people.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.560
And unfortunately, we both had
this quality where we really

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.440
need to be liked by
everybody, which is not always

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.590
a really great quality.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.860
But we both had it.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.830
And so there's
such a trickle down

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.470
phenomenon that
happens from the top.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:34.900
And as a result, we just amassed
this amazing group of people.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.970
And it also had a lot to do with
how we treated our employees.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.370
And we considered
our employees to be

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.090
as important as our customers.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.630
And it didn't matter
what your role was.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.760
It didn't matter if
you were mopping floors

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.240
or you were a senior VP,
everybody was treated the same.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.494
And I think that because
of that, we just ended up--

00:36:57.494 --> 00:37:01.470
really great, nice, wonderful
people gravitated to us

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.170
and wanted to work with us.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.800
And that's why we
would always call it

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.160
the Fly family, the Fly fam,
because we all really felt

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.820
like a family.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.882
But no question, as we expanded
and the expansion continued--

00:37:13.882 --> 00:37:15.340
that's what I talked
about before--

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:21.910
where that specialness
kind of was compromised.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.190
AUDIENCE: I also love studying
all things fitness trends.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.460
So love that you're
into that as well.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.570
What are some of the studios
or concepts or things

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.000
that you're really looking at
that are doing it right now?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.150
And as you're thinking
about your future, what

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.710
insights do you think you'd
want to take from them?

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.340
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So it's
interesting because when I hear

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.420
about other successful
boutique fitness businesses--

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.550
we were talking about
Rumble, for example--

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.060
the ones that I hear a
lot of excitement about

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.470
are, again, the ones where
people are gravitating

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.490
toward the community.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.130
And so I've heard that
a lot about Rumble.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.535
And there was actually a
really interesting article--

00:38:01.535 --> 00:38:02.910
I don't know if
you guys saw it--

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.340
that came out recently in Vox.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:13.740
And the writer talked about
this concept of expansion.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.110
She talks a lot about
Flywheel and SoulCycle.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:22.470
And her opinion was that they
lost their focus and identity.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.620
And she spent a lot of
time talking about boutique

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.190
and how the smaller studios
that are coming up now

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.120
are actually doing better and
people are going back to that.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.330
And so I found that really
interesting in terms of trends

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.260
and things going full circle.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.640
But I hear a lot about Rumble.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.060
Boxing seems to
really be taking on.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.550
I do feel that
things have changed

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.970
so much since the days of
SoulCycle starting and Flywheel

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.410
starting.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.790
And I'm about to lose
my train of thought--

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:59.610
I know-- and so what's
been happening-- again,

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.090
the whole full circle thing
is-- a lot of these boutique

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.150
businesses that started
out as boutique,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.850
have now expanded
their modalities.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.940
And a Flywheel or
a SoulCycle started

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.100
adding a lot of different
kinds of classes.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.740
And now we see a
lot of these studios

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.020
with five different offerings.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.480
And in a sense, that
feels to me like,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:26.670
oh, so what started as a very
dedicated boutique business

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.110
has now actually
morphed into the big box

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.830
Jim, which is how we
started in the first place.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.930
So if I were to start again--

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:39.950
spoiler alert-- and I haven't
committed to anything.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:46.080
But I think that if I did
do another brick and mortar,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.010
it would never be about
one offering, which is what

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.740
it could be about initially.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.260
But I'd probably have
two and that would be it.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.270
I wouldn't want to make
it any bigger than that.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:02.120
And as I said before, I think
that the community aspect

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.820
and the connecting
with people is never

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.781
going to fall out of favor.

00:40:06.781 --> 00:40:07.614
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:08.170
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:08.475
AUDIENCE: I read
that article too.

00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:09.090
RUTH ZUKERMAN: What's that?

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.640
AUDIENCE: I read the
Vox article, too.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.515
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Right.

00:40:11.515 --> 00:40:12.820
I thought it was interesting.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.861
And it made me look really
good, so I liked that.

00:40:14.861 --> 00:40:16.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.110
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Hi.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.860
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.520
for making an
Android app finally.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.228
That was awesome.

00:40:21.228 --> 00:40:22.619
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:23.910
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.940
One is, what is your
personal fitness routine?

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.898
Are you still spinning?

00:40:26.898 --> 00:40:27.810
Do you teach?

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.170
And my second
question is, there's

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.440
a lot of new trends in
terms of virtual reality

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.190
where bikes are actually moving
in the rooms or music videos.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.260
Do you think those are
all gimmicks or are they

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.310
actually contributing
something to the experience?

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.060
RUTH ZUKERMAN: So it's
hard to answer that

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.680
without my own personal opinion.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.170
For myself, they do
seem gimmicky to me.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.050
It's just my opinion.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.120
As I said, I left
Flywheel December 31.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.260
But up until December 31, I was
teaching six to seven classes

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.670
a week.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.250
I can't ever imagine
not teaching.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.510
It's just what I do.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.810
And I love it and
it never gets old.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.110
And as I was saying to
Charity, I've been teaching--

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.230
I've been on a
bike for 21 years.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.960
Sadly, I hate to
even talk about this,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.890
but I am nursing a
back injury right now--

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:25.950
a lower back injury.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.230
So for the first time in
21 years, I'm off the bike

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.750
and I'm not doing
anything except going

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.100
to physical therapy.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.700
So it'll be interesting
to see if anything

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.530
changes being off the bike.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.510
I mean, I think one
of the reasons why

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.160
I've been such an
advocate for spinning

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.800
is that it's actually so
safe and it's low impact.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.860
And people can do it at any age.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.720
So whatever is
going on in my back,

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.200
maybe it's overuse and just
long-term kind of situation.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.730
Hopefully, it will
get better soon.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.270
But at the same time,
I am an advocate

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:04.380
to mixing it up and not
just doing one modality.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.170
I was doing SLT for awhile.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.340
And I enjoyed that.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.450
It's so challenging.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.410
And then of late, I've
been incorporating Pilates

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.160
into my routine, because I
think Pilates is so challenging,

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.442
but really effective.

00:42:17.442 --> 00:42:19.400
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask about the book, which

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.420
is your newest baby.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.300
And what I'm fascinated
by is, obviously, you've

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.010
left an amazing legacy.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.780
But also, as a
business woman who's

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.279
done very well, as you were
thinking about the book and all

00:42:30.279 --> 00:42:31.820
the many things you
can write about--

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.562
and I'm sure you had an eye
on the business aspect of what

00:42:34.562 --> 00:42:36.020
is the most
interesting, how do you

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.780
get the most viewers and
readers and what not.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.180
How did you decide what
to cover in the book

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.110
and what to emphasize on
and how to position it?

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.220
RUTH ZUKERMAN: The beginning--

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:50.570
sorry-- the genesis
of the book really

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:55.010
happened by me just
sitting down and starting

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.110
to write personal anecdotes.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.910
That's how I started it.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.950
I worked with a collaborator,
because I really

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.000
didn't know how to start.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.890
And she posed that to me.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.230
She said, what about
sitting down and writing

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:11.120
10 stories that come to
mind through the course

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:11.790
of your life.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.700
And so that's how I started.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.150
And so it really started I
think from a personal place,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.530
and then I was quickly
able to draw lessons

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:26.120
from personal experiences,
lessons that I learned in life,

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.950
and then applied
them to business.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.980
So that's kind of how
that theme happened.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.400
And it really came--

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.340
the whole idea to
do it that way just

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.170
happened really organically
and really easily.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:44.840
And again, it was very
consistent with me

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.710
because I am all
about not being afraid

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.470
of sharing personal
stories, and that's

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:52.770
how I connect with people.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:53.855
So it just made sense.

00:43:53.855 --> 00:43:56.480
AUDIENCE: So it was more organic
versus like a market research.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.563
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Absolutely.

00:43:57.563 --> 00:44:00.140
Much more organic, which
again, made sense for me

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.875
since no business experience.

00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:03.750
AUDIENCE: And I know I
have another question.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.430
I just wanted to say,
you look amazing.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.840
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Thank you.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.673
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
start spinning again.

00:44:07.673 --> 00:44:09.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.436
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I have to say,
I was a little disappointed,

00:44:11.436 --> 00:44:14.000
because usually it comes
out in my talks that I'm 60,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.010
and it usually gets
a huge response.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.170
And all of you guys were
like, yeah, whatever.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.984
So thank you.

00:44:21.984 --> 00:44:23.900
CHARITY WORRELL: Are
there any more questions?

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.101
Oh, here we are.

00:44:26.101 --> 00:44:27.600
AUDIENCE: I'm also
nursing an injury

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.860
and I'm a big time
runner, so I sympathize--

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.620
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Oh, sorry.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.440
AUDIENCE: --with how
terrible and disruptive

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.120
it is with your life.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.840
RUTH ZUKERMAN: It's the worst.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.350
AUDIENCE: I was in Pilates
and PT, so I understand.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.310
But I wanted to learn
a little bit more

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.060
about the marketing aspect
of the Flywheel brand.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.630
I'm in ad sales here at Google.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.129
And I always think
it's interesting,

00:44:45.129 --> 00:44:47.100
especially in a super
competitive environment

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.670
like fitness, especially
with the rise of social media

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.580
and just all of the
community aspects of it.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.660
But how do you still make paid
advertising and paid marketing

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.320
really work for your brand
and actually drive results?

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.990
So I'd love to hear
more about that.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.823
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Sure.

00:45:02.823 --> 00:45:06.390
So we never advertised, ever.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.770
This business was so word of
mouth that we never needed to.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.610
Things have changed now.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:17.730
And it's interesting--
marketing and branding--

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:21.300
I remember specifically
when we started Flywheel,

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.024
we really had no idea what our
brand was going to look like.

00:45:25.024 --> 00:45:26.940
And people would say,
well, what's your brand?

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.390
And my partner and I
would say, we don't know.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.210
And we just started the
business and the brand

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.180
came to us through
trial and error.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.260
And it was just a way to
figure out who we were.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.820
And then we actually
hired a marketing team

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.120
to work with us about a year in.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.520
And they were the ones who came
up with the idea of never coast

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.200
and we loved that.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.700
And so that really became
a game-changer for us.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:02.130
And that was something we could
really hang on to and build

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.251
a marketing plan from.

00:46:04.251 --> 00:46:04.750
Yeah.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a
question about the pricing

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.420
and how you came up with
that, because SoulCycle to me

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.310
seems like one of the
first kind of boutique,

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:18.490
or the most well-known
early boutique places.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.640
And I was wondering how you
guys came up with the pricing

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.590
strategy and having no
memberships and stuff

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.130
like this at a gym.

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.700
And then if it was
a conscious decision

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.370
to change your mind
when going to Flywheel.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.900
I'm just basically
wondering how did

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.524
you know that people
were going to want

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:37.344
to pay this type of money to
do a boutique fitness class,

00:46:37.344 --> 00:46:39.760
because it doesn't really seem
like people were doing that

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:40.600
before.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.840
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Purely ripped
it off from SoulCycle.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:44.410
We did.

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.760
I mean, we just used--

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.340
looked at their model as to how
they priced and replicated it.

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.350
We knew that they
were getting it,

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.870
because the business was booming
at that point when I left.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.080
And so that's how we did it.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:06.460
However, over time we
changed our strategy,

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:11.440
because they became through
their pricing even more

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.280
elitist.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.200
And we really wanted
to move away from that.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.980
I mean, they offered
their Super Soul for $70

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.020
for a 45-minute spin class.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.850
And that just wasn't us.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.020
It wasn't our identity.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:27.400
And we really wanted to
build a business that

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.890
was about inclusiveness,
and SoulCycle to us

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.470
seemed like a business that
was about exclusiveness.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:41.100
So that was very important in
how we went about our pricing.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.280
I personally was not in charge
of that part of the business,

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.400
so I can't speak with
too much detail about it.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.740
But I know that the membership
idea really took off for us

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.170
and people loved membership,
because they could really

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.257
get in a lot of classes
for a lot less money.

00:47:58.257 --> 00:47:59.340
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.589
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:03.840
CHARITY WORRELL: What I do love
is that you give the spin shoes

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.720
for free rental, whereas
SoulCycle I think

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.592
goes like $3 or $4.

00:48:07.592 --> 00:48:08.376
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Yeah, and water.

00:48:08.376 --> 00:48:09.000
Paid for water as well.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.830
CHARITY WORRELL:
Yeah, which is great,

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:11.850
because you don't
have to bring anything

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.020
with you, which is amazing.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.250
RUTH ZUKERMAN: And
that was another way

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.290
in which we started the
business and figured out

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:20.670
things was, obviously, I was
coming from SoulCycle and so

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:24.990
what better way than for me
to look back on SoulCycle

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.510
and know what worked
and what didn't work.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.217
And the things that
worked, we kept.

00:48:30.217 --> 00:48:32.050
And the things that
didn't work, we changed.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.490
And one of the things I knew
from the rider experience

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.954
was they would come to
take class and then,

00:48:37.954 --> 00:48:39.870
oh, they'd have to take
out their wallet again

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:42.720
to pay for water or take out
their wallet to pay for shoes.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.310
And they really
kind of resented it.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.590
So that was just
one example of how

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.560
we thought we are going
to do away with that.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.018
CHARITY WORRELL:
One last question.

00:48:50.018 --> 00:48:52.200
AUDIENCE: I think I have
a good last question.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.380
So we have a spin studio
on the 14th floor.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.700
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I saw it.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.680
AUDIENCE: Once
your back gets back

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.930
in order, what are the
chances you come and teach us?

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.590
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I was
actually thinking about that.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.290
I really was.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:05.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.410
AUDIENCE: We can help organize.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.493
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I'll do it.

00:49:08.493 --> 00:49:09.130
Yeah.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:09.630
I'll do it.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.446
AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:49:10.446 --> 00:49:11.670
CHARITY WORRELL: Woo-hoo!

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.160
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Now I'm actually
wondering if that would

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.720
interfere with my non-compete.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.009
But I mean, come on.

00:49:17.009 --> 00:49:18.300
AUDIENCE: We won't tell anyone.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.236
RUTH ZUKERMAN:
Don't tell anyone.

00:49:20.236 --> 00:49:21.028
Yeah, that'll work.

00:49:21.028 --> 00:49:23.361
CHARITY WORRELL: Because I
never got to take your class.

00:49:23.361 --> 00:49:23.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.451
RUTH ZUKERMAN: I
would love to do it.

00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:26.796
Thank you for inviting me.

00:49:26.796 --> 00:49:28.170
CHARITY WORRELL:
And Ruth will be

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.370
upstairs to sign books after.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.180
So if everyone wants
to queue upstairs,

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.050
she'll be signing things
and you can buy the book.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.570
And thank you so
much for coming.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:36.930
RUTH ZUKERMAN: You're welcome.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:38.320
CHARITY WORRELL: It was
such a pleasure meeting you.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.361
RUTH ZUKERMAN: Thank you.

00:49:39.361 --> 00:49:40.470
[APPLAUSE]
