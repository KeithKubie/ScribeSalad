00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.350
The overall revenue
management problem

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.550
involves a network of airports
and literally thousands

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.750
of flights.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.550
Clearly optimization is needed.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.530
Myopic solutions leave
significant revenue

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.160
on the table.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.480
Furthermore, revenue
management involves

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.990
tens of different classes that
have different restrictions,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.080
different characteristics
like mile awards, and fares.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
PEOPLExpress could not compete
with American Airlines'

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.280
Ultimate Super Saver fares.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.630
Donald Burr, CEO of
PEOPLExpress in 1985,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.700
notes, "We were a vibrant,
profitable company

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.620
from 1981 to 1985, and
then we tipped right over

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.370
into losing $50 million a month.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.910
We had been profitable
from the day

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.360
we started until American
came at us with Ultimate Super

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780
Savers."

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.760
Revenue management
is the science

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.950
of selling the right seats
to the right customers

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.850
at the right prices.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.970
To illustrate the impact
that revenue management has

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.500
had on American
Airlines, we note

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.780
what Robert Crandall,
CEO of American,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.910
wrote during the period
that revenue management

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.740
practices were applied.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.229
"Revenue management is
the single most important

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.000
technical development in
transportation management

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.360
since we entered the era
of airline deregulation.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.550
We estimate that
revenue management

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.729
has generated $1.4 billion
in incremental revenue

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.050
in the last three years."

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.120
Let us see the impact of
revenue management more broadly.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.250
Today, American Airlines
has emerged from bankruptcy

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.370
by merging with US Air Airlines.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.240
However, American
Airlines has spun

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.889
off Sabre Holdings,
the entity that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.100
built revenue
management for American.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.000
As of November 2012,
Sabre ranked 133rd

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.430
among America's largest private
companies with $3.15 billion

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.390
in sales, 400 airlines, 90,000
hotels, and 30 car rental

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.560
companies as clients.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.560
Today, companies prosper
from revenue management.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920
Delta Airlines, for example,
increased annual revenue

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.550
by $300 million.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.460
Marriott hotels increased
annual revenue by $100 million.
