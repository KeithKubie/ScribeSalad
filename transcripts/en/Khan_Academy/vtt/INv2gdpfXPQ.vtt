00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.329
- [Instructor] Hinduism is often known

00:00:02.329 --> 00:00:05.661
for its large and
complex pantheon of gods.

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:07.830
The goal of this video is
to give an overview of them

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.658
and to think about how they are connected,

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:12.132
and how they are perceived.

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:15.542
So the Hindu Trinity,
as it is often called,

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:19.073
is made up of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma.

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:20.773
They are often considered to be

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:23.988
the three most important gods.

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.992
In modern-day Hinduism,

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:30.259
Shiva and Vishnu have
far more followership,

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.534
I guess you can say,

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:33.963
or more people view Shiva or Vishnu

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:35.035
as the Supreme Being.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.851
There's more temples
dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu

00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:40.163
than there are too Brahma.

00:00:40.163 --> 00:00:41.783
Followers of Shiva,

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:45.772
those who view him as the Supreme Being,

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:47.385
they're called Shaivas.

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.223
They're following Shaivism,

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:52.268
or sometimes referred to as Shivaism.

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:55.191
Shiva has multiple
aspects and as we'll see,

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:57.992
many of these gods have multiple aspects

00:00:57.992 --> 00:00:59.698
and multiple connections,

00:00:59.698 --> 00:01:02.661
but is often referred to as the Destroyer

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.932
or the Transformer.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.477
Vishnu, as I've mentioned,

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:08.763
also has a significant following,

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:12.042
a significant chunk of
Hindus are Vaishnivas,

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:16.185
or followers of Vaishnavism or Vishnuism.

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:19.357
And Vishnu is considered the Preserver.

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:21.017
Brahma, as I mentioned,

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:25.365
does not have as much followership
in modern-day Hinduism,

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.248
but he is considered to be the Creator.

00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:30.023
Now in some narratives,

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.786
he is the Creator and in other narratives,

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:36.492
he has been created by
either Shiva or Vishnu.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:40.754
Now Brahma should not be
confused with Brahman,

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:42.741
that we talked about in previous videos.

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.552
Brahman is considered
the absolute reality.

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:48.661
the true nature of things.

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.282
And Brahma you could
view as an aspect of it.

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:55.566
It is one God as part of
this true nature of things.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.479
In fact, everything you see on this video,

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.096
in fact everything you see in reality,

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:01.457
all of these gods to a Hindu

00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:05.284
could be considered as just
aspects of the true God

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:07.867
or the true reality of Brahman.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:11.286
Now what's interesting in Hinduism

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:15.453
is that gods are not viewed
to have a strict gender.

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:19.989
For example, Vishnu has
a female incarnation

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.874
and there's also groups of Hindus

00:02:23.874 --> 00:02:28.866
who view God as taking a
fundamentally female form.

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:33.292
One group are known as
the followers of Shaktism.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.632
To Shaktism, God is female,

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:38.747
the supreme goddess and takes many forms.

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:40.531
Parvati as you see listed here

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:42.346
is referred to the Divine Mother.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:46.041
She's viewed as Shiva's
consort or Shiva's wife,

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.479
but she has other forms like Durga

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.595
which is used as a stronger,

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:52.568
more aggressive form of Parvati,

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.905
sometimes referred to as Devi or Shakti.

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:57.036
Shakti means strength or power

00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.012
and is a warrior goddess.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.787
You have Lakshmi who
is the wife of Vishnu,

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:05.761
who represents or has aspects
of wealth and prosperity.

00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:08.021
You have Saraswati who has aspects

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.168
of knowledge, music and the arts

00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:14.517
and is viewed as the consort
or the wife of Brahma.

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:16.337
Now these are some of
the principal deities

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:18.239
that we have on this top row,

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.238
but there's also many, many
other significant deities.

00:03:21.238 --> 00:03:22.293
And as we will see,

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:24.830
depending on what part of India you're in

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.751
and which group subsect
of Hinduism you meet,

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.277
they will place different
levels of emphasis

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.502
on different deities

00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:35.085
and have different traditions
and different rituals.

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:37.920
So Ganesh who is very recognizable

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.198
because he has an elephant head,

00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:43.250
he is often referred to as Ganpati.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.955
He is viewed as the son
of Shiva and Parvati.

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:49.659
There's a great story about how he,

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.262
why he has this elephant head.

00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:55.265
He is viewed as the god of new beginnings

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:57.662
and the remover of obstacles.

00:03:57.662 --> 00:04:00.549
He has a lot of followership
and he is revered

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.665
in a lot of regions of western India,

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:03.799
and that's not the only places,

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.712
but he is known to be a principal God

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:08.150
in some of these regions.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.581
Durga similarly, that I referred to,

00:04:10.581 --> 00:04:12.770
in eastern India, especially Bengal,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.559
the place where my family comes from,

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.117
Durga Puja, the Puja for Durga,

00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:20.120
the rituals for Durga are considered to be

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.037
a very the important part
of the Hindu religion.

00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:25.762
If you go into the south,

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:27.245
for some Hindus,

00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:30.138
Karthikeya or also known as Murugan,

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:32.268
might be a significant deity.

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:34.520
That is the god of war.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.702
Vishnu is known to have
multiple incarnations

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:39.246
that are very prominent.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:42.123
The most prominent of which are Rama,

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:43.992
Vishnu's seventh incarnation.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.723
He is the main protagonist in the Ramayan,

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:48.582
the famous Hindu epic.

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:52.258
You have Krishna, who is
Vishnu's eighth incarnation.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.672
And he is a significant
figure throughout Hinduism,

00:04:54.672 --> 00:04:56.278
including the Mahabharata

00:04:56.278 --> 00:04:58.142
and the subset of the Mahabharata,

00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:00.465
which is the Bhagavad Gita.

00:05:00.465 --> 00:05:01.781
Now what's really interesting,

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.329
and I already alluded to it,

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.591
is you have all of this
diversity in Hinduism.

00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:10.351
Someone who worships Shiva,

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:12.678
you might see at a superficial level,

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:15.830
seems more different in their
rituals and their beliefs

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.591
from someone who worships Vishnu,

00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:21.842
than say, a Protestant from
a Catholic in Christianity

00:05:21.842 --> 00:05:24.509
or a Sunni from a Shia in Islam.

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.971
And what's fascinating about Hinduism

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:30.323
is that you don't see
these traditional schisms,

00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:32.314
you don't see a lot of conflict

00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:35.287
between the Shaivas or the Vaishnavas,

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:36.462
because to Hindus,

00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:38.656
even though you have this
diversity of practice

00:05:38.656 --> 00:05:41.785
across India or across
the Hindu tradition,

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:45.849
they're all viewed as aspects of Brahman.

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.793
They're all viewed as
different ways to visualize

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:53.241
or to connect with the fundamental reality

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.355
or the fundamental god.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.688
And because Hinduism
has been able to merge

00:05:58.688 --> 00:06:00.514
these very diverse practices,

00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:01.814
these very diverse rituals,

00:06:01.814 --> 00:06:05.541
and it's believed this emerged
because as Hinduism emerged,

00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.520
it took traditions from the
Indus valley civilization.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.359
It took significant traditions
from the Indo-Aryans.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:14.234
It took significant traditions
from the Dravidians.

00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:16.021
Instead of saying, "Hey
our different traditions

00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:17.494
"are different religions,"

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:21.167
they merged over thousands
of years into one religion.

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:22.960
And the word for this merging,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.727
taking an amalgamation
of multiple rituals,

00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:28.962
multiple ideas, multiple,
multiple practices,

00:06:28.962 --> 00:06:30.775
and turning them into one

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:33.302
is known as syncretism.

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:37.537
Hinduism is perhaps the
best example of syncretism

00:06:37.537 --> 00:06:40.527
where you have these
incredibly diverse practices.

00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:43.572
The gods that I show here
are just a sample of them,

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.010
but they've been connected
through this overarching,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.266
very diverse religion called Hinduism.

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:50.321
And to a Hindu,

00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:55.239
they're all ways of connecting
with the fundamental Brahman.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:57.356
And to remind that,

00:06:57.356 --> 00:06:59.548
we could just zoom out

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:02.715
and we see the connection with Brahman

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.751
which is viewed as this
fundamental reality.

00:07:06.751 --> 00:07:09.016
Which raises an interesting question.

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:12.548
Hinduism is oftentimes cited
as a polytheistic religion.

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:14.488
Polytheism, you have multiple gods.

00:07:14.488 --> 00:07:17.487
And clearly, I've cited multiple
gods even in this video,

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:21.053
and this is a sample of all
of the gods in Hinduism.

00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:22.353
But at the same time,

00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:25.225
they're all perceived
by many or most Hindus

00:07:25.225 --> 00:07:27.722
as to being aspects or ways to connect

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:30.640
with the fundamental reality of Brahman

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.064
who many Hindus would call to
be the true fundamental God.

00:07:35.064 --> 00:07:36.410
And so based on that they would say,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.864
"These are just aspects of the one God."

00:07:38.864 --> 00:07:41.945
And so they would argue
that it is monotheistic.

00:07:41.945 --> 00:07:44.869
So I'll let you decide how you view it

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:47.743
or if it even matters to put apply a label

00:07:47.743 --> 00:07:50.678
like monotheism or polytheism

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.877
to the idea of Hinduism.

00:07:52.877 --> 00:07:54.665
The big picture is,

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:57.492
is that you have many
gods and many practices

00:07:57.492 --> 00:08:01.283
and they are diverse
across the Hindu world,

00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:03.770
but they are all viewed as connected

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.187
to this notion of a Brahman.
