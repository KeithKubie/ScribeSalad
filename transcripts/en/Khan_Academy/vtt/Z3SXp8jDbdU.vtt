00:00:00.592 --> 00:00:01.770
- [Instructor] So right over here,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.684
Figure B is a scaled copy of Figure A

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:07.440
and what we wanna do is figure out

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
what is the scale factor to
go from Figure A to Figure B?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.238
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:17.926
Well, all we have to do is
look at corresponding sides

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:20.491
and think about how much
they have been scaled by.

00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.202
So for example, this side right over here

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:28.846
would correspond to this side
right over here on Figure B

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:30.929
and over here, it had length two

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.476
and over here, it has length

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:35.857
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:39.203
So it looks like that
side has been scaled up

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:40.870
by a factor of three

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.232
and so if Figure B truly is a scaled copy

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.660
then every side should be
scaled up by a factor of three

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.677
and we could verify that.

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:50.936
We don't have to do it with every side.

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:53.380
We're being told that
these are scaled copies

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.092
but we can see that this is the case.

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:56.885
For example, this side right over here

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.392
corresponds to this base right over here.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.312
This has length three.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.656
So if we're scaling up
by a factor of three,

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:07.406
we should multiply that by three

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:08.956
and this should be of length nine.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.350
Let's see if that's the case.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.517
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight and nine.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:19.748
And so you can see we can feel pretty good

00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:22.084
that Figure B is a scaled copy of Figure A

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.460
and that scaling factor is three.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.279
Let's do another example.

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:32.078
So here, we are told
Ismael made a scaled copy

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:34.253
of the following quadrilateral.

00:01:34.253 --> 00:01:38.086
He used a scale factor
less than one, alright,

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.256
and then they say what could be the length

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:44.028
of the side that corresponds to AD?

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:46.109
So AD is right over here.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.276
AD has length 16 units in
our original quadrilateral.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.228
What could be the length

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:53.902
of the side that corresponds with AD

00:01:53.902 --> 00:01:57.121
on the scaled copy of the quadrilateral?

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.124
So it's a scale factor less than one.

00:01:59.124 --> 00:02:03.012
So we're gonna get something
that is less than 16

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:04.199
for that side

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:08.316
and the rest of it will all
be scaled by the same factor.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:11.988
So the resulting quadrilateral
might look something,

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:13.335
might look something like this.

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:15.487
This is just my hand-drawn version.

00:02:15.487 --> 00:02:16.999
So the key realization is

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.369
is if our scale factor is less than one,

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:20.711
this thing right over here

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:24.112
is going to be less than 16 units.

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:25.379
So let's look at the choices

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.442
and it says choose three answers.

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:30.936
So pause the video and
which of these would match

00:02:30.936 --> 00:02:34.402
if we're scaling by a
factor of less than one?

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:35.426
Well, we just have to see which of these

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.109
are less than 16 units.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.700
This is less than 16.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.143
This is less than 16.

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:41.456
This is less than 16

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:44.142
and those are the only
three that are less than 16.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:47.710
32 units, this would be
a scale factor of two.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.161
64 units, this would be
a scale factor of four.

00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:54.244
Clearly a scale factor
that is not less than one.
