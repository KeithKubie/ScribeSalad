00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.890
What is the measure
of angle COB?

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.230
So this is C. This
is O. And this is B.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.770
So they're telling us, what
is the measure of this angle

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.770
right over here?

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.698
This is angle COB.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:16.239
And they clearly
don't give it to us.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.890
We need to figure it out.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.620
And what they do give
us is they give us

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.900
the measure of an
adjacent angle.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.020
This angle is 45-degree angled.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.200
Angle DOC is adjacent
because it shares this arm,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.720
this segment OC with angle COB.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640
And then they give us
the combined angle.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.300
If you take the two outer
arms of the two angles,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
these two outer segments,
if you look at angle BOD,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.880
they tell us that
that is 70 degrees.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.800
So if the measure of the angle
made from the two outer arms

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.130
of these two adjacent
angles, the two outer rays,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.980
if you kept going out
like this, if that's

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.660
70 degrees and one of the
adjacent angles is 45,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.960
then this one right over
here must be 70 minus 45.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.160
Or another way of thinking about
it is this angle, the question

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.280
mark angle, plus 45 degrees
must be equal to 70 degrees.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.020
Or that question mark must
be equal to 70 degrees

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.345
minus 45 degrees.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.800
So what's this going to be?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.570
Well, if it was 70 minus
40, we'd get to 30.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.540
But then we have to
subtract another 5.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.480
So it's going to be 25 degrees.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.457
So the measure of angle
COB is 25 degrees.
