00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.509
- [Instructor] As we've
talked about in other videos,

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.988
by the time we get into the 15th century,

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:10.453
Timur's Persia and central
Asia has been fragmented.

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:13.207
You have many of Timur's
descendants with their own

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:16.038
kingdoms, especially in central Asia.

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:19.871
In 1483, in the central
Asian city of Andijan,

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:26.096
now part of eastern Uzbekistan,
you have one of Timur's

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:29.263
grandson's great-grandson's born Babur

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:35.610
and at the age of 12, Babur
takes the throne of Fergana

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.593
after the death of his father.

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:42.306
Now over the next few decades,
he tries to consolidate

00:00:42.306 --> 00:00:45.867
control, he tries to take
control of Samarkand,

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:47.845
loses control and then of Fergana,

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:50.164
keeps repeatedly losing control.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.493
Early in the 16th century,
he is able to take Kabul

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:58.660
and then decides to focus on
India instead of central Asia.

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:04.154
In 1526, famously with the use of cannons,

00:01:05.394 --> 00:01:07.362
which had not been used
in a significant way

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:09.975
in the Indian subcontinent
until that time,

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:14.292
Babur was able to defeat Ibraham
Lodi of the Delhi sultanate

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.514
and come to power in northern
India and you can see

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.808
in this blue gray color, this
is the territory that Babur

00:01:20.808 --> 00:01:24.785
was able to rule over
until his death in 1530.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:28.195
Moghul is the Persian word for Mongol.

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.367
Remember, Babur is a descendant of Timur,

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.103
who is a Turko-Mongolian conqueror.

00:01:34.103 --> 00:01:36.461
On his mother's side,
he claims descendancy

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.628
from Gengis Khan, but Persian
is the language of his court

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:45.505
and so it significantly
increases the Persian influence

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.667
in North Indian culture.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:51.667
After his death, his son
Humayun comes to power.

00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:56.466
Humayun has difficult retaining power.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.600
He has various family
rivalries to contend with

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.767
and eventually he is dethroned
by the Pashtun Suri dynasty.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.807
He goes to the Safavids
and with their help,

00:02:07.807 --> 00:02:11.974
is able to retake control but
then trips on stairs and dies

00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:16.670
and then his son Akbar comes to power.

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:19.637
Now Akbar is perhaps most famous

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:22.147
of all of the Moghul rulers.

00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:26.488
As you can see, he is able to
rule over India for some time.

00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:30.892
As just mentioned, Humayan
essentially had to reconquer,

00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:35.763
retake the throne and his hold
on power was relatively weak.

00:02:35.763 --> 00:02:39.023
But now Akbar is able
to expand the territory

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:42.650
that you see in this
light purple mauve color.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.421
He's able to increase the central
authority and perhaps most

00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:50.764
importantly, he tries to
unify India culturally.

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:54.224
The Moghuls are Muslim and
are relatively tolerant

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:57.346
up through Akbar and to
some degree, Jahangir,

00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:59.522
of other religions, but Akbar takes

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:01.882
a very pluralistic approach.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.501
He's famous for holding
court with religious scholars

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.509
throughout the empire
and even trying to merge

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.850
the religions, creating
what some would consider

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.921
a religion of his own
that would later be called

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:16.270
Din-i-Illahi, the religion of god.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.481
Many Jain and Hindu
principles appealed to him.

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:24.478
He becomes a vegetarian, he
bans the slaughtering of cows.

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:28.645
At his death in 1605, his
son Jahangir comes to power.

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:34.091
Historians consider Jahangir
to be relatively tolerant

00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.026
like Akbar and to continue
the interest in the sciences

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:41.497
and the arts that you saw in
the Moghul court under Akbar

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:44.356
but he's a little bit more controversial.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:47.633
As we talked about in the Sikhism video,

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.633
he famously tortures
and executes Guru Arjan.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.640
Some would say it was because Guru Arjan

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.848
was siding with Jahangir's
son, who was trying to rebel.

00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:59.465
Others would say that it
was because Guru Arjan

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:03.113
was getting a following in
Punjab and that Jahangir

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:06.947
was insecure of his own hold on power

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.780
and decided to execute Guru Arjan.

00:04:12.446 --> 00:04:15.500
But he is succeeded by
his son, Shah Jahan,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.063
who becomes decisively less tolerant.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:22.678
His reign, however, is
known as the golden age

00:04:22.678 --> 00:04:26.893
of Moghul architecture, with
the crowning achievement,

00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:30.536
arguably, the Taj Mahal,
which is a mausoleum that he

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:34.703
commissions in the 1630s to
house the body of his dead wife.

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:39.585
As you can see here, it's housed in Agra

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:42.741
and Agra and Delhi at various points

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.610
during the Moghul empire are the capital,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.375
there's a few moments
when it is at Lahore.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:53.542
He is eventually imprisoned
by his son, Aurangzeb.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.285
Aurangzeb is considered a very strong

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:01.386
and authoritarian ruler.

00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:04.802
You can see here that he is
able to expand the territory

00:05:04.802 --> 00:05:08.381
of the Moghul empire
well into South India.

00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:12.152
At its maximum extent, the
Moghul empire is now rivaling

00:05:12.152 --> 00:05:14.254
the amount of territory
that was controlled

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:18.421
by the Moria empire, roughly
2000 years before this time.

00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:24.736
Despite being the last
truly strong Moghul emperor,

00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:28.928
he's also known as the least
tolerant of the emperors.

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:32.171
After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707,

00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:36.122
he's succeeded by weaker
and weaker Moghul rulers.

00:05:36.122 --> 00:05:39.358
The 18th century, you
see a significant decline

00:05:39.358 --> 00:05:42.006
in the power of the Moghuls,
the territory they have.

00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:45.413
Delhi is famously sacked by Nadir Shah,

00:05:45.413 --> 00:05:47.475
the Persian conqueror.

00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:50.345
As we get into the second
half of the 18th century,

00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:54.160
the British are able to chip
away more and more and more

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.356
territory, not just from the Moghuls,

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.366
but from other Indian rulers as well,

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.283
which we will see in future videos.
