00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.460
So, today I'm gonna tell you about how the Fibonacci sequence appears in the Mandelbrot set.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.460
Hopefully, your mind will be blown by the end of that sentence.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.220
So the Fibonacci sequence, the rule is that you take the previous two numbers,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.600
and you add them together to get the next. Right? So we started with 1 1. Their sum is 2.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.749
The next number will be the sum of 1 &amp; 2, which is 3.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.909
The sum of 2 &amp; 3 is 5. The sum of 3 &amp; 5 is 8. I'll do one more.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.010
And then, you can continue on.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.040
Brady: "Easy."

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.800
Easy, right? And this occurs everywhere that has interesting connections to things in nature, and all of that,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.950
but I just want to show you where it appears on the Mandelbrot set.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.839
So, slightly less easy. So, the Mandelbrot set is a special object inside of the complex plane. So the plane of complex numbers. And

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.809
the way you cook this thing up is by

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.869
considering a certain type of dynamical system. So if you give me a complex number c,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.179
so here's a picture of the complex plane, so these are the real numbers and these are the real numbers

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.590
times i, which is that square root of minus one, if you give me a complex number c,

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.298
it's in the Mandelbrot set if, when you take the function z squared plus c

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.320
and you look at what happens to zero when you plug it into this function repeatedly, if that number doesn't get large,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320
then c is in the Mandelbrot set.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.210
So I know that sounds sort of complicated, but just let me do an example, right? So if you look at c equals minus one,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.229
right? Then you look at the function z squared minus one, you plug in the number zero,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.860
zero, if you plug it into this function, gives you minus one.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.659
Minus one, if you plug it into this function, gives you one minus one, which is zero again.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.720
And so you're just gonna repeat this pattern. And so this number doesn't get large, no matter how far out we go.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660
And so this number is in the Mandelbrot set

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.180
It's about right here. So for each complex number, you make this decision based on what happens to zero under iteration.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.660
So it looks something like this. So there's this big piece in the middle, all this interior is included, by the way,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.749
and a little disc around minus one, and there's some more pieces coming off of here,

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.098
and some kind of funny tendril-y stuff goes on out here, and a few more pieces this way, another heart-shaped piece.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.340
Mathematicians love this thing. Even non-mathematicians love this thing, but maybe for different reasons.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.180
All right, so where is the Fibonacci sequence?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.670
I mean first of all, this thing has nothing to do with whole numbers and addition, and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.489
arithmetic, and the kinds of things that you think about with Fibonacci, which is why it's weird that you can see it in here.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.480
But so, let me show you how to find it. I didn't draw too many of them,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.320
but there's a bunch of these little components coming off of this main piece.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940
Brady: "What are they called?"

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.640
They're called the hyperbolic components, but let's not get into that.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.059
To these components I'm going to assign a number,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.620
and that number is going to be the number of branches that come off the sort of tendril-y bit, which is called an antenna.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.260
So like here, this component, there's this part where we have these tendrils, and there's three different directions

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.909
you can go in the antenna. And so this component will have number three. And similarly, over here, it actually turns out

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.730
there's only two directions

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.079
you can go in that antenna, so this is component number two. Now if we look for the next biggest one,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.969
the largest component between the two and the three component, I've drawn it here.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.070
I haven't drawn the tendrils,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.439
but I'll try. It turns out

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.100
that there's exactly

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.899
five directions that you can go from that antenna. And the next biggest between these two, if you draw the antenna,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.380
I'm not sure I can fit it in here, since I think you already know what the answer will be,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.160
is eight. So if you go through the Mandelbrot set, and you start with these two components, the two and the three

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.910
components, and you look between them for the next biggest component, the next biggest one will be the next Fibonacci number.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840
So I want to explain why.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.500
Brady: "You'd better."

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.980
All right. I'll explain at least part of why. How about that?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.000
I called this big piece, the main component, it's called the main cardioid.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.160
Brady: "What's its number?"

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.359
Its number is one, actually. That's a really good question.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.600
But it's not so obvious to see from antennas, so.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.600
So the main cardioid here,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.350
number one,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.399
it turns out that there's a very natural way to stretch this thing back into a disk,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.980
which is something we understand really well, right?

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.180
So this is always useful in sort of geometry or that kind of study, if you can

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.819
change something just a little bit and get back to something you understand really well.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.259
So there's a natural way to view this thing, just by some stretch,

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.829
so this disk maps under this stretch to a cardioid.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.460
And I want to look at what happens to, first of all, my center point, it turns out it goes to zero, this ray

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.199
will map to this ray. This ray is, I guess, zero of the way around the circle, right? If we go halfway around the circle,

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:53.889
it maps to this line inside the main cardioid. If we go, say, a third of the way around the circle,

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.559
it maps to a kind of a funny curve

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.930
inside the main cardioid. And same for two thirds, and so on. So you can track

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.810
what happens to these rays under this stretch.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.249
And here's the thing. Is that the place where the rays end up in the main cardioid

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.119
are exactly the places where it connects to these components.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.719
So here is the connection to the two component,

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.499
and here is the connection to that top three component,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:28.389
and that bottom three component. We have a five component up here in the Mandelbrot set, so there must be some

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.080
five ray which lands there, and in fact there is. It turns out that that's the two fifths of the way around the circle ray.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.000
And the point is that, under this stretching map,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.289
the number of antennae, the number we assigned to each of these components, is the

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.070
denominator of the fraction that tells you how far around the circle you went. This question of, what's the largest

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.259
component between any two other components,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.549
turns into this totally separate question of, what's the fraction with the smallest denominator between these two fractions?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.300
Brady: "Why is the five component at two fifths, and not one fifth or three fifths? Two seems arbitrary."

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.039
So the one that I drew is between one-third and one-half, and so that's the two fifths.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:18.968
But there are five components at 1/5 3/5 and 4/5. You're totally right, so yep, it works every time with the denominators.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.859
But the point is that you can read off these numbers in two different ways, right? The antennas or the

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.259
denominators of the fraction for the way around the circle. So we're closing in on Fibonacci. So I said that, okay,

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.718
we changed this question completely to a question of, what's the fraction with the smallest denominator between two fractions?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.810
One third, which is less than some fraction,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.719
which is less than one half. And the question is, I want a smallest denominator fraction here, how small can it be?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.320
Well, it can't be 4, right? Because 2 over 4 is the same as 1/2, and 1/4 is too small.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.469
But it can be 5, because 2/5 really is between these two numbers.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.499
Okay, so 2/5 is the answer here.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.040
Now, what if we were to do the next one? The next one was asking, between the three and the five

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.319
components, right? So we want a number that's between

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.749
1/3 and 2/5 that has the smallest possible denominator. And again

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:13.380
you can check, six and seven aren't gonna do it. It turns out that the answer is 3/8.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.920
And in general, the crazy thing is that if your fractions are close enough together, the way to find

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.450
the one between them that has the smallest denominator, is just by taking the mediant, or the fairy sum, or,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.390
as some people refer to it, the freshmen sum,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.830
because you get it by adding together the numerators, and adding together the denominators.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.190
Brady: "Why is that a freshman sum?"

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.480
Well, because, I think it's mean, actually. I mean, maybe a kindergarten sum? Is that better?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.140
Brady: "Because why? Because people who don't know maths would think that was a legitimate..."

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.500
That's right, that's right.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.520
Brady: "Well, it is a legitimate thing."

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.420
It is a legitimate thing. I can tell you why it's bad, right?

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.600
So why is it a bad way to add fractions? Because it matters how you represent your fractions.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.570
So if you try and add 1/3 to 1/2 this way, you'll get something different than if you add 1/3 to 2/4, right?

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.440
So, it's not so good. But.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.340
Brady: "It works for this."

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.080
It works for this.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.730
Right? So 1/2,

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.170
here's the symbol usually used for mediant. The mediant of these two fractions

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.569
is just 2/5. The mediant of these two fractions is 3/8, and so on. So where is Fibonacci?

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.130
Fibonacci is because,

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.280
look at the fractions I started with.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.780
I started with the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.720
and the third and fourth elements of the Fibonacci sequence. And the way I get the next thing is by adding the other two together.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.080
And so it's exactly the rule which defines the Fibonacci sequence

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.700
coming up in these fractions,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.960
coming up in their mediants,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960
and so coming up in the Mandelbrot set.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:01.080
If you'd like to better understand the Mandelbrot set, and I mean really understand it, then why not check out this?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.339
Look, it's a Mandelbrot set quiz, and a Julia set quiz, as well.

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:12.599
We've covered the Julia set before. They're from Brilliant, a problem solving website that lets you go further into the world of math and science

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.990
by not just watching stuff, but doing stuff.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:18.838
There's a lot to like about these curated sequences.

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:23.698
But what I like is that they guide you through step by step, help you understand.

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:25.089
But it's not all about

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:29.039
scoring your work, or making you feel silly. I mean, you can look up the solutions,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.409
you can look up hints. They help you along the way.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:36.539
And they also help you understand just how beautiful mathematics can be. It really made an impression on me.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.860
I really feel like these people know what they're doing. They've made a good thing. To check it out,
