ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and welcome
once again to "Android

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.925
Design in Action." I'm your
host Roman Nurik.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:15.110
NICK BUTCHER: And hi, my
name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.610
ROMAN NURIK: And today we're
going to be talking about

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.710
designing collections.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.370
Collections specifically, I
guess we're talk about what we

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.180
mean by collections in a second,
but collections are

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.540
all about lists, and presenting
lists of objects

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.020
and collections of things,
groups of objects.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.600
Anyway let's just jump in.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
So like I said collections are
really just groups of objects

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.020
of I guess things like a list
of items in a shopping cart,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.600
or a list of books,
things like that.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.520
So today we're going to be
talking about a couple things.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.890
I guess we're going to be
talking about consumption of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.040
collections as well as mutation
of collections.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.750
By consumption of collections,
I really mean things like

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.140
being able to view a collection
obviously, being

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.550
able to search through it,
filter through it, things like

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.760
that, as well as things like
responsive design for

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.090
collections, and Nick will
do a bit about that.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.940
And then also, we're going to
talk about mutations of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.360
collections, specifically ways
in which you can allow users

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.420
to add items, remove items from
a collection, reorder

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.400
them as well as take action on
certain items in a collection.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.690
All right.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.070
So I know that was a
super fast intro.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.670
Before we jump into all these
specific details, we just want

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.960
to look at one thing first
is basic presentation.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.340
So throughout the rest of these
slides, throughout the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.650
rest of today's episode, we're
going to be looking at very

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.010
specific details but from
a very high level.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.110
This is stuff that we obviously
already talked about

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.760
in the past, but we're going to
be looking at collections

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.990
from a number of different
viewpoints.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.750
Obviously, you know you can
use a list to present a

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.300
collection of objects and grid
to present a list of objects

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.380
or a collection of objects as
well as something like a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.660
ViewPager, like swipe between
different items within a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.440
collection.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.010
We're going to be focusing
on the first two here.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.040
We're not going to spending
too much time on the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.970
ViewPager, the swiping
between items.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.670
So just kind of keep that
in mind, I guess.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.080
Before we jump in, Nick do you
want to add anything to that

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.546
super fast intro?

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:28.250
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.720
As you said, we're not going to
talk about what a list is,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.540
what a grid is.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620
We're more kind of go through
the options you have on

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890
Android for working with
these collections,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.601
doing things to them.

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:39.020
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.340
All right.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.020
So let's jump in to collection
consumption.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.440
Nick, do you want to talk about
collection consumption?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.190
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.880
Absolutely.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.530
So here we've kind of called
this section distillation.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.210
So this is when you're acting
upon items where in the

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.310
collection kind of refinements
and so forth.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.790
And so we pulled up three
examples here on the slide,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.570
the first of which is a quick
way to kind of section and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.170
navigate around content
with a collection.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.220
And so some standard ways of
doing that on Android, we've

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.650
pulled out working from left
to right, first off we have

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.110
this combination of headers with
an index fast scroll bar.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.860
So in this example here, we're
using the People app.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.400
They're your list of
your people, and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.720
contacts, and so forth.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.980
So you can see that each of the
letter of the alphabet has

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.650
a section, and this instance is
using a pass that we call

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.230
sticky headers.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.110
So you can see here that e has
stuck to the top and will stay

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.230
in place until it's scrolled
out of view by the next

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.070
section here after that.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.080
Combine that with a quick scroll
from as a fast way to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.470
navigate these kind of long
lists of quite structured data

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.030
that work quite well if your
data is a good match of that.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.340
It doesn't work so well if your
data doesn't have such a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.770
kind of rigid and expected
structure.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.710
So it depends on your
data needs whether

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.310
that will all work.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.200
The next kind of distillation
method, which is called on

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
Android we're using this
kind of view change.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.260
It's using one of the facilities
of the action bar

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.080
which allows you to
kind of flip the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.540
representation of the data.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.810
So in this example, we're using
the Gallery application,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.330
which let's you view your
collection of photos as either

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.350
a grid of photos or you can get
this cool kind of zoomed

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.950
out film strip view where you
can see them one main photo

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.130
mainly at a time, we'll have to
cut more peeking in on each

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.545
side and quickly fling
between them.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:26.230
So yeah.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.430
Here we're using the action
bars spinner all have

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.780
drop-down control in order to
provide this kind of switch of

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.250
views or flip a view type.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.775
And the last kind of
distillation action that I'm

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:40.180
going to talk about
is sorting.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.450
So in this example here on the
right from a foreign rep side

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.410
of ADIA, we're using an action
bar button in order to reveal

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.900
a sub menu to do some sort.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.910
So if you see the kind of the
three lines action buttons,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.820
the standard iconography on
Android for sorting, pressing

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.160
that reveals a sub menu which
lets you pick how you want the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.450
data sorted.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.430
So pretty simple stuff.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.470
These are the common ways on
Android in which you can do

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.632
these kind of distillation-type
behaviors.

00:05:09.632 --> 00:05:10.320
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.550
And one more thing I wanted to
mention is that another way to

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.100
do the view change is to have an
Action Bar button that lets

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.440
you toggle the view, but
actually I find that what

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.560
Gallery does here is actually
kind of neat.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.080
It kind of expresses both the
title of the current screen as

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.190
well as the type of view all in
the top-left kind of View

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.060
Details area, which is
this kind of a neat

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.640
way to expose that.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.450
And then any time you press the
spinner and make a change,

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.720
only the subtitle
I guess changes.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.935
The top title camera doesn't
change which is pretty cool.

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:43.780
NICK BUTCHER: Definitely.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.570
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.180
Moving on.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.200
NICK BUTCHER: So some more
types of distillation

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.670
we have here is--

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.075
and these are kind of slightly
different to the previous

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:55.810
types in that these distillation
actions were

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.150
actually apped upon the items so
it will refine or show less

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.430
items rather than just
flipping to another

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.760
representation really
So it's more kind of

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.690
like filtering behavior.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.840
So the first off column 1 used
the kind of standard searching

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.290
behavior in order to just
filter through the items

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.750
already shown on screens.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.130
So in our example, we're going
back to the People application

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.650
again where you can start
searching for a contact.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.660
So this works really well for
large data sets where if you

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.430
had to pick from a list, the
drop-ins, it might be too

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.605
large or too kind of
nonspecific, so search can

00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:34.370
work quite well there.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.190
The next up is a simple kind of
filter switch where you're

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.750
changing kind of on discrete
filterable things.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.970
So in our example here, we're
using pocket which let's you

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.280
select and store different
kinds of media for later

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.130
consumption.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.110
And they use this kind of corpus
switch filter to kind

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.720
of filter down just to kind of
articles, videos, images, I'm

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.190
looking at media type, so that's
a pretty common one.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.460
And again, that's implemented
as an action

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.470
from the action bar.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.020
So pressing the action
reveals a sub menu.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.210
And in this particular visual
design pocket, I've chosen to

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.670
use the kind of the right
pointing down on right kind of

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.840
arrow to kind of display either
there are other options

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.330
here, which is kind
of optional.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.930
We see it similar to sorting
behavior in that you don't

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.660
necessarily need to have
that drop-down option.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.770
ROMAN NURIK: And another area
where this is used, this kind

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.540
of bottom-right triangles would
be ShareActionProviders.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.860
So if you have a custom or
I guess if you use the

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.050
ShareActionProvider or the share
pack as it's sometimes

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.480
known as, and you press the
button, it actually shows kind

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.470
of an anchored list as well.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.070
So it's a very similar
presentation, so it's quite

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.071
often coupled together.

00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:44.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.770
And it's got quite the support
in the platform of [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.780
so it's easy to implement this
kind of stuff using sub menus.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.170
And the last one which is my
favorite ones is using this

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.100
right side d in order
to provide

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.780
some filtering behavior.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.880
So again, this screen shot is
from an earlier episode of

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.470
"Android Design in Action" where
we went quite in depth

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.510
about its topic.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.420
But I'm a big fan of this
because it has a lot of the

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.620
benefits of the drawer.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.880
And left-hand drawer will have
a navigation as it can for

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.750
actions on the right-hand
side.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.200
So some of those benefits are
very kind of as it appears,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.190
kind of in Chrome level, so it's
above the content in a

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.120
way, which is great for
filtering in my opinion.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.760
Because you can see they're
acting at a level above the

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.785
content rather than inline
with the content.

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:30.060
And what's more if your data
supports it, you can imagine

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.620
changing these filtering
settings and seeing the kind

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.659
of content behind the update
live, the number of results is

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.909
displayed, producing, and so
forth, which that kind of

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.659
instant response is a great
thing to provide.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.930
So in this instance, we as with
the navigation drawer,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.790
you have an affordance in the
action bar, so here we have a

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.930
filter icon.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.870
But this would also be
accessible by a kind of an

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.060
edge swipe, a X swipe, a Bezel
swipe from the side, on,

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.600
giving real quick and
instant access to

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.402
the filtering options.

00:08:58.402 --> 00:08:59.670
ROMAN NURIK: So one quick note,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.586
actually two quick notes.

00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:03.810
The first is if you want more
details on the specific

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:08.830
design, look at the past episode
titled "GDG Oslo." I

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.800
think we also covered brand
consistency in that episode,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.060
but this is from that episode.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.130
And the second thing was, a
live example of the actual

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.370
interaction could be found in
the Google+ app, the way in

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.640
which they do notifications.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.240
They use this type of
interaction for notifications,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.900
but it's perfectly suitable for
other types of things, for

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.050
example, filtering.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.840
Generally, not great for
navigation, for core

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.380
navigation.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.670
That's really more for the
navigation jar, the left side

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.680
of the screen, I guess.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.730
But for filtering, for
distillation of content in a

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.532
collection is a great option.

00:09:46.532 --> 00:09:47.490
NICK BUTCHER: Absolutely.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.680
ROMAN NURIK: Let's move on
to responsive layout.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.580
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.700
So when we're talking about
collections, we have to kind

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.570
of have this extra dimension
that I had over the fact that

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.880
they're going to be
displayed on all

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.660
sizes and shaped devices.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.810
So something like a list view,
for example, might work great

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.310
on a small device, but it's not
going to scale up terribly

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.720
well to a larger device
especially when you think

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.450
about say 10-inch tablets in
landscape orientation, lists

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.850
can be a pretty bad way of
displaying information because

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.610
you end up with these
excessively lot-wide list

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.990
items with lots of white
space and so forth.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.710
So the first pretty simple thing
you can do is switching

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.560
up from say using the list
in a smaller device up to

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.260
something like a grid view
in the larger device.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.090
So problematic, this is very
simple to do in Android.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.460
Both of these list and grid
components kind of have that

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.260
common base so it's
very easy to do.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.000
You just provided different
layouts, say over this size

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.660
web view, this representation
of my item rather than this

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.030
list type one uses
grid type one.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.790
And this can work especially
well if you have very kind of

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.420
visual, like large images or
thumbnails, which you can use

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.710
to form these kind of
like grid items.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.590
So this is one simple way in
which you can use the space

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.230
better to present
your collection.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.720
If you want to go into details
about this pattern as well,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.450
the last Google, Roman and
I gave a talk and we've

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.620
documented some code on
how you might go about

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.870
implementing this.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.860
The next thing you might
consider doing is breaking out

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.115
into this kind of like staggered
representation.

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:27.680
So this is kind of like
the step up from going

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.330
from lists to grids.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.350
This allows you to create a
more dynamic kind of more

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.760
appealing representation
of your collection.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.610
It allows you to kind of
recognize that not every item

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.650
in your group might
be similar weight.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.040
So in this example here, we're
showing some kind of news

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.950
story, if the story is
particularly relevant,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.380
particularly pertinent to the
user, you might take this

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.790
opportunity to break out of the
standard rhythm and take

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.690
up say a couple of cells
and so forth.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.980
And this is another kind of way
of just re-utilizing the

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.806
space, and that's available
to you when you go

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:02.293
on to larger devices.

00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:05.179
ROMAN NURIK: Moving on.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:07.860
NICK BUTCHER: Moving on.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.350
You can use a combination
of these [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.620
all together and as you kind
of get more available

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.960
space to play with.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.663
And one great example of this
is the third-party Out of

00:12:18.663 --> 00:12:20.505
Pocket, which I think we've
mentioned on the show earlier

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:24.220
before, which is a really great
job of adapting to the

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.080
amount of space available
to it.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.030
So starting on the left from
a small device, they use a

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.400
standard list-driven navigation
to kind of show a

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.630
collection of items.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.830
But as they get more room, they
kind of break it out into

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.150
sharing grid view and then on
even larger devices, they

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.050
switch up to a stack
of grid view.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.160
So as you can see here, this
avoids those problems of

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.560
having these awkwardly-wide
cells.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.750
You can imagine if that list
view was just stretched all

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.600
the way across that tablet, it
would look pretty uninspiring.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.530
And instead, if they see it as
an opportunity to make the

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.560
content kind of stand out and
use it to highlight stories,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.745
which might be particularly
interesting to these.

00:12:56.745 --> 00:13:00.100
So it's kind of great use
of the opportunity.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.720
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.060
So this is just a great example
of really kind of

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.030
having the content, kind of
having, I guess, constraints

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.190
on your content, making sure
that images are a certain

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.330
aspect ratio, making sure that
the content never, or the body

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.290
text never exceeds certain
number of characters per line

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.240
and kind of starting with
those constraints and

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.348
designing outward from there.

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:25.150
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.070
As you were touching on here,
I'm just going to slide this

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.270
to show that when you're
thinking about displaying your

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.850
collections on this kind of
variety devices, you kind of

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.760
have to let go of a little bit
of the kind of strict control

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.850
of the layout.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.533
And one technique that works
really well-- go on to the

00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:41.380
next slide-- is to
use this kind of

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.510
center cropping technique.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.270
So this is a technique which
will help you with your images

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:52.660
to make them scale from wider
to smaller devices and

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.600
sacrificing some kind of
complete control over the

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.030
pixel dimensions, but just
saying maintain this correct

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.280
aspect ratio and pick the right
kind of segment of the

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.340
image in order to display it
in the amount of space

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.230
available to cell item there.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.590
So you use the center cropping
technique and really help you

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.710
to build these cell contents
of the individual

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.662
items in the group.

00:14:12.662 --> 00:14:13.470
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.630
This works really well for like
landscape photography or

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.700
images like these strips
of bacon here.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.160
Doesn't work so well when you
have people's faces or other

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.200
things that have important
or other photos that have

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.000
important content around
the fringes.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.890
I think we may have touched on
this in past episodes, but it

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.960
is definitely a very, very
important technique to use.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.020
NICK BUTCHER: Of course there's
still ways to do that

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.740
with that kind of imagery.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.520
You might just have to do a
pass at it first and store

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.380
some data about where the center
is rather than being

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.600
the physical center
of the image.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.808
It might be you detect where the
faces are on the server or

00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:48.610
something like that, and when
you deliver the image down,

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.350
you pass in some information.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.900
So it let's you do the center
crop technique but without

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.080
using the actual center, using
a focal point instead.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.790
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.210
Or use the face detection,
definitely a good technique.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.430
A little harder, a little more
difficult to implement for

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.780
developers since there's no
kind of like random or

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.945
arbitrary center crop.

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:09.930
It's just like kind of the
center of the photo or it kind

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.660
of centers around the photo,
but definitely some of that

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.270
can be done.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.700
It's not incredibly difficult,
but it can be done.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.440
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.030
And so one of the techniques
that Google is moving towards

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.210
is what we like to call this
kind of inside out design.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.670
It's a kind of more of a
change in mindset than

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.540
anything else.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.870
It's thinking about your content
first, thinking about

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.850
what the information you're
trying to display, what your

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.910
building blocks are and building
outwards from there,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.070
rather than starting with
a grid, starting with a

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.890
Photoshop with a canvas of a
certain size and then trying

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.720
to sort your information
into it.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.480
It's kind of going the
other way around.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.130
So in a lot of Google design
language, we're moving towards

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.400
these carts or these blocks
of content, these kind of

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.540
individual blocks
of content and

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.330
building from there outwards.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.290
So we think about content, and
we're thinking it can have

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.935
different representation.

00:16:01.935 --> 00:16:06.190
So it might have a big cart
here at one certain

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.340
size it might be.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.252
It might have different sizes it
can be in like maybe small,

00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:11.830
or tiny carts.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.070
It might have different
landscapes it can be in.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.110
But all of these are just
thinking about this is my

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.370
piece of content and here are
some ways in which it can

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.335
express itself, it can
draw itself, it

00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:23.790
can represent itself.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.180
And then once you can have those
building blocks, you can

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.020
then build outwards and then
see how they slot together.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.130
So starting from the individual
one, you can place

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:38.410
it into a canvas on the screen
and then by using just simple

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.720
proximity rather than kind of
bounding boxes or kind of

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.660
support in Chrome, you can just
build them up into these

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.645
clusters of items.

00:16:45.645 --> 00:16:48.000
You can build up your grouping,
your clustering of

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.630
items just by placing them
next to each other.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.900
And then you can introduce this
variety of the different

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.770
representations.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.110
So you might use different
orientations, different size

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.930
carts to denote something
might be more important.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.390
So this item on the left might
be most relevant to me, and it

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.680
can take a different rhythm than
the rest of the items and

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.930
use that to kind of express
why the information is

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.040
important to me.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.550
And the concept here really is
to build this up into these

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.730
canvases, which is like a
collection of items where the

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.220
canvas is more of a conceptual
thing rather than being kind

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.750
of bounded to how much screen
really is on device.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.510
But it's more like an ideally,
this is the group of items

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.060
which want to be displayed
next to each other.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.470
So then when it comes to
actually time to kind of show

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.740
this on device, the device might
show a portion of this

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.750
cluster at once to might be this
is the kind of portion of

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.200
items and I will be able to then
pass horizontally swiped

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.440
to move along and see more of
the cluster available to me.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.150
Or in a larger device, I might
be able to take all of this

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.930
conceptual cluster of
items, and see them

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.410
all at once on screen.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.490
So as I say here, it's kind
of like starting with the

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.410
smallest building blocks but
starting with your information

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.040
first and building outwards
rather than starting your grid

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.160
and trying to fit
information in.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.750
So one example of looking at
from the Play Store of how to

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.960
represent a movie might be,
hey, here's a few ways in

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.220
which we know we can represent
the information that's

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.600
important to this movie like the
poster, a title, a price,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.450
a description, a reason why
it's interesting to you.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.190
And you build these different
building blocks, these

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.250
different sizes of which
you can express itself.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.440
And then the device at run time
just kind of picks the

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.830
right representation to show
this cluster of information.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.380
And it might be able to
show only one thing

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.120
on screen at a time.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.020
It might be able to put it next
to this mode of stuff and

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.330
build up this cluster
of information.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.440
But you at least start from
these building blocks, these

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.200
conceptual building blocks.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.120
And that was just kind
of like a rapid run

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.280
through this approach.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.860
If you want to learn more, we
did a whole show looking at

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.730
this kind of stuff when we
talked to some of the

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.720
designers who worked on the
Google Play applications.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.130
So do go back and check out that
show if you want to hear

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.600
some more about how we at Google
have been using this

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.834
kind of inside out design
principle to design our

00:19:02.834 --> 00:19:03.782
collections.

00:19:03.782 --> 00:19:05.680
ROMAN NURIK: Excellent.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.020
All right.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:12.150
So with that, let's move on
to mutating collections.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.360
So there's a couple of different
ways to mutate

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.710
collections.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.560
What we mean by mutating is
allowing the user to make

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.990
changes to the collections.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.450
And we're going to try to speed
through this since we

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.850
have very little time left.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.030
But the first is the very basics
of adding or removing

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.840
content to or from
a collection.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.830
So how can you do this?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.195
The first pretty obvious way is
this example in the People

00:19:35.195 --> 00:19:39.470
app, you simply have an action
bar item that allows you to

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.260
add something.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.290
In this case, you're allowing
the user to add a group of

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.100
contacts or add a new group
that's going to have no

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.090
contacts for now.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.570
And we'll talk about that
in a second with

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:50.710
some details there.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.120
Another more kind of potentially
interesting way of

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.680
doing this, more useful way of
doing this, more contextual

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.580
way of doing this is to actually
place the affordance

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.580
to add new content in line.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.620
So here in Google Play Music,
you'll notice the Create New

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.130
Station button is in line with
the actual stations.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.410
And even better example is here
in Google Keep, which

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.210
will actually use quite a bit
throughout the next few

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.320
screenshots.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.690
You'll notice here that in the
to-do list or in this kind of

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.820
a checklist, the next item, the
item that you are going to

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.760
be adding next, is kind of this
faded out almost semi

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.150
transparent item indicating
that it's not there.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.480
It's almost like a
ghost of an item.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.990
It's not there but click here or
touch here and start typing

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.650
your content, and it will
become a real item.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.670
So it's almost kind of hinting
that to create a new item,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.260
here is where you start entering
your information.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.380
So this is a very kind of good
technique for allowing users

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.190
to add content in line with the
rest of the items in the

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.070
collection.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.085
Another very good technique
for this is to

00:20:58.085 --> 00:20:59.350
use the empty state.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.580
So the empty state is something
we talked about in

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.510
last week's episode on
onboarding, but basically the

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.310
empty state is when you have
no content in a collection.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.700
And we find that is one of the
biggest missed opportunities

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.750
across apps on Google Play is
that when there's new content,

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.460
the app either says, there's no
content, or sorry there's

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.290
no content, or just a loading
spin or something.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.240
That's a great opportunity to
actually let the user fix that

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.900
problem, actually let them
populate that collection, let

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.690
them fix the problem
of the empty state.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.510
So in here in Google Keep, if
you have no reminders, the

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.230
center of the screen actually
has this nice, big affordance,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.650
this nice, big touch target
to create a new reminder.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.380
Touching that actually
takes you to the

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.740
create a reminder flow.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.240
So those are some basic ways
to add items to the

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.495
collection.

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:50.850
NICK BUTCHER: And I think quite
often people when think

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.440
about adding items they think
that's an action, adding is an

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.290
action, and therefore, up here I
know what action is going in

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:57.520
action bar.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.310
But I think that can often be
kind of a missed opportunity.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.100
I think these inline options
can often avail convey more

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.420
context with them.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.990
I mean, this Google Keep one
in particular, you can know

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.810
exactly what it's going
to app there, what's

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.010
going to happen there.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.990
It kind of conveys a lot more
information than just having a

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.225
simple button in
the action bar.

00:22:14.225 --> 00:22:14.973
I could do a lot more.

00:22:14.973 --> 00:22:18.010
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.740
And the key there is context
and direct manipulation.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.330
It really kind of helps satisfy
that design principle.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.430
All right.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.270
So sorry, folks.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.930
I think we're having some
technical difficulties, but

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.730
now let's jump back into it.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.130
So one thing I wanted to mention
when talking about

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.970
adding items specifically
exposing an action in the

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:44.320
action bar for that, is you
should try to, when possible,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.530
show the actual icon
representing the object type

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.825
as well as a plus overlay
or plus suffix as

00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:52.270
it's labeled here.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.735
And this is really kind of
a platform convention.

00:22:53.735 --> 00:22:58.420
It helps establish context for
what exactly you're adding.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.790
Cases where you don't really
have a great iconic

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.630
representation of the content,
you could just show a plus,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.780
but for sure, it's preferred to
show the plus as a suffix

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.440
again to establish context.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.020
All right.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.460
So let's move on to
removing items.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.620
So there are number of different
ways to allow users

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.610
to remove or delete items
from a collection.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:25.430
The first is using this kind of
contextual action overflow

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.900
that you would place inside
of your object.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.080
And what happens is when the
user presses these three

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.210
little vertical dots, and
actually the touch region

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.350
should probably be expanded to
be about 48 dip, the bottom

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.490
right 48 dip of a screen, if
they touch that overflow,

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:48.720
they'll get in anchored pop up
menu of actions they could

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.830
take on that object.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:54.570
So in this case, I'm looking
at a station on Google Play

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.300
Music, and if I press these
three vertical dots, I get

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.340
this delete action.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.440
So that's one way to
delete something.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.950
Another way is to trigger the
contextual action bar.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.520
So here this is Gallery.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.020
If you long press one of these
photos and then you can also

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.340
press other items that are
adjacent to select those as

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.950
well, you actually see the
contextual action bar up here

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.270
at the top of the screen, and
then you can choose to delete

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.780
those objects.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.820
So these two things, the
contextual action bar and this

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:32.390
contextual action overflow, I
guess, these are also useful

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.442
for other things, but deletion
or removing an item from the

00:24:36.442 --> 00:24:38.770
collections is one very
common way to do that.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:44.760
Now, another way to remove
items is to use something

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.000
called swipe to dismiss or
swipe to remove, and this

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.110
works best in kind of like a
vertical list or horizontal

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.340
list of objects where if the
user starts swiping left or

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.180
right in a vertical list or up
or down in a horizontal list,

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.640
the object is removed
from the collection.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.790
The nice thing here is that as
part of this interaction, as

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:14.110
part of this gesture, you can
also kind of have the adjacent

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.650
items slide in or animated in
to fill up the gap that was

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.860
left by the item that was moved
to help kind of convey

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.040
the concept that this thing has
been kind of removed from

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.780
this set of objects.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.126
NICK BUTCHER: And I think this
kind of swipe to remove

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:31.755
pattern is a very visceral,
direct manipulation pattern,

00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:34.365
so rather than operating
machinery like pressing a

00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:35.240
button to remove something.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.970
I'm actually like grabbing
the [INAUDIBLE] and

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.070
getting rid of it.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.120
And it's kind of really
satisfying.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:41.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.560
Exactly.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.640
NICK BUTCHER: It's also quite
prevalent in our system as

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.280
well, so like notification is
the recent stack, use it.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.090
A bunch of basics used for
Android, so it's pretty

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.500
well-understood gesture
as well.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.920
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.520
So let's move on.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.070
There's a bit more to say on the
contextual action bar, but

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.890
we'll talk about it in a bit.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.650
So beyond just simply allowing
users to add or remove items

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.600
to or from a collection, one of
the things you may want to

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.890
do is allow them to reorder
things, reorder objects.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.630
An example of this could be
personalizing kind of the

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.790
order of navigation sections
that you care about or

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.690
something as simple as
reordering a set of

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.860
tasks in a task list.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.560
So let's talk about some of
the ways in which you can

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.080
allow users to do that.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.650
The first is to use something
called like a drag grip.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.670
So you want to send these first
two examples on the left

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.710
of your Google Keep.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.510
On the right, you have
Google Play Music.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.630
There's these three horizontal
little lines, and it's kind of

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.900
a smaller version of the
burger menu icon or the

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.280
navigation drawer icon, so we
kind of like to call it a

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.860
slider if you get the joke.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:57.740
So this drag grip is basically
these three horizontal lines

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.990
that are vertically centered
within the object that you're

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.160
showing, and it's on
the left-hand side.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.210
So if the user presses or
touches in that area, the

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.460
object kind of is picked up
momentarily, and the user can

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.490
kind of drag up and down
to reorder it.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.740
So on the left, you'd reorder
a set of tasks.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.760
On the right here, you would
potentially reorder items

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.610
within a play queue,
for example.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.640
And Nick brought up this
earlier, kind of important

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.300
point around how this works
with the navigation jar.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.530
One of the features of the
navigation jar is that if you

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.110
touch anywhere, if you're on a
screen with a navigation jar,

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.860
if you touch on the left side of
the screen, on the left 16

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.220
dip or so of the screen, the
navigation jar kind of peaks

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.700
in to indicate that
it's there.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.070
And you'll notice actually that
with these drag grips,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.480
they're also on the left
side of the screen.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.370
So those are kind of two
overlapping touch regions.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.250
So generally, if you have a
navigation jar and also want

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.880
to expose reordering with this
kind of drag grip approach,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.330
you'll probably either want to
re-think what's most important

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.210
is offering the jar there most
important or the drag grip or

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.290
just place the drag grip on the
right side or somewhere

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.860
else within the item.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.770
So that's a very important
point.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.360
Another thing to note is that
this touch region is actually

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.370
very small, and since this is
a fairly important kind of

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.830
gesture, fairly important
action, you may want to

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.970
actually virtually extend
the touch region

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.480
to be about 48 dips.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.430
So while it looks like it's
about 16 or 20 dips wide, you

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.760
may want to use something called
a touch delegate to

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.020
allow users to touch anywhere
within the left 48 dips of the

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.330
screen to allow reordering
or dragging.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.380
So that's the drag grip and
we'll talk about presentation

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.810
of drag grip in a second.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.560
But another way to do this and
actually this is another

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.430
example from Google Keep,
another way to allow users to

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.530
reorder is to allow them to
touch and hold to kind of pick

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.510
up the object, very similar to
how you would trigger the

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.760
contextual action bar.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.520
But then once you touch and
hold and start moving your

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.040
finger around, the object starts
dragging around, so you

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.630
see the ghost image of the
object underneath the finger

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.060
and then you see kind of a
destination rectangle kind of

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.860
move around to indicate where
the object will land

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.680
when you let go.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.120
So this is again slightly more
direct manipulation like.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.780
It kind of fits that principle
quite a bit more.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.050
But it's slightly less
discoverable since it doesn't

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.595
have an on-screen affordance.

00:29:30.595 --> 00:29:32.540
NICK BUTCHER: Another thing you
just said, before we move

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.020
on, is it's important to
indicate when you enter this

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.590
mode as well.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.950
So you need to do examples.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.460
Once you start the drag action
so when you touch on the

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.080
slider menu or when you long
press on the item in Keep,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.675
they visually react to it.

00:29:44.675 --> 00:29:47.540
So in Keep, you see a kind of
ghost semi transparent, and it

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.140
actually kind of moves, I think,
about 16 dips up and

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.040
right or up and left.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.772
It's physically like you've
picked it up almost.

00:29:54.772 --> 00:29:57.450
And I just indicate that this is
what you're acting upon, so

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.485
it it's good to react
straight to it.

00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:00.030
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.280
Absolutely.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.860
One thing I wanted to point
out here is that there's

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.400
actually two visual
presentations for the drag

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.480
grip, the first is this slider
that we call the little three

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:20.120
horizontal lines, a slightly
more common yet older style is

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.730
this kind of tire track where
basically you have these

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:29.070
little kind of boxes, two
columns of boxes or squares

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.530
aligned to the left
of the screen.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.730
And the interaction is just
the exact same thing.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.900
You basically kind of touch to
pick up and start dragging up

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.650
and down, but the visual

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.100
presentation is slightly different.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.490
So this is slightly
older style.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.070
This is a slightly
newer style.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.620
Both are certainly
valid approaches.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:47.900
All right.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.810
So let's move on to
acting on items.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.850
So this is kind of
the big one here.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.390
This is actually kind
of a summary of a

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:57.760
couple of these things.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.910
So acting on items, what we mean
here is, generally, an

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.970
object in a collection
has a single main, a

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.850
touch target itself.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.980
When you touch on it, you show
the details for the object or

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.080
kind of take the
primary action.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.010
Now, what if you have secondary
actions, other

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.070
things you can do
to that object?

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.260
And we touched on a couple of
these already but, the first

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.840
is to offer an action overflow
or a contextual action

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.620
overflow, I guess.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.120
So you would have these
three vertical dots.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.710
Like we said before, you touch
the overflow affordance, and

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.440
then you see a pop-up menu.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.920
So this works well with the
secondary actions like delete.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.960
Also things like if you're in
Google Play and you're looking

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.830
at an app, you can press the
three vertical dots to

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.230
immediately start installing
that app, also things like

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:52.070
edit or whatever you want, any
other things, share as well.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.920
The contextual action bar is
certainly kind of the more

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.210
standard, more common approach
to doing this.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.320
So what you do here is, you
select an object by long

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.670
pressing it and then the context
of the screen changes.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.660
So your action bar changes into
this contextual mode and

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.120
then you can take action
from there.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.350
For example, here you can long
press to pick up a note in

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.630
Google Keep and then change its
color sort of a reminder,

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.000
or archive it.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.260
You'll notice that here in
Google Keep you can long

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.580
press, like I said before,
long press to pick it up.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.590
If you don't move your finger
around, it just selects it and

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.710
lets you take action.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.510
If you start moving your finger,
it will actually start

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.130
dragging it.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:34.510
So these two are very,
I guess they work

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.380
in tandem, if possible.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.600
NICK BUTCHER: And one of my
favorite things about the

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.720
contextual action bar is it's
a very easy way to act on

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.220
multiple items at once.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.820
So you can imagine in the
Gallery example there, if you

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.070
long pressed on an individual
photo, it would offer one

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.980
selection of actions, which is
applicable to a single item.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.415
But if you just quickly tap on
three extras, you have a group

00:32:57.415 --> 00:32:58.510
force of exit.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.090
You can very quickly access
them, very quickly share them,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.820
and delete them, whatever it is
you want to do much quicker

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.040
than I'm going to have to go
into an item and perform an

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.780
action, come back up to the
group, then go do again.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.432
So the contextual bar is very
powerful in that way.

00:33:10.432 --> 00:33:12.753
ROMAN NURIK: One other note I
wanted to make here is that

00:33:12.753 --> 00:33:18.400
rather than taking the action
first and then selecting which

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.830
objects you want to take action
on, like it is very

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.400
common in other platforms, on
Android it's really kind of

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.880
select first then take action.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.300
The nice thing about this is
that it's very much direct

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.540
manipulation minded, right?

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.090
I mean, you start with the
content, you start with the

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.200
object, and then you
perform the action.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.360
The other nice thing about the
contextual action bar here is

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.200
actually you can offer things
like Select All really easily.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.290
So once you long press the
Select, you can offer like a

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.030
spinner in the action bar
offering the user to Select

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.520
All or Deselect or
things like that.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.120
All right.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.890
Moving on since we're running
super short on time.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:03.470
Another very popular way of
offering a secondary action is

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.280
to offer something in line with
the list item running

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.700
along the right side
of the screen.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.010
So here you'll notice that with
this individual object,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.610
another action you could take is
make changes to it, change

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.929
its settings.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.010
And this is offered as a
Settings icon all in the right

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.960
side of the screen.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.469
You'll notice that there's a
little divider here, and this

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:28.360
serves the purpose of indicating
that there are two

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.870
distinct touch regions.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.929
So if I touch here, one
thing will happen.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.719
If I touch here, something
else will happen.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.530
Another think you should keep
in mind when presenting this

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.080
type of UI is that you should
make sure that the entire

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.670
right side of the screen or
right side of this item is

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.440
dedicated to that secondary
action.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.949
So if I touch above the icon
or below the Settings icon,

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.005
you should still trigger
the settings action.

00:34:50.005 --> 00:34:52.949
And that's really to kind of
simplify the number of touch

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:56.469
regions or simplify the touch
regions on the screen and to

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.460
prevent human error
with touches.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.730
NICK BUTCHER: And those are kind
of echoed by the touch

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.830
highlight, so that if you were
to touch on the main item, the

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.980
entire line will light up to
kind of like underscore the

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.830
fact this is the main action,
and if you touch on the

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.640
secondary reaction, just
the area up to the

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.537
divider will light up.

00:35:11.537 --> 00:35:14.160
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.520
One last thing I wanted to point
out here is another good

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.580
example of this since you know
this entire episode has been

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.510
driven by examples, we
wanted to see these

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.090
techniques used in action.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.550
Another really good example of
this is in the contact details

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:32.240
screen, you manage your phone
probably has contacts app on

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.250
your Nexus device probably
the People app.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.510
When you're looking at contact
details, if you look at a list

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.770
of phone numbers for a specific
contact, you'll

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.970
notice that each of those
phone numbers has an

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.390
additional secondary action on
the right to send a text

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.610
message to that number.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.870
So the primary touch target, the
phone number itself, will

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.660
try to place a call
to that number.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.210
But then if you touch on the
right-hand side, there's

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.220
little text message icon that
will actually take the users

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.810
to the composed text
message screen.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.840
So lots of different
ways to offer

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.120
additional actions on objects.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.880
So I think that about does
it for collections.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.825
So we talked about a couple
things today.

00:36:11.825 --> 00:36:15.910
We talked about specifically
kind of how you can offer

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:20.100
filtering, searching, sorting
through collections, I guess

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.610
the consumption side as well as
how to present collections

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.080
in a very responsive way.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.450
And then we talked about a
mutation of collections,

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.790
adding/removing items,
reordering them, as well as

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.750
taking action on items within
a site of objects.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.460
So that's about it for today.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.642
With that, I'm your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:36:39.642 --> 00:36:41.930
NICK BUTCHER: And bye from
me, Nick Butcher.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.180
ROMAN NURIK: Thanks
for joining, guys.
