As professor Horseman develops his car example, we'll do our own more

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.460
interesting example in parallel. Cars aren't where the money is. The money is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.970
in social networks, but existing social networks, I mean my parents are in

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.290
existing social networks. Maybe we're going to need to start our own new social

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.900
network. Let's call it Udacious.net. Social networks are all about people, so

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.150
we're going to need a person class. And the thing we're interested in them

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.173
doing, is making friends. So, if we have two people, John and Maria, who meet.

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:33.905
And now John considers Maria a friend, we need to update our persons objects to

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.675
reflect that. What might the method call look like in Java?
