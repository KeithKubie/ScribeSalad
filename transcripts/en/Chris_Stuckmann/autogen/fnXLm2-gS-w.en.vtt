00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.699
I have a few problems with the
documentary and mainly their technical

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709
documentary and mainly their technical
 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.930
documentary and mainly their technical
issues because I look at things from a

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940
issues because I look at things from a
 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.520
issues because I look at things from a
directorial standpoint quite often I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530
directorial standpoint quite often I
 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.259
directorial standpoint quite often I
really got annoyed with how often the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269
really got annoyed with how often the
 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.550
really got annoyed with how often the
camera went in and out of focus

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
camera went in and out of focus
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.379

throughout this movie it happens so many

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389
throughout this movie it happens so many
 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.599
throughout this movie it happens so many
times I know they're filming live events

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609
times I know they're filming live events
 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.979
times I know they're filming live events
and that's very difficult to get the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989
and that's very difficult to get the
 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.780
and that's very difficult to get the
focus right but I mean the entire movie

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790
focus right but I mean the entire movie
 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.330
focus right but I mean the entire movie
just goes like in and out of focus over

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
just goes like in and out of focus over
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.680
just goes like in and out of focus over
and over again that's just a technical

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690
and over again that's just a technical
 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.030
and over again that's just a technical
issue though bully is a good documentary

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
