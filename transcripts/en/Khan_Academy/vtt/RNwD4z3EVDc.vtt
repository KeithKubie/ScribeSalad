♫ Neither sand nor heat

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.725
♫ Would assail their feet

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:29.247

♫ When bandits made an assault

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:51.525
♫ But

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.683
♫ But the Fanboys fan
made a wind so mighty

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:58.138

♫ The magistrate said
we're all very grateful

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.677
♫ But it's time for an end to your fun

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:21.354
♫ He said to the boys

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.344
♫ It's your fan or your freedom

00:01:23.344 --> 00:01:26.926

♫ The boys who had a plan

00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.427
♫ The boys saw the land
was crying for justice

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:48.992
♫ Yet they knew that this wasn't the way

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:50.803
♫ So they put down their fan

00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:53.152
♫ And they picked up their notebooks

00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:57.319
♫ And this is what they had to say ♫

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.879
- [Voiceover] Though we
lay down our fan this day,

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.968
you too can have the power
to unite phrases, words

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:09.135
and clauses with the coordinating
conjunctions of English.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.602
Which are:

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.624
- [All] For.

00:02:14.624 --> 00:02:15.457
And.

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:17.268
Nor.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.004
But.

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:20.787
Or.

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:23.320
Yet.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.153
So.

00:02:25.564 --> 00:02:28.583
- [Voiceover] You too
can harness the power

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:29.833
of the Fanboys.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.624
♫ Fanboys

00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:35.922
♫ They're the Fanboys

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.404
♫ The boys who carry the fan

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:39.456
♫ That's their whole deal

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:40.289
♫ Fanboys

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.186
♫ We're all Fanboys

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.353
♫ Remember the boys with the fan ♫
