00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.190
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.800
and today, I'm learning more about

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.380
Article VII of the US Constitution,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.530
which is the provision that specified

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.530
the conditions for the
Constitution to become law.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.500
It reads, "The ratification
of the conventions

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.030
of nine states, shall be sufficient for

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.010
the establishment of this Constitution

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.750
between the states so ratifying the same."

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.713
Although this sounds simple, it reminds us

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:26.880
that when the framers finished
drafting the Constitution

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.540
in Philadelphia is 1787, it
was by no means a done deal.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.100
At least nine states had
to ratify the Constitution

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.640
in order to replace
the existing government

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.620
under the Articles of Confederation.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.920
To learn more about the
ratification process,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.810
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.180
Mark Graber is the Jacob A. France

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.210
Professor of Constitutionalism at

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.200
the University of Maryland
Francis King Kerry School of Law.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.210
Michael Rappaport is the
Darling Foundation professor

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.980
at the University of
San Diego School of Law.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.200
Professor Graber, can
you tell us a little bit

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.040
about the political
context of ratification?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.940
What was going on at this time as

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.060
the framers tried to
put a new Constitution

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.690
into the fabric of the United States?

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.940
- [Mark] Well, one central problem of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.270
the Articles of Confederation
was the Articles

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.270
required that all 13 states
consent for any amendment.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.250
And it turned out, at this time,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.210
Rhode Island was a great outlier

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.580
so Rhode Island wasn't gonna
consent to much of anything,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.690
and, in fact, Rhode Island
did not even send delegates

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.440
to the convention that
drafted the Constitution,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.900
so the framers knew that if you had

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.560
the unanimous rule for
ratification, it would not work.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.810
Instead they chose nine,
it's about two thirds,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.590
three fourths, in part to make sure

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
Rhode Island and one outlier
could not prevent adoption.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.410
- [Michael] So, let's remember,
there's two stages here

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.774
in how the Constitution
gets written and ratified.

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:02.620
First, it's written in what's called

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.750
The Drafting Convention, or
the Philadelphia Convention,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.890
which was held during the summer of 1787,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.010
and in that convention, it's
pretty much in agreement

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.010
that the federal government
needed to be made stronger,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.260
but that was just a proposal.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.410
In order for the
Constitution to be ratified,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.610
it needed nine of the thirteen states and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.900
so it went to the second stage,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.750
and there things were, in some ways,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.060
gonna be more difficult,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.350
because there was a variety of viewpoints

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.200
in the different states.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.630
The main question that came up

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.000
in state after state after state was,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.520
was the federal government being given

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.030
too much additional power?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.120
Under the previous regime of
the Articles of Confederation,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.570
the federal government
had very limited powers,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.280
and the Constitution was gonna

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.190
give the federal government more power.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.590
- [Mark] They wanted a strategy that,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.053
once the balls started rolling,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.030
states that were slower were
gonna be faced with a choice.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.070
You could get in on the inside,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.940
and maybe affect some changes early,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.970
but if you were left out,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.647
whatever happened would
happen without you,

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.330
and a lot of states, at the end,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.830
were fearful of being left out.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.030
- [Michael] This strategy worked,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.100
and as they went through in
tough states, as time went on,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.850
so New Hampshire,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.490
Virginia,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.730
New York,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.900
North Caroline, Rhode Island,
in order to get ratification,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.800
each time they promised,
we'll have a Bill of Rights

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.010
and those states added
a list of amendments

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.877
that they wanted added
to the Constitution.

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:47.920
- [Kim] So was it controversial that

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.640
the framers decided that only nine states

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.750
would be necessary to
ratify the Constitution?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.220
- [Mark] Very controversial.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.480
One of these central
points of anti-federalists

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.740
was that this was illegal,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.590
that the existing Constitution
said all states so therefore,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.390
only all states could
change the Constitution.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.380
- [Michael] So in that respect,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.890
it was somewhat controversial.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.854
Another way in which it
departed from the Articles

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:14.800
is the Articles said you needed

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.448
the state legislatures to
approve the amendments,

00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:20.500
and the U.S. Constitution said,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.160
no, we want state conventions,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.150
special bodies elected by the people

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.590
to approve these things.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.770
Why did they say that?

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.210
Because they feared that
the state legislatures,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.550
who would be losing a lot of
power under the Constitution,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.800
would vote against it,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.410
so they wanted sort of to
go directly to the people

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.570
in these conventions and
bypass the state legislatures.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.930
- [Kim] So we know that
there were some opponents

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.950
of this new Constitution.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.600
How close did they actually come

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.730
to preventing its ratification?

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.600
- [Michael] Well, it
was a very close fight.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.010
We look back on it and
eventually all 13 states

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.140
are gonna ratify and it looks like,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.560
oh well, that wasn't
too much of a trouble,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.140
but it was very close
and things could have

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.080
easily gone in the opposite direction.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.020
One of the ways in which it was close

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.120
was that there were just very close votes.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.700
Massachusetts

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.290
was 187 to 168.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.820
New Hampshire was 57 47.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.080
New York was 30 27.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.629
Very close votes.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.210
A couple of people changing their mind and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.290
that would have meant
various states didn't ratify.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.340
In addition to that,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.010
some of the states
actually did not ratify.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.170
The first thing that
happened was Rhode Island,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.160
early on in the process, says,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.000
we don't like your horrible Constitution,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.210
they all expected that.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.950
We're not gonna hold even a convention.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.930
You want us to hold a convention,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.190
we're not gonna hold a convention.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.240
We're just gonna have a vote in state.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.480
And that vote in the state,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.543
90% of the people voted
against the Constitution.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.060
In a way, Rhode Island actually
voted against ratification,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.820
although it didn't use the proper method.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.340
North Caroline, also,
they held a convention,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.870
and they were very upset about

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.940
there not being a Bill of
Rights in the Constitution,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.750
and they just didn't approve it.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.490
They didn't disapprove
it, they just did nothing,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.600
and they waited.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.800
And so, in a way, two of the states

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.470
voted against ratification.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.800
- [Mark] North Carolina
had not yet ratified

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.560
when George Washington took office,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.410
so, in fact, when George
Washington took office,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.080
there were only 11 states in the Union.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.920
At the end of the day, crucial people,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.560
I think, decided it was better
to sign the Constitution

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.470
and be in on the ground floor

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.030
then stay out and see what happened.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.863
- [Kim] Interesting, so, who are

00:06:48.863 --> 00:06:51.440
some of the major players involved here,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.490
and what were they arguing about?

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.145
- [Michael] There were the federalists,

00:06:55.145 --> 00:06:59.834
who were arguing in favor of
ratifying the Constitution,

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:01.235
and the anti-federalists,

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:04.790
who were arguing against
ratifying the Constitution.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.075
The federalists, two of
the very famous ones,

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:13.070
are familiar names, Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.130
Those two people, that were
also particularly important

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.300
because they decided, Hamilton said,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.490
we're gonna have a tough time

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.560
getting ratification in New York,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.300
we need to write some essays
defending the Constitution.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.760
And so Hamilton and
Madison cooperated together

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.300
and wrote what we now call
The Federalist Papers,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.980
which were simply essays
written in the newspapers

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.490
trying to urge the New York Convention

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.370
to ratify the Constitution.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.670
Eventually those essays
were sent to other states

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.510
and became known, and now we've come to

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.930
revere those essays as
The Federalist Papers.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.340
But they were originally just kind of

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.850
advocacy pieces for
ratifying the convention.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.310
Now, there were also anti-federalists.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.240
- [Mark] The anti-federalists, in part,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.400
were simply people who
opposed the Constitution,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.670
and just as is the case as
say people opposed Obamacare

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.030
from both the left and the right,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.330
people who opposed the Constitution

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.270
opposed it for many different reasons,

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.330
and one of their problems was
they were not a united bunch.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.370
But, in general, these were people

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.020
fearful of a very strong
national government.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.270
They believed states were sovereign,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.690
they wanted to keep power local,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.610
and they were very fearful of what they

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.900
perceived to be an elite who would

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.620
run the Constitution after ratification.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.230
The names that people may
know who were anti-federalist

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.540
were people like Patrick
Henry and Samuel Adams.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.880
- [Kim] So what were some
of the major arguments

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.320
made in favor of adopting
this new Constitution?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.950
- [Michael] There were, I
think, two types of arguments.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.980
People felt that the articles
were not working properly.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.390
They had all kinds of problems,

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.590
and one of the strongest arguments

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.140
that the Federalist papers made was that

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.140
if we don't fix this and make
for a stronger union together,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.680
what'll happen is, we'll break apart.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.170
Look at what happens when you have

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.170
a bunch of states all next to
one another in a land area.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.870
We know what that looks
like, it's called Europe,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.170
and what happens in Europe?

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.950
They fight wars with one
another all the time,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.850
and those wars are very problematic.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.660
You have to have big
armies, standing armies.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.960
Now, there were also the
particular arguments about

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.860
what powers were missing that
the federal government had.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.310
The main arguments were made was

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.530
the federal government
did not have enough power,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.670
so they didn't have, for
example, the taxing power,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.500
and they didn't have a
way of enforcing treaties

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.760
against the states very well,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.130
and some of the states
were putting tariffs up,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.610
so interfering with
trade within the country.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:00.360
- [Mark] So, states would set
tariffs on out-of-state goods,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.860
states wouldn't contribute
to the national government.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.030
Second, we needed to
present an united front

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.420
to foreign governments.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.480
We were very worried, what would happen

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.260
if South Carolina formed
an alliance with England

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.130
and North Carolina formed
an alliance with France.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.090
That wouldn't be good,

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.162
the country needed to
speak with one voice.

00:10:22.162 --> 00:10:23.520
- [Kim] Those are some of the arguments

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.750
made for adopting the Constitution,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.860
what were some of the arguments

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.230
against adopting this new Constitution?

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.280
- [Mark] Well, first argument was,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.700
even though most anti-federalists admitted

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.130
the Articles needed some repair,

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.990
they said it's not really urgent.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.790
It's not like the house is
gonna fall down tomorrow,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.160
it's just, you know, the
wind is coming through

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.890
and we can figure it out.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.840
We really want a better Constitution.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.390
The other arguments were the Constitution

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.880
put too much power in
the national government.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.870
It put too much power in elites.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.990
The fear was if you
had national elections,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.940
only elites would win.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.520
If you had local elections,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.180
people the people actually knew would win.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.540
- [Kim] They thought, a
big national government

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.390
would be too far away from the people

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.410
to know what they really needed,

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.170
as opposed to state governments,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.270
which they perceived
as being more personal,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.240
closer to the needs of individuals?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.430
- [Mark] Compare two kinds of elections.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.650
First, how many people really know anyone

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.450
who runs for Senator,
who runs for President,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.550
that you're on a first name basis with?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.390
Now, compare, you're in a school club,

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.550
chances are when someone runs for

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.290
an office in the school
club, you know who they are.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.120
- [Michael] Another type of argument was,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.320
if you give the federal
government this power,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.860
and even if, and the federalists would

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.750
always argue that the power was limited

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.390
that they were being given
to the federal government,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.160
and the anti-federalists
came back and they said,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.410
well, you say it's limited

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.430
but what we know from
historical experience is

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.970
is that once a government's in power,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.640
it tends to seize more power.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.540
There's a lot of vague
phrases in the Constitution

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.770
and the federal government will use

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.850
those vague phrases to assert
greater and greater power.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.470
- [Kim] What were some
of the strategies that

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.000
the framers used to entice
some of the opponents

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.690
of a strong central government
to ratify the Constitution?

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.190
- [Michael] The first thing that they did

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.150
was to try to build up momentum.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.350
They knew there were certain states

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.160
which were strongly in
favor of ratification.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.940
Small states, sometimes,
wanted ratification.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.970
The first state that comes in is Delaware,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.820
and they vote 30 to zero
for the Constitution,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.010
and a bunch of early states,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.110
so let's say the first five states

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.200
all vote for ratification
by pretty lopsided margins.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.260
That builds up a kind of momentum.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.200
Alright, we have five states,
we only need four more.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.253
Of course, the next ones
that were gonna come

00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:06.443
were gonna be much more difficult.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.760
They then needed to change

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.810
their strategy at that point.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.250
- [Mark] They argued like crazy.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.870
The Federalist Papers are
a very famous example.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.630
They indicated they'd be open to amendment

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.773
once the Constitution was ratified.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.780
Then again, in Pennsylvania,

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.640
when anti-federalists
boycotted the convention,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.480
and the result is the
convention didn't have a quorum,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.690
they ordered the
sergeant-at-arms to a tavern.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.740
The sergeant-at-arms found some
boycotting anti-federalists

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.390
and physically put them in the building

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.712
so they could count for a quorum.

00:13:43.712 --> 00:13:44.880
- [Kim] That is terrific.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.970
- [Mark] That one doesn't get told

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.570
in a whole lot of history books.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.730
- [Kim] Wow.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.580
- [Mark] The framers could play

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.040
rough and tumble politics
with the best of them.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.260
- [Kim] A lot of the things that

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.670
pop up at the time of the framing,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.530
I think, we look back
on today and imagine,

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.620
how would this work in today's era,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.550
with 330 million Americans?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.030
Do you think the system under

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.860
the Articles of Confederation with a

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.593
smaller, more local, government
could possibly work today?

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.650
- [Michael] Well, among other things,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.540
the Articles had no great means of

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.090
collecting taxes or gaining revenue.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.660
Given that modern government
needs trillions of dollars,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.750
the Articles, if you've
got a thousand dollars,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.240
it was a miracle, so the
Articles clearly don't work.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.210
But the Articles were inadequate

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.990
for 18th century government.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.140
They were clearly inadequate,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.230
or would be clearly inadequate,
for 21st century government.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.650
Now, the Constitution appears to have been

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.930
adequate for 18th century government,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.420
whether it is adequate for
21st century government

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.900
is a fair question.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.200
- [Michael] One of the
interesting questions about

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.780
the Constitution is, how
democratic is the Constitution?

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.270
This debate about how
democratic the Constitution is

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.130
actually enters into the
question about ratification.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.990
On one level,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.070
the Constitution was democratic

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.900
because each state in these
ratification conventions

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.680
voted on whether to
ratify by majority vote.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.020
On the other hand, at the federal level,

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.020
the ratification requirement
required nine out of 13,

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.300
and the idea there would
be, we needed more buy in.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.420
We needed a limitation
on simple majority rule

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.420
in order to make the system function well,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.620
in order to produce a Constitution

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.800
that would have support
from the whole country.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.590
The interesting thing about
that supermajority rule,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.300
and something that people don't often

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.380
make the connection with,

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.970
is we probably owe our Bill of Rights

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.230
to that supermajority rule,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.030
because if only seven of the 13 states,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.365
the minimum majority, had been needed

00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:00.820
to ratify the Constitution,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.110
then it's quite possible that the

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.340
federalists wouldn't have had to

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.750
promise to put a Bill of
Rights into the Constitution,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.160
because they wouldn't have needed to.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.760
And they were initially quite opposed

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.220
to putting a Bill of
Rights in the Constitution.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.850
It was only the fact that they needed

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.690
nine out of 13 states that
really forced their hand

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.270
and forced them to promise that

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.120
they would put the Bill
of Rights in there.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.710
We see, in terms of the ratification,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.750
that there's both sort
of democratic elements

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.750
but also republican, or
supermajority, elements.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.430
- [Kim] We've learned that it wasn't easy

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.160
to ratify the Constitution.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.530
The framers bypassed state legislatures

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.770
and went directly to the
people in state conventions,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.020
hoping that momentum and arguments for

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.560
a stronger federal government would entice

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.470
the opponents of the
Constitution to ratify it.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:57.470
It took until 1789 for
nine out of 13 states

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.440
to ratify the Constitution
and finally make it law.
