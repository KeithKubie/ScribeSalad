00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.483
- [Voiceover] Is the function
given below continuous

00:00:02.483 --> 00:00:04.840
slash differentiable at x equals one?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.362
And they define the function g piece wise

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.798
right over here, and then they

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:09.972
give us a bunch of choices.

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:11.133
Continuous but not differentiable.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.817
Differentiable but not continuous.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:13.841
Both continuous and differentiable.

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.662
Neither continuous nor differentiable.

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.171
And, like always, pause this video

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:19.863
and see if you could figure this out.

00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:21.072
So let's do step by step.

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.433
So first let's think about continuity.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:26.605
So for continuity, for g to
be continuous at x equals one

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:30.217
that means that g of
one, that means g of one

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.193
must be equal to the
limit as x approaches one

00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:35.443
of g of g of x.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.313
Well g of one, what is that going to be?

00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:43.135
G of one we're going
to fall into this case.

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:46.884
One minus one squared is going to be zero.

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:49.057
So if we can show that the limit of g of x

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:51.776
as x approaches one is
the same as g of one

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:54.468
is equal to zero than we
know we're continuous there.

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:56.625
Well let's do the left and
right handed limits here.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.446
So if we do the left handed limit, limit,

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.532
and that's especially
useful 'cause we're in

00:01:00.532 --> 00:01:02.272
these different clauses
here as we approach

00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:04.254
from the left and the right hand side.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:06.583
So as x approaches one from

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:09.000
the left hand side of g of x.

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:12.961
Well we're going to be falling
into this situation here

00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.722
as we approach from the
left as x is less than one.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:19.905
So this is going to be
the same thing as that.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.986
That's what g of x is equal to when we

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:24.932
are less than one as we're
approaching from the left.

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:28.349
Well this thing is defined,
and it's continuous

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:29.687
for all real numbers.

00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:31.948
So we could just substitute one in for x,

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:34.501
and we get this is equal to zero.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.709
So so far so good, let's
do one more of these.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.897
Let's approach from the right hand side.

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:43.756
As x approaches one from the
right hand side of g of x.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:45.486
Well now we're falling into this case

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:47.958
so g of x if we're to the right of one

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.188
if values are greater or equal to one

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:53.098
it's gonna be x minus one squared.

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:54.898
Well once again x minus one squared

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.076
that is defined for all real numbers.

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:58.343
It's continuous for all real numbers,

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.513
so we could just pop that one in there.

00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:01.793
You get one minus one squared.

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:03.636
Well that's just zero again,

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:05.976
so the left hand limit,
the right hand limit

00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:07.450
are both equal zero, which means that the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.825
limit of g of x as x approaches
one is equal to zero.

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:13.336
Which is the same thing as g of one,

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:15.430
so we are good with continuity.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.814
So we can rule out all of the ones

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:19.181
that are saying that it's not continuous.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.841
So we can rule out that one,

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:25.242
and we can rule out that
one right over there.

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.259
So now let's think about
whether it is differentiable.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.009
So differentiability.

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.376
So differentiability, I'll write
differentiability, ability.

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:39.671
Did I, let's see, that's a long word.

00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:41.921
Differentiability, alright.

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:45.561
Differentiability, what
needs to be true here?

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.773
Well we have to have a defined limit

00:02:47.773 --> 00:02:50.523
as x approaches one for f of x

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.028
minus f of one over,

00:02:54.613 --> 00:02:57.480
oh let me be careful, it's not f it's g.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.437
So we need to have a
defined limit for g of x

00:03:01.437 --> 00:03:02.604
minus g of one

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:05.178
over x minus one.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.575
And so let's just try
to evaluate this limit

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.179
from the left and right hand sides,

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.296
and we can simplify it.

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:14.275
We already know that g of one is zero.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:15.860
So that's just going to be zero.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.348
So we just need to find the limit

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:19.770
as x approaches one of
g of x over x minus one

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.615
or see if we can find the limit.

00:03:21.615 --> 00:03:23.915
So let's first think about the limit

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:26.292
as we approach from the left hand side

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:27.709
of g of x over

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.973
x minus.

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.755
G of x over x minus one.

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.353
Well as we approach
from the left hand side,

00:03:36.353 --> 00:03:38.351
g of x is that right over there.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.654
So we could write this.

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:40.487
Instead of writing g of x,

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.181
we could write this as x minus one.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.801
X minus one over x minus one,

00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:48.765
and as long as we aren't equal to one,

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:50.572
this thing is going to be equal

00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:52.959
as long as x does not equal one.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.300
X minus one over x minus
one is just going to be one.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.299
So this limit is going to be one.

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.266
So that one worked out.

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:02.310
Now let's think about the limit

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.498
as x approaches one
from the right hand side

00:04:06.498 --> 00:04:09.532
of, once again, I could
write g of x of g of one,

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:10.723
but g of one is just zero,

00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:15.378
so I'll just write g
of x over x minus one.

00:04:15.378 --> 00:04:17.161
Well what's g of x now?

00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:19.267
Well it's x minus one squared.

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:20.887
So instead of writing g of x,

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:24.554
I could write this as x minus one squared

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.391
over x minus one,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.533
and so as long as x does not equal one,

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:32.660
we're just doing the limit.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.149
We're saying as we approach
one from the right hand side.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.845
Well, this expression right over here

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:39.915
you have x minus one squared
divided by x minus one,

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:42.828
well, that's just going
to give us x minus one.

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:44.837
X minus one squared divided by x minus one

00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:48.443
is just going to be x minus one,

00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:52.042
and this limit, well this
expression right over here

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:56.265
is going to be continuous
and defined for sure all

00:04:56.265 --> 00:04:58.432
x's that are not equaling one.

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.074
Actually, let me, let me, well,

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:02.839
it was before it was this,

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.350
x minus one squared over x minus one.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.251
This thing over here, as
I said, is not defined

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:11.344
for x equals one, but it
is defined for anything

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:15.299
for x does not equal one, and
we're just approaching one.

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:17.628
And, if we wanted to
simplify this expression,

00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:20.536
it would get, this would just be

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:21.369
I think I just did this,

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:23.573
but I'm making sure I'm doing it right.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.167
This is going to be the same this as that

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:27.270
for x not being equal to one.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.303
Well this is just going to be zero.

00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:31.852
We could just evaluate when
x is equal to one here.

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:33.632
This is going to be equal to zero.

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:36.034
And so notice, you get a different limit

00:05:36.034 --> 00:05:39.263
for this definition of the
derivative as we approach

00:05:39.263 --> 00:05:42.167
from the left hand side
or the right hand side,

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.499
and that makes sense.

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.680
This graph is gonna look something like,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.076
we have a slope of one, so it's gonna look

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:49.466
something like this.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:53.335
And then right when x is equal to one

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:56.280
and the value of our function is zero

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.208
it looks something like this,
it looks something like this.

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:02.259
And so the graph is continuous

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.546
the graph for sure is continuous,

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:07.325
but our slope coming
into that point is one,

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.929
and our slope right when we
leave that point is zero.

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:14.536
So it is not differentiable over there.

00:06:14.536 --> 00:06:18.703
So it is continuous, continuous,
but not differentiable.
