00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.211
RICK HARRISON: What
can I help you with?

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.796
Well, I've got a
really cool half dollar.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.381
RICK HARRISON: OK.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:13.471
It is a 1906, $0.50, improperly
cleaned, John W Gill.

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.557
And what is that supposed to be?

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.851
He was one of the
victims of the Titanic.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:18.435
RICK HARRISON: Whoa.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.982
FREDERICK: This coin is an
incredible link to history.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.234
One of the most famous
maritime disasters.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.154
It has an unbroken
chain of pedigree

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.614
all the way back to 1912.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.784
I paid $75,000 for the
coin about a year ago,

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.453
but I'd really like
to reappropriate

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:40.999
funds and buy some more toys
for some of my collections.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.293
RICK HARRISON: God,
this is pretty amazing.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.462
You know, everyone knows
the story of the Titanic.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.255
You know, it was
the unsinkable ship.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.965
FREDERICK: Absolutely.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.468
And the big problem was, it
was a new steel process, which

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.219
made the steel
really brittle, so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.013
when they ran into an iceberg
everything started breaking up.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.391
And it sank in a few
hours, but there was a lot

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.518
of floating bodies afterwards.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.228
There was a few
ships that came by.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.230
Anything that was on
their body was cataloged.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.524
It was sealed up, sent
back to the family members,

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.276
and they were buried at sea.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.112
Yeah, these guys
picked up 239 bodies.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.615
He was tagged body 155.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:15.200
RICK HARRISON: Hm, OK.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.243
So how did you get it?

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.954
I bought it from an avid
collector about a year ago.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.372
OK.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.541
And so this was auctioned
off at one point?

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:24.793
Obviously, you got
the catalog here.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:25.794
It's like, 2002.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.128
FREDERICK: 2002, yeah.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.421
It was auctioned on
the 90th anniversary

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.632
of the sinking of the Titanic.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.091
RICK HARRISON: OK.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.261
This coin by itself would
be worth $40 or $50,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.598
but the fact that it belonged to
someone who died on the Titanic

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.267
is a complete game changer.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.436
And how you looking
to get out of it?

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.147
About $125,000.

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.899
And where did you come
up with that figure?

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.651
OK.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.487
A $1 bill that came off of one
of the survivors of the Titanic

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.072
sold for $125,000.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:57.575
Now, the story of the
Titanic isn't the survivors.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.327
It's the victims.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.121
So kind of figure this has to
be worth the same kind of money.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.958
It's got a million
dollar story behind it.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.125
I'm a little bit intrigued.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.336
Let me call a coin
buddy of mine.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.462
Let me have him
take a look at it.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.089
Absolutely.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.590
See what he thinks about
it, and we'll go from there.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.758
OK?
- Fair enough.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:14.843
All right.
I'll be right back.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.594
Take your time.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.388
This coin is one of a kind.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.390
It's a wonderful
link to history.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.561
And I really would not
go less than $50,000.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.312
This is what I
called you about.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.690
It's a half dollar
supposedly off the Titanic.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.442
Wow.
It's a fantastic item.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.111
RICK HARRISON: Do you
know anything about it?

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.780
Well, John Gill was one
of the unfortunate victims.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.241
He was 24 years old,
second class passenger,

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.493
left his new bride
to start a new life.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.412
And there are very
detailed records

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.539
that I was able to
access that described

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.500
the kinds of things that were
found on Mr. Gill's corpse.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.335
There's a gold watch.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.588
There's a gold ring
with his initials on it.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:55.216
But there were coins in there,
and this is one of them.

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.718
RICK HARRISON: Cool.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.887
This wouldn't be the
first item I have actually

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.763
handled from the Titanic.

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.724
Something like this
is highly unusual,

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:06.895
and collectors really line
up for that kind of thing.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:08.688
RICK HARRISON: So, what
do you think it's worth?

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:18.031
Well, apparently this coin had
sold in 2011 for about $3,850,

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:22.660
and then again in 2014
for about $21,000.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.288
A coin like this
really has to reach

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.499
the ultimate audience
where you could justify

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.377
charging much more than that.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.795
So $21,000?

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.589
Right in that ballpark.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.883
I would have to think
that even at $21k,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.176
it was in the wrong auction.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.886
That's it would seem
to me, they missed

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.387
the wrong target audience.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.222
DAVID VAGI: So, with an
item like this value,

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:46.768
it was only determined when
several extremely interested

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.354
parties are all aware
that it's selling,

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.064
and they have the
opportunity to compete.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.857
There is no such thing
as an accurate value.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.233
RICK HARRISON: OK.
Thanks, man.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.735
I sort of got the gist of it.
- All right.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.236
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.780
Appreciate it.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.281
FREDERICK: I understand
where the expert has come up

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.824
with his number
from, but I think

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.868
it's value stands
on its own, not

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:07.664
what it sold for previously.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.375
I mean, if it sold, like
a year ago for $21,000,

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.502
there's no way of
justifying $125,000.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.129
I just don't see it happening.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.632
It's something I'd pay
like $10,000 for it,

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:21.344
because it's something where
the price waxes and wanes.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.805
Just depends on how cool
the Titanic is at that time.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.140
So I mean, is there a
realistic price you'd

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.102
be willing to take for it?

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.479
I guess I'd really
need to be at $75,000.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.981
Yeah, I mean--

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.898
There's no way we're
going to make a deal then.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.024
- Understood.
- OK.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:35.900
Have a nice day, man.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.567
You as well.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.319
Thanks so much.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.781
I think the offer of $10,000 was
a bit shocking, quite frankly.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.826
This seems to be
so far below what

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.202
other people would value it at.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.203
It's hard for me to
take it seriously.
