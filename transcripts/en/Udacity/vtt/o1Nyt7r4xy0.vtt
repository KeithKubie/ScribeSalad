00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
During a lightening storm, mass electric fields can build up between the ground and the earth.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's say that in one particular lightening storm, you have an electric field

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of 10,000 N/C pointing downwards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's say you want to take advantage of this electric field

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
by taking an air-filled balloon that you've recently inflated--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that's a balloon, by the way--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and rubbing it on your head, because rubbing a balloon on your head

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
actually causes the rubber of the balloon to strip electrons away from your hair

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and give the balloon a negative charge.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
By doing this, you're hoping that you can take your balloon and have it suspend itself

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
inside this region of electric fields in such a way that the weight of the balloon downwards

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is exactly the balanced by an electric force upwards.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If we know that the weight of the balloon--or I should say the mass of the balloon--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is 30 g, how much charge must you put on the balloon to have it balance perfeclty

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in this electric field? Enter your answer here in Coulombs.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I've set this up in scientific notation,

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so you can enter your exponent here and the base part of your number here.
