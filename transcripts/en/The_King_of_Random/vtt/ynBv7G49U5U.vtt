00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.932
In today's video,

00:00:00.932 --> 00:00:03.400
we are going to find out
if you can make slime

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.800
out of ballpoint pen ink.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:14.380
[Music]

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.700
Guys, a few of you wanted to see

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.800
if we could make slime
out of pen ink.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
A few of you.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.100
This is 48 comments,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.200
and the irony of this is
that they were more,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.652
but we ran out of
printer ink to print them.

00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:29.300
So I guess,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.300
we're going to try and make
some slime out of pen ink.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.709
But first,

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:33.800
we should probably address
the elephant in the room.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860
My black gloves
are gone, you guys.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.350
We've decided to wear white
gloves with this video because

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.700
if you've seen our previous
videos with the ink,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.600
it stains everything.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.040
We kind of want to see
how bad it's going to be.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.700
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.900
Taking our leftover
ballpoint pen ink,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.400
we are going to mix
that with some regular slime,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.300
and see if we can get
it to hold together.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.200
To start off,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.230
we are going to make the most
basic slime there is, borax,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.400
clear glue, and water.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.300
Let's get mixing.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.100
Start off with 1 cup water,
and 1/2 teaspoon borax.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:13.740
[Music]

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.000
Once your borax is dissolved,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.339
add 1/2 cup of water
to 5 ounces of clear glue,

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.300
which is just over 1/2 cup.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:29.640
[Music]

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200
All right, before I
combine these two,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.031
I'm actually going
to add the pen ink

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.540
to our glue mixture.,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.500
see if that's even going to mix
it all before we add the borax.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.279
This might be the very end
of our ink, guys.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.800
We're just going
to start with a little.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.800
When I say a little,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.080
I mean about a
hundred pens worth.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.730
[Music]

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.620
Oh, wow.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.597
Right from the start,

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:54.311
you can actually see the blue
is separating right out.

00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:55.900
Pigments rising to the top.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.197
Now, you can actually
see the copper

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
and the blue has sort
of separated here.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.140
Now, it almost looks
like an oil spill.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.900
It doesn't look quite
the same as the surface

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.260
of our ink itself,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.620
but you definitely have
that metallic shine.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.000
[Music]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.760
Oh, something happened.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.000
Wait.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.200
[Music]

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.100
Awesome.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.200
Guys, I think it worked.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.680
We have pen ink slime.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.780
[Music]

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.000
Well, it definitely worked.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.322
You can still see these bits
of copper everywhere.

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:46.040
But the blue,
you can actually see,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.900
it's kind of coming
out on my gloves.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.082
So it's separated.

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:50.200
But to be honest,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.083
it's not making nearly
as huge of a mess

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:52.765
as I thought.

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:55.100
I was expecting this
to stick to everything.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.500
But instead of sticking

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.600
to everything, it's just
a beautiful metallic slime.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.500
The color is really

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900
not sticking to my gloves
as bad as I thought it was,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.700
so I'm gonna do something
that's probably not smart.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.200
They have to know.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.380
[Music]

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.800
That's not nearly as bad as I
was already expecting.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.500
Yes.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.800
It's getting some ink on me,
but it's not like a full coat.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.300
It's just barely there.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.400
Oh wait, there's our blue.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.420
See that?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.100
When it gets thin
and transparent...

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.100
Wow, it's almost like we have
little galaxies forming in it.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.700
It's honestly what
it looks like.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.940
That is so cool.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.719
All right, you guys win.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.080
This is awesome.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.000
I want to see it outside.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.700
Let's see if we can get
it in the sunlight.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.640
It's honestly metalic ooze now.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.780
It looks so coppery red.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.720
[Music]

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.760
See how the color moves,
like there's blue up here.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.480
[Music]

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.000
Well, a couple of you
said you wanted to see

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.460
if it could be frozen.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.700
[Music]

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.800
Let's see if we find that again.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.440
[Music]

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.000
I don't think the snow
is going to do much to it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.764
But again, I'm very surprised,

00:04:18.764 --> 00:04:20.500
the color is just
not coming off.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.400
Not even sticking
to it a little bit.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.800
Snow staying very white
no matter where it goes.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.000
So I got more ink on my hands

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.300
because I was trying
to mix it with my fingers,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.800
instead of just
letting it solidify.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120
But it's holding together.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.900
Alright, so I'm back inside,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.880
and we've actually
made a second batch

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:42.000
of ink slime for a little bit
of a different contrast.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.194
This one, we've used
a lot more pigment.

00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:44.900
So this one,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.200
you can actually see
right off the bat.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.140
There are these copper swirls
in my first batch.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.500
Now on my second batch,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100
I use probably
double the amount of ink,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.900
and it is just
an inky black in comparison.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.400
It's also interesting to note

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.600
that this one is also
a lot more malleable.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.000
My first one,
very very firm, wants to rip.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.300
I think I pulled it
out of the borax solution

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.400
a little too quick.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.750
But this one is much goopier,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.320
and I've noticed
there is a difference

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.569
when hold them up
into the light.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.600
You get a lot more copper coming
through on this one,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.100
but our second batch...

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.500
Now the first colors
to come through this one,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.600
blue and almost a deep green.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.700
All of these are just starting
to look like nebulas to me.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.659
This is awesome.

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.300
Now, obviously, my hands
are stained to death

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.714
because I've mixed
two batches now of this stuff,

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:29.575
but I want to see

00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:31.400
if it actually
will stay in paper now

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.560
that it's fully mixed.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.363
So our first batch,
which is what more brittle.

00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:36.700
Just leave that there.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.900
The second batch.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, if I just rub
these along the paper.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200
Well...

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.740
It's brittle, but it's
just dusting away.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.700
There's really not
any staining happening.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.000
This more oozy second batch.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.220
That's about the same,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.005
but the color itself
isn't actually really

00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:58.300
sticking to the paper.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.874
The ink is well
and truly in the slime.

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:03.253
This is in fact
ink pigmented slime,

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:06.553
and I cannot get over
these little galaxies in here.

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:07.200
All right.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.500
Well, we've made two different
types of slime with our pen ink,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.234
but this comment suggest
that we also make ink oobleck.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.068
Let's try it.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.800
All right, for the oobleck,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.649
as much fun as it would be to
just simply dump the cornstarch

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:21.000
in the rest of our pen ink,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600
I don't want to
destroy it all yet.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.500
So I'm going to put
some in with water,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.144
and then try and mix
in the cornstarch,

00:06:26.144 --> 00:06:27.400
and see what that looks like.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.400
Right away, it
disperses so much faster

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.500
than it did in just
the glue and water.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:51.860
[Music]

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.840
The coloring just reminds me
a lot of the blue glaucus.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.100
It's this little tiny sea slug,
but that coloring is identical.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.840
Just mix it straight
into the water.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.500
Oh, well, immediately,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.465
it's almost dried
on the surface.

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:06.000
It cracked right through.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.900
That's weird.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.400
It actually doesn't really
want to mix in with the water.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.387
All right, we're going
to try this a different way.

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:13.700
We're going to pour
the water out,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.645
and I'm going to add cornstarch
just to the ink itself,

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:17.900
and add water as we go.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.260
Because that's not going
to mix like this.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.520
Ink with just the tiniest bit
of water still in the bowl,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.512
which is really cool
because as I stir it,

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:28.000
you can watch the blue
just sort of seep out.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.880
Now, my concern with this is
that cornstarch is very opaque,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.100
and I am not sure

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.200
what that's going to do
to our coloring here.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.100
Because right now,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.745
you can see it's mixing
into the water,

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:43.300
but it's really not wanting
to have anything to do with ink,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.400
which is actually making
for a pretty cool result.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.900
All right.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.600
Let's add a touch more water,
see if it'll actually mix now

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.920
that cornstarch is involved.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:03.560
[Music]

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.660
Got the gloves back on
so let's try this out.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.580
[Music]

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.900
It feels exactly
like regular oobleck.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.960
The difference is this
will never come off.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:32.100
[Music]

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.760
Side-by-side comparison.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.700
This popsicle stick
only has ink,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.420
and this one has oobleck.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.093
If you look
at the difference here,

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:41.710
I mean the differences
in viscosity is apparent,

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.671
but color-wise,

00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:45.300
they're even closer
than the ink slime is.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.600
Let's take a look at that.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.300
Now, the ink slime you can see

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.629
that the pigment
is actually still separated.

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:53.450
You've got touches of blue
in our darker pigmentation,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.590
and the copper is really showing
through in our first batch.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.500
Then our oobleck
and our straight pen ink.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.200
Much closer.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.200
I don't think there's
any saving this Oobleck.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.600
Now, I didn't want
to make too much

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.700
because I didn't want
to use all of the pen ink.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.227
See how it just reacts
just sit in for a second.

00:09:09.227 --> 00:09:12.400
Normal Oobleck will just pool
and almost form like a liquid.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.800
So, let's see if it does that.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.111
Well, what we may have done
is just dried out the ink,

00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:18.700
which actually makes sense.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.767
Sometimes, if you're
using an ink pen,

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.500
you can actually dust the paper

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.600
when you're done
to try and dry it faster.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.500
I'm almost wondering

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.500
if that's what we've done here
with the cornstarch.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.200
It's absorbed so much
of the liquid in the pen ink

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.180
that it's almost lost
its fluid nature.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.352
It's still there,

00:09:34.352 --> 00:09:37.904
but it's definitely not as
a liquid as regular Oobleck

00:09:37.904 --> 00:09:41.120
anymore, even as liquid as it
was 10 minutes ago.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.900
But it's sure making
some cool patterns.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.100
The messiest way to paint.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.800
Well guys, can you
make ink slime?

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.685
Yes, you can.

00:09:50.685 --> 00:09:52.344
Can you make ink Oobleck?

00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:54.400
Yes, you can, and it's awesome.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.340
We still have a little bit
of pen ink left.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.500
So if there's anything else
that you want to see us do with that,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.620
let us know
in the comments below.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.500
Guys, that was awesome.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.900
Thank you for your suggestions.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.838
But you know we've always
got more for you to see.
