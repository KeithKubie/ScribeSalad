00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.750
This week while everyone was looking at Pluto
pics, an asteroid flew by the Earth worth

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.200
5.4 TRILLION DOLLARS.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.150
WHY AREN'T WE UP THERE?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:18.820
Think 
of the DOLLARS?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.029
Asteroids fly by the Earth all the time, and
even though the 5.4 trillion dollar 2011 UW158

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.779
seems like a missed opportunity, back in 2013,
asteroid 2012 DA14 flew by, and it was worth

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.080
some 20 trillion!

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.160
In case you're curious -- and you're a DNews
watcher so I know you are -- some asteroids

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.100
are simply worth a LOT of money.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.070
And it's just floating out there, ready for
the taking.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.660
Asteroids range in sizes, compositions, and
shapes.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.510
Some are bundles or rubble, held together
by their own gravity, others are solid, pock-marked

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.950
survivors from the early solar system.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.910
Looking at UW158 they found a fast-spinning
asteroid, meaning it wasn't a collection of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.350
rubble (because it wouldn't sustain such a
spin) and looked sort of like the inside of

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.350
a walnut.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.570
But after looking at the spin, astronomers
wanted to know what the old gal was made of…

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.250
which kind of is an imprecise science -- or
at least a fun debate.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.930
Once asteroids are located, scientists use
ground-based infrared telescopes and spectrometers

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.580
to see which minerals exist in the structure…
different minerals absorb light at different

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.000
wavelengths -- once they bounce the light
off the asteroid, they compare it to charts

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.340
we have from Earth.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.800
They can even bounce radar off the asteroids
and determine composition by what is reflected

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
back.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.000
It's never made of just one thing, it's moving,
so there's usually a scientific debate as

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.600
to the different minerals present in pretty
much ANY ASTEROID.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.710
Once the composition is (more or less) determined
asteroids are assigned a spectral classification,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.640
SEPARATE from their letter names -- for example
S-Type means they're found in the inner area

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.850
of the asteroid belt, closer to Mars and are
mainly stony, C-Type means they're in the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.340
outer main belt and are more carbonaceous
(80 percent of asteroids are C-type), but

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.150
A,B,C,D,E,F,G,M,P,Q,R,S,T and V gets confusing!

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.550
Of course, all this can be checked by sending
a spacecraft to rendezvous with these minor

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.950
planets - like NASA did with the NEAR spacecraft
in 2001, but that's SO expensive it's been

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.140
tough to justify…

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.840
Pointing these tools at UW158 tells us it
might have a core of platinum, maybe as much

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.330
as 90 million tons of it -- thus the high
price tag.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.330
But getting there, mining it, and bringing
it back is ALSO expensive.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.450
UW158 was added to NASA's Near-Earth Object
Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.150
or NASA's NEO NHATS.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.680
These are asteroids we recognize might be
candidates for future manned asteroid missions.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.230
Billionaires with space on the brain like
Google's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, as well

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.630
as Virgin's Richard Branson all want to mine
these things!

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.990
The problem is sending the materials to mine
an asteroid into high Earth orbit costs about

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.910
10 million dollars per ton… and the tech
is relatively untested.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.989
I say relatively, because last week Planetary
Resources' Arkyd 3 Reflight spacecraft was

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.709
launched from the International Space Station.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.530
The A3R is the first proof-of-concept test
vehicle for landing and extracting resources

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.670
from an asteroid.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.930
We're on our way chaps.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.740
When the A6 goes up later this year, it will
have tools to spot water, and infrared to

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.569
seek minerals on asteroids -- which you know
all about now.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.430
These are the first steps into the space economy.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.870
What do you think about asteroid mining?

00:03:28.870 --> 00:04:12.779
Should we keep our greedy fingers on the ground,
or get up there before someone else does?
