00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.620
The Black Clown is a poem by

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.580
Langston Hughes that we have adapted for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.040
the stage with the purpose of further

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.240
explicating and amplifying his intent for

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.520
humanity to be claimed

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.040
Performing this piece and being allowed to present it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.600
with such an incredible family of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040
collaborators is being empowered to make

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.180
a statement that I feel is most

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
important and crucial if not critical in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.580
our world today

00:00:44.200 --> 00:01:05.380

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.290
I really hope that audiences take away

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.540
from this piece the importance of

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.620
engaging with individuals in the context

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.420
of their entire history. I think one of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.280
the only ways that we can move towards a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.260
better society is that they have an

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.420
understanding of where people come from

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:50.940
