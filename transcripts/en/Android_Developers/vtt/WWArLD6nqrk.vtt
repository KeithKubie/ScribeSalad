OMAR SIDDIQUI: What I love
about gaming, at least

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.870
the kinds of games
we make, they're

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.490
really interactive storytelling.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.610
My name is Omar Siddiqui.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm the CEO and
co-founder of Kiwi.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.720
Our titles are immersive,
character-oriented.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.530
Over the course of
the last two years,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.310
we've had five that have
been in the top 25 grossing.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.240
The kinds of games
we make require

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.070
a few things to be successful.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.810
One, they need to be able to
be distributed really broadly.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.690
Two, they need
the ability for us

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.480
to really have analytics
infrastructure.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.396
And third, they really
need robust [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:39.840
transactions and that whole
monetization infrastructure.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.214
SHVETANK JAIN:
Two years ago when

00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:44.000
I was going around and saying
we're starting a new gaming

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.730
company and we're going to be
focused on making games only

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.920
for Android, I think everyone
looked at me and was like, why?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.569
And two years later,
everyone looks at me

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.360
and says that was a
very smart thing to do.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360
JOHN HSU: What's interesting
about the ecosystem

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.437
as Android becomes
so prevalent is

00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:00.770
that it's becoming more and
more of a social experience.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.000
You play games, you talk
to your friends about them,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.459
you always have them on you.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.970
And with the
platform itself, you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.550
can actually integrate
and interface

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.050
with people, check leaderboards
to see how your friends are

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.258
doing, and making it a
comparative social experience.

00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:18.740
OMAR SIDDIQUI: Every
six months, the revenue

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.850
we've been generating
has been doubling.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.737
It's great to be a part of
that type of growth as well.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.820
SHVETANK JAIN: Some of the
key features of Android

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.320
that has really
helped us are being

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.620
able to push out APKs
and content immediately

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.350
to our users and doing partial
deployment to a segment

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.450
of users and test it
out, and then roll it out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.540
to the remaining ones.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.210
And also, the
international penetration

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.270
has been really helpful to
be able to reach a larger

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.960
audience.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.510
JOHN HSU: When we design
games, we don't just

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.782
focus on necessarily creating
an immersive experience.

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:52.240
We recognize that
players are going

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.100
to be playing these games on
the train, in boring meetings,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.760
wherever.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.394
And we want to design
experience that's

00:01:58.394 --> 00:02:00.310
specifically relevant
for how they're actually

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.430
interacting with it.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.960
OMAR SIDDIQUI: At
this point we've

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.209
had games that have been on
Google Play for almost two

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.410
years now, and they still
have a large community

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.410
of players who play
every single day.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.390
And that's our challenge,
is to keep it fresh

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.535
and to keep it interesting.
