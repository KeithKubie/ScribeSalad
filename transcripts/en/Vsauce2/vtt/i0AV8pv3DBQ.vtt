00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.489
Vsauce!

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:02.489
Kevin here.

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.290
Throughout history, some have given their
lives to advance scientific research.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.059
Because of their efforts, we can fly, stave
off death, carry fire in our pocket and play

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.269
golf on the moon.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.310
In the decade before the Wright Brothers first
flew at Kitty Hawk, Otto Lilienthal made over

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.449
2,000 flights in gliders he designed.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.369
In 1894, Otto built a 45 foot (13.7 meters)
artificial hill that allowed him to test his

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.790
gliders in any direction so he always had
suitable wind conditions.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.340
On Otto’s final flight, the top wing of
his newest prototype broke off and he fell

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.900
55 feet (17 meters), suffering fatal injuries.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.660
Before he passed away his last words were
“Sacrifices must be made.”

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.090
Lilienthal is considered the inventor of piloting
and was a direct influence on the Wright Brothers.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.690
The aviation industry now supports over 58
million jobs, roughly the entire population

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.840
of Italy, and transports 3 billion passengers
each year - almost twice the world population

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.369
at the time Otto made his sacrifice.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.299
Russia's Alexander Bogdanov wrote a science
fiction novel about a perfect world on Mars

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.869
in which technology has solved all of life’s
problems and blood transfusions between the

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.039
young and old extend lifespans.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.119
His fiction morphed into scientific research
when he founded the Institute for Haemotology

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.600
and Blood Transfusions in 1926.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.530
Building on centuries of slowly-advancing
research, he began experimenting with blood

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.939
transfusions on his friends and on himself.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.490
He believed blood transfusions would make
him immortal and claimed they improved his

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.610
eyesight and cured his baldness.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.509
Unfortunately, his 12th transfusion was with
a student infected with malaria and tuberculosis,

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.299
and Bogdanov died.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.280
Today 108 million units of blood are collected
globally each year to save lives during surgeries

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.000
and after trauma.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.530
4.5 million people in the U.S. alone would
die annually without life-saving blood.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.620
Baldness, however, rages on.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.390
In the early 1770s Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered
a gas he called "fire-air" - the element we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.530
know as Oxygen.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.800
Prior to his discovery, people believed in
the Phlogiston theory, which stated that something

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.740
called phlogiston, a fire-like element, was
responsible for combustion.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.860
Part of Scheele’s study of compounds and
elements involved tasting them, including

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.900
ones we later discovered are toxic like lead,
arsenic, hydrofluoric acid and mercury, leading

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.930
to his death by poisoning at the age of 43.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.210
Scheele didn't just identify the source of
combustion; he also developed a way to mass-produce

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.740
phosphorus, leading to the production of matches,
and he described the reduction of silver salts

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.010
to metallic silver via sunlight, which is
the basis of photography - which led to film

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.590
- which led to video - which led to YouTube
- which led to Vsauce.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.730
Thanks, Carl.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.720
In the 1960's the space race brought us technologies
ranging from artificial limbs and firefighting

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.370
equipment to solar panels and memory foam
-- and also a crater on the far side of the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.470
moon named Wan Hoo.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.730
Chinese legends claim Wan Hu was the world’s
first astronaut, who in the 16th century attached

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.600
two kites and 47 gun-powered rockets to a
chair.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.040
After a big explosion, Wan and the chair were
never seen again.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.090
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.330
Didn't work.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.690
It didn't work!

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.920
You guys!

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.280
It didn't work!

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.400
Wait!

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.519
No!
