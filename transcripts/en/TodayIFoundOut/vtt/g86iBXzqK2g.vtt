00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.580
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out Youtube channel.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.970
In the video today, we’re looking at why
the way most people draw hearts looks nothing

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.870
like a real heart.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.059
The heart symbol is one of the single most
enduring and widely recognised symbols in

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.429
modern culture.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.150
But where did it come from?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.970
Something like the familiar heart symbol goes
back many thousands of years.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.189
Specifically, several pieces of pottery going
back as far as 3000BC clearly show the unmistakable

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.189
symbol.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.440
However, in these instances, the symbol is
noted to be a simplification of either a fig

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.149
or ivy leaf, not a crude representation of
the human heart, and seemingly, at least initially,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.190
not having anything to do with love.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.330
Fast-forwarding through history and we find
many cultures using a similar symbol, such

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.430
as depicted in Grecian, Cretian, Minoan, Mycean,
Roman and Corinthian pottery, along with many

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.430
others.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.111
In these instances, again, the symbol doesn't
appear to be representative of a heart, but

00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:57.429
of various leaves.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.790
For example, the early vine leaf imagery in
Greek culture was mostly used to represent

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.660
Dionysus, the god of wine, fertility, and
ecstasy, among other things.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.020
For a more straightforward example of the
ivy leaf imagery having a double, suggestive

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.260
meaning, in the city of Ephesus around fourth
century A.D, the symbol was used to represent

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.260
a brothel.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.640
As ivy is quite long-lived and hardy, it was
also prominently seen on early Greek and Roman

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640
graves.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.920
Interestingly, entirely independent of the
Greeks and Romans, Buddhists also came to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.500
use a symbol similar to that of the drawn
heart.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.280
However, in their culture, it was representative
of a fig leaf, which came to symbolise enlightenment.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.570
However, just because these very similar early
symbols strongly resemble the modern symbol

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.820
for the heart, doesn't necessarily mean this
is where the modern symbol came from and we,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.500
unfortunately, lack much in the way of direct
evidence to trace its early lineage.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.430
As such, it has also been proposed that it
derived from a different, now extinct, plant

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.340
known as, "silphium", which was used in ancient
times as a very effective form of birth control,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.590
among many other uses.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.140
The trade of silphium was so lucrative that
Cyrene, the town it was grown in, actually

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780
put it on their money.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.200
Along with its obvious links with a form of
love, the plant's seed pod was stylised in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.310
ancient times as what we can now recognise
as akin to the heart symbol.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.640
Whether these various leaves or seed pod had
anything to do with the subsequent symbol

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.030
directly, it is generally thought describing
the human heart as looking like certain leaves

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.710
may have had something to do with it.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.750
You see, though Arabic and other doctors of
earlier periods had made leaps and bounds

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.440
in anatomical study, during the middle ages,
much of this was lost or suppressed by the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Church.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.130
And with autopsies being outlawed, many were
forced to rely on the early descriptions of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.810
these doctors and nothing else.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.470
These descriptions tended to describe the
heart in one of two ways, looking something

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.370
like a conifer cone in overall shape or looking
something like an inverted leaf, with the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.450
stem as the arterial branching.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.500
As for direct evidence, appearing in a 13th
century French manuscript and written by an

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.490
unknown author, a simple romance tale called
"Roman de la poire" (Romance of the pear)

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.209
is now famous for featuring one of the the
earliest known images of the heart in a metaphorical

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.960
sense, where a man hands his heart to his
lover.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.190
Its shape is likened to that of a conifer
cone, in keeping with the known medical literature

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.190
of the time.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.280
Around this same time in the 13th century,
the royal banner of the kings of Denmark prominently

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.760
depicted the heart symbol.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.100
In the early 14th century, we also see yet
another conifer-cone shaped heart where Giotto

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.360
de Bondone depicts a heart being giving to
Christ in a painting at the Scrovegni Chapel.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.740
From here, numerous others began using this
same basic symbol, at first with the point

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.810
commonly on top, and then switched to pointing
down like today around the 15th century.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.220
During this same period, the indentation in
the fat side of the heart symbol started to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.090
appear more and more frequently, perhaps mimicking
the look of certain types of leaves as mentioned

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.690
and as many have theorised, or perhaps not.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.230
Whatever the case, during the next few hundred
years, several things happened that saw the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.240
heart symbol's popularity explode.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.832
Ironically, though the Church had played a
large role in people being unaware of what

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:55.960
an actual human heart looked like, it also
was integral in the spreading of the heart

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960
symbol.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.540
Specifically, the so called "Sacred Heart
of Jesus" was supposedly seen in a vision

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.870
by one, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in 1673.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.700
Physically, this Sacred Heart is remarkably
similar to the modern heart symbol, though

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.239
generally depicted surrounded by thorns and
sometimes depicted on fire.

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.949
The Catholic Church used this symbol extensively
in the subsequent centuries.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.150
However, as previously noted, by that point
the symbol and its use to depict a human heart

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.860
had already been well known and commonly used
by artists and others for a few centuries.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.150
It was even used by Protestant Reformation
leader Martin Luther when he oversaw the development

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.889
of his coat of arms, "Luther Rose", in 1519,
over a century and a half before Saint Margaret's

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:36.889
vision.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.860
Luther had this to say about the design of
his coat of arms in a letter written in 1530:

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.630
“...I shall answer most amiably and tell
you my original thoughts and reason about

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.180
why my seal is a symbol of my theology.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930
The first should be a black cross in a heart,
which retains its natural color, so that I

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.590
myself would be reminded that faith in the
Crucified saves us.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.379
'For one who believes from the heart will
be justified' (Romans 10:10).

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.469
Although it is indeed a black cross, which
mortifies and which should also cause pain,

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.430
it leaves the heart in its natural color.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.099
It does not corrupt nature, that is, it does
not kill but keeps alive.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.120
'The just shall live by faith' (Romans 1:17)
but by faith in the Crucified.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.189
Such a heart should stand in the middle of
a white rose, to show that faith gives joy,

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.219
comfort, and peace...”

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.659
So contrary to what is often said, Saint Margaret
Mary Alacoque's vision was not the origin

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.939
of the symbol as representing a heart, but
certainly helped popularise it with its widespread

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.990
use by the Catholic Church after this.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.400
The other important thing that happened to
help popularise the symbol, and that also

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.620
predated the Sacred Heart vision, is the late
15th century introduction, and later spreading,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.710
of the French card suits, Cœurs (Hearts),
Carreaux (Diamonds), Trefles (Clubs) and Piques

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.710
(Spades).

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.440
In the end, though religious pressure on the
medical world waned in later centuries and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.110
anatomical knowledge was eventually spread
far and wide, the sheer amount of artistic,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.990
poetic and commercial attention given to the
iconic heart symbol not only saw it survive,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.050
but thrive as symbol for both the human heart
and love.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.930
Despite that love doesn't originate in, nor
does the symbol look much like, the human

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.449
heart, from the looks of things, the drawn
heart representing these things is not about

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.979
to change anytime soon.
