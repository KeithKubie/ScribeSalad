00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.482
So, let's recap. Remember originally, the tone is a neutral stimulus. It does

00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:11.320
not elicit any response except perhaps the dog orienting, meaning it heard it.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.274
Then, we pair our tone with the unconditioned stimulus. Recall that a

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:23.567
unconditioned stimulus automatically causes a reflexive response. In this case,

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:29.350
the meat powder automatically causes the dog to salivate. Next, after these

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.716
repeated pairings, tone, food, tone, food, we test to see if classical

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:40.502
conditioning has occurred. To do this we present the conditioned stimulus alone

00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:46.629
and we see does the animal respond. In this case, the animal did salivate so

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.301
now we can call the tone a conditioned stimulus and the salivation to the tone

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.719
a conditioned response.
