on the spectrum between where you have

on the spectrum between where you have
relatively little data to where you have

relatively little data to where you have
 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.930
relatively little data to where you have
lots of data so for example I think that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
lots of data so for example I think that
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.130
lots of data so for example I think that
today we have a decent amount of data

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140
today we have a decent amount of data
 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.900
today we have a decent amount of data
for speech recognition and these

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.270

is just a complicated problem to look at

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
is just a complicated problem to look at
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.700
is just a complicated problem to look at
all those pixels and figure out what it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
all those pixels and figure out what it
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.219
all those pixels and figure out what it
is it feels like even though the online

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
is it feels like even though the online
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200

data sets are quite big you know over a

million images feels like we still wish
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.380
million images feels like we still wish
we had more data and there are some

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
we had more data and there are some
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.460
we had more data and there are some
problems like object detection where we

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
problems like object detection where we
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.760
problems like object detection where we
have even less data so just as a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
have even less data so just as a
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710
have even less data so just as a
reminder image recognition was the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
reminder image recognition was the
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390
reminder image recognition was the
problem of looking at a picture and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
problem of looking at a picture and
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450
problem of looking at a picture and
telling you is this a cat or not whereas

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
telling you is this a cat or not whereas
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460
telling you is this a cat or not whereas
object detection is looking a picture

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
object detection is looking a picture
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.280
object detection is looking a picture
and actually you're putting the bounding

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
and actually you're putting the bounding
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960
and actually you're putting the bounding
boxes so telling you where in the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
boxes so telling you where in the
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.760
boxes so telling you where in the
picture of the objects such as the calls

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
picture of the objects such as the calls
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160
picture of the objects such as the calls
are as well and so because of the cost

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
are as well and so because of the cost
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.100
are as well and so because of the cost
of getting the bounding boxes is just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
of getting the bounding boxes is just
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.050
of getting the bounding boxes is just
more expensive to label the objects and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
more expensive to label the objects and
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060
more expensive to label the objects and
hand the bounding boxes so we tend to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
hand the bounding boxes so we tend to
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.480
hand the bounding boxes so we tend to
have less data for object detection then

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
have less data for object detection then
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880
have less data for object detection then
for image recognition and object

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
for image recognition and object
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170
for image recognition and object
detection is something we'll discuss

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
detection is something we'll discuss
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.980
detection is something we'll discuss
next week so if you look across a broad

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
next week so if you look across a broad
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.319
next week so if you look across a broad
spectrum of machine learning problems

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
spectrum of machine learning problems
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.020
spectrum of machine learning problems
you see on average that when you have a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
you see on average that when you have a
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.559
you see on average that when you have a
lot of data you tend to find people get

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569
lot of data you tend to find people get
 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.289
lot of data you tend to find people get
in a way we're using simpler algorithms

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
in a way we're using simpler algorithms
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.379
in a way we're using simpler algorithms
as well as less hand engineering so

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:18.389
as well as less hand engineering so
 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.679
as well as less hand engineering so
there's just less needing to carefully

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689
there's just less needing to carefully
 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.599
there's just less needing to carefully
design features for the problem but

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609
design features for the problem but
 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.160
design features for the problem but
instead you can even join your network

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
instead you can even join your network
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.739
instead you can even join your network
even a simpler architecture and have a

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749
even a simpler architecture and have a
 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.720
even a simpler architecture and have a
new network just learn whether he wants

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
new network just learn whether he wants
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.690
new network just learn whether he wants
to learn when you have a lot of data

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700
to learn when you have a lot of data
 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.309
to learn when you have a lot of data
whereas in contrast when you don't have

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319
whereas in contrast when you don't have
 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.580
whereas in contrast when you don't have
that much data then on average you see

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
that much data then on average you see
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.459
that much data then on average you see
people engaging in more hand engineering

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469
people engaging in more hand engineering
 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:44.030
people engaging in more hand engineering
and if you want to be ungenerous you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
and if you want to be ungenerous you
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.330
and if you want to be ungenerous you
know you can say they're more hex but I

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
know you can say they're more hex but I
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.550
know you can say they're more hex but I
think when you don't have much data then

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
think when you don't have much data then
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.209
think when you don't have much data then
hand engineering is that he the best way

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:53.219
hand engineering is that he the best way
 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.559
hand engineering is that he the best way
to get good performance so when I look

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569
to get good performance so when I look
 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.899
to get good performance so when I look
at machine learning applications I think

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
at machine learning applications I think
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.720
at machine learning applications I think
usually we have the learning algorithm

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
usually we have the learning algorithm
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.360
usually we have the learning algorithm
as two sources of knowledge one source

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
as two sources of knowledge one source
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.909
as two sources of knowledge one source
of knowledge is the label data really

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919
of knowledge is the label data really
 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.909
of knowledge is the label data really
the x-y parents you use for supervised

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919
the x-y parents you use for supervised
 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.619
the x-y parents you use for supervised
learning and the second source of

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629
learning and the second source of
 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.599
learning and the second source of
knowledge is the hand engineering and

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609
knowledge is the hand engineering and
 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.550
knowledge is the hand engineering and
then lots of ways to hand engineer a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
then lots of ways to hand engineer a
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.219
then lots of ways to hand engineer a
system it can be from carefully hand

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229
system it can be from carefully hand
 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.409
system it can be from carefully hand
designing the features to carefully hand

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419
designing the features to carefully hand
 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.960
designing the features to carefully hand
designing the network architectures to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
designing the network architectures to
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.819
designing the network architectures to
maybe other components of your system

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829
maybe other components of your system
 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.249
maybe other components of your system
and so when you don't have much label

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:28.259
and so when you don't have much label
 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.890
and so when you don't have much label
data you just have to call more on hand

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
data you just have to call more on hand
 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.879
data you just have to call more on hand
engineering and so I think computer

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889
engineering and so I think computer
 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.619
engineering and so I think computer
vision is trying to learn a really

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629
vision is trying to learn a really
 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.649
vision is trying to learn a really
complex function and it often feels like

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659
complex function and it often feels like
 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.319
complex function and it often feels like
we don't have enough data for computer

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329
we don't have enough data for computer
 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.300
we don't have enough data for computer
vision even though data says it getting

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310
vision even though data says it getting
 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.249
vision even though data says it getting
bigger and bigger often we just don't

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:46.259
bigger and bigger often we just don't
 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.280
bigger and bigger often we just don't
have as much data as we need and this is

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
have as much data as we need and this is
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.890
have as much data as we need and this is
why the state of computer vision

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900
why the state of computer vision
 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.569
why the state of computer vision
historically and even today has relied

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579
historically and even today has relied
 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.589
historically and even today has relied
more on hand engineering and I think

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599
more on hand engineering and I think
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.659
more on hand engineering and I think
this is also why the field of computer

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669
this is also why the field of computer
 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.379

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:57.910
percent better or two percent better or
 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.360
percent better or two percent better or
so it's a little bit better on some

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.370
so it's a little bit better on some
 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.390
so it's a little bit better on some
benchmark and this will cause you to do

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
benchmark and this will cause you to do
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.950
benchmark and this will cause you to do
a little bit better you know maybe

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960
a little bit better you know maybe
 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.930
a little bit better you know maybe
sometimes as much as one or two percent

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:06.940
sometimes as much as one or two percent
 

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.030

this central region that drop and run it
 

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.560
this central region that drop and run it
through your crossfire and then take

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.570
through your crossfire and then take
 

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.720
through your crossfire and then take
that and prop up a left-hand corner run

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:24.730
that and prop up a left-hand corner run
 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.520

crop then take the four corners crops so

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920
crop then take the four corners crops so
 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.890
crop then take the four corners crops so
that's one central crop here and here

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:43.900
that's one central crop here and here
 

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.990
that's one central crop here and here
there's four corners crop here and here

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000
there's four corners crop here and here
 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.150
there's four corners crop here and here
and if you add these up that's ten

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160
and if you add these up that's ten
 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.920
and if you add these up that's ten
different crops of the invention so has

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:49.930
different crops of the invention so has
 

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.830
different crops of the invention so has
the name ten crop and so what you do is

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:52.840
the name ten crop and so what you do is
 

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.170
the name ten crop and so what you do is
you run these ten images through your

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.180
you run these ten images through your
 

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.880
you run these ten images through your
crossfire and then average the results

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:58.890
crossfire and then average the results
 

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.590
crossfire and then average the results
so if you have the computational budget

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600
so if you have the computational budget
 

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.540
so if you have the computational budget
you could do this maybe don't need as

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.550
you could do this maybe don't need as
 

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.220
you could do this maybe don't need as
many as ten crops you can use a few

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.230
many as ten crops you can use a few
 

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.770
many as ten crops you can use a few
crops and this might get you a little

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:07.780
crops and this might get you a little
 

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.200
crops and this might get you a little
bit better performance in a production

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.210
bit better performance in a production
 

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.720

you're deploying for actual users but
this is another technique that is used

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:18.670
this is another technique that is used
 

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.820
this is another technique that is used
much more for doing well on benchmarks

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:20.830
much more for doing well on benchmarks
 

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.470
much more for doing well on benchmarks
then in actual production systems and

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480
then in actual production systems and
 

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.330
then in actual production systems and
one of the big problems upon something

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:27.340
one of the big problems upon something
 

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.310
one of the big problems upon something
is that you need to keep all these

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320
is that you need to keep all these
 

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.080
is that you need to keep all these
different networks around and so that

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.090
different networks around and so that
 

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.410
different networks around and so that
just takes up a lot more computer memory

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420
just takes up a lot more computer memory
 

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.180
just takes up a lot more computer memory
for multi crop I guess at least you keep

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.190
for multi crop I guess at least you keep
 

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.510
for multi crop I guess at least you keep
just one network around so it doesn't

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:38.520
just one network around so it doesn't
 

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.970
just one network around so it doesn't
suck up as much memory but it still

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:41.980
suck up as much memory but it still
 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.190
suck up as much memory but it still
slows down your runtime quite a bit so

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200
slows down your runtime quite a bit so
 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.710
slows down your runtime quite a bit so

on your data set you can often get going

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:57.730
on your data set you can often get going
 

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.960
on your data set you can often get going
much faster on an application but of

stop you from training your own networks

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:07.690
stop you from training your own networks
 

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.580
stop you from training your own networks
from scratch and in fact if you want to

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:11.590
from scratch and in fact if you want to
 

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.590

algorithm that's not that's what you

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:15.610
algorithm that's not that's what you
 

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.480
algorithm that's not that's what you
might have to do so that's it for this

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.490
might have to do so that's it for this
 

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.850
might have to do so that's it for this
week I hope that seeing a number of

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:20.860
week I hope that seeing a number of
 

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.830
week I hope that seeing a number of
computer vision architectures helps you

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:22.840
computer vision architectures helps you
 

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.590
computer vision architectures helps you
get a sense of what works in this week's

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600
get a sense of what works in this week's
 

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.780

another programming framework and use

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:30.670
another programming framework and use
 

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.210
another programming framework and use
that to implement resonance so I hope

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:33.220
that to implement resonance so I hope
 

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.700
that to implement resonance so I hope
you enjoyed that program exercise and I

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:35.710
you enjoyed that program exercise and I
 

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.720
you enjoyed that program exercise and I
look forward to seeing you next week
