00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Voiceover] All right, we
have a wordy question here.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.483
The global temperature anomaly
indicates how much warmer

00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:07.840
or colder the average
global temperature is

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.883
than normal during a particular time.

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.680
A researcher conducting
an observational study

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.407
charted and analyzed
atmospheric carbon dioxide,

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:19.704
CO2 levels and the global
temperature anomaly

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:23.407
in degrees celsius since the year 1960.

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:26.484
The researcher observed
that the rate of ...

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.480
okay this is the part that
seems to get interesting.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.708
The researcher observed
that the rate of increase

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:35.063
of atmospheric CO2, carbon dioxide,

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:40.063
since 1960, approximately
four percent per decade,

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:44.166
is comparable to the rate of increase

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.744
in the global temperature anomaly

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:49.316
during the same time period.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:52.827
Approximately 3.9 percent per decade.

00:00:52.827 --> 00:00:57.047
Based on this data, which
conclusion is valid?

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:58.870
All right, let's see.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.196
There is a correlation
between the increase

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.516
in atmospheric CO2 levels since 1960

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:09.046
and the increase in the
global temperature anomaly

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:12.572
during the same time period.

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:15.021
That one seems pretty valid.

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.260
These are both moving in
the same direction together.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.806
That's what correlation tells us.

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.484
It doesn't mean that
necessary the CO2 levels

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.063
are causing the temperature to increase,

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:26.591
or that the temperature
increase is causing the

00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:28.216
CO2 levels to increase.

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:30.132
It's just saying that look over this time

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.069
we're seeing that these two
things are moving together,

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.495
which is what correlation is taking about.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.467
How much do these data
points move together?

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:41.783
I'm liking this one.

00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:43.269
I'm liking this one, so I'll ...

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.117
actually, let me read all of
them before I pick that choice.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.773
The increase in the
global temperature anomaly

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:52.869
since 1960 caused the
increase in atmospheric

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.121
CO2 levels during the same time period.

00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:56.329
Well, we don't know that.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.860
We don't know whether
there is causality here.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.800
Just by looking at that data,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.344
these two things moving together,

00:02:03.344 --> 00:02:05.245
you can't say that the temperature caused

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:06.685
the CO2 to move up.

00:02:06.685 --> 00:02:08.903
This is one of the classic things

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:10.497
that a lot of times when
two things correlate

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.411
people want to show that
there's some causality.

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.409
It's much harder to show causality

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.528
than it is to show correlation.

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:19.182
I definitely don't like that.

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.071
The increase in atmospheric CO2 levels

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.073
since 1960 caused the increase in

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:27.312
global temperature anomaly
during the same time period.

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:30.110
Well, that might be a
reasonable hypothesis,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.935
but that data doesn't tell us that.

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:33.060
It doesn't tell us.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.730
There might have been some other cause

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.470
that caused both of those
two things to go up,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.433
or this might have just
been two things that

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:40.733
happened to move together,

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.274
but is wasn't because of any

00:02:43.274 --> 00:02:45.887
kind of causation one way or another.

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:48.052
You can't say that.

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:49.933
Just based on the data we have,

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:53.473
the fact that they both
increased at roughly four percent

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.749
per decade since 1960.

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.688
You can't say that one caused the other.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:00.206
There is no correlation
between the increase

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.830
in atmospheric CO2 levels since 1960

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.374
and the increase in the global temperature

00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:06.163
anomaly during the same time period.

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:08.635
No, they're for sure is a correlation.

00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:10.641
You would say there's no correlation if in

00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:14.295
some decades CO2 went up,

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:19.161
and the temperature went down,

00:03:19.161 --> 00:03:21.612
while in other decades they both went up,

00:03:21.612 --> 00:03:23.411
and other decades they both went down,

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.501
that would be no correlation.

00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:27.846
If actually every time one of them went up

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:28.810
the other one went down,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.342
that would be a negative correlation.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:32.050
If they move together,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.916
that is just a very strong
positive correlation.

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:36.960
No correlation would be
if you could, you know,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.550
sometimes when one moves up,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.769
the other one moves up or down,

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.011
when the other one moves up or down,

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.370
the other one moves up or down.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.580
I don't know if that last
thing I said just made sense.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.543
There was definitely a correlation.

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:47.808
They were moving together.

00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:49.978
They're both increasing and
roughly at the same rate

00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:53.101
over per decade since 1960.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:54.504
I would rule that one out.

00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:57.575
So yep, I feel good about
with our first choice.
