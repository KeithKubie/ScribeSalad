00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.330
Although mutations that can cause color blindness have

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.190
been found in over 56 genes on 19 different

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.590
chromosomes. The most commonly inherited form of the disorder

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.200
comes from mutations on the X chromosome. So here's

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.040
the zoomed in pair of the sex chromosomes where

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.660
the X chromosome is a part, in an individual

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.930
that's XY. Remember the Y chromosome is much shorter

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.852
than the X. Now the X chromosome is about

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:33.410
155 million base pairs from tip to tip. And the OPN1LW gene is located right

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.370
here close to the end of the X

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170
chromosome. Notice that there's no corollary because the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.940
Y chromosome is much smaller and doesn't

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660
have the same genetic information that the Y

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.400
does here. The OPN1LW gene, is a gene with 6 exons on the X chromosome spanning

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.560
about 15,000 base pairs of DNA. And it has an allele that's associated with red,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.550
green color blindness. After a transcription and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.090
splicing of the gene, we're left with the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.740
coding region as 1,095 nucleotides long. And

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.200
so after translation we end up with a

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.010
protein that's 364 amino acids long. Remember, this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.312
map is pretty easy. We just divide 1,095

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:22.000
by 3 to get 365 and then subtract 1 to get 364 because

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.260
remember the stop codon doesn't code for an amino acid, it's just empty.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.440
It means stop. Now one allele of the OPN1LW gene

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.590
contains a C, a cytosine to T, to thymine mutation at position

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.410
739 of the coding region. I've highlighted the change in red here.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.960
Now, what I want you to do is, use

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.055
the genetic code that you learned about in lesson

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:49.178
3 and you can find in the instructors notes

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:52.850
on this page. And determine the change expected in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450
the amino acid sequence and select the type of

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.760
mutation that this C to T change is most

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
likely categorized as. Now if you have trouble answering

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.529
this you might want to review mutations from lesson 6.
