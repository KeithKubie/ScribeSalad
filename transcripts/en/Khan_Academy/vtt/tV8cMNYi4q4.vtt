00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.365
- [Voiceover] I would like
to multiply nine times 10

00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:07.151
to the ninth power times negative two,

00:00:07.151 --> 00:00:10.122
times ten to the negative third power.

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:12.770
And so I encourage you, pause the video,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.009
see if you can work through this.

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:16.593
Alright.

00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:18.683
So the first thing I would want to do is

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.401
let's just change the
order of multiplication.

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.652
Let's multiply the nine
and the negative two first

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:24.395
and then we can multiply
the 10 to the ninth

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.554
and 10 to the negative third power.

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:28.156
So if I were to change the order,

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:31.012
we could write this as nine times,

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.124
nine times,

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:35.679
nine times negative two.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.325
Nine times negative two

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.857
times 10 to the ninth power.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.905
Times ten, let me do it in that,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.930
in this color.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.858
Times ten to the ninth power.

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:50.434
Times 10 to the negative third power.

00:00:50.434 --> 00:00:53.558
Times 10 to the negative third power.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.440
Now what's nine times negative two?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.043
Well, if nine times two is 18,

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:01.528
nine times negative two
is gonna be negative 18.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.222
So that's negative 18.

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:08.214
And what is 10 to the ninth
times 10 to the negative three?

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.955
Well if I have a number
raised to some exponent

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.789
times that same number, I have 10,

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.156
I have the same base for both of these,

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:17.752
time that same number
raised to another exponent,

00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:20.144
this is going to be the
same thing as that number,

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:23.418
as that base, raised to
the sum of these exponents.

00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:26.297
This comes straight out of
our exponents properties.

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:29.246
So this is going to be 10 to the,

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:30.593
10 to the

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:34.470
nine plus negative three power.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.463
Nine plus, actually, let me
use those colors so you see

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.970
where that nine and that
negative three came from.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.888
Nine

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.994
plus negative three power.

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.879
Nine plus,

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.597
this color, I'm having
trouble changing colors.

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:49.942
Nine plus negative three power.

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:51.289
Now what's this gonna be?

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.238
Well this is going to
be equal to negative 18

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:55.152
times

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.083
times 10 to the,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.152
nine plus negative three,

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.985
same thing as nine minus three,

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:02.216
which is six.

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:04.817
Negative 18 times 10 to the sixth power.

00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:05.741
And if you wanted to think about

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:06.924
well what number is this?

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.269
10 to the sixth, that's
one with six zeros,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.478
this is a million.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:12.196
Negative 18 times a million,

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:14.402
it's gonna be negative 18 million.

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.908
Or we could say negative
18 times 10 the the sixth.

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:18.651
Either way.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.439
But this is another way we
could have written this.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.596
We could have written this as negative 18,

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.211
negative 18,

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:29.560
let me write the zeros with
the green, just for fun.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.152
Negative 18.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.314
Negative 18 million.

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:39.191
Either way is a legitimate
way to represent this number.
