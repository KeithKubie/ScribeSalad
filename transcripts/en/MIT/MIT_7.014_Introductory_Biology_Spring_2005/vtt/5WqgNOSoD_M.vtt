00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.856
So today we are going to
continue where we left off last

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:08.183
time talking
more specifically about

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:10.969
variations on the theme of life.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.914
And last year
I tried to do this lecture

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.545
using PowerPoint and it was a
total

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:21.989
disaster so I'm going back to
the board.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.345
You will have the PowerPoint
slides.

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:30.202
They'll be on the Web to
download to summarize basically

00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:33.779
what
I'm drawing on the board.

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:38.142
But it will be slightly
different on

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.342
the board.

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:46.428
But I found that for this
material it really doesn't work

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:50.634
to exclusively use the
PowerPoint.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:59.610
So last time we talked about,
remember, my life on Earth

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:11.500
abridged where --
-- we had photosynthesis making 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.785
glucose or organic carbon plus
oxygen?

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:30.000
And then the reverse of
this was respiration.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.347
And then we had elements
cycling in the middle.

00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:39.032
And I said this is
very, very abbreviated of how

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.267
all life on Earth works.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.479
And so today
what I'm going to do is tell

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.093
you that that's not right.

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:51.347
That's
grossly oversimplified.

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:55.331
And there are some really
interesting

00:01:55.331 --> 00:02:01.665
variations on the theme of how
to extract energy and carbon and

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:06.695
reducing power and electrons
from the Earth's system to

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.000
create life.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.467
And it's mostly microbes that
have these diverse

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:12.499
possibilities.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.679
And,
again, even what I'm going to

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.354
talk to you about today is
oversimplified.

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:23.270
If you go to a microbiology
textbook you'll find

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.361
just about every possible
combination of energy sources,

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:32.378
carbon sources and electron
sources in some microorganism

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:35.551
somewhere to
get through life.

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.375
So I'm giving you,
again, the

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:44.090
simplified version because
otherwise it gets way too

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.200
complicated.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.406
So all
of life needs carbon and

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:52.209
energy, and a lot of other
elements, too,

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.250
but
these are the main axis upon

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.078
which we're going to order
our universe today.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:12.047
So for carbon the choices are
inorganic or organic.

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:20.141
So this would be CO2 and this
might be glucose or

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.382
sugars, any sugars.

00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:31.569
And then on the energy axis
they can use solar

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:41.340
energy, as in photosynthesis,
or they can use chemical

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.000
energy.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.333
And within the chemical energy
sources they can be inorganic or

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:58.953
organic like sugars,
etc.

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:09.417
And often here you have reduced
compounds such as hydrogen

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:16.500
sulfide, ammonia,
and we'll talk about these.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:26.529
So these are the ways we divide
up the possibilities for carbon

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:31.285
and
energy sources to be alive.

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:36.333
All organisms also need to have
an

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:39.249
energy currency in the cell.

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.999
And you've talked about this a
lot

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.980
already in the biochemistry
lectures so I'm,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.392
again, just giving you the
impressionist view of this.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.513
You know the details.

00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:58.475
This is just to
get you organized.

00:04:58.475 --> 00:05:03.000
And so all life uses redox
reactions.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.541
And in your handouts for today
there's a primer on redox

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.873
reactions
just in case you want to review

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:13.376
that.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:19.709
And one of the key reactions
we'll talk about today is the

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:21.811
conversion of NADP.

00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:28.722
If you put
energy in you can reduce it to

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:30.000
NADPH.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.830
So that's a reduction.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.750
And the reverse you get energy
out when it's

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.040
oxidized.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.500
Now, we're going to be talking
about oxidation and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.528
reduction today.

00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:56.250
And then they all use ATP which
you've talked a lot

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.032
about here.

00:05:58.032 --> 00:06:02.407
And the couple here is ADP.

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:05.000
Put energy in.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.427
You make ATP which is a high
energy

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:14.778
intermediate.

00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:20.283
And in converting it back to
ADP that energy can be

00:06:20.283 --> 00:06:21.205
released.

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:26.118
And this is used in the
biochemistry of the cell.

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:30.280
So all
cells have these two energy

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.000
conversion processes in common.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.466
OK, so let's look at just
summarizing what we're going to

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:43.294
go
over today.

00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:47.647
This is a summary of options
for life.

00:06:47.647 --> 00:06:51.955
See also Freeman,
Chapter 25.

00:06:51.955 --> 00:06:58.000
There is some discussion of
this.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.818
And we can divide life here
between what we call autotrophs.

00:07:02.818 --> 00:07:06.347
These are
organisms that can make their

00:07:06.347 --> 00:07:08.017
own organic carbon.

00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:12.243
In other words,
they can convert carbon dioxide

00:07:12.243 --> 00:07:13.778
to organic carbon.

00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:17.668
Heterotrophs are
organisms that can only use

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:18.929
organic carbon.

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:25.195
They rely on the guts of
other organisms in order to get

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.000
through life.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.831
And so now we're going to
systematically go through these

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:36.466
processes that fall under each
one of these.

00:07:36.466 --> 00:07:41.152
Oxygenic photosynthesis
is the one we've been talking

00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:44.497
about last time and in my
abbreviated

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.776
version of life on Earth.

00:07:46.776 --> 00:07:50.331
And this is carried out by
eukaryotic

00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:52.944
organisms, plants,
trees, etc.,

00:07:52.944 --> 00:07:56.166
and also by prokaryotic
organisms.

00:07:56.166 --> 00:08:01.166
Those are the cyanobacteria,
microscopic photosynthetic

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.000
plants.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.847
They use CO2 and sunlight.

00:08:03.847 --> 00:08:06.831
So our first variant on this
theme we'll

00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:10.365
get into is a group of bacteria
that do anoxygenic

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:11.663
photosynthesis.

00:08:11.663 --> 00:08:13.879
Oxygenic means they evolve
oxygen.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.497
These guys use solar energy but
they

00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:17.985
don't evolve oxygen.

00:08:17.985 --> 00:08:20.439
And we'll get into how that
works.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:23.414
And then
there's a group of organisms

00:08:23.414 --> 00:08:24.827
that still use CO2.

00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:28.630
And in the very
similar pathway the Calvin

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.000
Cycle is photosynthesis.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.506
But they use chemical energy in
order to make these

00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:39.493
intermediates to
fix CO2.

00:08:39.493 --> 00:08:43.404
OK, so let's talk about those
first.

00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:56.000
And so we're going to
talk about the autotrophs.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And all of them share this
pathway, CO2 to C6H12.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.817
This would be glucose.

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:19.666
And it takes ATP to run this
reaction and it also

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:36.399
takes reduced NADPH --
-- to run this reaction.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.500
It also takes this enzyme
RuBisCO which

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.578
you've talked about I'm sure,
ribulose bisphosphate

00:09:45.578 --> 00:09:47.000
carboxylase.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.500
And this is the enzyme that
initially takes the CO2 from the

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:00.000
atmosphere and binds it to an
organic carbon.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.993
Now, in a detailed version of
this is what's called the Calvin

00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:06.377
Cycle or
the Calvin/Benson Cycle.

00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:09.427
I don't know which one your
book calls it.

00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:13.656
Calvin got the Nobel Prize but
Benson was the graduate student

00:10:13.656 --> 00:10:15.320
that
did all the work,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.330
so you should recognize that.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.277
Anyway, you studied
this in great deal.

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:23.570
But an interesting factoid is
that RuBisCO

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.134
is the most abundant protein on
Earth.

00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:31.462
That tells you how important
this reaction is for sustaining

00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:33.000
life on Earth.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.600
So notice that in order to
drive this reaction,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.384
which is the Calvin
Cycle, it requires energy and

00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:45.239
reducing power.

00:10:45.239 --> 00:11:11.000
So where
do they get it?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.666
Well, there are three ways that
autotrophs can get energy and

00:11:17.666 --> 00:11:21.460
reducing power to drive this
reaction.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.554
And the first is oxygenic
photosynthesis.

00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:31.000
And the second is anoxygenic.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.257
And the third is
chemosynthesis.

00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:37.199
OK, those first three there.

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:41.545
So now
we're going to go through each

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:45.500
of these and look at how they
work

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.610
remembering that all of them
are generating ATP and NADPH in

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.149
order to
drive that.

00:11:54.149 --> 00:12:00.000
So all of the autotrophs have
that in common.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.264
Well, oxygenic photosynthesis
is the one that you know well

00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:05.000
already.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.550
You've studied it in great
detail in biochemistry.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.460
So we're going to,
again, give you the abbreviated

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:18.552
version here just so you have a
template to map these other

00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:20.000
ones onto.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:40.135
These are what are known as the 
light reactions of

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:44.048
photosynthesis,
the Z scheme taking solar

00:12:44.048 --> 00:12:46.604
energy,
splitting water,

00:12:46.604 --> 00:12:50.857
evolving oxygen and
synthesizing ATP and NADPH.

00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:53.362
This is
all familiar,

00:12:53.362 --> 00:12:54.048
right?

00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:55.650
Very familiar.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:01.227
I'm just writing it in
a cartoon version.

00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:06.000
OK, so this is the NADPH and
ATP

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that goes to fuel that process.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.714
OK, so now, well,
at least I can do it on that

00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:22.342
board.

00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:35.000
Let me do it on
this board. Anoxygenic --

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.625
-- is almost exactly like this
process, but instead of

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:46.692
splitting
water these guys oxidize

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:49.307
hydrogen sulfide.

00:13:49.307 --> 00:14:01.000
So here's
our ATP and NADPH.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.014
And they use sunlight to do
this.

00:14:04.014 --> 00:14:07.500
So these are called
photosynthetic

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.323
bacteria.

00:14:08.323 --> 00:14:12.352
And they were around very early
on the Earth.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:16.072
Long before the
Earth's atmosphere was

00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:20.500
oxygenated these were the guys
that were able

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.375
to use solar energy and make
organic carbon but without

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:27.000
evolving oxygen.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.822
Then somewhere along the line
some cell evolved,

00:14:30.822 --> 00:14:35.342
had some mutations and
somehow figured out that water,

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.711
this abundant source of water
was a much

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.258
better electron donor than
hydrogen sulfide.

00:14:42.258 --> 00:14:45.990
And once the biochemistry
figured this out,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.337
you can see the simple
substitution here,

00:14:49.337 --> 00:14:52.768
the whole
Earth started going in a

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.720
different direction.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.928
So this is an
interesting example of how a

00:14:58.928 --> 00:15:05.472
small biochemical innovation can
dramatically change the whole

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:08.000
nature of the planet.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.075
Now, these guys are still
around on Earth.

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.944
In fact, I'm going to show
you some.

00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:18.500
I'll explain this at the end,
but I have some captured in

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:18.897
here.

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:21.125
See that little purple band?

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.795
Those are those guys.

00:15:22.795 --> 00:15:27.140
I've got
other little tricks in here but

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.000
I'll save those.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.608
Well, you cannot really see the
purple band.

00:15:32.608 --> 00:15:36.138
But you can come up
later and look at it.

00:15:36.138 --> 00:15:38.785
Those are photosynthetic
bacteria.

00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:42.544
So they're
still around on the Earth but

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:46.872
they're stuck in places where
there's no oxygen.

00:15:46.872 --> 00:15:50.816
So they have a rather
restricted niche on the

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.865
planet now, but they're still
extremely important.

00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:56.270
What did I do?

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.797
Oh, here it is.

00:15:57.797 --> 00:16:01.461
So one of the places that they
can

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:05.442
be found, and if you're
interested in them a great place

00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:08.626
to go find
some is out at the Mystic Lakes

00:16:08.626 --> 00:16:11.304
in Arlington which is a
permanently

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:15.534
stratified lake so the bottom
of the lake is always anaerobic.

00:16:15.534 --> 00:16:17.564
There's
never oxygen there.

00:16:17.564 --> 00:16:21.150
In a typical lake like that you
have a lot of mud

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.173
on the bottom and you have a
lot of hydrogen sulfide coming

00:16:25.173 --> 00:16:28.778
out of the
mud from bacterial processes

00:16:28.778 --> 00:16:31.000
that we'll talk about.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.558
And you have light here.

00:16:33.558 --> 00:16:38.250
And so you have a gradient here
of this is

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.598
oxygen and this is H2S.

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:45.500
And these photosynthetic
bacteria have to live

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:51.776
somewhere where there's enough
light to photosynthesize and

00:16:51.776 --> 00:16:56.990
enough
hydrogen sulfide to use in this

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.000
part of the reaction.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.482
But they're very sensitive to
oxygen so they cannot be in the

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:06.925
oxygenated
part of the lake.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:09.349
So you find them in a layer.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.513
It's called the
squeeze.

00:17:11.513 --> 00:17:14.922
They have to have light so they
have to be up,

00:17:14.922 --> 00:17:18.666
but they cannot
have oxygen so they have to be

00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:19.050
down.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.816
And they need hydrogen sulfide
so

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:23.634
they have to be down.

00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:26.058
So they're layered in lakes.

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:26.318
OK.

00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:28.851
So what
about these guys,

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.246
chemosynthesis?

00:17:30.246 --> 00:17:33.500
They don't rely on solar
energy.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:39.367
Again, they're still driving
the Calvin Cycle reducing CO2

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:42.801
from the
air into organic carbon,

00:17:42.801 --> 00:17:45.773
but they're not using sunlight.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:18:02.000
So what do they
do? They get their energy --

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.599
-- from redox reactions.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:16.000
And let's just show you an
example.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:32.008
Redox reactions couple to the 
conversion of oxygen to H2O.

00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:38.612
So oxygen is involved in these
reactions.

00:18:38.612 --> 00:18:43.290
And one organism,
for example,

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:50.235
can take ammonia and
convert it to nitrite.

00:18:50.235 --> 00:18:57.000
Another type of organism can
take nitrite and

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.859
convert it to nitrate.

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:07.000
And there are other organisms
that

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.846
can take hydrogen sulfide and
convert it to sulfate.

00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:20.666
And some can
take hydrogen sulfide,

00:19:20.666 --> 00:19:25.833
oh, no, take iron,
ferrous iron,

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:30.429
Fe2+
and convert it to Fe3+.

00:19:30.429 --> 00:19:35.500
So in all of these cases what
is

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.485
happening to these compounds?

00:19:38.485 --> 00:19:41.985
Are they being oxidized or
reduced?

00:19:41.985 --> 00:19:44.438
I
heard an oxidized.

00:19:44.438 --> 00:19:47.453
Yes, they're being oxidized.

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:53.125
So these reduced
compounds, relatively reduced

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:58.736
compounds can be utilized
by oxidizing them.

00:19:58.736 --> 00:20:03.333
The organism can release the
energy

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:05.855
that's needed.

00:20:05.855 --> 00:20:10.000
ATP is generated here.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:27.261
And NADPH is generated by any of
these redox couples.

00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:31.333
So using this energy then the
cell

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:37.089
takes the reduced NADPH and the
ATP and it runs the Calvin

00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:39.611
Cycle,
chemosynthesis.

00:20:39.611 --> 00:20:39.934
OK.

00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:44.664
Now, you may think that these
are kind of

00:20:44.664 --> 00:20:50.035
strange, weird bacteria that
live in strange pockets of the

00:20:50.035 --> 00:20:54.332
Earth where
there's no oxygen.

00:20:54.332 --> 00:20:58.000
And who cares anyway?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.289
They're outdated.

00:20:59.289 --> 00:21:02.932
They dominated the Earth way
back in the early

00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:06.544
stages of the Earth but they're
not so important now.

00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:08.232
Well, that's not
true.

00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:10.367
They're incredibly important.

00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:14.564
In some ecosystems they're the
total base of the entire

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:15.300
ecosystem.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.730
But also on a global scale,
as

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.778
you'll learn,
you should have a feeling for

00:21:20.778 --> 00:21:24.779
this by the end of this
lecture, but also when we talk

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:27.598
about global biogeochemical
cycles you

00:21:27.598 --> 00:21:31.474
will learn that these microbes
are really messengers for

00:21:31.474 --> 00:21:33.996
electrons in
the environment.

00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:37.200
Without them the redox balance
of

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.629
the Earth would not be
maintained, OK?

00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:43.630
You cannot have nothing but
oxidizing reactions or nothing

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.000
but reduction reactions and have
a

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.489
system sustain itself.

00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:50.400
So it's these microbes that are
playing a

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.799
really important role in
maintaining the redox balance of

00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:55.881
the Earth.

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:56.205
OK.

00:21:56.205 --> 00:22:00.098
Now, one system that I'm going
to

00:22:00.098 --> 00:22:04.142
show you in that DVD,
that will do much better

00:22:04.142 --> 00:22:07.538
justice to it than my
drawings here,

00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:12.499
that's a deep-sea volcano in
case you didn't recognize

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:12.776
it.

00:22:12.776 --> 00:22:17.403
And this is 2500 meters at the
bottom of the ocean,

00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:19.135
very, very
deep.

00:22:19.135 --> 00:22:21.406
And there is intense heat.

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:24.898
I mean just think of a volcano
on the

00:22:24.898 --> 00:22:27.367
surface of the Earth.

00:22:27.367 --> 00:22:31.598
Intense heat and reduced
compounds

00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:38.068
are found in the Earth's mantle
that are ready to erupt through

00:22:38.068 --> 00:22:40.805
this
deep-sea volcano.

00:22:40.805 --> 00:22:45.999
And you have sulfate in the sea
water that

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:48.398
percolates through here.

00:22:48.398 --> 00:22:53.199
And as it percolates in and
gets draw into the

00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:59.199
volcanic stuff that's coming
out of here it's reduced to

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:02.499
hydrogen
sulfide coming out of the

00:23:02.499 --> 00:23:03.171
volcano.

00:23:03.171 --> 00:23:06.363
But you have oxygen in the
water in

00:23:06.363 --> 00:23:07.228
the deep-sea.

00:23:07.228 --> 00:23:11.088
And we'll be talking about this
when we talk about ocean

00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:11.899
circulation.

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:15.816
But the oceans have a global
ocean circulation where the

00:23:15.816 --> 00:23:19.411
surface water that's in
equilibrium with the atmosphere

00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:22.667
actually sinks
and travels along the bottom of

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:23.352
the ocean.

00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:26.682
So there is oxygen in the
bottom of the ocean,

00:23:26.682 --> 00:23:30.000
unlike many lakes where you
don't have oxygen.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.338
And we'll talk about that
difference.

00:23:34.338 --> 00:23:40.126
And in the hot vents
the water coming out of here

00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:44.220
can be very, very hot,
but there's a

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:50.675
gradient right as it comes out
meeting the colder sea water.

00:23:50.675 --> 00:23:54.221
And
so what you have here is a

00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:58.444
perfect incubator for
chemosynthetic

00:23:58.444 --> 00:24:08.808
bacteria --
-- that use the hydrogen

00:24:08.808 --> 00:24:12.500
sulfide in chemosynthesis to fix
carbon dioxide

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.361
using the oxygen here.

00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:18.000
And that forms the base of the
entire food

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.500
web in the deep ocean because
there's no light down there.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.099
There's no photosynthesis.

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:29.000
There's only chemosynthesis.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.121
And just a little story that
goes back to when I first came

00:24:34.121 --> 00:24:37.918
to MIT as
an assistant professor in 1976.

00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:39.860
You weren't even born.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.078
But when I was
young we used to go the Muddy

00:24:44.078 --> 00:24:47.544
Charles Pub periodically after
work

00:24:47.544 --> 00:24:49.039
and have beers.

00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:53.726
And there was a professor,
in this department

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:58.894
actually, John Edmond,
who passed away several years

00:24:58.894 --> 00:25:02.073
ago but
who used to be there.

00:25:02.073 --> 00:25:05.269
It was sort of like our Cheers.

00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:08.232
And
I'll never forget the day he

00:25:08.232 --> 00:25:10.241
came back from a cruise.

00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.004
He came to the
pub.

00:25:12.004 --> 00:25:15.063
He was a chemist and I'm a
biologist.

00:25:15.063 --> 00:25:19.754
And he said you will not
believe what we found on the

00:25:19.754 --> 00:25:21.405
bottom of the ocean.

00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:26.177
He had gone down in
Alvin, this two-person

00:25:26.177 --> 00:25:29.000
submersible vehicle.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.230
And he started talking about
these giant clams and these

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.503
giant tube
worms and all of these things,

00:25:36.503 --> 00:25:39.460
and I thought he had had one
too many

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:39.914
beers.

00:25:39.914 --> 00:25:41.961
I found it hard to believe.

00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:44.690
Well, it turned out that that
was

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:49.338
the first discovery of these
deep-sea vents and he was on

00:25:49.338 --> 00:25:50.833
that
expedition.

00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:55.152
And through that collegial
relationship I actually

00:25:55.152 --> 00:25:59.294
ended up with one of the clam
shells from the clams there,

00:25:59.294 --> 00:26:02.218
which is one
of the giant clams.

00:26:02.218 --> 00:26:05.887
Their meat is blood red because
they

00:26:05.887 --> 00:26:10.544
have a special kind of
hemoglobin that they use to keep

00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:14.155
the oxygen
tension perfect for these

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:16.546
chemosynthetic bacteria.

00:26:16.546 --> 00:26:19.955
If the
oxygen is too high they cannot

00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:23.221
do this because it will
spontaneously

00:26:23.221 --> 00:26:24.872
oxidize the H2S.

00:26:24.872 --> 00:26:29.000
So the oxygen tension is very
critical.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.711
And they have a special kind of
hemoglobin that does that.

00:26:32.711 --> 00:26:34.665
So these
clams had symbiotic

00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:36.228
chemosynthetic bacteria.

00:26:36.228 --> 00:26:39.743
Well, since then these
vents have been discovered

00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:42.284
everywhere and ecosystems
similar

00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:44.705
have been discovered on the
surface.

00:26:44.705 --> 00:26:47.769
And there are all kinds of
different vents.

00:26:47.769 --> 00:26:51.140
You're going to learn about not
only hydrothermal

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.658
vents, hot vents in this video,
but also cold seeps they're

00:26:54.658 --> 00:26:57.942
called where
you have methane bacteria that

00:26:57.942 --> 00:26:59.604
are really important.

00:26:59.604 --> 00:27:00.000
OK.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.816
So these are the main ways in
which organisms can get energy

00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:09.406
to convert
CO2 to organic carbon.

00:27:09.406 --> 00:27:13.343
Then you have all these
heterotrophs,

00:27:13.343 --> 00:27:16.536
the
ones that use the organic

00:27:16.536 --> 00:27:21.000
carbon, and they have various
ways of doing

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.593
that.

00:27:21.593 --> 00:27:27.050
You've learned in biochemistry
the primary way,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.776
which
is very powerful,

00:27:29.776 --> 00:27:35.000
and that is using aerobic
respiration to do that.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.475
And so we are just going to
abbreviate that here.

00:27:42.475 --> 00:27:50.244
That's our
reverse of photosynthesis.

00:27:50.244 --> 00:27:54.000
So heterotrophs.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So we have first aerobic.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And let me jump ahead
with the slides.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.924
OK, there you are.

00:28:27.924 --> 00:28:35.699
So this is a cartoon version of
aerobic respiration.

00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:41.855
So we'll just put glucose,
we'll come down to the

00:28:41.855 --> 00:28:43.519
Krebs' Cycle.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:50.428
And we are going to let
electrons flow here and have

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:59.000
oxygen be the final electron
acceptor creating water.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.860
So we've really just
accomplished the absolute

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.729
reverse of
photosynthesis and we've made

00:29:09.729 --> 00:29:14.109
NADH in doing this and we've
made ATP.

00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:20.300
So these guys are getting the
energy out of the glucose that

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.868
all of the
other organisms made.

00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:29.221
And oxygen is the terminal
electron acceptor when

00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:31.655
there's oxygen around.

00:29:31.655 --> 00:29:35.750
But there are lots of
environments,

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:40.279
as we've talked about on Earth,
where there isn't oxygen.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:43.236
And there
are bacteria that can take

00:29:43.236 --> 00:29:45.680
advantage of those environments.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.557
And instead
of having oxygen be the

00:29:48.557 --> 00:29:52.250
terminal electron acceptor there
are a number

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:56.885
of other elements that they can
use, compounds that they can

00:29:56.885 --> 00:29:57.200
use.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.451
For
example, there are some that

00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:05.922
use nitrate and they reduce
it to nitrous oxide.

00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:06.323
N2.

00:30:06.323 --> 00:30:07.392
Ammonia.

00:30:07.392 --> 00:30:14.356
All the relatively
reduced forms of nitrogen.

00:30:14.356 --> 00:30:19.000
And so this called anaerobic.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:31.772
And this process is called 
gentrification.

00:30:31.772 --> 00:30:37.735
And if it weren't for these
bacteria, these anaerobic

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:40.498
bacteria that can reduce
nitrate, nitrogen

00:30:40.498 --> 00:30:43.097
would never return to the
atmosphere.

00:30:43.097 --> 00:30:46.696
Remember last time we
talked about nitrogen fixation,

00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:49.163
how specific types of microbes
can take

00:30:49.163 --> 00:30:52.541
N2 from the atmosphere and pull
it into the ecosystem?

00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.205
Well, if you
didn't have these bacteria

00:30:55.205 --> 00:30:57.832
doing this process that nitrogen
would

00:30:57.832 --> 00:31:00.072
never get back to the
atmosphere.

00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:03.391
They're central to closing the
nitrogen cycle.

00:31:03.391 --> 00:31:07.152
Then there are some that can
use sulfate and reduce it

00:31:07.152 --> 00:31:08.665
to hydrogen sulfide.

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:11.920
As you can imagine,
these are critical to

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.778
creating the hydrogen sulfide
that's used in these other

00:31:15.778 --> 00:31:16.690
processes.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.536
There are some that use CO2 and
convert to methane.

00:31:20.536 --> 00:31:22.959
These are
methanogenic bacteria,

00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:26.230
and they're incredibly
important in the global

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.000
carbon cycle and in the methane
cycle.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.806
Methane is a really powerful
greenhouse gas,

00:31:34.806 --> 00:31:38.554
and we're going to
talk about that later.

00:31:38.554 --> 00:31:42.332
And then there are some that
can take Fe3+

00:31:42.332 --> 00:31:44.825
and reduce it to Fe2+.

00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:48.000
And the same for manganese.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.400
So you should be starting to
sense a

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.075
sort of symmetry here,
right, that these anaerobic

00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:02.396
bacteria are
fulfilling functions on the

00:32:02.396 --> 00:32:02.884
Earth.

00:32:02.884 --> 00:32:05.000
Let me write these down.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:16.666
These are sulfate reducers,
these are methanogens,

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:25.597
and these are iron
reducers and manganese

00:32:25.597 --> 00:32:27.205
reducers.

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:33.817
So these will all become
extremely

00:32:33.817 --> 00:32:40.458
important when we talk about
the global biogeochemical cycles

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:43.635
of all
of these elements.

00:32:43.635 --> 00:32:49.089
It's these microbes that make
sure that the

00:32:49.089 --> 00:32:56.147
cycles can continue and don't
run into a dead end of oxidation

00:32:56.147 --> 00:32:57.848
or
reduction.

00:32:57.848 --> 00:32:58.185
OK.

00:32:58.185 --> 00:33:04.362
Before we go to the movie,
I just want to say if you

00:33:04.362 --> 00:33:12.000
look at Table 25.2 in your
textbook, I think it's that one.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.739
I'm assuming I'm using the most
recent version.

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:20.879
You'll see a
variation of this theme in

00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:24.570
which there will be some entries
of

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:30.855
organisms that don't fall into
these categories that I've

00:33:30.855 --> 00:33:32.549
just shown you.

00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:36.500
And that is to say that there
are

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.000
organisms that use light energy
and organic carbon energy at the

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.862
same
time.

00:33:41.862 --> 00:33:45.775
For every variation that's
possible there's an organism

00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:48.589
that's
evolved to take advantage of

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:48.813
it.

00:33:48.813 --> 00:33:51.500
I've just oversimplified it
here,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.692
but you should know that.

00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:58.743
And the bottom line is if it's
thermodynamically possible.

00:33:58.743 --> 00:34:01.900
And, again, this whole lecture
could

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.048
have been done in a
thermodynamic mode.

00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:09.212
We could have looked at which
redox couples were

00:34:09.212 --> 00:34:13.498
energetically possible and then
assigned those to

00:34:13.498 --> 00:34:15.156
particular microbes.

00:34:15.156 --> 00:34:19.298
But for now I just want you to
get the overview.

00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:23.958
But for anything that's
thermodynamically feasible

00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:27.492
there's a
microbe out there that's doing

00:34:27.492 --> 00:34:27.731
it.

00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:30.284
And, in fact,
microbiologists

00:34:30.284 --> 00:34:33.645
actually comb through redox
tables and put together

00:34:33.645 --> 00:34:36.444
different redox
couples and hypothesize.

00:34:36.444 --> 00:34:39.425
I ought to be able to find an
organism that

00:34:39.425 --> 00:34:41.503
does this in that environment.

00:34:41.503 --> 00:34:42.957
And then they go out.

00:34:42.957 --> 00:34:46.051
And they can
almost always actually find it.

00:34:46.051 --> 00:34:48.105
So they're incredibly
versatile.

00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:50.583
And
it gives you a really good

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:55.314
strong feeling for the power of
thermodynamics in driving the

00:34:55.314 --> 00:34:59.136
evolution of these biochemical
processes.

00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:07.151
Finally, before we show you the
movie I want to show you what

00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:09.897
this thing is all about.

00:35:09.897 --> 00:35:15.464
There was a
Russian microbiologist back in

00:35:15.464 --> 00:35:30.000
the previous century named
Winogradsky --

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.865
-- who wanted to isolate some
of these photosynthetic

00:35:34.865 --> 00:35:35.707
bacteria.

00:35:35.707 --> 00:35:38.046
And
knowing what their

00:35:38.046 --> 00:35:42.724
characteristics were he went out
and got himself

00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:45.361
some mud and some pond water.

00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:49.088
And he set up what we've come
to call a

00:35:49.088 --> 00:35:51.008
Winogradsky column.

00:35:51.008 --> 00:35:55.452
This is a Winogradsky juice
bottle, but it

00:35:55.452 --> 00:35:56.836
works the same.

00:35:56.836 --> 00:36:01.817
And what you do is you put mud
in the bottom and you

00:36:01.817 --> 00:36:03.760
put pond water here.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.356
And the pond water has
basically an

00:36:07.356 --> 00:36:07.971
inoculum.

00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:12.070
It has representatives of all
different types of bacteria.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.427
They might be spores.

00:36:13.427 --> 00:36:16.784
If they don't like the
environment they're in they

00:36:16.784 --> 00:36:19.791
sporulate and then they just
don't germinate.

00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:23.490
But presumably in pond
water you have everything that

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:25.349
could possibly grow in here.

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:27.761
And in the
mud you add a source of

00:36:27.761 --> 00:36:28.300
sulfate.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.927
And so you might add calcium
sulfate

00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:33.769
and you might add a little
organic matter,

00:36:33.769 --> 00:36:38.422
you know, plant parts or
something just to jumpstart it.

00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:41.833
And eventually you set up a
gradient

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:45.666
here of hydrogen sulfide and
oxygen.

00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:49.498
And over time the organisms
grow

00:36:49.498 --> 00:36:51.787
along that gradient.

00:36:51.787 --> 00:36:57.166
So you'll end up down here with
the anaerobic

00:36:57.166 --> 00:37:06.000
respiration.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.957
In fact, the organisms generate
this gradient.

00:37:08.957 --> 00:37:12.385
When you start out the
whole thing is oxygenated.

00:37:12.385 --> 00:37:15.199
And what you should think about
in this

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:16.847
context is what happens.

00:37:16.847 --> 00:37:19.800
How do these gradients get
generated when

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.820
you start out with a completely
mixed system,

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.239
everything in there,
everything oxygenated?

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:29.000
Eventually you have anaerobic
--

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.942
First you'll just have aerobic
respiration, right?

00:37:32.942 --> 00:37:36.172
Anything that
can use organic carbon and

00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:39.460
oxygen is going to go like mad,
and that's

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.356
what's going to draw the oxygen
down.

00:37:42.356 --> 00:37:46.101
Then you'll have anaerobic
respiration here.

00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:49.920
You'll have photosynthesis up
here, evolving

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.450
oxygen.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.772
You'll have chemosynthetic
bacteria here because they need

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:57.319
a
little bit of oxygen but they

00:37:57.319 --> 00:38:00.384
also need some of this hydrogen
sulfide

00:38:00.384 --> 00:38:07.000
and photosynthetic bacteria
here.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.007
Well, they're like down here.

00:38:09.007 --> 00:38:11.500
Because they need light but
cannot

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.305
have oxygen.

00:38:12.305 --> 00:38:14.186
And so you can set these up.

00:38:14.186 --> 00:38:17.963
And this purple band here
tells you that you've got your

00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.563
photosynthetic bacteria.
