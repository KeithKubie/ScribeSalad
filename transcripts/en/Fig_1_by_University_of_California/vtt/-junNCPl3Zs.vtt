00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.250
you know in astronomy we rely heavily on
or visual intuition because of course

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.330
because is not an experimental science
we cannot go exactly the place where

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.460
these two objects are actually merging

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.029
so this is for example a
collaboration between

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.460
artists and astrophysicists in trying to
understand well how can I explain

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.850
to myself into the public what's
happening because it's certainly

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.400
you know train my brain into look at
things in a very different way so now

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.890
can see a three-dimensional
visualization

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.420
and they try to understand basically the
physics in a different way because I

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.840
have tools that I didn't have before

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.030
of how to look at a phenomena so high so to
play to be an alchemist with a computer
