00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.270
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: My
name is John Van Oudenaren.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.030
I'm the acting interim director
of the Kluge Center here

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.500
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.530
Welcome to all of you and
welcome to our speakers.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.830
Thank you to our speakers.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.450
This is an experiment
cafe -- Kluge Cafe series.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.960
This is the first time
we're doing this.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.490
And so we're actually very
interested in getting feedback

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.770
from the -- from the
participants and the speakers

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.350
as well as how well this works.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.220
I'll say a little bit about
the background to this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.620
as I understood it because I was
sort of vaguely involved in some

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.270
of the discussions early
on about this series.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.270
I think idea is to give our fellows
a chance to present their work

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.130
in a more informal setting, relieve
them a little bit of the burden

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.630
of doing a big formal
talk, although they may --

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.340
some of them may still want to
do that, and we'll still do that.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.060
But this is a chance to sort
of present their work sitting

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.060
down as opposed to
standing at this lectern.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.350
It's a chance -- it's
a -- the idea is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.750
to foster interaction
amongst scholars.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.650
Serendipity look for
unexpected thoughts and insights

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.410
that might come from having
people together on the platform.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.330
So it is, as I said, an experiment

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.160
and we're looking forward
to seeing how it works.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.450
Let me just briefly introduce
the speakers, the participants,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.410
and then get out of the way.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.800
We have Ascension Mazuela-Anguita
from Spain, who is going to work --

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.690
introduce you to her project on
Alan Lomax's fieldwork in Spain.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.690
Chet Van Duzer, I'm proceeding
from right to the left,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.370
or my right to your left, Chet Van
Duzer who is the 2016 Mellon Fellow

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.820
at the Kluge Center
and he is working

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.550
on the Ptolemaic World is Not
Enough annotation for education

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.610
in the Princeton copy of
Ptolemy's Geography 1525.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.880
And then to his left Margarita
Karnysheva, who is writing

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.970
about researching and writing
about a misinterpreted mission,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.050
American Intervention
in Siberia 1918 to 1920.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.920
Many of you must -- might know
the great George Kennan work

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.970
on this area and Richard Allman
[assumed spelling] worked

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.330
in this area so she's actually
adding new insights into this.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.900 position:56%
And then the missing chair there is
for Chelsea Stieber, who will arrive

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.210
in a few minutes we hope.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.430
And she's working on writing for
Haiti regionalism in the creation

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.200
of modern Haitian literature,
1890 to 1940.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.820
So those are the topics.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.410
I spent a little time trying
to think of a common theme

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.110
that wove them altogether
and I just sort of gave up.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.810 position:56%
I thought it would be best to let
the scholars tell what they're doing

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.860
and we'll see what emerges.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.680 position:56%
So with that I will get out of the
way and turn it over to our fellows.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.510
Thank you.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.240
&gt;&gt; Ascension Mazuela-Anguita:
Thank you.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.720
It is a great honor to have
spent eight months doing research

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.680
at the Alan Lomax Fellow

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.940
at the Kluge Center [inaudible]
intellectually stimulating

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.240
utmost fear.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.240
I would like to express my
appreciation to the Kluge staff

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.620
and to the Kluge fellows
for [inaudible]

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800
and insightful discussion.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.770
I am so grateful to Abby
Porter [assumed spelling]

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.050
from the [inaudible] for
her interest in my project.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.780
I cannot thank enough
the daily assistance

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.910
of the American Folk Life Center's
excellent staff, and especially

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.720
of [inaudible] of the
Alan Lomax collection.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.930
Let's start with music.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:41.510 --> 00:05:41.510
[ Singing ]

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.410
[ Inaudible ]

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.690
This is one of the almost 1500
folksongs recorded by Alan Lomax

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.200
in Spain between 1952
and January 1953.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.340
The material resource of his
journey, which are preserved

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.780
at the American Folk Life Center,
include music on magnetic tape,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.390
but also photographs, [inaudible],
invoices, annotated maps, letters,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.610
diaries, and even the manuscript
of part of a book for publication.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.700
Why did Lomax undertake
field working in Spain?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.350
Columbia Records had
commission [inaudible]

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.160
to bring together a series
of folk music albums,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.080
each of which would be
devoted to a country or region.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.350
One of the albums would
be dedicated to Spain.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.760
Lomax wrote [inaudible]
musician and writer,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.780
director of the British
Council in Spain asking guidance

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.400
to help him find a
Spanish folklorist

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.030
with experience in field recording.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.770
On this light we can see
[inaudible] indicating

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.040
that Spanish ethnic
musicologists continue

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.720
to write the music down by hand.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.280
Given the possibility of
finding a collaborator

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.300
with the required equipment and
experience, Lomax, who was living

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.780
in Paris at that moment, decided

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.630
to attend the attend the
Folklore [inaudible] Festival

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.870
to be celebrated in
[inaudible] in June 1952

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.250
as it would be a good
opportunity for networking.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.570
The coordinator of the
festival was [inaudible],

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.690
a [inaudible] musicologist who
had been appointed director

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.070
of the folklore division

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.220
of the former Spanish
Institute of Musicology.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.570
According to Lomax, when Schneider
[assumed spelling] learned

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.470
about his project he stated that
he would personally see to it

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.320
that no Spanish musicologist
would help him.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.140
It was this encounter that
made Lomax promise himself

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.270
that he would record in Spain.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.570
The main source of funding
was the BBC in London,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.480
which was planning a series
of broadcasts in Spain.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.270
Lomax offered to provide them with
recordings if they finance his trip

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.290
and that of his British
assistant, [inaudible].

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.570
The lack of cooperation from
the Spanish musicologist

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.300
to whom Lomax referred leaves us to
wonder how he succeeded [inaudible]

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.090
that allowed him to
complete his project.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.800 position:56%
It is also worth considering how his
approach to fieldwork defers to that

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.300
of [inaudible] working in
Spain at the same time.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.230
The aim of my visit was
to answer these questions

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.530
by analyzing the documents from
Lomax's Spain trip [inaudible]

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.090
from oral history and
technological tools.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.330
These materials offer
a unique opportunity

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.710
to approach the political situation
and the Francoist dictatorship,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.720
the poverty of the country, and the
moral constrictions faced by women

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.580
through the eyes of
Lomax and [inaudible].

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.580
Digital tools has been used in
order to establish connections

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.870
between the songs recorded by
Lomax and other collections

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.970
of Spanish traditional music
compiled around the same time,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.180
such as [inaudible] at the
Spanish National Research Council

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.740
in Barcelona.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.070
The Barcelona collection is
primarily made up of more

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.300 position:56%
than 20,000 folksongs copied on
paper and collected throughout Spain

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.670
between 1944 and 1960, most of them

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.290
through the so-called folkloric
missions and competitions organized

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.980
by the former Spanish
Institute of Musicology.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.400
Since 2011 I have been involved
in the project to digitize

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.430
and catalogue the Barcelona
collection

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.280
in an open access database.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.020
As the first stage of my research
at the Library of Congress,

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.750
I have incorporated the details
provided by the Lomax collection

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.610
into the same database,
cataloging information

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.730
on all the places visited by
Lomax in Spain and all the songs

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.810 position:56%
and people recorded there, including
his [inaudible] on the Association

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.830
for Cultural Equity Online Archive.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.300
The material was catalogued
by listening to the songs

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.910
and consulting Lomax's notes
on the [inaudible] boxes along

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.060
with his diaries and notebooks.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.770
Some of the songs were broadcast
into series of programs by the BBC.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.050
The song commentaries were
cited in the database as well

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.050
as the notes included in the
albums that were published

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.830
by Lomax or edited later.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:17.010
I also analyze catalogue
and transcribe documents

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.120
such as field notebooks,
annotated maps, letters,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.450
and diaries connecting
them to the music, people,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.520
and locations to which they
refer, and including links

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.150
to the corresponding [inaudible]
on the Library of Congress website.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.970 position:56%
Lomax's writings offer contradictory
details regarding his itinerary

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.710
and the dates of the
recording sessions.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.550
Accounting records, such as
those related to accommodation

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.000
or car repair, have been
particularly useful here

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.380
as they provide accurate evidence
of Lomax's itinerary and dates.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.840 position:56%
The state has prepared the materials
for analysis and comparison.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.830 position:56%
It is now possible to identify
concordances between this collection

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.690
and the one in Barcelona.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.040
Mutual enrichment between
collection can first be achieved

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.720
through these digital tool.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.480
As part of the second stage,
I have been using the database

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.590
as a research tool
for interpreting data

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.100
and preparing an academic
monograph on Lomax's [inaudible]

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.400
in the cultural context
of mid-20th century Spain.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.190
At the same time, through
the social networks

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.420
to which the database is
connected, Lomax's contribution

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.500
to Spanish traditional
music can be better known

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.980
and appreciated by
a general audience.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.960
In order to provide a different
approach, both to the database

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.680
and to the Lomax Spanish
collect at the library,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.860
I have created a story map

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.700
which presents Lomax's
itinerary connecting each town

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.710 position:56%
to the [inaudible] sample of an
example of the music recorded there.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.840
These are also connected to
[inaudible] image belonging

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.120
to the Lomax collection
and to a link

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.390
to the complete information
concerning

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.120
that location on the database.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.940
This application was intended
to make data more visual

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.420
and accessible not only
to researchers but also

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.310 position:56%
to our brother audience outside the
[inaudible] purely academic context.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.240
Analyzing references
distributed in a variety

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.590
of documental sources allows us
to compose Lomax's [inaudible]

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:23.430
and to understand his itinerary.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.900
Lomax explained what he named
the Spanish [inaudible].

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.610
A recognized person provided
him with a business card,

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.210
which included a brief
note as a type of letter

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.150
of recommendation asking
another person

and recorded [inaudible]

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.940
[Inaudible] explained to Lomax some
aspects of the political situation

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.820
in Spain, as well as the
origin of folk groups

from different Spanish regions that
participated in the Panama Festival.

Most of them formed part of
various government initiatives.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.520
Lomax thought that folklore was
something that lives, changes,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.600
especially in the country,
this is contrasted

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.610
with the official folklore

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.720

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.320
Consequently, Lomax visited this

and only needed a phone call to
provide him with [inaudible].

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.450
It is remarkable that

from the United States carried
out field recordings in Spain

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.900

at first they could be confused
with text written by Lomax himself.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.120

of [inaudible] arrival

1952, and an encounter with Lomax.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.160
They also contain comments on her
experiences through her journey,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.690
her role in the recording
process, and her feelings.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.580
These memoirs demonstrate her
connections with Spanish women.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.970
For instance, learning to dance
with young girls or trying

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.400
on traditional women's costumes.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.200
She also explained her
experience when Lomax left her

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.180
to record a group of young
girls on her own and even wrote

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.290
that Spanish women were the
nicest people she had ever met.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:21.090
[Inaudible] was also
skilled at talking with men.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.200
For example, when Lomax reported
on his field work in the north

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.980

he recorded a young man told

[inaudible] wouldn't have told him

that in his worldwide field work
he found feature of song and dance

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.820
that are specific to women.

always asked the female singer

to hold a child in her arms.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.630

in the oral transmission
of music in Spain.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.690
The clear [inaudible] of the
Barcelona collection were women

or grandmothers or from other girls.

To conclude, the material results

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.760
of Lomax's Spain trip can only
barely reflect the deep impact

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.260
that his visit must have
had on the habitants

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.840
of the small villages
where he recorded.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.780
His amazing legacy can
complement other collections

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.010

on paper in the same period.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.680

concordances

However, these concordances
have a very limited scope.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.560

to his concept of folklore.

that oral tradition is a key
question that must be asked

voices in historical accounts

Changing subjects a little bit,

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.190
although Ascension did show an
annotated map, a map annotated

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.080
by Lomax, so we have that
commonality working for us.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.070
I'll be talking to
you this afternoon

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.550
about an extraordinary book,
a copy of Ptolemy's Geography,

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:20.430 position:56%
the 1525 edition which is held by
Princeton in the university library.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.810
And it is very, very
heavily annotated,

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.870
has many handwritten
annotations on it as you'll see.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:33.000
Ptolemy's Geography, when it was
rediscovered in Byzantium about --

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.710
in about 1300, and then spread
across Europe in the 14th

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.410
and 15th century in both a
manuscript and printed editions,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.770
it became the most
important geographical text

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.820
of the European renaissance.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.600
And on the one hand, there was
a great enthusiasm for the work.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.590
It was reproduced in
many manuscripts

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.190
and a great abundance
of printed editions.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.220
But on the other hand, there was
a dissatisfaction with the work,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.880
specifically as regards the fact
that it's a mathematical geography.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.990
It's not very descriptive at all.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:11.150 position:56%
The work consists of text that gives
instructions on how to make maps

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.980 position:56%
and a database of 8000 locations
with their latitudes and longitudes.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.810
So very little in the
way of description.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:22.390
And so the work came to be
supplemented in various ways.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.300
And one of those ways was
annotation, as we see here.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.680
So here's the Ptolemaic
map of Spain in the book,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.040
and in case you can't see it
immediately, all of the text

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.260
that I've highlighted
is handwritten,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.790
supplementary, descriptive
information.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.130
So it's really an extraordinary
book.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.650
Looking at a few other
maps from this book.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.300
Here's the Ptolemaic world map.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:53.210
And as you can see, it's surrounded
by handwritten supplementary texts.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.200
The texts are not only on
the maps themselves but also

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.170
on black pages following the maps.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.610
The annotator was that enthusiastic
and he had so much to say

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.530
that he also wrote
on following pages.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:12.850
The text, as I said, was printed --
this edition was printed in 1525.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.680
The annotations were
composed in 1527.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.040
At one point the annotators
refers to a historical event

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.940
as having taken place last summer,
and that event took place in 1526.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.260
I want to point out here, this is
something I'll return to later,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.440
that what Princeton has
is really half the book.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.200
So we can see a visible
difference in the paper

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.240
in the two parts of the book here.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.530 position:56%
And what have is the end of the text
block on the left and the beginning

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.410
of the maps on the right.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.810
So at some point in the book's
history a dealer had these

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.650
annotated maps.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.500
He realized that in order
to get the full value

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.940
out of selling the book
it had to be complete.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.100
So he took the text
from another copy

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.460 position:56%
and bound it together with the maps.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.900
So we have in the Princeton
copy the annotated maps

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.560
with unannotated text
from a different copy.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.980
So what does all this text say?

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.860
Well, it's -- he's
adding very substantial

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.000
and very detailed descriptive text

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.610
to Ptolemy's basically mathematical
description of the world.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.850
So just to look at a few examples.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:29.630
On the third map of Africa,
looking at this text, add, he says,

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.310 position:56%
and that's an instruction to the
student, these annotations were made

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.370
for a student, which is one of
the most interesting aspects,

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.980
add right in this book that
the map above is defective,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.850
for there where I put this
sign, the one I've circled,

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:52.330
is the Aphroditopolites nome and a
landlocked metropolis between which

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.620
and Crocodilopolis,
towards the Nile,

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.000
there was a Lake Mirios
about which below.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.530
And then on the map
he places that sign

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.710
to the location where
this text applies.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:10.280
Looking at another example, the
Ptolemaic fourth map of Asia,

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.200
looking at the text
in the left margin.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.430
He says, not far from Tripoli there
is a field that Strabo calls Marca

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.180
in which Posidonius says
a dead dragon was seen.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.190
It covered half an acre, and was
so thick that men mounted on horses

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.550
on either side could
not see each other.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.870
Its mouth was large enough to
receive a man riding a horse,

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.230
and each scale of its skin
was larger than a shield.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.620
So this really couldn't be any
more different from Ptolemy's text,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.360
this long list of 8000 places with
their latitudes and longitudes.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.370
He's giving a historical,
descriptive information,

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.460
including about, if you would
say, the animals or monsters

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.140
that were thought to live
in a particular region.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.910
Looking at the Ptolemaic
map of Spain.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.230
Again in the left margin, he says,

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.620 position:56%
there is great confusion among
different authors regarding the name

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.670
of the promontory in
Spain that faces west.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.810
And he goes on to discuss

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.060 position:56%
in considerable detail the different
opinions regarding the name

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.160 position:56%
of this promontory of Ptolemy, Mela,
Pliny, Solinus, Aelian, and Strabo.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.410
So he's very engaged with
classical literature,

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.750
and we'll see more
evidence of that later.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.750
The map of the Atlantic
and the New World.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.700
Again, we can see very
heavy annotation.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.500
And these annotations are some of
the most interesting in the book.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.100
He talks -- he's talking about
the discovery of the New World

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.230
and the discovery of the route
from Europe around Africa to Asia.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.590
And what he says is that
these are not new discoveries,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:51.240
that both of these things, the
New World and the route to Asia

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.690
around Africa, had been
discovered in antiquity.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.230 position:56%
And so he makes little of the recent
Spanish and Portuguese discoveries.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.010
On the preceding page, that is
the page just before this map

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.060
of the New World, he writes,
remark, as I often said,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.440
that neither this route to the
west, nor that of the Portuguese

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.700
around the tip of Africa, is
new, but had already been done

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.930
by other ancients, then abandoned,
and now finally in our times taken

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.950 position:56%
up again, as is clear from
Aristotle, a most celebrated witness

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.420
and a noble author for
increasing one's confidence.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:30.360
And on the map himself he
says, along these same lines,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.030
we will venture, based on
the excerpts from Aristotle

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.110
that I transcribed below,
that the men and women found

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.010
in this new land were Carthaginians
by origin, and that afterwards,

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:43.190
left alone and deprived of
communication with other peoples,

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.650
they became savages and gradually
lost their customs and rites

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:51.130
and the use of clothing
through long desuetude.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:56.740
So this question is of where the
peoples of the New World came from?

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.660
If all people were
descended from Adam and Eve

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.030
and Columbus was the first
to reach the New World,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.160
where did the people
living there come from?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.060
And what he's saying is that
they were Carthaginians.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.610
That they're Carthaginians,
this [inaudible] work claimed

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.240
that Carthaginian sailors
encountered a large land mass

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.830
in the Atlantic, and
what he was concluding is

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.490
that that was how the
New World was peopled.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:26.760
The annotator had a
strong character.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.830
He -- as we saw, he is very
content to disagree with Ptolemy.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.780
He also did not hesitate to
voice was rather strong opinions

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.710
about the peoples who lived
in the maps in Ptolemy.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.470
So if we look at the modern map
of France, he has drawn a banner

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.840
across the top which says, this
province produces a great number

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.060
of chicken farmers,
innkeepers, cooks, flute-players,

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.510
gamblers, drunkards, and fools.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.040
[ Laughter ]

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.290
The modern map of Spain.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.810
He says here, the best thing for
one's financial affairs is not

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.540
to take a loan from a
Catalan merchant [laughter].

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.530
And there are similar statements
on a number of the maps.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:17.320 position:56%
They're all negative except for
one, which is -- I'll mention later,

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.230
he -- across one of the
maps of Italy he says

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.150
that heroic virtue is
innate to Italian blood.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.450
Guess where he was from [laughter]?

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.160
So some of -- not all of
the maps are annotated.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.810
We saw that a number of them are
very, very heavily annotated.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.470
Some of them have no
annotations at all.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.800
And we can't be certain because --

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.770
whether that was because
the annotator was not

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.640
so interested in those regions.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.070
It's also possible that he
just didn't finish the program

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.570
of annotation he had in mind.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:53.120
But the fact, I'm inclined to
think that we can read something

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.830
into the fact that
they're not annotated,

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.980
because if they had been priorities

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.890
for him he would have
come to them sooner.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.800
So the Ptolemaic map of Taprobana.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.090
There was an abundance
of classical material

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.250
that he could've added
to the map here.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.680
He did not.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.390
And I take this as evidence
that his real interest was

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.970
in the Mediterranean Basin,

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.230
which was where the classical
civilizations of Greece

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.850
and Rome were most active.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.430
The modern map of the Holy
Land has no annotations.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.410
I think that's quite surprising
in 16th century Europe.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.950
So, again, his interest
was classical antiquity,

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.610
not religious history.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.980
The modern map of Southern Africa.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.880 position:56%
Another -- from another annotator we
might have expected some text here

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.710
about Portuguese voyages
around Africa.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:45.330 position:56%
As we saw, he thought little of
those voyages so it's not surprising

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.280
that he makes no remark here.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.490
Looking at a few of the
sources of the annotations.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.840
One of his most -- the
book that he had to resort

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.250
to most frequently was Caelius
Rhodiginus' Antiquarum Lectionum

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.340
Libri IVI books.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.440
It's basically an encyclopedia.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.360
It's a very poorly organized
encyclopedia with quotations

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.400
from classical authors on an
enormous variety of subjects.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.510
And when I go through the
annotations and I find

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.970 position:56%
that he's citing a classical author,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.710
I have to check whether he's
citing the author directly

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.550
or citing the classical author
by way of this book for example.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:37.390
A very similar book in terms of
its nature that is consisting

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:41.910
of enormous masses of quotations
from classical authors is this book

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:46.750
by Sabelico, another work
of encyclopedic nature.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:52.690
This is the title page of
the edition of Pomponius Mela

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.920
with annotations by the
Swiss scholar Vadianus.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.890
This was another of
his favorite sources.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.510
And he makes use not
only of Pomponius Mela,

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:07.910
the Roman geographer, but also
Vadianus' commentary on Mela.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:12.740
And Giovanni Pontano's Dialogi,
that's the source of some

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.630
of his insulting comments about
the peoples of various regions.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.320
So he's a humanist scholar.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.210
He doesn't just take an
insult he heard on the street.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:29.010
He has a source, a classical -- a
literary source for his insults.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:35.210
The care spent on the
annotations, one of the nice things

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.020
about this project is that
the annotations were written

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.040
by a scribe, which is
somewhat surprising.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.430
It has the great benefit of making
most of the text pretty legible.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:49.000
And just to compare the hand

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.490
in which these annotations
were written, that is the hand

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:55.760
of a scribe, with those in another
annotated Ptolemy that's a little

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.100
bit more typical, we see
here the difficult hand

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.370
of a scholar's annotation in
a different copy of Ptolemy,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.890
much more difficult to read.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:11.050
So the mere fact that a scribe
was hired to write these text

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.730
into this copy of the
book bespeaks a project

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.330
with a lot of money to play with.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.010
Modern map of eastern India.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:25.040
Looking at the text on the
following page the annotator says,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.500
in addition to what was said on
the four other maps of India,

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.990
I think it is here worth adding a
few words regarding the fertility

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:33.290
of that land.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.210
My point here is that he's
referring to the text he wrote

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.540
on the other four maps of India.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.910
It's a whole planned
program of annotations.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:47.690
It's not just casual remarks that
he made as they occurred to him.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:52.020
The Ptolemaic world map
that I showed earlier.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.220
Tremendous care was devoted
to the planning and layout

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.150
of the annotations on this page.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.980
At the top and bottom we
have symmetrical quotations

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.710
from Vitruvius about the
inhabitants of the northern

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.170
and southern parts of the world.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.960
We have these triangular boxes
at the corners of the map.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.960
It's no accident that the text
fits in those triangles so neatly.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.490
He has a little title to
the annotations that run

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.920
down the left and right margins.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.470
At the left we have
on the Hyperboreans.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.300
On the right on the Antipodes.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.160
And I want to point out that the
text is perfectly symmetrical.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.840
So it runs down the margins
and then into the lower margins

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.900
and it ends at symmetrical points.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.840
And this, again, was -- it
didn't happen by accident.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.190
It was all very carefully planned.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:46.720
So we're talking about a project to
which very substantial resources,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.970
both of time and money,
were devoted.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:53.350
The purpose of the
annotations, as I mentioned,

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.720
these annotations are unusual in
that they were made for a student.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.790
So what we have in this book is a
program of geographical education

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.360
in the early 16th century.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.940
It's really quite extraordinary.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.570
And I want to look at
some of the evidence

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.400
that the annotations
were made for a student.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:16.040
On the third map of Africa, in the
lower left, the annotator writes,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.740
where I added the Nasamones,
who were missing,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.260
so that you would know
the custom of this people.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.210
So he's addressing the student.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.360
And also in this annotation we see
an interest in teaching the student

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.170
about ethnography,
teaching the student

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.370
about the customs of
different peoples.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:42.390 position:56%
The Ptolemaic map of Greece, the
lower left, this I willingly written

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.990
so that you will know that these
provinces have many products suited

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.440
to the study of the inhabitants,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.540
that is that are revealing
about the inhabitants.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.090
So again, an interest
in ethnography,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.160
an interest in the customs
of different peoples.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.600
The eighth map of Europe.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.350
About which also see
Book 1 of our Strabo,

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:06.320 position:56%
to whom you should have recourse for
such things, rather than to others.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.420
So he's giving the student advice
about which classical authors

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.030
to consult on which subjects.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.840
Ptolemaic map of Asia Minor.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.250
I've explained these things from
Alexander the Great here so that

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.830
by using them, you can
understand what Pliny says

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:26.120
in Book 5, chapter 29.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:31.770
So he's expecting his student to
be very engaged with this material,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:37.050
to be comparing information from
one source with that from another.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.590
Ptolemaic map of Italy.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:47.490
Of all the Alpine peoples, are
listed here by Pliny, but you,

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.650
speaking to the student, list
them with their modern names.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.120
Write the modern names beside
the ancient ones, by conjecture.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.040
So he's giving the
student an exercise.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.190
Write out ancient names
from Ptolemy,

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:02.970
place beside them your best guesses
as to their modern equivalents.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.030
Some material on the back of the
modern map of the British Isles.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.530
For since I once crossed over
to Britain in order to get

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.850
to know the English customs and
pursuits, it would be unworthy,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.210
if I did not add something

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.870
to this map regarding the
hospitality of that people.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.370
So first of all, this indicates
some of the annotator's travels.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.810
It also, again, reflects
the annotator's interest

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:34.500
in the customs of different people.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.170
So how does this work?

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:39.620
How does the educational program
in this work compare with that

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:45.060
in other 16th century
texts that were aimed

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.350 position:56%
at imparting geographical education?

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:52.130
Well, it turns out to be much more
sophisticated and thus was designed

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.300
for a much more advanced student.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.040
So here's Peter Apian's
Cosmographicus liber of 1524.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.350
There's a one-page description
of Africa in this work.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.560
The annotator could easily write
one page about a river in Asia.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:11.990
So he's offering a student a
much higher level of detail.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.730 position:56%
There's a long list of place names
with their latitudes and longitudes.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.170
So this is exactly the sort
of mathematical geography

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.910
that one would get
from Ptolemy himself.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:27.660
So the book is not adding
much for the student.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.100
Johannes Honter's Rudimento
cosmographica.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:37.020 position:56%
One of the sentences is a list of
the most important cities of Poland.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.510
Well, that's wonderful
but it's not much detail.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.720
It's not any analysis.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.380
So, again, I mean, and what Ptolemy
was basically offering was a list

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.370
of the places in Poland.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.820
Here we have a list of
classical place names

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.580
with their modern equivalent,
that is a commonality

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.820
between contemporary graphical
text and the annotations.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.520
So what can we conclude
about the annotator?

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.820
He was Italian.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.650
He uses mostly Italian sources.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:12.070
He occasionally uses an
Italian word in his Latin.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.170
The banner, as I mentioned before,
across one map of Italy read,

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.490
heroic virtue is inherent
in Italian blood.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.940
He traveled widely.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.160
He visited the Hungarian court for
commerce, he mentions at one point.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.810
He visited Augsburg.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.300
He traveled to England
and he was familiar

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.930
with English ecclesiastical
writers and seems

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.930
to have visited the
shrine of Thomas Becket.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.380
It's also possible that
he traveled in Greece.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.270 position:56%
I'm not entirely certain about that.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.210
And his overriding interest was
in European classical antiquity.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.320
The maps of Asia are
lightly annotated.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.640
The modern maps are
lightly annotated.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.570
There's no annotation of the map

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.980
of the Holy Land, as
I mentioned before.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.180
He repeatedly argues against
the great antiquity of Egypt.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:03.290
So if Egypt was more ancient than
Greece it would have more prestige,

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.050
so he argues that Egyptian
culture is not that old.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:10.180
And he argues that recent
geographical discoveries merely

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.800
repeated the accomplishments
of the ancients.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.000
So a few conclusions.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.230
What exactly is this book?

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:23.000
It was intended for an advance
student of geography, clearly.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.470
The annotations profess
an interest in ethnography

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.350
and more broadly demonstrate
the great richness

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.310
of classical geography.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.850
The hiring of a scribe
and careful arrangement

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.260
of the texts indicate a
very expensive production.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.680
Was this a copy made
for the student?

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.390
So was a scribe hired,
instead of the student

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:46.790
as he had been instructed writing
these texts in the book himself,

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.320
was a scribe hired
to do that for him?

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.770
Or was this perhaps a fair
copy for the annotator himself?

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.430
I'm not sure.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.690
Finally, I mentioned before

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.050
that what Princeton had was
only really half the book.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.840 position:56%
It was the annotated maps without --

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.590
with a text block that
had no annotation.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.750
And while I was doing this
research I was curious

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.700
about what might have
become of the other half

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.940
of the book, of the annotated text.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.580
Surely an annotator who was

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:21.110
so enthusiastic would not have
left the text unannotated.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:25.500
It seemed most likely that
the annotated text block

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.820
of the book had been just lost
over time, had been destroyed.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:35.870
But through remarkable good
fortunate I managed to discover,

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:39.740 position:56%
here again is showing the difference
between the two halves of the book,

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:46.410
I managed to discover the
text block of the 1525 edition

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:51.760
of Ptolemy's Geography in a private
collection Brussels annotated

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.820
by the same hand.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:44:01.330 position:56%
And the collector who owned the
book has now very generously sold it

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.290
to Princeton and so the two halves

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.050
of this extraordinary book
have now been rejoined

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.150 position:56%
after considerable time spent apart.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.950
Thank you very much.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:17.500
[ Applause ]

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.530
&gt;&gt; Margarita Karnysheva:
Thanks everybody

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.820
for coming to listen to our talks.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.510
Before I start my presentation I
would like to express my gratitude

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:37.540
to the Library of Congress
staff, in particular of course

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.340
to the Kluge Center people.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.690
I also appreciate the
professionalism [inaudible]

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:47.210
divisions as well as
the European division

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.820
and the American Folk Life Center.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.330
I also would like to say thank
you to Daniel [assumed spelling],

00:44:54.330 --> 00:45:00.690
who provided very useful advice
and tips for my research.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:06.130
And I am leaving in a week
so I'm sad a little bit

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:12.040
because I spent here nine
very fruitful months.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.110
So thank you all again.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:20.370
My research is on the American
expedition to Siberia between 1918

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:28.500 position:56%
and 1920 when the Entente intervened
into the Russian Civil War.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.930
This is another map, I am
following the previous presenters.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:38.300
It's not easy to count exactly
how many countries participated,

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:43.130
but according to Winston
Churchill totaled 14 countries,

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.850
including the United States.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:52.870
This is a military map, so the
blue color shows the [inaudible].

00:45:52.870 --> 00:46:05.070 position:56%
And the red color shows where allied
and [inaudible] forces were located.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:11.760
The allies conducted [inaudible]
and counterinsurgency operations

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.970
against the Bolshevik Reds.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:18.170
Since this controversial
[inaudible] is inseparably tied

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.400
to the Russian revolution
and the Civil War in Russia,

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:26.440
we have incalculable number
of publications on this topic.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.130
Naturally the very fact of the
U.S. troops haven't been operated

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.170
in Russia, the fact of
[inaudible] interference

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:40.230
in the Russian Civil War
creates ample opportunities

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:44.400
for it being utilized
as a convenient tool

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.280
for anti-American propaganda
campaigns.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.370
Unsurprisingly, the
narratives that have been formed

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:56.340
for 100 years mirrored all
the abrupt shifts in Soviet

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.010
and Russian American relations.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:03.990
And, of course, due to the recent
rise of [inaudible] Americanism

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:06.950
in Russian, now these
narratives are often used

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.010
by the Russian propagandists.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:13.710
The main goal of my research is
not the study of these events,

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:18.900
not the study of these events,
but investigation of historical

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.120
and political contexts in which
the main interpretation is both

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.610 position:56%
in Russian and English where
written, as well as how ideological,

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.720 position:56%
political, and social
affiliations of the numerous writers

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:38.190
of these events shape the narrative
-- the narratives they produced.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:43.440 position:56%
While doing my research I identified
the two dominating Russian language

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.340
narratives, which can be
conventionally named the red

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.770
and the white.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:51.720
The red, or the Soviet
communist party narrative,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.020
consists of two interpretations.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.650
One is the [inaudible]
illusion created by the group

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:01.560
of Marxist historians
led by Pokrovsky,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.630
who in 1919 himself actively
participated in the negotiations

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.620
on signing separate peace treaty
between Russia and Germany.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.860
Being vehemently anti-British,
anti-French, and anti-Japanese,

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.660
this group asserted that the United
States has not recognized the

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.500
intervention and American
participation

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.610
in the real fighting was
actually very limited.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.970
Even though they harshly
criticized President Wilson

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.500
for his [inaudible] imperialistic

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.740
and now colonial foreign
policy disguised

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.160
under democratic [inaudible],

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:49.490
I would say that this
narrative was rather favorable.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:54.290
In the 1930's this
narrative was reconsidered due

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.680
to internal political struggle
in the Soviet leadership

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.060
and the rapidly changing
international situation

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.230
on the eve of the World War II.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:08.700
Following the deterioration of
Soviet Japanese relations that led

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.350
to the civil [inaudible] wars,
the Soviet historians claimed

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.930
that they recognize that
the most active participant

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:19.620
of the [inaudible] intervention
has been imperial Japan

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:26.230
and Trotsky has been accused of
being a German and Japanese spy.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:30.040
The beginning of the Cold War;
however, resulted in creation

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.510
of the narrative where America was
viewed as the organizer and sponsor

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.360
of the Entente intervention.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.850
This narrative dominated
official Soviet historiography

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:44.450
up to the 1990's when
it was replaced

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.870
by the anti-communist
white narrative.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:53.410
It is worth mentioning that
nowadays Russia is undergoing kind

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:57.650
of white renaissance,
everything somehow related

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:01.960
to the white movement
[inaudible] values, songs,

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.830
literature are extremely
popular in Russia.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:10.520
There are many drama films and
[inaudible] produced recently

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.850
that unlike the abandoned
Soviet narrative [inaudible]

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:16.430
prerevolutionary Russia

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.320
and anti-Bolshevik white
movement favorably.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:26.770
And the reds [inaudible] as radical
fanatics whose main purpose was

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:30.710
destruction of Russia
and its peoples.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.470
I think that the surprising
popularity

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.420
of the defeated whites
can be partially explained

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.630
by the communist party
efforts to erase the memory

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:42.910
of the white movement
from Russia's history.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:47.170
However, the 70 years of the
red narrative domination proved

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.010
to be counterproductive.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:55.380 position:56%
The white interpretations of the
American intervention can be divided

00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:00.120 position:56%
into two sub narratives, the one
created by the supporters of Russian

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.570
and -- of Russian anti-Bolshevik
socialist parties

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:07.520
and the one created by
the Russian rightists.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.360
The letter included not only
far right loyalists advocating

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:17.200
restoration of [inaudible] dynasty,
but also [inaudible] conservatives

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.120
and nationalists who
oppose the socialists.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.930
One would think that the whites,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:26.510
who refused to recognize the
Bolshevik treaty with Germany

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:30.320
and continue to fight
on the American side,

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.730
should have created a
pro-American narrative.

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:37.850
However, the right whites
unanimously accused their

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.990
[inaudible] of provoking
and escalating the Civil War

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:46.290
to win Russia this
[inaudible] people.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:48.970
Basically, the white
narrative asserted

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.940
that not only the United States,

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.090
but entire Entente have provoked
the Civil War to force Russia

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:01.310
to continue fighting
against the Germans.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.660
And when they failed to
[inaudible] Russian people,

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.930
they [inaudible] treacherously
abandoned them to suffer torture

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.400
and death at the hands of
the victorious Red Army.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.710
According to this narrative,
General William Greaves,

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:20.710
the commander of the American
expeditionary force in Siberia,

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:23.600
in fact, gave assistant --

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:29.030
gave assistance not to his white
allies but to the Bolsheviks.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:34.970
And the [inaudible] had generally
financed antigovernment terrorist

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.730
organizations, including
the Bolsheviks,

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.400
to destroy the Russian empire.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.660
This narrative often noted in
all kind of conspiracy theories

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.030 position:56%
and knowledge [inaudible]
themselves constitute a fertile soil

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:54.420
for creating conspiracy theories,
not only in contemporary Russia

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.620 position:56%
and the United States but worldwide.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:04.700
So my research aims at finding
inconsistencies, false premises,

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.180
wrong conclusions,
misunderstandings,

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:12.750
and misinterpretations in
this anti-American narratives.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:16.780
Here at the Library of Congress
I studied archival documents

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:20.650
from 12 collections,
including papers

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:24.500
of President Wilson's
Secretary of State Lansing,

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:30.270
Secretary of War Baker, Senator
William Borah, American Ambassador

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.500
to Japan [inaudible],
and many others.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:40.500
It was priceless to have all the
necessary publications at hand,

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.810
especially the recently
published ones.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:47.530
What surprised me in the
U.S., despite the fact

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.750
that this two year-long
occupation of a huge part

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.410
of Russia's territory is not known

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.980
to the [inaudible]
academia audience,

00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:01.510
it has been actually scrutinized
in every single detail.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.080
Also, I discovered that the
library possesses a unique

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:10.320
and very rare collection of the
white authors' writings published

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:18.730
in Europe between the 1920 --
between the 1920's and 1930's.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.620
In conclusion, I would like to
say that my research is not over

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.950
and I need to study tons of
materials at the National Archives

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:32.150 position:56%
in Washington, D.C., as well as
some Russian and Japanese documents.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.920
But anyway, I'm sure that the
information that I collected

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.280
at the Library of Congress will
constitute the most important part

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.250
of my database.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.050
Thank you.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:49.500
[ Applause ]

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:57.340
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Stieber: Okay, hello.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.020
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.720
Thank you also to the Library
of Congress, the Kluge Center

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:09.610
for organizing, and also, yeah,
to all of these wonderful talks.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.630
I'm sorry that I was not
here for the beginning.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.200
I am now back to teaching.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.900
So I'm wearing these two hats.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.040
So I'll start right off so we can
get to questions and then food,

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.070 position:56%
and hopefully both at the same time.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:26.840
So it was interesting,
I got the poster sent

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.770
to me Travis [assumed spelling]
and I thought to myself,

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.620
oh no, that's the wrong title.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:36.630 position:56%
And I realized that I had proposed
a title in 2015 for what I was going

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.230
to be doing at the
Library of Congress,

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.040
and it has turned into this.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.650 position:56%
So this, I think my talk will
hopefully be a testament to the work

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.010
and the research I've done here
that has really transformed

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.900
and enriched the scope
and rigor of my book.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.380
So, yes, it's changed quite a bit.

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.190
So in this talk I'll just do a
short overview of my book project,

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:59.800
focusing on the main
intervention as well as the stakes

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.100
in the fields I'm working in, and
then I'll briefly describe two

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:07.360
of the collections that I've used
here to make that work possible.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.440
So as you see, the book
project, it's currently

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.020 position:56%
under the working title Haiti's
Paper War, Post-Independence Writing

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.760
and the Making of the
Republic, 1804 to 1954.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.220
And the book basically does --

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.040
is what it's doing is
revealing the power struggles

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.210
and strategic silences at stake
in the scripted representations

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:28.750
of Haiti's past since 1804.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.560
I'm particularly interested
in questions of civil war

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:35.580
and regional conflict as they
played out almost continuously

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.990
in literature, politics, and
culture in postcolonial Haiti.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:43.280
Indeed, and this is really sort
of really the main crux of this

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.440
at the moment, while much recent
scholarship has rightly emphasized

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.550
the Haitian revolution as
the radical instantiation

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:55.500 position:56%
of enlightenment liberalism in the
Atlantic world, it is not only this.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.470
So my book considers the aftermath

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.090
of Haiti's radical
anti-colonial gesture within Haiti,

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.110
and specifically the
factional conflicts

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.240
that both shaped the
revolution itself

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.890 position:56%
and conditioned the possible futures
postcolonial independence statehood.

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:13.430 position:56%
And a brief background here on the
history and the specificity of this,

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.860
because it will be
useful to you, I think.

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.690 position:56%
The newly independent state of Haiti

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:20.950
in 1804 divided itself
along the same lines

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:24.430
that had divided it during the
revolutionary period between those

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.940 position:56%
who were liberals, who wished to see
the independent state as a republic,

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:30.980
and in 1804 they wanted
to proclaim Haiti

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.610
as the last true remaining
place of liberal enlightenment,

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:37.910
especially after the first
French republic had faltered.

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:39.210
And then on the other side,

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:42.990
those who envisioned a
military authoritarian regime.

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:45.920
These tensions remained
unresolved for the first two years

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.740
of Jean-Jacques Dessalines' rule

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.200
over independent Haiti
from 1804 to 1806.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.500
And it's important to note here

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.160
that this state never bore
the name of a republic.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.870
It was a military state
and then an empire.

00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:01.940
And it was Dessalines'
decision to proclaim an empire,

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.860
orchestrated in secret
by his advisors,

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.430
the backers of this
military authoritarian state,

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:09.670
that more or less sealed his fate.

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:11.880
The republican faction
staged an uprising

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.800
and assassinated Dessalines
in October 1806.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.850
So the republican faction
felled the empire,

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:21.350
but they were unable
to unite the nation.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.190
Instead, Dessalines'
assassination marked the start

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:27.680
of an official civil war between
north and south, between monarchy

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.740
and republic, that
lasted until 1820.

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:34.320 position:56%
And what's so fascinating about this
period to me, and what is so useful

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.710
for understanding the rest of
Haitian history in my mind,

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:40.420
is that we see two
drastically different versions

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.840
of postcolonial Haitian statehood
play out, vying for hegemony.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.140
These are possible futures

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:50.200
of what an abolitionist black
state could or should be.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.530
And one of the most
salient differences

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:56.320
between the two sides is
the way that each state used

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.470
and defined the notion
of, liberty, liberty

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.400
or freedom depending on
how you translate it.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.150
And if we take as given that
both regimes, both the monarchy

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:09.230
and the republic, agreed that
liberty did mean abolition

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:12.280
and freedom from chattel
slavery, it is also true

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.370
that they fundamentally disagreed
on its meaning with regard

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:19.250
to enlightenment principles and
questions of individual rights.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.940
So did liberty mean
independence from colonial rule

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:25.110
or did it mean freedom
from arbitrary government

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:27.280
and the guaranty of
individual rights?

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.500
And this differed in each state.

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.930
In the north, Christophe,
Henri Christophe, the king,

00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:36.450
saw liberty primarily as
independence from colonial rule

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:39.350
and not as a guarantee
of individual rights.

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:42.380
Indeed, the two for him
were mutually exclusive.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:47.360
His military state turned
monarchy placed individual,

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:51.060
or rather anti-colonial
independence, above all else.

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:54.730 position:56%
That meant that individual liberties
and rights had to be sacrificed

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:57.240
for this greater good
of sovereign statehood.

00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.930 position:56%
Conversely, Alexandre Pation's state

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:03.300 position:56%
in the south finally founded the
republican government that partisans

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.150
of enlightenment liberalism had
been envisioning since 1791.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.230
His regime embraced the
revolutionary language

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.570
of individual rights and radical
democracy, but it is important

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:18.760
to note often felt short --
fell short of this in practice.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.470
So I've elaborated on
these foundational tensions

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.070
in early postcolonial Haiti at
length here because I believe them,

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:26.580
as I said before, to be central

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.170
to understanding the continued
civil war secessionist regimes

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.760
and regional conflicts that
persisted throughout 19th

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.650
and 20th century Haiti, and
even to the present day.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.910 position:56%
And more important for our purposes
here, they reveal crucial background

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:45.910
on the battles over national
identity and cultural legitimacy

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:49.790
that have marked Haitian
writing since independence.

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.770
For -- while I place great
importance on historical

01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:56.200
and political background here in my
work, my book is ultimately still

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.930
about writing and how
we can use writing

01:00:58.930 --> 01:01:01.670
to trace the continued
residences of civil war

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.110
and regional conflict in Haiti.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:08.960
Take, for example -- here,
let me check my time.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.260
Yeah, we're good.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.750 position:56%
[Speaking foreign language] or paper
war that occurred between the north

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:16.200
and south during this 1806
to 1820 civil war period.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.630
The printed matter that came
out of each regime, the monarchy

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:23.360
and the republic, supported their
oppositional political agendas.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.110
So in the north we have
pamphlets, newspapers,

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.500
and essays from the
northern monarchy

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.700
that served a primarily
utilitarian purpose in support

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.770
of the regime's militant
anticolonial agenda.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.840
In the southern republic, on the
other hand, and this is fascinating

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.150
to witness, writing begins to
take on the emergent modern sense

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.570
of literature as [speaking foreign
language], that is literature

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:52.190
as imaginative, creative works,
of the autonomous liberal mind.

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:55.280
And so southerners were doing this
in order to position themselves

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.680
against northern writing and
also to position themselves

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.390
within a world republic of letters

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.200
that supported their
liberal enlightenment agenda.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.010
They actually did this
via the literary magazine,

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:10.770
which was itself a recent invention
of the republic of letters.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:14.100
So these southern writers
were performing the successes

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.710
of the liberal republican model
by heralding literary writing

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:20.250
as a direct expression
of the liberal mind

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.270
and the creative intellectual
abilities of the individual author.

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:30.150
So here the book basically reveals
how writing itself became the

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:31.880
subject -- excuse me?

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.180
&gt;&gt; Slides?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.810
&gt;&gt; Chelsea Stieber: Oh no,
no, this is just a preface.

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.910
Oh, but thank you very much.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.490
No, no slides yet.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.920
They're at the end.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.180
Yeah, my book basically shows how
writing itself became the subject

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.520 position:56%
of civil war, and more
specifically the limits and criteria

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:52.240 position:56%
for what constituted literature at
specific moments in Haitian history.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.220
So what I've done and what
I've done with this research is

01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.470
to basically trace this throughout
the 19th and 20th century

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.990
where we see these sort of
returns and continued residences

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:07.110
of these foundational fractures
in writing, and especially

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:11.140
between this idea of a utilitarian
form of writing that was in support

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.520
of a certain regime and a much more
liberal [speaking foreign language]

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.620
idea of literature.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.770
So ultimately my book is a
new history of Haitian writing

01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.880
that focuses on civil war,
on internal divisions,

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.940
and strategic silences that
have shaped our conception

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.570
of Haitian national literature.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:30.600
The need for new scholarship

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.850
that interrogates oversimplified
representations

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.390
of Haiti's diverse
realities is a pressing one,

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.900
but I think even beyond the
immediate Haitian context my book

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.960
offers a compelling regional
paradigm for grappling

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.980 position:56%
with the wider Caribbean, which
like Haiti, remained geographically,

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.560
politically, and culturally
stratified for most

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.630
of the 19th century and,
of course, into today.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.900
The Dominican Republic
is an excellent example,

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.780
divided between north and south,
between interior and coast.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.160
Cuba is markedly different
from west to east.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.160
But because these various Caribbean
populations have been defined

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.580
since their inception as sort of --

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.710
in relation to the European
metropole, they are marginal

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:17.430
because Europe is center, this
makes them always already regional

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:20.040
in a larger Euro Atlantic context.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.120
So in essence, my book
is challenging the notion

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.870
of the Caribbean regional and
the Euro Atlantic and arguing

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:28.840
that regional difference within
the Caribbean is a necessary

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.300
and productive lens for analysis.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.760
One final note just
on contributions.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.020
There's some debates in francophone
postcolonial literary studies

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.220
about this idea of what was
literature and the world republic

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.440
of letters because I think it's
really useful to think here

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.730
about what gets obscured
and what gets highlighted.

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:52.660
I'm joining up with some other
scholars who are working on sort

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.620
of critiques of the field
to reveal how studies

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.090
of Caribbean literature has failed
to consider, or even register,

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.990
marginal, and in this
sense I mean non-hegemonic

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:06.710 position:56%
or non-cosmopolitan writing
precisely because it does not engage

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:09.480
with the market forces of
international recognition

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.880
or world literary debates.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.580
So I'm identifying
a culture of writing

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.570
from beyond the world republic
of letters on the margins

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:20.510
of this international literary
field of Paris-based consecration.

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:25.110
And one note on methodology and
sources by way of transitioning

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:29.480
to my slides, and also to the
content section of this talk,

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.150
to do this book, to focus on
silences, what's written out

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:37.320
or delegitimized in scripted
representations of Haiti,

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.000
it was absolutely critical
for me to go back

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.260
to primary sources themselves.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.030
So the histories that were written
in the 1850's and the 1890's,

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.660
newspapers, essays, rather than
relying on secondary readings

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.030
of that original content and
specifically Anglophone readings.

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:55.560
And this is something that
I know is sort of widespread

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.460
in everyone's field, but the
need for Haitian studies is so,

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:06.060 position:56%
so strong because there is this sort
of, not a slippage, but a failure,

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.120
I think, to take account of
when there is this tension,

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.090
the civil war tension that
I'm talking about that sort

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.110
of gets reproduced
throughout the 19th century.

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:15.540
It also involved a lot of reading.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.710 position:56%
And so, you know, to the extent that
that's possible for a book project,

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:22.110
and I certainly have learned as
this is my first book, what is

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:25.230
and is not possible to take
on, but being able to work here

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:28.120
at the Library of Congress has
been transformative in that way.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.640
The library holds so many
Haitian sources from the 19th

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.080
and 20th century, the
most important ones

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.310
but also some really interesting,
lesser-known publications

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:41.250 position:56%
from Haitian scholars produced
locally, many of which exist outside

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:44.720
of this Port-au-Prince sphere as
well which has been fantastic.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.780
So in the final minutes that I
have here I want to highlight two

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.620
of the collections
that I've been using

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.550
that are really critical
to my research.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:56.070
So the first is a Haitian
social science journal,

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.370
the [speaking foreign language].

01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.670
It's a social science journal.

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:06.510
It's arguably the most important
20th century social science journal

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:08.920
in Haiti, and it certainly
the most prolific,

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.880
and still in existence
today as well.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.720
It's a hugely important
repository of scholarly production

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.540
of locally produced
knowledge in Haiti,

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.030
and the library has a
near complete run of it.

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.480
It's one of the only libraries
that does in microfilm

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.310
or on microfilm [inaudible]
and in bound volumes.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.260
I will not belabor
this point; however,

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.950
because I already gave
a short talk on it

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:33.930
at the National Digital Initiatives
Collections as Data Conference here

01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.880 position:56%
at the library, so you can just
watch it and learn a little bit more

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.400
about this so I can
skip to the other stuff.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.730 position:56%
We're also doing an exciting digital
humanities project with this here

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.830
at the library, labs.loc.gov.

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:47.320
So check it out.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.950
It's on my Twitter but I think it's
the sixth hour and 35 minute mark

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:54.130
on the YouTube channel for that
conference so check it out.

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.120
Okay, so the second
resource that is --

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.980
that I've been using is this
fascinating manuscript division

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.510
collection called the
Celestine Bencomo Collection.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:08.880
The collection holds hundreds of
pieces of archival material related

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.320
to nearly every Haitian head of
state from the 19th and early --

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.040
all of the 19th and then
the early 20th century.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.600
Just a little bit on this
interesting man, Celestine

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.750
or Celestino Bencomo, served as
the Console of the Republic of Cuba

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:27.740
in Port-au-Prince on
and off 1909 and 1914.

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.970
And during that time he collected
all sorts of interesting pieces,

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.690
lithographs, painted
portraits, decrees, letters,

01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:39.350
other official documents on
or about Haiti's leaders.

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:44.500
And he gifted this material to
the U.S. government in 1925,

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.640
at which point the Department
of State transferred it

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.110
over to the Library of Congress.

01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:50.790
And having this fascinating

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:55.120
and really well-preserved
archival material allowed me

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.250
to do some fun things, some
new analyses on some rare,

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.940
and in some cases, as
far as I know, unique,

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.840
historical documents on Haiti.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:06.840
And so specifically here I did a
few other analyses, but this one is

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.280
on the heraldry and coats
of arms of Haitian leaders.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:17.560
So what I want to kind of show
is how these coats of arms,

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.310
this heraldic symbolism, reveals
the ruptures and continuities,

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.250
the [inaudible] and
adaptations of symbols of power

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:27.390
in early postcolonial Haiti.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:30.800
And more specifically, I want to
make an argument about the empire

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.460
of Fostou Soluke, you
have his name here,

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.110
who is one of Haiti's least
studied or understood leaders.

01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:41.910
He ruled as an emperor
between 1849 and 1858.

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:46.080
And there is a black legend that
surrounds the history and legacy

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.230
of his rule that is not too
dissimilar from the memory

01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:51.280
of Napoleon III in France.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.920
And indeed, the two ruled during
the same period, though it's true

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.040
that Soluke proclaimed his
empire before Louis Napoleon.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.350
And in this sort of black
legend Soluke is either a symbol

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:06.530
of violence and cruelty or of
ignorance and pure mimicry.

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.390 position:56%
The truth is, of course, somewhere
in between, or maybe not even there.

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:14.270
But it's true that Soluke's legacy
and memory is heavily mediated

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.830
by his detractors' depiction of
him, especially because there's

01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:21.530
so little self-representation from
his regime in the way of writing,

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:26.400
artwork, or propaganda, which is
why this Bencomo Collection has

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.410
so many original documents
is amazing because we're able

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:33.800
to see some of what the documents
coming from his regime looks

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.430
like and some of the images.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:40.130
And just a side note, Soluke is
best known for Solukery [phonetic],

01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:42.880
which were basically French
republican caricatures,

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.300
detractors of Napoleon III's
regime who used the image

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.040
of a black emperor in Haiti
to ridicule the return

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.490
to empire under Louis Napoleon.

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:57.300
And so what I'm trying to
do with these images is sort

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.500
of understand more about
this particular leader.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.680
So let's just look
briefly at the images

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.680 position:56%
and I'll do a little comparison just
to show you how I did my reading

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.270 position:56%
and analysis of these coats of arms.

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:09.400
So here you have -- and
what's really fascinating

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.020 position:56%
with the Bencomo Collection is you
have a bunch of different documents,

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.820
so I was able to look at the
variation of these coats of arms.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.300
And in fact, you know, for Soluke I
think I found four different ones,

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.330
for Christophe there were six.

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:23.890
So it's interesting to see that
there were different printers

01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:27.460
and different images, or
not images rather plates

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.160
that they were using for these.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.690
So let me show you
the first comparison.

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:36.160
So here we have Napoleon I's coat
of arms, 1805, and Dessalines' coat

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.640
of arms just to show you --

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.750
what I want to show you is how
Soluke builds his out more or less

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:43.940
from these prior leaders.

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.480
What's fascinating, and
these are not actually

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.710
in the Bencomo Collection,
unfortunately, although there is --

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:52.080
there are a few documents
from Dessalines, which is --

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.450
which is great, even
from [inaudible].

01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.190
But you see here, there's
a really big difference.

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:59.980
And Dessalines created his
coat of arms after Napoleon I.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.960
There's a little bit

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.800
of an interesting thing
going on in history here.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:11.000 position:56%
They -- it appears that Desslines
backdated all of his decrees and all

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.060
of the official nominations of
him as emperor to make it look

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.180
like he nominated himself, or
was nominated before Napoleon,

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:24.350
but it's not true, or that's
what it most likely looks like.

01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:27.380
And it's a compelling argument,
I believe that to be the case.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.090
In any case, so we're going on the
idea that Dessalines created his --

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:36.590
oh no, Dessalines created his
coat of arms off of Napoleon I.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:39.770
But as you see here, there
really isn't that much

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.070
that they're working on, right?

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:42.370 position:56%
There isn't that much that's shared.

01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:45.230
We have the lions in Dessalines,
you have the [inaudible],

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.000
which is significant in
French revolutionary imagery

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.790
but also the importance of
the rooster in Hispaniola

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:55.290
and in the specific [inaudible]
case is also interesting.

01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:58.270
So I'll come back so that you can
see some of the other comparisons.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:01.150
Then we come to Henri
Christophe's coat of arms,

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:05.330
which is a significant departure
from Dessalines but brings some

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:08.190
of the Dessalines image
in and also then starts

01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:12.360
to look a little bit more like a
more typical or characteristic,

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:18.860
a more real symbol, perhaps closer
to Napoleon or more generally

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.750
to a coat of arms as it would
look in any regime of that sort.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:25.330
I'll skip over the details
just for the sake of time,

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:27.450
but it's interesting to
remark the different ones

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:29.170
that I was able to find.

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.950
And then here you can
see the comparison now

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.270
to what Soluke came up with.

01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:37.660
And so it's interesting because
Soluke basically, I think,

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:41.990
reinterprets Napoleon I's coat
of arms through Dessalines

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.710
and Christophe's adaptations.

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:47.410
So he's creating something
that's wholly derivative

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:50.300
but entirely new at the same time.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.180
He maintains the two lions, and
his lions, I think, look much more

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.180
like Christophe's than
like Dessalines,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.590
but the way that they're
turned also evokes Dessalines,

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:00.550
which is really interesting.

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:03.360
He returns the eagle
to the shield instead

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.920
of the [speaking foreign language]
that Dessalines had or the phoenix

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.530
that Christophe had,
the mythic phoenix.

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:12.640
He also at the liberty tree,
which I think is interesting.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.980
This is a republican, the Haitian
[speaking foreign language]

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.660
which is a republican symbol
which leads me to believe

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:25.820
that he's basically amassing
symbols from prior regimes in order

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.880
to create a more capacious
idea of his power

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.940
and of Haitian national identity.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.120
Interestingly though,
the most radical gesture

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.880
in this is his addition
of the imperial rope,

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.200
which returns us -- oh, I'll skip.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.500
Yeah, that was Christophe.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.800
You can see some of
those similarities.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.100
And then back to Napoleon I.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.080
I mean, the imperial robe is
an exact replication of --

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.880
I mean, he basically just
puts all of that on top

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.180
of the Dessalinean [phonetic]

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.020
or Christrophean [phonetic]
imagery there.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.880
And he actually used this imperial
rope in his coronation ceremony.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.180
We have images of it.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.480
So they're in the collection.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.040
So it's interesting.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.400
He's -- it's a complete copy
of Napoleon I that's sort

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.590
of dressing this interesting
reinterpretation

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:09.610
of previous symbols
of Haitian power.

01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:12.330
And so I wonder, by
way of concluding this,

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:15.310
what that might tell
us about Soluke.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:18.850
And as I said before, I
think it points to his savvy

01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:22.980
and an understanding of creating
and using symbols to gesture

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:27.490
to previous Haitian rulers and to
create this larger sort of idea

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.710
of Haitian national identity.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:32.550
But the Napoleon focus,
I mean this is what

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.140
so many historians have pointed to,

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.900
it was just pure imitation
of Napoleon.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.170
I think there's something certainly
a bit more sophisticated going

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:45.750
on there, not least of all
because in -- on December 20, 1848,

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.830
Louis Napoleon, Napoleon
III, was elected president

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:50.570
of the second republic in Haiti.

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:56.290
And so at the very least we have an
awareness of this fact in this sort

01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:00.210
of return to imperial
Napoleonic symbolism

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:06.630
and this 1849 heraldic
symbolism from Soluke.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:09.060
I think, my own interpretation that
I'm still kind of still working

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:11.950
through right now, is that it's
actually a really great form

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:16.280
of sophisticated trolling and
that Soluke actually proceeded

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.580
the [inaudible].

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.110
I mean he was sort of wanting
that perhaps even to happen.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:22.800
In any case, I think what we see

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:27.400
from this analysis is a much more
sophisticated and complex portrait

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.110
of a little studied and
even less understood leader,

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:31.980
which I was able to undertake.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.320
So I'll leave it there.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.140
I would start out with a
question for Chet as well.

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.280 position:56%
About the annotations, the -- are
they all based on classical sources?

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.080
I mean, this is 1525.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.590
By this time you've got, you
know, several decades of Spanish

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:44.910
and Portuguese discoveries,
exploration, is that incorporated

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:48.020
in the annotations or is
it just purely exercising

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.320
classical literature?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.620
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: It's -- so a lot
of classical learning comes by way

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:59.040
of these sort of collections
of classical quotations

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.900
that were published in
Italy in early 16th century.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.390
But there's very, very little
reference to recent discoveries.

01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:10.420
There's a fair number of
corrections of classical authors,

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.290
but not on the basis of Portuguese
or Spanish voyages, for example.

01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:17.080

some point the Europeans conclude

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.590
that Ptolemy is an interesting

01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:44.390
&gt;&gt; About the students.

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:46.520
You mentioned that these -- he
would have written these things

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.980 position:56%
for a student and I wondered what
kind of student would be doing this?

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.730
Is it a map making student
or a student of classics

01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:55.450
or who would the student be?

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:58.890
&gt;&gt; Chet Van Duzer: So
what I'm imagining is

01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:02.580 position:56%
that the annotator would essentially
tutor for a very wealthy family

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:08.560
in northeastern Italy is
as close as I can get.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:14.460
And it would have been part
of an education devoted

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.630
to both classical literature
and specifically geography,

01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:22.580
not map making as such
but geography principally.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.420
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Very good.

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.410 position:56%
Okay, well I think it's probably
best maybe if we continue informally

01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:29.710
around the food and the wine.

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:32.520
I thank -- these have been
four fascinating talks.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.440
They're on different subjects
but also people coming

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.300
out of different sort of, I don't
even want to use the word academic,

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.800
different research traditions,
different institutions

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.800
that they're working from,
from, you know, our last speaker

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.110 position:56%
who is really grounded in the
American academic tradition it seems

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.060
to other, you know, Spanish,
Russian, and Chet, I guess,

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.120 position:56%
is our free flying spirit, whatever.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.110
And so it's been not only different
topics, but also different ways

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:03.240
that people, different
traditions, different methodologies

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.130
that people can approach material
and get fascinating results from.

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:10.760
So please join with me
in thanking our group.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:14.840
And again, this is an experiment
so we really appreciate feedback

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.550
on how we proceed in the future.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:18.920
Thank you.
