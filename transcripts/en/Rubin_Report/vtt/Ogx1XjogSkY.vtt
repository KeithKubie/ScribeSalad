WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.270
All right.
I think we're alive.
We're alive.
We're alive.
We're alive on Youtube.

2
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.990
How about that?
Uh,
I am here with author,
with journalists,

3
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.991
with documentary filmmaker and a guy who's gonna cause me a whole world eight

4
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:23.700
today,
Mike Cernovich.
How you doing man?

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.200
<v 2>Um,
I'm doing better than you're doing.
That's really good.
Well,</v>

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.430
I'll leave where you're in the bubble of protection right now.

7
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.080
So we'll see the battlement in the barrage of attacks coming.

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.990
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
So look,
I you,
I think you know how I interview,</v>

9
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:40.700
I really try to just sit down with someone and focus on being present and seeing

10
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.020
where the chips fall,

11
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:44.750
but I am going to conduct this interview a little bit differently than I usually

12
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.670
do.
I've got all your past controversies here and controversial statements and

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.010
things you've said and done and all of those things.

14
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:53.450
And I want to dive into all of those things.

15
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.980
But I thought the first thing we should do is talk a little bit about our

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:02.270
history because I had you on the show way before.
We were independent.

17
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:07.271
We were at aura TV back in March of 2016 it was right at the beginning of the

18
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:14.000
Trump phenomenon and I was seeing this thing on Twitter where I saw all this

19
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.340
support for Trump.
I saw these fun memes.

20
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.100
I saw like there was a real energy behind this thing,

21
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.890
but I could not find anyone,
you know,

22
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:25.010
a verified person on Twitter or a celebrity or an author.

23
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.400
I couldn't find anyone that was supporting Trump.
Then I came across you.

24
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:29.211
I think I tweeted out,

25
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.880
I'm looking for a Trump supporter basically to have on the show.

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240
I came across you,
you are a published author.
You could have the gorilla mindset,

27
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:36.074
which you have right here,

28
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.520
and we sat down and three and a half years ago,

29
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.140
it feels like a different life to me.
Uh,
what,
what you,

30
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.180
what do you remember that guy three and a half year ago,
Mike Cernovich.

31
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.730
<v 2>Well yeah,
that's what's wild.</v>

32
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:53.731
And then people attack you because subsequent controversies arose at some of

33
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:57.510
which,
right.
Then you did things lead.
We're going to address them.

34
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.910
Ruben talked to two years.
How dare he talk us like,
well,

35
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:05.911
the character arc was different and the history of is pretty simple at the time

36
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.190
that I was on your show.
Everybody said Trump all went,
here's why.
Boom,
boom,
boom,

37
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.300
the Poles,
this everything.
And I said,
no,
no,
no.
He's gonna win.
Here's why.

38
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:17.770
Here's the trends,
here's why people support some.
Here's where the puck is going.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
As Wayne Gretzky was safe,
nobody else was saying that.
Nobody could.

40
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.780
Scott Adams being an exception cogently not,
oh I love Trump.
Robyn,
Robyn.
No.

41
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:27.250
The media has made him everything.

42
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.850
Now that I'm saying the media is like catching up to oh,
Trump's nicknames,

43
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.140
maybe we shouldn't amplify them.

44
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.990
A two powerful everything where I talked about branding,

45
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.530
how Trump was essentially the big gorilla and everything else.

46
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.630
So all of that aged well.

47
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.640
Everything that I said was going to happen happened and then people go,

48
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.650
well we don't want to look at the message.

49
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.120
Cernovich is a bad guy persona non grata and there's a number of things to

50
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:55.840
address.
One is a,
I used to troll pretty hard.
Twitter.

51
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.240
It's easy to say Twitter was a different place,
right?
That's,

52
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.960
this is like namaste.
A Twitter was a different place.
If you're James Gunn,

53
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.100
you get to say that if you're James Gunn or a lefty,
you get to just say,

54
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.020
you know what?
Twitter was different.
I was joking.

55
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.790
How dare you weaponize tweets and bad faith because we all know where that

56
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.130
happens.
For some reason,

57
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.120
the lefties are able to get away with past a agregious.

58
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.530
Things were bad jokes or whatever it is.
Where if you sort of step out of that,

59
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.320
you're not allowed to get away.
Yeah.
There's nothing worse than James Gunn.
Yeah,

60
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.540
but,
but,
but,
but,
and this is,

61
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.420
and you say trolling just for the people that really aren't paying attention to

62
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:33.580
the Twitter nonsense or the youtube comment section,

63
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.100
just the average person that checks in on these conversations.

64
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.430
What do you mean by that?
Like,
so there's multiple layers.

65
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.860
There's a trolling merely to provoke and then for the,
for his own provocation,

66
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.940
and that was always sort of nasty.
I never did that stuff.
There was something,

67
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.560
for example called rip trolling,

68
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.810
which is trolls would go to a memorial site of someone's dead person and like

69
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.750
laugh about it,
which is just a moral evil.

70
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.670
And then there's using tactics that generate attention,
massive controversy,

71
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.270
but in a way that amplifies and underlying message.

72
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.200
That's why when people call Trump patrol is the Ursa he's using.

73
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.980
He's using a tactic.
So what I would do is I would use a certain tactic.

74
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.480
There's a,
there's a meanness to it really that everybody's a troll now though,

75
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:23.950
which is ironic because when you watch mad cow that she is a troll.

76
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.610
She's not a nice person.
She's on having open into conversations with people,

77
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.080
everybody now trolls.

78
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:34.081
So I was a troll kind of and then the left all became a troll and Trump won.

79
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540
Then I become nice and now everybody is making people angrier and I realized

80
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:43.390
that just being a nice person is mixed people so angry.

81
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.770
That's why I wanted to have you on,

82
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:48.490
because I had seen an interesting evolution and you've been on sort of the side

83
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:50.650
of the hate machine and then you've been on the side of,

84
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
of taking the hate and all of those things.
So I thought,
all right,

85
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.950
why don't we start with this?
Uh,
right before I had you on,

86
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:00.580
I tweeted this out and I got a,
you know,
a series of people saying that,
um,

87
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:02.860
all right,
and you're a racist and all the usual stuff.

88
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:04.960
And these are verified journalists,
you know,
blue check,

89
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.370
verify journalists and all that.
But somebody,
it doesn't know,

90
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.960
we don't have to mention his name,
but a blue check guy said that your,
uh,

91
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.950
that Reuben is having a serial rapist on the show.
Now that's a,

92
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.670
that's a pretty serious accusation.
Yeah.
They make these massive accusations in.

93
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:22.930
The answer is they attack attack,
attack in any way.

94
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.160
And of course it's so weird accusations and I,
but no,
I'm not,
this is a lie.

95
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.710
The person saying,
have you ever raped any,
no.

96
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.290
Not only have I never not done anything like that,

97
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.680
but the people who make those allegations have made fake videos than me.

98
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.960
Fake videos.
And my daughter,
uh,
threatened to release revenge porn of me.

99
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:44.080
They claim they have a sex tape of me and they're going to release revenge porn,

100
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:48.940
which is actually a sex crime in California.
So the answer to that is no.

101
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.630
Now the question is why do people say that?
And why don't you just sue everybody?

102
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.840
And the answer is,
if you're me and you've been so smeared in the media,

103
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.330
you can't just go sue for defamation.
Because the theory is,
well,

104
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.490
nobody would believe it because they're saying it on Twitter.

105
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.080
But even if they would believe it,

106
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.350
then they wouldn't side with you because of whatever the reputation.

107
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.470
So they say either rapist,
rape,
apologist,

108
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.540
why supremacist and a men's rights activist.

109
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.300
So there's,
there's like a whole,
a whole slew of them.

110
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.850
And it's all very bizarre to me,

111
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.440
especially because I don't do any of that stuff,

112
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:29.750
don't want to do anything like that.
It'll have a very conventional life.

113
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.830
I have a wife,
two kids,
we hang out very kinda chill.

114
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.450
So your wife is Latina and by the way,
if the Persian,
Persian,
Persian,

115
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.260
I thought she was Latina and she's Persian.

116
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.590
I'm also on Islamophobia even though even though half the people that are

117
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:46.190
wedding are Muslim,
you know,
so that's the,
so if you're,

118
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.520
so there's like three layers to this.
There is the layer of view,

119
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.440
the layer of my wife and then my layer,
your layers.

120
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.930
You're trying to kind of figure it out.
My wife's layer is,
she's like mortified.

121
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:58.220
How can they say this about you?

122
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.420
And then there's my layer where I'm just so used to false hoods and outright

123
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.930
lies that I don't even notice them anymore.
People are like,
oh,

124
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:07.730
so and so said that about you.

125
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.720
So you did have rape charges brought was falsely accused of rape in college.

126
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.990
This was in 2001 about the time period of the case took around five years.

127
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.720
Litigate charges were dismissed.
My record was expunged.

128
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.740
The only reason anybody knows about that is because I've spoken about it.

129
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.740
I love how they're like,
oh,
did you,
did you know about this?
Yes,

130
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:30.140
because I talked about it because I wrote about it.

131
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.730
No criminal record license attorney ever.
Literally there.

132
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:35.060
This is what expungement means.

133
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.940
Expungement means it did not exist as a matter of law.

134
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.940
So I could've just said never happened.
Never happened.

135
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.980
I've always spoken about openly though,

136
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:45.770
because that's one reason I'm passionate about due process.

137
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.870
That's one reason I'm passionate about these issues.

138
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:51.610
So there's all these gotcha things that people think they haven't.
I'm like,
no,

139
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.070
no,
no.
You know that because I,
because I said it,
I never even had to say it,

140
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.610
but I believe in living in open and transparent life about it.

141
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.930
Now have I done some bad satire and,
and things that,
absolutely.

142
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.970
So that tweet for example,
can you explain that Dave?
Sure.
So,
so,
well,

143
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
the irony is the date rape tweet was an homage to Susan ash rich who wrote a

144
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:15.020
book called real rape.

145
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.290
And the thesis of the book is that all rape is rape is either rape or not rape.

146
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.370
And if you create this category of Eh,

147
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:28.490
is it or isn't it mean to develop fire?
Yeah,

148
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.580
see the rate for it's not,
you don't like if I murdered right here,

149
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:34.780
I wouldn't say I was,
you know,
Ruben murdered or acquaintance murdered.

150
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.361
You would just said,
well,

151
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:39.050
you were just murdered and the so when they call and I go,
no,
no,
no,

152
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.660
actually that's,
that's it.
Susan Nash thing.
This is a,

153
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.320
a second wave feminist argument,
which is you need to treat.

154
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.050
This is the problem with societies.
You need to treat it very seriously.

155
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.680
Like if we were walking outside and we saw somebody raped,

156
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.890
we would like take a baseball bat to the guy said nobody would be like,
oh,

157
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.510
rape apology,
you Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
You just,
you've just,

158
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.780
everybody knows what they would do.
But that said there,

159
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.820
now it's become a world where everybody's just tosses it around.
Oh,
that was ray.

160
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:07.310
If that was raped,
well this thing happened that was rape.

161
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.530
There's now even a thing that regret is rape.

162
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.780
Because if you feel bad the next day,

163
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.810
then you must not have had affirmative consent the night before.

164
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.520
So this is where,
this is where it's actually going.
Now my mistake is,
well,

165
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.600
number number of things.

166
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.650
One is when you have 40 Twitter followers and everybody knows that you're

167
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:29.190
talking about a specific article,
then people are like,
oh yeah,
they get it.

168
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.490
And then you become like famous or whatever.

169
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.450
And then people pretend that there wasn't that context to it.
But again,

170
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.430
this only happens if you're conservative.
A tree on the right.

171
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.630
If you're on the left,
you can say,
I'm James Gunn and he touches children.
Oh,
lol.

172
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.810
And Cernovich found these tweets.
How dare he's weaponizing bad faith.

173
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.150
So the answer to that is,
uh,
those tweets,
they're just not very smart.

174
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:54.030
They haven't actually read the literature.
They should go read since Nash Rich.

175
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.090
Now that said,
uh,
and I've learned this,

176
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.820
there's a lot of people been through some shit,
man.
Like I fat,

177
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.370
shame people feel bad about that.
Um,

178
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:05.490
I watched this video by Boogie and he talked about what fat shaming did to him.

179
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.040
So I'm like,
I fashion people as real shitty.

180
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.050
There are people reading me private and rate,
you know,

181
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.200
it's not something to be Glib about.
It's not something to joke about.

182
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.260
How much of that do you think?
And we've all been guilty of this,

183
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:18.360
so I do not sit here as holier than now.

184
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:23.010
Have I engaged in some of this type of stuff?
Sure.
Um,
I'd really try not to.

185
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.910
And then sometimes just the nature of the evil nature of Twitter just drags you

186
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:27.960
into it one way or another.

187
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.010
How much of what you were doing though was calculated just just so that you

188
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:36.030
could get followers so that you could get whatever your message is out there.

189
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.780
Well,
that stuff wasn't,
um,
that was just 40 people.

190
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.781
Everybody knows you're providing Meta commentary about an article that said,

191
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:48.150
you can judge me.
There are people who can judge me.
You can judge me.

192
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.820
Maybe Sam Harris can.
So you've got after Sam a couple of times.
Pretty hard.
Yeah.

193
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:58.200
But,
but so,
okay,
Sam,
I've gone after hard,
but not in fairly,

194
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:02.460
which is a difference.
Um,
because he,

195
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.650
he has this very,
uh,
dismissive article or attitude towards Trump's supporters.

196
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.600
And he was wrong about it.
But I don't go after Sam.
I'm nice to say I'm,

197
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:15.420
I'm nice to Ben.
There's enough people going after these guys,

198
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.900
I guess is the way I look at it.
I try not to go after anybody really.

199
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.380
I don't even want to tag people into tweets,
but you,

200
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.730
you could judge me.
Um,
I think you've had Harmeet on here.

201
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.050
She's like a Republican.
We have good judgment.
She can judge me if she,
you know,

202
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:32.940
she,
there's a few people who can,

203
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.800
but the idea that these people at buzzfeed who say,
kill all white men,

204
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:40.470
let's kill white people.
Have you killed a white person?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

205
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:43.050
They can't judge me.
So what frustrates them as,

206
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:46.200
I won't apologize for them ever for anything.
They can't.

207
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:47.850
There are a few people who can judge me.

208
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.510
They're certainly not on the crown though.
So,
so what do we do?

209
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.040
Regardless of what your

210
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.791
<v 1>past is,</v>

211
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:59.680
what do we do about this set of people that is this blue check set of Buzzfeed,

212
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.820
vox people that we know we're watching this right now waiting for you to screw

213
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.630
up one word or meet a pause in a weird way or get a glimmer in my eye,

214
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.710
like just any crazy things so they can selectively edited so they can just try

215
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:12.490
it as raise and they're,

216
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.580
what people need to understand is there's a business behind this and you're also

217
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:19.240
acknowledging that some of your business partook in some of these things.

218
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.060
<v 2>Well,
I didn't do it for business.
I did to help Trump win.</v>

219
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.000
So when I was trolling people like Sam and others,
the,

220
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.910
so the idea behind like salmon sandwich,
you're watching,
um,
I'm,
I'm apologize.

221
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.270
Uh,
but that sincere,
that's the globe.
See,

222
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:38.020
this is one thing I was thinking about today when we drive is we live in kind of

223
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:42.100
like the Glib Age,
which is,
oh,
so sorry.
It's like,
no,
no,
no.
Like you're here.

224
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.650
If you're an asshole to person.
Sam had the credibility,

225
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:48.070
you apologize to someone for something a guest sat in when Sam said that I

226
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:51.940
thought,
son of a bitch,
you know,
so I publicly apologized.
I said,
you know what,

227
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.180
this you did the right thing,
so I'll do the right thing.
But when you're,

228
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:55.960
I think that

229
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.510
<v 1>Chili is,
when I read this is probably about six or eight months ago,</v>

230
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.930
and that's when I finally had reached out to you after about two years of not

231
00:13:01.931 --> 00:13:02.950
speaking because I thought,

232
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:06.030
here's someone you're trying to acknowledge some of these things,
uh,

233
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.150
some of your past behavior.
And I thought,
we knew we want to destroy everybody.

234
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:13.000
We don't want it to give anyone a chance to come back from the brink.

235
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.530
And that I thought that was

236
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.520
<v 2>commendable.
Well,
and that's what's interesting is they,
and this is the,</v>

237
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.870
the reason that they're all freaking out is there are no longer,

238
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:24.670
they've lost gatekeeper status.
And this is,

239
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.210
this was talked about in the one I did with you two and a half years ago.

240
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.440
And now their methodology has changed where they go now to the tech companies in

241
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:35.530
Christ.
So,
so for example,
they're crying.
There's this girl,

242
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:39.700
so she's 14 she's got the,
they're gone,
you know,
so used to me,

243
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.730
they'd write a hit piece of Malaga,
Youtube.
How do you allow us person on there?

244
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:45.820
So here's my answer at all the blue checks.
I know they're watching all of you.

245
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.360
I'm putting,
I'm talking all of you right now.
You all know what Vic Berger did.

246
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.610
You know we had to do fake videos about my wife and daughter.
Fact,

247
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.070
you know that he's edited multiple videos about my daughter fat.

248
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.370
You know the emails she sent me,
the threats,
you know that I've gone to police.

249
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.480
You've seen the police reports.

250
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.740
So Paul about this is like some clown verifying climbs were there watching.

251
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.880
He calls me.
All right.
And Yeah,

252
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.270
this is my message to that he made fake videos about my wife and daughter.

253
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.080
There is a thousand fake videos of me where if I come on here and I said,

254
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:13.810
you know Dave,
they called me a murderer.
Yes,
I like to murder.

255
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.810
I know that'll end up in a soundboard and five years from now,

256
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:18.160
some boomers can be like,
oh wow,

257
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.250
I heard this audio where you said you'd like to murder people.
You know,

258
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.960
I don't care.
That's the game.

259
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.290
But going out to someone's wife and daughter beyond the Pale,

260
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.600
they all know about it.
Cause I emailed them and everything.

261
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.870
They won't write about it.
But then the go Dave Rubin,
this and that,

262
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.620
so they can show some integrity and they're all watching you write about that.

263
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:39.400
Say,
Hey Cernovich's of asshole.
He's a jerk.
He's a troll.
He's a bad guy.

264
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.140
You should never,
never make a fake video about an 18 month old girl.

265
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.130
My daughter was a time,

266
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.000
you should never make a fake video about a wife tag in child protective
services.

267
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.950
Never.
But they can't.
So they'll say,
demonically go,

268
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.350
Dave Rubin gives Cernovich's redemption article.

269
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.170
Reuben lets them come in and apologize,

270
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.740
but he didn't bring up these other 15 things and we'll just pretend that Vic

271
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.550
Berger hasn't tried to make his Cernovich's wiffle living hell right.

272
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.530
So screw all these people.
Well that's,
that's the thing is that the game,

273
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:09.380
no matter how many of these things I read off to you and no matter what mia

274
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:12.260
culpa you do or don't do that they never stopped.
I mean,

275
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:13.910
if I've learned anything in the last couple of years,

276
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:17.000
it's that they never stopped.
They just ratchet up every time.
But we,
let's,

277
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.370
let's back up to this 14 year old girl for a second.
Cause I don't know,

278
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:21.610
a lot of people knows what,
what's her name again or what's the Youtube Channel?

279
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.020
Not even sure.
Actually I,
her name was,
I saw for Sophie,
something like that.

280
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.940
So I saw this video.

281
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:29.900
It's a 14 year old girl and she does a really interesting biting,

282
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:33.290
sort of red pilling social commentary video.

283
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.320
This guy from buzzfeed decides to go after her and her channel is now banned or

284
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:43.100
suspended is,
I don't know if it's Spanish.
So she's one shackle that,
yeah.
Um,

285
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:47.510
so you've got buzzfeed going after kids,
literally for kids,

286
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:51.230
for satire.
The video was taken down.
It had something like 800,000 views.

287
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.550
But the guy who went after her,

288
00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.590
who of course has gone after me before the rest of it.

289
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.950
And this is a buzzfeed verified guy.
Um,
he has a tweet,

290
00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:59.360
I think you just referenced it saying,

291
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:01.760
kill all white people on your way to work today or something to that effect.

292
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:05.600
I mean,
now I have no doubt that he's joking,
right?
But it's like,

293
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.370
what rules are you guys playing by him?

294
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:11.600
Why is it that some people get protection and lauded for these things and some

295
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:12.650
people get destroyed by them?

296
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.110
And I'm glad you bring up this reporter and I won't name them because then

297
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:18.920
you're inciting harassment.
They'll go,
no,
they're inciting and he's nobody.

298
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:22.940
He's irrelevant other than he's trying to gain relevance by Baidu playing in a

299
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:26.600
really bad game,
I think.
Yeah.
But I'll tell you,
revealing story.
Uh,

300
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.630
I held an event in New York night for freedom 2008 teen and a number of bus

301
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:34.490
people.
People were there,
Chelsea manning was there.
So it became a story.

302
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:36.020
How dare Chelsea,
Mandy come to my story.

303
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.160
Even though everyone has nice to her and [inaudible] 30 year old white male was

304
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:44.030
arrested for almost beating a Jewish man to death.
He was walking home.
No,

305
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.450
no mainstream coverage of that.
They came to the event,
the same people who go,

306
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:51.380
oh yeah,
you're Dave Rubin is a gateway to radicalization,
blah,
blah.
It's like,

307
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:55.070
okay,
why?
Why don't they report it in Tiva?
Right?
Here's my,
here's this is,

308
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.310
I think that this is why they're losing trust.
If I read an article,

309
00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.930
it says Cernovich is a piece of shit,

310
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.040
but so as Vic Berger and you should never go after kids and Antifa violence is

311
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.970
wrong,
I'd be like,
wow,
okay.
You know,
what are you gonna do?
Well,
we're all flawed,

312
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.870
but when I read these articles Cernovich Dis,
oh,
but by the way,

313
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:15.290
Cernovich when after James Gunn,
this was,
this was I think revealing.

314
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.200
My wife found this quite amusing as she goes,
Babe,

315
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.880
all these articles saying that you found James guns tweets and they're saying

316
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.310
he's choking and then they're saying,
but look at Cernovich's tweets.

317
00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:28.670
But our tweets jokes are they sat tire or they need to be taken literally.

318
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.860
And the answer is there is no rule in anybody with a brain knows that the left

319
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:36.770
doesn't care.
They don't,
they're not nice.
They're not nice to people.

320
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.000
They don't call out their own side.
There's Chris Cuomo praises and Tifo.

321
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:45.080
We like Antifa Antifa beat up three marines in Philadelphia,
no media coverage.

322
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.640
The Guy who ran the smash racism,

323
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:51.641
d c Twitter Account Antifa do you see is being charged with hey crimes because

324
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:56.730
he called the Hispanic Marine,
uh,
w e t Bac k is facing.
Hey,

325
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.290
where's the coverage of that buzzfeed?

326
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.080
Where are you guys talking about how bright,
nowhere.

327
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.610
The shooter last week in Colorado,

328
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:05.910
I believe was a trans guy who was anti Trump supporter,
right?

329
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:08.750
Somehow that story went away.
Really goes right.
Real quick.
Skull,

330
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.860
the scalies shooting,
nobody says,
oh,
you know,

331
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.580
w who is radicalizing the far left.
They just,

332
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:18.330
let's pretend it didn't happen and we'll put,

333
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.950
we'll pretend that you're radicalizing people though,

334
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:23.310
even though the irony of this is that if anything,

335
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.210
you've D radicalized people because you've made people,

336
00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.260
you and a few other people,

337
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.470
and this is why they hate the IDW or whatever it's called because you showing

338
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:32.520
people,
look,
you don't have to,

339
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:35.490
you're not calling this hug Elian thing where you're either a far left,

340
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.210
median accurate,

341
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.080
just the far right calling people Cox all day on Twitter or whatever hey is,

342
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.240
you know,
there's a little bit of room in between here.
Well,

343
00:18:42.241 --> 00:18:45.630
that's the thing that I've realized is so bizarre.
All I think I've actually,

344
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.480
you look,
I've,
I've talked about the difference between leftism in liberalism.

345
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:49.020
Sure.

346
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.170
But I think what I did that they really hate is that I've shown that you can be

347
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:56.820
conservative or lean a little.
Right.
And that doesn't mean you're a bigot.

348
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.880
And that's a huge,
no,
no for these guys.
So do you think,

349
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.310
do you think that your tactics are just,
we're,

350
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.530
let's say just a reaction to their tactics that if they had behaved,

351
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.930
if they behave differently or if the media hadn't been so awful leading up to

352
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:14.780
Trump that you would have behaved differently or,

353
00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:16.470
or maybe not even been relevant?

354
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:18.540
Because then when I had been looking for a Trump supporter,

355
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.360
how would I have ever found you?
So great question.

356
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:25.170
Why it is Angela Nagel got in trouble because she wrote a book called kill the

357
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:29.550
normies and kill it.
This is like a very online kind of thing,

358
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:33.420
but the idea was people like me are essentially right wing social justice

359
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:36.090
warriors.
So the left would do call out culture.
Oh,

360
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:39.690
Dave Rubin made this joke in 2015 can you believe we've got to cancel them?

361
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.033
And then people like,

362
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.980
and then there are the traditional conservatives who were like,
oh gasp,

363
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.980
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair.
The double standards.

364
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:49.680
And then there are people like,
okay,
I'm going to go through your tweets.

365
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.370
Let's find your,
let's play [inaudible].
This is how it's going to be.

366
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.600
Let's do this.

367
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.600
And then people like that leads to mutually assured destruction though.

368
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.840
So like when you were going after gun and you can explain it a little bit more,

369
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:03.480
like was like when I saw you doing it,

370
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:06.930
my feeling was these are obviously jokes,
they're all kind of gross.

371
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.200
We've all made bad jokes and this is the purpose of jokes,
right?

372
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:12.240
You want to get as close to that line as possible,

373
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.360
but sometimes when you're doing it,
you're going to trip over that line.
Um,

374
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.840
but did you have any sense of like,
if I keep ramping this up,

375
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.200
they will keep ramping this up and then what does that actually lead to?

376
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.490
Will gun is an,

377
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.090
is an unusual case because I have reason to believe that some of his stuff is

378
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:30.120
pretty bad.
The worst one was Bieber when he was 16.

379
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.330
I don't want to get in the weeds of that,
but people can read the tweets.

380
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.850
But there,
there is a sense of,

381
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.350
and we see this now with Rashida to lab and um,
um,

382
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.340
congresswoman Omar and them as the,

383
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.000
the left can't withstand the scrutiny that you and I take for granted.

384
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.530
We sit down,
we already know right away,
okay shit storm.

385
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:49.660
They're going to go after Dave.
Here's what they're going to say.

386
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:52.540
They're going to clip this or in a clip that we already know this.

387
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:55.240
You take it for granted,
you take it for granted.
But the,

388
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:58.990
these people on the left to go up and say Israel is hypnotized the world.

389
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.100
And like nothing happens.
The issue with James Gunn,
I always says,

390
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.580
why didn't he delete his tweets?
You know why he didn't have to?

391
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.790
Because nobody on the left was ever going to find his tweets.
Or if they did,

392
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:11.860
they weren't gonna do anything with them.
So Do you think Rosanna

393
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.140
<v 1>bar then is the best example of the double?
Exactly.</v>

394
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.050
No one in their right mind thinks that Roseanne Barr's are racist.

395
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.810
Her show was anti racist.
It was cutting edge.

396
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.410
It made working class people look decent,
white working class people,

397
00:21:23.411 --> 00:21:27.970
which people now mock relentlessly.
Um,
and,
and I know her,

398
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:31.630
I mean this woman is not,
she had the first gay kiss ever on television was her,

399
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.450
I mean the idea that she's a racist or homophobic xenophobe or any of these

400
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:38.050
things,
but she had one bad tweet and I do believe her,
by the way,

401
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.070
that she didn't know she was pregnant.
I didn't even know she was.

402
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.930
I do believe that.
But regardless,

403
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.590
you could say it was one really stupid tweet and she's had many other stupid

404
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:51.430
tweets.
But the point is she lost the number one sit.
Come on television.

405
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.293
This is just last year.

406
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.040
<v 2>Hold that from syndication.
Yeah,
it wasn't,
yeah.
Yeah.</v>

407
00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:57.170
So if you want to talk about overreaction,

408
00:21:57.171 --> 00:22:00.590
the Dukes of Hazzard was pulled out a syndication because the generally had a

409
00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:02.840
rebel flag on it,
which they weren't backing.
I mean,

410
00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:07.430
the purpose of those were the good guys.
Yeah.
And right,

411
00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:11.570
so they,
the overreaction.
So Roseanne and her show gets,
she gets fired,

412
00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:12.740
pulled from syndication.

413
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.760
But then if a made man of the left says stuff way worse.

414
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.870
[inaudible] they attack the messenger,
they go after me.
My favorite article was,

415
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.300
and,
and this,
this kills them.
There's um,

416
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.080
there's a guy at CNN and his job is to dig up old tweets,

417
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:30.380
the people and he digs up old tweets.
He gets a lot of people fired and whatever.

418
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:35.240
That's the game now.
He was gonna fall special place in hell.
He was,

419
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.810
he was profiled in the Washington Post.
Great Guy.
He's the guy,

420
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.970
he'll never let you forget your past.

421
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.970
But then when the James Gunn thing happened in Washington Post said,
oh,

422
00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:47.420
Cernovich is used a bad faith actor.
I like,
well,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

423
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:49.340
I mean our old tweets off limits or aren't,

424
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.670
are old comments off of them and said,
our tweets literal or they jokes,

425
00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:57.570
are there satire or there or is there even redemption?
And the,

426
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.660
the issue that they have with me,

427
00:22:59.661 --> 00:23:02.060
the left does is I will never apologize to them.

428
00:23:02.061 --> 00:23:05.360
There's one tweet I will apologize for.
I would apologize.

429
00:23:05.361 --> 00:23:07.610
I made a Glib remark about Trayvon Martin being shot.

430
00:23:07.611 --> 00:23:10.400
I would apologize to his mom,
but if you're going to be,

431
00:23:10.401 --> 00:23:13.040
if I and I and I sincerely would actually,
I mean you lose a child and,

432
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:17.840
and joking about it,
you know,
that's an issue that I've had to work on.

433
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.950
But this vicarious outrage,
I'm offended on behalf of all these people.
No,

434
00:23:21.951 --> 00:23:23.180
I'm not going to apologize.

435
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:26.570
These people I'm going to and I'm going to just going to keep finding more stuff

436
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:31.010
that they said.
And now again,
I'm like Rashida till APP.

437
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.830
I'll make the devil's advocate case for her and then I'll make the the case for

438
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:36.740
her.
I can do both.
Right?

439
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.450
The devil's advocate case against her as she used holocausts and comic feeling

440
00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:42.560
in the same line.
This is bad.

441
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.030
The case for her is that she was saying,
you know what,

442
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:50.030
I know my ancestors died so that Jews can move to Palestine.

443
00:23:50.031 --> 00:23:53.910
And that makes me feel pretty good about myself.
Now this a historical component,

444
00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:58.550
is that true?
No.
No,
but I can,
but again,
you know,
I'm a lawyer.
I can flip it,

445
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:01.150
right?
I can do both sides and yeah,

446
00:24:01.151 --> 00:24:03.790
it's a historical and there there's recently doubted.

447
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.650
But if you are conservative,
that's,

448
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.180
they'd call everybody to disavow Pelosi's defending her.
So,
so that's the part,

449
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:13.160
I mean,
we're all over the place here,
but that's the part,
I mean,

450
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:15.260
I even tweeted that,
I think it was this morning or maybe yesterday,

451
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:20.261
it's like she lied about what the nature of 1948 war was.

452
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:24.740
And all of those things use the holidays in the worst sort of sense and are all,

453
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:29.510
I didn't,
it's not about piling on hurts.
Where is any decent Democrat ever.

454
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:34.160
The right always has to,
uh,
has to get rid of these guys and that's,
that's good.

455
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:38.930
Self policing is good,
but it seems that the left never has to do it.
And,

456
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.920
and that then I have this weird sympathy when people like you sometimes step

457
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:46.370
over a line.
I'm like,
well,
it's the only way to ever get anything done.

458
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.510
It may not be my tactic.
And,
and I sort of saw this with Milo years ago.

459
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:55.340
It was like I can understand his over the top ridiculousness because he's sort

460
00:24:55.341 --> 00:25:00.341
of blowing things up so that maybe someone a little calmer like me could come in

461
00:25:00.381 --> 00:25:02.400
and try to rebuild things.
And it's just,

462
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.660
it's just we all operate in different tactics.
Well,
yeah,

463
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:08.840
and the issue is a lot of people like I've evolved,

464
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.320
they know the Pizza Gate Post Pizza,
gay guy,
so I want to talk about this.

465
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:14.090
That's why they keep bringing up pizza gate,
right?

466
00:25:14.091 --> 00:25:15.830
Because what have I done lately?

467
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:19.710
There was actually a really funny video for media matters where they go the,

468
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.160
the gist of it was Cernovich is being nice but don't let,

469
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.730
don't forget all these bad things he said.
But then a couple of the clips,

470
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:29.630
and this shows how people,
things get chopped up.
I did one video where I said,

471
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:32.960
you know what,
there's all this,
because I was part of the man's Internet,

472
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.060
whatever people call it,
the manosphere,
whatever it was.
And I,

473
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.410
I broke from that a long time ago,

474
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:41.270
but there was a racial element came in and I was like,
look,
you know,

475
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.580
I won't have any tolerance since racial element.
And I was like,

476
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:45.440
here's what people are saying about black guys on Twitter.

477
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.310
And then I repeated what I said and then that gets chopped up into a video.

478
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.510
Oh Cernovich you drop it in bombs.
No I wasn't calling anyone.
I was saying,
Hey,

479
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:56.360
you know,
I'm not having any tolerance for this kind of stuff.

480
00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.140
Cause like our guys already have enough drama.
Yeah,
they did this all the time.

481
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.940
I mean literally an hour ago,

482
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:06.800
some blue check I was going after me because years ago on a livestream I years

483
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:09.470
ago when the old was just coming to fruition,
whatever that is.

484
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.720
I said as a me making joke machine,
there's something funny going on here,

485
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.190
but the previous sentence,
no,
the racists are bad,
the bigots are bad.

486
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:20.150
All of those things.
So what are they?

487
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.060
Of course daily beast didn't run that piece.
And then this guy is quoting,

488
00:26:23.061 --> 00:26:26.510
it's like every freaking time and that's what they do.

489
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.850
And so the pizzagate thing is interest in for a number reasons.

490
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.400
One is that just do one oh one do pizza,
gay.

491
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.380
How the hell did this thing on the radar?
I actually did not track it that much.

492
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:38.330
I remember thinking at the time,
I was like,

493
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.440
I only have a certain bandwidth for enough Twitter craziness and I just kind of

494
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:45.960
let that one be.
I got bullied into talking about it.
So there were,
there was a,

495
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:51.050
a Podesta emails that wikileaks and there was a bunch of emails that don't even

496
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:54.570
make sense.
So there was one for example that said,

497
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.050
you left a handkerchief at your house.
There was a map on it,

498
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.590
something pizza related.
Now I don't who,

499
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.610
who would leave a Napkin at your house and somebody is going to email you.

500
00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:07.710
You left a Napkin at my house,
you want me to mail it to you?

501
00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.520
And so it was a little weird,
you know,
could have meant nothing,

502
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.110
could have been vague,
but then people thought,
oh,

503
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.910
that must mean pedestrians involved in something.

504
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.210
But I never said anything about John Pedesta.
Right.
I just said,
well,
yeah,

505
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:19.470
I mean there's all this stuff happening.

506
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.990
There's all these attempts to normalize pedophilia.

507
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.560
You can find articles in salon where they said pedophilia is a disorder,

508
00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:27.330
not a crime.
There was an article,

509
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.150
and I'm not going to quote it because it would say it,
but the person wrote,

510
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.530
he's a pedophile,
not a monster that was in salon.
So I was like,
look dude,

511
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:36.300
there's all these efforts to normalize pedophilia.

512
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.030
I talked about the Jimmy's developing out of what the BBC,

513
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:40.200
I talked about Jeff Epstein,

514
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.510
I talked about all these great deals people are getting,

515
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.310
and then I used the Hashtag pizza gate.

516
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.920
So that becomes Cernovich said comet pizza.

517
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.940
And I said,
I never said comet pizza did anything.
So what they did,

518
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:57.840
you actually started the Hashtag?
No,
no,
no.
The hats or no,
no,
no.

519
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:01.560
The hashtag was already started way before me and I just thought,
oh,

520
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:04.350
this is a hash either talking about pedophilia and you know,

521
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.390
Jeffrey Epstein and whatnot,
which by the way,

522
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:09.570
I'm in precedent setting litigation about freedom of the press involving Jeffrey

523
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.030
Epstein,
Miami Herald reported on it.
They're in the same case as me.

524
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.050
So Cernovich she's in a case with the Miami Herald seeking records about Jeff

525
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.310
Epstein.
So what they did was they,
they,
if they're honest,
here's what they said,

526
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.350
and this is true.
They'll say,
you know,

527
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:25.740
you amplified a Hashtag and he should've been more careful and you should have

528
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:28.320
paid attention.
And the answer that is,
yeah.
Should have.
You're right.

529
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:31.980
That was for me like,
oh,
okay,
okay,
we gotta,
we gotta be a little more careful.

530
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.000
But the flip side is,
I never said anything about comet pizza.
And in fact,

531
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.900
this same guy who made fake videos and my wife made a video where I say comet

532
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:44.430
pizza,
but only because I was talking about James O'keefe video where blah,
blah,

533
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:46.620
blah,
blah,
blah.
We're going way into the weeds.

534
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:50.010
But it's important to lay out some of this because the,
because part of,

535
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:53.850
I think what's happening here is the inability for mainstream,
whatever that is,

536
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:57.570
the increasing layer of mainstream that's just shedding relentlessly by their

537
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:01.950
own doing.
It's their inability to deal with any of the outsiders.
So,

538
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.530
I mean it's the way they respond to things that I do.

539
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:08.910
It's like they can't understand that people might have a different take on

540
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:13.911
internet culture or on just outsider culture or any of the trolling Romy making.

541
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:17.070
They just can't piece it all together.
Well,

542
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:19.830
they can't piece it all together there.
They don't want to do nuance.

543
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.300
So there's a number of pressures.

544
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:25.470
And I went into this with hoax hoax that my movies started off with.
I was,

545
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.800
I become much less conspiratorial.
The more I've learned about these people.

546
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.370
And the biggest problem in media,
well not the biggest,

547
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:36.500
but one of the big problems is cable news.
It's the same 10 people,
oh,

548
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.400
today we're gonna talk about Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

549
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.380
Tomorrow we're going to talk about banking and tariffs on China.

550
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.340
Are you out of your mind?

551
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.330
How can some 28 year old with a BA in anything know that?

552
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.050
Why don't you bring actual experts on?
And they all talk about everything.

553
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.150
So then when they go pizza gate,
they're like,
hey,
Google it.

554
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:55.540
Give me the five minute summary.
Oh,
pizza gate.
Cernovich sorry,
repeat the gate.

555
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.740
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
the end.

556
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.370
And they don't ever get in the weeds of any kind of surgery for no expertise.

557
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:02.920
So then you,
so for,
so for example,
oh,

558
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:06.850
tariffs are are bad now apparently they're saying Trump was gonna win,

559
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:08.260
the market was gonna crash.
I was like,
well no,

560
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.160
the market is at record highs and they so they,
they all,

561
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:15.520
rather than having actual experts on to discuss the issues,

562
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.970
then they just talk like they're experts on everything.

563
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.950
It's amazing to think about.
Right?
Yeah.

564
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.020
Well everyone on Twitter is an expert about anything.
Well,
I try to,

565
00:30:24.021 --> 00:30:27.520
if you don't declare centrifuges,
I don't,
but,
but you don't try to do that.

566
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.790
I don't try to do that.
Like if you asked me something out of my comfort zone,

567
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:33.370
I would say,
well I kind of have a take on that,
but not really.

568
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.990
And when I came on,
and this is them,

569
00:30:34.991 --> 00:30:37.630
this is kind of segways into you having experts on your show.

570
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.660
I'm an expert on Trump,
meme,
culture,
persuasion,
the Internet,
you name,

571
00:30:41.661 --> 00:30:46.600
but I'm an expert on it in terms of mass human psychology trends where things

572
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:49.270
are going.
So then you go,
well,
I mean I can't know everything.

573
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:51.880
I'll have this guy on here.
Oh,
he's got baggage.

574
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:55.050
And that baggage becomes your baggage.
Yeah.
When did

575
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.580
<v 1>just such intellectual hostage taking,
I mean that's the thing.
So wait,
let's,</v>

576
00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.620
let's really dive into something here.
So about a year ago,

577
00:31:00.621 --> 00:31:01.311
I think it was a year ago,

578
00:31:01.311 --> 00:31:05.470
last week was when that big renegades of the intellectual dark web,

579
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.270
a piece came out in the New York Times.
And the piece,

580
00:31:08.271 --> 00:31:11.190
Barry Weiss wrote the piece.
And I know Barry gets a ton of hate online and I've,

581
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.140
I've sort of mixed feelings about her,
but whatever it is,
um,

582
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.680
in the piece she sort of threw me and rogue and under the bus because she said,

583
00:31:18.681 --> 00:31:22.980
if you talk to people like Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones,
now sir,
uh,

584
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.520
Jones had been on Rogan show a bunch of times and he's been on since,

585
00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:26.121
and here you are.

586
00:31:26.121 --> 00:31:30.890
And you had been on my show that you're either stupid or cynical.
Um,

587
00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.430
now I didn't like the line because to me it's like Joe and I are our

588
00:31:34.431 --> 00:31:36.650
interviewers,
at least when we're doing our shows.

589
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.440
And it's like you're going to have to talk to people outside of your box.

590
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:42.950
I'm not even,
I'm not even referencing you here.
You talk to all sorts of people.

591
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:45.290
That's what an interviewer does.
Right?
Um,

592
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.960
but she said you'd have to be stupid or cynical to talk to those people.

593
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:52.910
And I was wondering,
uh,
you're,
you're a source for all sorts of people.

594
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.030
I'm guessing probably the New York Times and all sorts of different papers and

595
00:31:56.031 --> 00:31:58.490
all sorts of things.
Now we happen to be doing this publicly,

596
00:31:58.491 --> 00:31:59.780
so all the haters can watch in.

597
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:02.660
Anyone can judge whatever they want about anything we say.
Um,

598
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.620
but I suspect you probably talked to all sorts of reporters and all sorts of

599
00:32:06.621 --> 00:32:09.470
things and it just goes under the radar and that's why it's acceptable for those

600
00:32:09.471 --> 00:32:12.120
people.
Am I completely off base here?
Cernovich

601
00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.920
<v 2>well,
sometimes I feel like Rodney Dangerfield,
no respect.
I can't get no respect.</v>

602
00:32:15.921 --> 00:32:16.460
Right.

603
00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.480
It's like hit me for the things I said and done that are wrong pit before him,

604
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.930
but she can't deny.
I made a member of Congress,

605
00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.210
John Conyers design through my reporting,

606
00:32:26.211 --> 00:32:28.520
which I handed off to to meet the Alice Ivan handed.

607
00:32:28.521 --> 00:32:31.530
All were not happy about that.
No speed had to credit you for that.
Yeah,

608
00:32:31.531 --> 00:32:36.530
they had to and I've handed off all kinds of stories to people in all kinds of

609
00:32:36.531 --> 00:32:38.040
publications and I'm not gonna out him,

610
00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:42.320
but we'll just say the prestigious publications in the country have run stories

611
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:46.550
where I sourced it or I hand deliver them something because me,
I just,

612
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.190
I took a pivot and I wanted to move under the radar a little bit.

613
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.700
So I'm not asking you,
obviously the boys source or a,
or you are the source,

614
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:54.800
but to blow a connection other than to say,

615
00:32:54.801 --> 00:32:58.070
I think it's just worth noting because that line sort of stuck out of that

616
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.430
article and it's like,
well you guys just do it on the DL,

617
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:04.450
you're all doing it on the DL and then you think you're holier than thou and,

618
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.720
and uh,
well that it's personal to me.
So,
well it is,
and not only that,

619
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:13.340
but the question I always have for people like her is,
and again,

620
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:14.900
she gets a lot of hate and everything else.

621
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:17.360
I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't want to pile on her.
She gets,

622
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.700
she gets a ton of come to that position of love.

623
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.760
If I were already completely cynical and jaded,
I would say,
well,
you know,

624
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.360
Ms. Wise,
um,
I've,

625
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.460
I made a member of Congress is on how many reporters and their entire career can

626
00:33:28.461 --> 00:33:33.190
say I uncovered a secret sexual harassment settlement involving a very powerful

627
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.440
mumbler congress.
My reporting led to him resigning.
How many people can say that?

628
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.530
How many people can say they wrote a book on mindset too.
Um,

629
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.110
we're at 100,000 copies,
over a hundred thousand copies sold.

630
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:44.450
Most books don't even sell it.
How many people can say that?

631
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.350
How many people can say,
I broke the Susan Rice unmasking story,
massive stories.

632
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:52.030
Hr,
McMaster,
the,
at the time,
national security advisor,

633
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.220
United States of America held meetings about me because he was feared.

634
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:56.001
He was obsessed with me.

635
00:33:56.001 --> 00:34:00.020
Foreign policy even called me the object of his obsession say,

636
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:03.470
hate me or love me.
How many people can say in a career that they've done,

637
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:07.940
even one of these things that I've done.
So who is serious and who isn't?
Right.

638
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.120
Do you think part of everything we've talked about so far is just that as you

639
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:15.770
mature in a career,
one way or another,

640
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:19.310
that tactics change when you become,

641
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.050
hopefully you become a better person.
Um,
obviously with me,
even things like,

642
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.720
you know,
there was like Spurg out.
I'd be like,
oh,
this person is burning out.

643
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:30.140
I had a couple of miles back,
hey,
you know,
my son has autism.
And I was like,
yeah,

644
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:33.020
I just felt kind of bad about it.
Actually don't even know what that means.
Okay.

645
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:34.730
Well it's,
um,

646
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:39.731
when people get a little angry and jittery and maybe throw a temper tantrum or

647
00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:44.560
whatever and it's a,
it's like,
you know,
it was,
yeah,
I didn't even know it was,

648
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.540
I was like,
okay,
so I don't say the r word ret rd.
I don't say that anymore.

649
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:48.560
I just,
well,
I don't know.

650
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:51.410
People read me and their kids are having developmental problems.

651
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.650
Why would I make them feel shitty?
You know,
why?

652
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.970
Why would I make them feel like they want to just come here?

653
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.710
Why would I just make them feel shitty?

654
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:03.040
And that's the irony of the arguments to know platform people is you become

655
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.410
normalized as you become more whatever famous because you get more inputs now.

656
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:13.310
It isn't just you and 50 people knuckleheads seeing who can be the most

657
00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:16.790
offensive and you're like,
wow,
why do I want to fashion?
And people,
I,
you know,

658
00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.600
there's probably somebody fat reading me right now and maybe I should try to try

659
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:24.080
to think of a way to,
to lift their mood and Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
And then of course,

660
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.330
you know,
things that I didn't take seriously before.

661
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:28.850
I know realize real prompt people would be like three years ago,
you know,

662
00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:30.380
antisemitism,
prominent American.
I'm like,

663
00:35:30.381 --> 00:35:32.960
well people call me an ass am I don't even talk about this stuff.
I don't even,

664
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.940
that's not even my lane,
you know,

665
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:38.100
if you want to call me massage and it's just like,
well there's a to be had,

666
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.820
but if you're calling me like an Islamophobia for an anti Semite,
it's like,
no,

667
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:45.420
no,
we're just not even in the same ballpark here.
But then,
you know,

668
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:47.730
like I talked a lot of my Jewish readers and stuff,
I'm like,
yeah,
there is,

669
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:50.850
there is a problem.
And then there was a synagogue shooting.
So yeah,

670
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.990
clearly there's a problem,

671
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.210
but that's the idea is the more people you talk to you and the more you get out

672
00:35:57.211 --> 00:36:01.130
of your own space and your own little niche to morning Rosa.
Okay.

673
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.620
It's my behavior really reflecting while and then as you become more prominent,

674
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.150
then you start to think,
well,

675
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:09.870
anything that I do is going to be used against people who have been nice to me.

676
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.640
So now I have,
so it's called the growing up.
Yeah,
well it's all just social

677
00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.230
<v 1>stupid because it's like I forgetting that the usual suspects will come after me</v>

678
00:36:17.231 --> 00:36:18.280
for even doing this.

679
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.030
It's like there's probably somebody out there now that I would like to get on

680
00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:25.180
the show that simply will not come on the show because I'm doing this right now.

681
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.040
I mean,
even yesterday I,
uh,
I contacted uh,

682
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.780
Paul booty booty judge edge food.
Yeah.
Uh,

683
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.830
his PR person DMD me cause I asked him to come on the show and we're looking

684
00:36:35.831 --> 00:36:38.100
into it.
But then the,
the blue checkers.
Yeah,

685
00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.940
<v 2>yeah.
You call,
you know,
calling me all these awful things and it's like,</v>

686
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.250
what are you guys all doing?
Like what,

687
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.160
what is it that they're all trying to accomplish by,

688
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:50.390
by d platforming and destroying everybody?
Well,
it's turf forests there.

689
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.290
Something interesting happened when having a post had to lay off a bunch of

690
00:36:54.291 --> 00:36:57.620
people like,
oh,
everyone's like,
oh my God,
hire these great minds or whatever,

691
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.410
and I went to their Twitter cause I'm like,
nope,
no you're not.

692
00:37:00.411 --> 00:37:04.220
You're not interesting.
You're not.
This is another basic hot take,

693
00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:08.660
white male patriarchy due to everybody's evils.
Like no,
they're fungible.

694
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.420
What they're doing is they're producing a functional content,

695
00:37:11.421 --> 00:37:15.890
which is outrage directed a specific group of people and then people like you,

696
00:37:15.891 --> 00:37:18.350
people like Joe Rogan,
they're jealous.

697
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.440
There's also those people and they rather than just say,

698
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:24.320
and again this is like a mindset issue rather than Tressa.
Yeah,

699
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.230
I'm kind of jealous.
Those people,
maybe autumn,

700
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.940
I figured out what they're doing maybe ought to up my own game.

701
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:33.530
They want to attack and destroy and largely that's because leftwing politics

702
00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:38.240
today,
orthodoxy is largely based on the edge resentment.

703
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.400
How do you think or why do you do,

704
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.520
<v 1>I think Trump got this,</v>

705
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:44.430
like if we were going back three and a half years ago to that first sit down,

706
00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:48.300
I'm sure I asked you something to that effect that the very nascent version

707
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.680
<v 2>of it,
but what do you think about Trump?
Is it that,</v>

708
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:56.540
that he understands this thing?
He's a leftist?
Um,
he,
yes,

709
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.940
he was always a liberal before I became a Republican.
I was all the,

710
00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.630
if you reform leftists are the of the left worst nightmare.

711
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.910
Because psychologically,
and I don't know,

712
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.160
this is something I haven't heard a good answer for.

713
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.050
Jordan Pearson Cottey touches on it.

714
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.650
There's a difference between a left wing brain and right brain,

715
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.040
the conservatives,
the American Eagles,
that sort of campy stuff.

716
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:20.310
And I don't want to be dismissive,
but that's just not me,
right?
I'm,

717
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.730
I would rather look at Jackson Pollock or something.
I think that's the real art.

718
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.620
And Trump thinks like a leftist and he's thinking,

719
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:31.080
how can I get under their skin,
right?
I'm going to get,

720
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:32.010
I'm going to get under the skin.

721
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.500
How can I get another snake skin because he understood that that was what

722
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:38.710
brought you cultural relevance and cultural significance is getting under the

723
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:39.880
skin of the other side,

724
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.960
which has now become medically is called owning the libs.

725
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.050
So now you have all these people on the right,
oh lol.

726
00:38:47.051 --> 00:38:50.280
Owning the libs is become a meaning of its own and now the left is saying all

727
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.490
these people want to own the libs.
But then actually they say that in a fairly,

728
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:57.880
sometimes there's a profile on Candice Owens who Charlie Kirk and they said all

729
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:00.340
they do is own the libs and that was dismissive and untrue.

730
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:03.940
But the medically there is a sense of it and we're going to rile them up.

731
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:08.320
And Trump is great at riling people up because his brain,

732
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:09.370
he has a leftist brain.

733
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.100
It's so interesting the two d arguments on a lot of this stuff,

734
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:15.490
cause you probably know,
I often go to colleges with Candace and Charlie and yes,

735
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:19.570
do they,
do they,
you know,
are their chance of build the wall and do they,

736
00:39:19.571 --> 00:39:22.420
are they screaming and all of these things.
There's a lot of that.

737
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:24.910
But you know what they're mostly is,
I would say 90%.

738
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.100
It's actually talking about ideas.

739
00:39:27.101 --> 00:39:29.830
And we'd go up there and we talk about the things that we disagree on,

740
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.260
but you can't get the media to report on that.

741
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:34.600
They will only report on it in the two D way.

742
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.770
And then what that does is the people that were there or that see video of it
go,

743
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:42.520
oh,
well you guys are just liars because that's not really what happened there.

744
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.170
There's some kids having some fun chanting,
right.
Damn will.
And that becomes,

745
00:39:47.171 --> 00:39:51.030
so that becomes a crisis of confidence and that's why more and more people lose

746
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.930
trust in me.
I'll give you a great example.

747
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:56.380
That sincere is when I read a daily beast article where they said,

748
00:39:56.381 --> 00:40:00.190
Jacob Wall put this kid up to making a false accusation against mayor Pete.

749
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.870
And we have tape.
I was like,
I think I said Paul before,
by the way,
it's p.
Dot.

750
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.010
[inaudible] P.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,

751
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.550
and I thought that they might provide this line because they've lied about me

752
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:13.120
before.
So when I read an article now,
I don't think,
oh,

753
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.620
this is informing my peanut.
I'm like,
yeah,

754
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:18.010
this is the probably lying or that suck beyond imagination.
I mean,

755
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:21.370
if you care about truth in any way whatsoever,
and I don't mean you know,

756
00:40:21.371 --> 00:40:24.520
like anyone watching this,
if you care about truth,
like during the Jesse smell,

757
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:29.150
that thing the entire time I was like,
this all just read so wrong.
But,

758
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.560
but it's not just that the media is lying about it to gin everybody up to,

759
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:34.120
to start a freaking race war.

760
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.530
It's that the politicians that are all tweeting that this is an example of white

761
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:42.220
supremacy in America and coming to end gate 15 year old kids,

762
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.640
you want to talk about bullying,
Cernovich,
bully,
blah blah blah.

763
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.830
And they went after 15 year old kid,
right?

764
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:53.120
Get out of hoax based on a hoax and then the writeup absolve themselves of all

765
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:56.620
personal responsibility is,
and our kids have got killed.

766
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.480
So is there a line that you draw then?
Cause the other part of the,
uh,

767
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.280
of the New York Times article,

768
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:07.290
why is New York Times article is basically that there needs to be just,
uh,

769
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.760
well she was in this case she was talking about the IDW whatever you,

770
00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:11.860
however you want to define that.
But generally speaking,

771
00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:14.980
do you have sort of boundaries of what gatekeeping should it be like what ideas

772
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:18.370
are so fringe that are so,
I mean,
people call you a white nationalists,
are you,

773
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.920
do you believe that America should be a white nationalist?
That's as,

774
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.130
I never have written about it.
That's what,

775
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.820
but that's bizarre about me is they with your Persian wife?
Yeah.

776
00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:29.530
Well that's what I would say.
Like where does my Persian wife fit into this?

777
00:41:29.531 --> 00:41:31.570
Right.
I don't even,
I don't even talk about this kind of stuff.

778
00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.330
And when you look at actually immigrant populations,

779
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.770
the Indians tend to be more innovative.
There's the idea behind immigration.

780
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:41.540
We talked about this in 2015.

781
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.440
Over three feels like a deputy over three years ago.
I'm all for it.
I just,

782
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.300
I'm a,
I'm a believer in,
we have enough people here making 12 bucks an hour,

783
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.840
so we don't need anybody else here who can take $12 an hour jobs.

784
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.160
But if we can get people who are really brilliant from all over the world,

785
00:41:58.161 --> 00:42:00.440
let's skim.
I'm a cream skimmer.

786
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:04.700
I want to bring the smartest people over and bring them all over here and make

787
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:08.480
America great place for them.
And they try to say,
oh,
I'm like,

788
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:13.481
well I live my reveal preferences are antithetical to the accusations they make.

789
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.970
Now that said,
are any ideas off limits?

790
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:19.820
And I've always held the belief that no idea is off limits.

791
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.270
You can talk about anything.
It's fundamentally how people treat you.

792
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.480
And there is an example of,
there are people for example,

793
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:29.630
that they wanted me to do their show and I want to do this show because I just

794
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:32.300
don't like them.
Like you're just a nasty person.
I don't know.

795
00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:35.210
I don't want to talk to you about anything.
You're,
you're a bad person.

796
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.620
It isn't that they're too far left for me.
And then of course,

797
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:42.470
what I thought was funny to you is I always see people tweeting out that you

798
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:46.790
won't have a socialist on your show,
but they will come on your show.
Right?

799
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.250
I mean,
I'm sure some socialists word,
but I've had plenty of lefty.
I mean,

800
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.390
this argument is so boring.
It's like,
you know,
right.
It's just,

801
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.190
it's just never endingly ridiculous.

802
00:42:55.191 --> 00:42:58.610
It's like if my lefties that I have on all the time aren't left enough for you,

803
00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:03.140
it might be you.
That's the problem rather than,
than my guest choices.
Um,
yeah.

804
00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.790
But there's any ideas.

805
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:08.090
I think people should be able to talk about any kind of ideas.
Fundamentally.

806
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:10.250
It's how do you,
how do you treat people?

807
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.940
And I think that we're seeing now is something that I predicted I might've,

808
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:18.470
I think I talked about on your show actually.
Uh,
if not,
I have to rewash clip.

809
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.500
But what happens when you put ideas off limits are there's nobody to be like,

810
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:25.460
hey,
that was a really dumb thing.

811
00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:28.970
You said you're just with 50 other people in discord server trying to one up

812
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:31.330
each other and you're with the them and then you,

813
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.570
you get in a downward spiral and vast when you have violence,

814
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.240
they shut people down and then that's when people are starting to get violent

815
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:39.074
and we're actually,

816
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.320
we're seeing that backlash and that's why I wake up every day and I'm like,
oh,

817
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:45.170
of course the left got worse today.
Of course they got worse.
They,
of course,

818
00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:48.260
they go to work today because I kept saying,
guys,
we can't call everybody racist.

819
00:43:48.261 --> 00:43:52.550
We meaning me as a lefty too.
We can't call everybody racist.
You can't say that.

820
00:43:52.551 --> 00:43:55.850
Everybody who wants stricter immigration then you want the type of thing that

821
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:58.880
Obama ran on or Bill Clinton used to talk about all the time.

822
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.400
You can't say that they're all racists because of that,

823
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:06.320
but every day there's just another version of that and it seems like they're,

824
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:08.430
it seems like there's just no adult in the room.
Well,

825
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.260
I thought Trump was blues for sure.
2020 thought for sure.

826
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.000
If you'd asked me a year ago,
I was like,
oh yeah,

827
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:18.380
Trump and the left decided that they didn't want to.

828
00:44:18.381 --> 00:44:22.850
When you're talking about,
well the baby's born,
we'll make her comfortable.

829
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.070
I don't think the left.
So just to be clear,

830
00:44:25.071 --> 00:44:27.200
I don't think the left wants to chop off the heads of babies,

831
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.920
but if you can't just say some concession there.
Yeah,
exactly.

832
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.330
But if you can't just say,
because you're so afraid of the mob.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

833
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.450
The baby's out of the womb.
Nobody's supports poster birth abortion.
You,

834
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.910
they can't even say that because they're terrified that the lot to also,

835
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:43.530
you're saying a woman doesn't have complete control.

836
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.490
They can't even draw any kind of lines where you're like,
look man,

837
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.510
we all know eight,
you know,
eight and a half months that the mothers healthy.

838
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.310
There aren't going be any kind of complicated.
And,

839
00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.560
and the irony of that too is it's such a marginal issue to go to lose on.

840
00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.051
It's like a hill.

841
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:01.560
You're dying on women who are pro choice don't want to kill her babies.

842
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.850
Now there's a prolife or saying,
well but life begins at conception.

843
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.641
That's a different debate.

844
00:45:05.641 --> 00:45:09.600
But women who are eight and a half months pregnant are not trying to go to the

845
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:11.380
clinic,
but the,

846
00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.410
the left is so afraid of freaking out their base of just feral monsters or

847
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:20.280
whatever that they won't even just say what I just said,
which is so not so.

848
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.140
They have to make everything sound like it's okay.

849
00:45:22.141 --> 00:45:23.340
And then as I say all the time,

850
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:26.760
then it's like for me who's begrudgingly pro choice,
I mean I still am,

851
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:30.180
even though I've heard far more compelling prolife arguments than pro choice

852
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.600
arguments at this point,
it makes my position impossible to hold.

853
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.720
Cause I know I'm holding this temporary position on quicksand because I know

854
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:41.721
these guys are going off the deep end and that's why they're there creating no

855
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.640
backlash.
I talked to my,
um,
my wife and I,

856
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:48.180
we talk about if we're going to be Christians and go to church because you just

857
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:52.860
look around and so debased.
Now they're,
they're,
they're the big,
they're going to,

858
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.190
there's going to be a big revolution of Christianity or Islam or something where

859
00:45:56.191 --> 00:45:59.860
people are just sick of the generous.
He like,
I'm,
I've,

860
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.080
I was always pro gay marriage before it was a thing,
cause I'm libertarian.

861
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.070
20 years ago in law school I was like,
dude,

862
00:46:06.071 --> 00:46:09.270
do you know why can't adults enter into contracts it blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.

863
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.290
But 11 year old kids on stage with dollar bills throwing at them.
No,
sorry dude.

864
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.350
Right.
Sorry.
Record that has nothing to do with gay marriage.
No,
no,
no.

865
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:20.400
I get what you're wearing.
Libertarian.
If you want to be a drag queen,
a trends.

866
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:23.040
Yeah.
I don't care man.
It's your life is hard.

867
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.950
Whatever you do to help you get through it,
it's fine.
Well there's,

868
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.680
somebody tweeted this,
I wish I knew who it was,
but they were saying how this,

869
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.310
how the left was lauding this 11 year old drag queen and guys were throwing

870
00:46:32.311 --> 00:46:34.710
bills at this kid.
They're saying that's amazing.

871
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:36.720
But now these 14 year old that we referenced earlier,

872
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:41.100
who's making edgy jokes on Youtube,
oh,
that's an old right,
racist.
And it's like,

873
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.560
pick one guys.
Which way are we going here?
Well,
and that's the problem.
The,

874
00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:48.750
the left doesn't have a governing moral standard outside of victimization.

875
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.380
Who's the biggest victim and how can we need,

876
00:46:51.381 --> 00:46:55.070
you talked about this and the inversion of values and their story that tranche

877
00:46:55.071 --> 00:46:57.810
laws,
and this is all this is all been prophesied by him.

878
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.890
And so like sick,
except the 14 year old kid for example,
self,

879
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.590
you watch her and they're saying,
oh my God,

880
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:08.180
she's talking about killing gay people.
And then you watch a video.
No,
no,
no.

881
00:47:08.181 --> 00:47:10.830
It's actually met a commentary,
right?
She's,

882
00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.280
she's pointing out the hypocrisy of well,
if you criticize Islam,

883
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:17.400
you're Islamophobic.
Okay,
but you know,
gays maybe don't do so well,

884
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.910
maybe it's fair to ask that question.
No,
no,
no,
you can't do that.

885
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:24.210
So she is doing it and her dead pan delivery style.
And when I watch I'm like,

886
00:47:24.211 --> 00:47:27.420
wow,
she's more talented to me.
Now if somebody said,
where are the parents?

887
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:31.200
I'd be like,
well,
okay,
you know,
that that's the more their child actors and,

888
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.400
or is she being protected from groomers?
And,

889
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.290
but then if you tried to apply that same,
uh,
same standard to Desmond is amazing.

890
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.370
Now you're a bigot and you just,
you hate,

891
00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:43.560
you hate everybody else gave people Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
So there,

892
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.610
there's no universal standard that you just apply and you apply evenly down the

893
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:51.730
board.
Do you think that will lead to a resurgence in religion?

894
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:55.000
And I think this has a little bit to do with sort of the Jordan Peterson

895
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.800
phenomenon over the last year.

896
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.800
He's not telling people to be religious and practice per se,

897
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:05.110
but he's explaining why the stories of religion have value.
And I do,

898
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:05.801
I see that,

899
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:08.470
I mean I traveled the world with the guy and I saw it happening in real time.

900
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.470
Yeah.
Jordan Peterson is a secular religion,
which may be,
seems contrary to,

901
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.010
but not really just the old school of virtues.

902
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.970
I think Aristotle is going to come back a Ryan holiday popularize that Stoics,

903
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.330
right?
So Ryan holiday has his own,
you know,
books on stoicism.

904
00:48:22.331 --> 00:48:24.340
And the idea of dealing with the world,

905
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.210
trying to live virtuously trying to tr to be a good person and you're going to

906
00:48:28.211 --> 00:48:32.140
see a return of virtue that will absolutely,
it's already making a comeback.

907
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.920
I'm less of a piece of shit sometimes because I look around and I'm like,

908
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.740
I don't want to,
like,
I've seen the mirror now.
Okay,
this is me,

909
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.360
these people that I don't like.
That was me three years ago.
I don't like that.

910
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:47.350
That isn't what I want to see.
So I'm in my own way,
living my own virtuous life,

911
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:51.250
which makes me,
can try it about some things while still having the sense of,

912
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:55.230
but I'm not gonna apologize to the people who are doing it.
It's quite all right.

913
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.780
So let's,
let's back up to the censorship stuff because obviously now,

914
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:03.781
so Alex Jones has been booted from youtube than last week or 10 days ago or so.

915
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:08.470
Uh,
Facebook and,
uh,
what else was it?
Instagram took him.
Paul,

916
00:49:08.471 --> 00:49:12.910
Joseph Watson,
Laura Loomer,
a couple others.
Um,
first off,

917
00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:16.240
do you see any meaningful distinction between any of these people?
How do you,

918
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.970
how do you pay apologists of Watson?
Right.
It just,

919
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.660
you could say guilt by association with Alex.

920
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:26.860
Paul's the most above board clean cut,
all hits above them.
He does.

921
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.620
Pretty sure if we now post this video on Facebook,

922
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:32.620
you've now said something nice about him and the page by page could probably

923
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:34.420
know.
That's actually true.
That that's,
that's funny.

924
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.910
The Stalinist stick on prayers.

925
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:39.490
I remember I wrote a book called the comments are vanishes.

926
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.850
Everyone should watch or read this book or at least pretend to override it,

927
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.170
you know,
to be a cultured person.

928
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:48.100
And they would show how pictures would be edited as Stalin would have people

929
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:50.800
killed.
These people would be added on pictures.

930
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.460
And I remember reading this 20 years ago,
I can't believe that ever happened.

931
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.180
And I'm not like,
no,
I can totally believe it happened.

932
00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:02.470
And I see the parallels and they ban people for off platform content,

933
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.470
uh,
conduct.
But they won't be in the people who make fake videos.

934
00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:08.470
And my wife and daughter for [inaudible] information and I don't,

935
00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.430
I don't see how Milo's he's cleaned up his act if anything had become kind of

936
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:15.280
fish ticket,
you know,
anymore.
And,

937
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:17.980
but do you see any distinction between any of these people?

938
00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:21.640
Like is there somebody that's done something that you think is so overboard?
No,

939
00:50:21.641 --> 00:50:25.030
definitely not over the,
there's nothing,
um,
Alex Jones,

940
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.250
people forget to mention he's apologized for sandy hook so many times.

941
00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:32.750
Repeatedly he went on Joe Rogan I didn't realize on my followers were not,

942
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:35.090
some were going to go harass these parents and I wish I'd have known that,

943
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.380
but it's like,
okay,
we're sorry bro.
Like what are we supposed to do?

944
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.270
And then,
and then they wipe them out.

945
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:44.090
So there was nothing any of them send that was over the top.

946
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.840
<v 1>So what do we do then that forgetting the specifics?
I,</v>

947
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.560
I happen to like Paul a lot and I think his videos are good and yeah,

948
00:50:49.561 --> 00:50:52.290
I think he's funny and I think he gets some of the culture stuff that you're

949
00:50:52.291 --> 00:50:54.720
talking about are not some of it.
I think he probably gets all of it.

950
00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:58.690
Probably gets a lot of it in a way that I don't even get,
let's say.
Um,

951
00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.680
but these all happened to be right leaning people.

952
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.710
Lot of a lot of lefties can get away with a Lotta stuff.

953
00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.210
We've referenced some of it already.

954
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:06.881
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:11.170
Well anybody who doesn't think Facebook is the new Russia is missing the trend.

956
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.270
This is election interference and they're going after pro Trump influencers.

957
00:51:16.271 --> 00:51:17.770
People who have cultural cachet,

958
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.610
people who can get votes for Trump and they're getting rid of them before it

959
00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:25.450
becomes too hard,
too hot to handle.
Once we're full in primary season,

960
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.970
it'll be too on the nose.
His election in France.

961
00:51:27.971 --> 00:51:30.850
So it's election our fence 100% that's why they're doing it.

962
00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.120
They're banning influential pro Trump people there are silencing them and not by

963
00:51:36.881 --> 00:51:40.000
any kind of rules like so here.
So here's an example.
The,
you know,

964
00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:42.070
I'm not putting anybody on blast.
These are my friends and everything.

965
00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:44.860
I'll just say that I've messaged people before.

966
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.300
Some people you named and some you haven't said,
I think this is,

967
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.310
you shouldn't say this.
I think this is kind of nasty now.

968
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.220
It's not a very nice thing.
Not It wasn't hate speech,

969
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:58.060
but there Facebook doesn't say,
Hey,
you know this is like a nasty thing.

970
00:51:58.061 --> 00:52:02.260
Don't say this.
Right.
Don't refer to Muslims as animals for example.
Right.

971
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.010
This is like a pretty clear rule.
If you refer to Muslims is filthy.

972
00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:10.030
Jihad is like,
okay bro,
you know,
come on,
but you can call it Jews.
Cockroaches.

973
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.420
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
So there,

974
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:15.820
there is a double standard element and you can't like meet with them and they're

975
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:17.800
like,
okay,
here's the 10 things you did wrong.

976
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.070
You're going to come back in a probationary period.
No bullshit.

977
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.920
You better just be,
if you feel like you're close to the line,

978
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:25.330
don't even go near the line.

979
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:29.260
That's what you would do in a functioning working system that was actually

980
00:52:29.261 --> 00:52:31.450
trying to make the world a better place and increase the value of the

981
00:52:31.451 --> 00:52:35.410
conversation and not interfere,
manipulate the election.
You'll just say,
look,

982
00:52:35.411 --> 00:52:39.190
this is,
this is a bad thing.
You said,
here's why this is the rule.

983
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:41.680
Don't say it.
There's,
there's none of that.

984
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.130
<v 1>So do you think platforms just cannot exist as they have existed for the last</v>

985
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:49.370
five or 10 years then that they've become too much?
Uh,

986
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.190
too much of a sort of informational behemoths.

987
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.810
There are two so many voices on there competing and then you've got a social

988
00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:01.130
justice mentality out of silicon valley that it's all the inequities.

989
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:04.310
So when Tim Pool has to explain this right to Jack's face on Joe Rogan,

990
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.700
it all looks ridiculous because it is ridiculous.

991
00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:12.410
<v 2>Well,
they have monopolies and this is something that isn't mentioned enough.</v>

992
00:53:12.411 --> 00:53:15.830
There's a,
there's a guy,
there's like a new upstart rock fin that's trying to,

993
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.020
that explain this while there's something called Metcalf's law,

994
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.650
which is there's a formula where the value of the network increases

995
00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:25.680
synergistically based on more people you have and what Youtube did,

996
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:28.740
and this is why I don't have any sympathy for the other private companies taking

997
00:53:28.741 --> 00:53:30.180
over the one.
No,
they can't.
Here's why.

998
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.270
Joe Rogan built Youtube Pewdie Pie Bill Youtube.

999
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.390
They brought all the people who liked them onto youtube.

1000
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.630
Youtube provided a platform.
Bullshit.
We all remember what Youtube said.

1001
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:42.240
Come on up.
You can say anything,
bring all your people.

1002
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:44.040
And then they built that network up.

1003
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:47.070
And then once youtube had the network effect and networks,

1004
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.830
Peter Teal talks about this in zero to one and his other writings,

1005
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.780
networks tend towards monopolization.
So once they have a monopoly now in video,

1006
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:56.640
which youtube has Facebook and Twitter,

1007
00:53:56.641 --> 00:54:00.120
they'll have their own respective monopolies.
Then they say,
oh,
you gotta go.

1008
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.970
And then these free market can serve as well as private company that can do

1009
00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.500
anything want.
Nobody's in its fraud.

1010
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.620
They lied to people to get people to put their time and the resources,

1011
00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:11.970
thousands hours and their channel to build that network under Metcalf's law.

1012
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.350
And now they're,
they're changing the rules.
That is

1013
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.370
<v 1>civil part.
So let's,</v>

1014
00:54:15.371 --> 00:54:17.950
so let's dive into this a little bit more because you've probably seen my tweets

1015
00:54:17.951 --> 00:54:22.160
on this and this is pushing my libertarian side to its end point.

1016
00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.520
I feel like that's what's happening right now is that,

1017
00:54:24.521 --> 00:54:28.360
I know right this second by having you on or for not even having you on for any

1018
00:54:28.361 --> 00:54:30.820
reason.
Could they pull the plug or right this second?

1019
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.710
Would I be if I had to bet my life right now?

1020
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.400
Have they depressed the views of this livestream?
Yes.

1021
00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.650
Are they my channels over a million subscribers?

1022
00:54:38.651 --> 00:54:41.950
We're getting 20,000 views on some things.
Are they fucking with us?
Yes.

1023
00:54:41.951 --> 00:54:45.250
His Twitter shadow banning.
Yes.
Have they,
has it all gotten worse?
Oddly,

1024
00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:46.900
since I had James O'keefe?
Yes.

1025
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.260
I mean we could do like a list of all of this shit.
Right?
So,

1026
00:54:50.261 --> 00:54:52.580
but putting that aside for a second,
my,

1027
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:57.070
my core libertarian belief is that I would prefer that competition solve this.

1028
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.520
Why do you think that that's not a,
a sound art?

1029
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.340
<v 2>Because they're natural monopolies is social media company,</v>

1030
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:06.640
a tech companies in natural monopoly,
uh,
power companies and natural monopolies,

1031
00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:10.270
standard oils and natural monopoly.
The railway tracks or natural monopoly.

1032
00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:15.450
So you have certain industries that tend towards monopolization and if you have

1033
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:20.890
an,
you can't have a free market competition because the do the economy scales in

1034
00:55:20.891 --> 00:55:23.940
the Metcalf's law.
Now,
the counter to that,
if,

1035
00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.450
but this would be counterfactual is if five years ago youtube had said,
hey,

1036
00:55:28.451 --> 00:55:29.740
come onto our platform.

1037
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.760
We might ban you just because we don't like you going to like what you're saying

1038
00:55:33.761 --> 00:55:36.700
or some middle managers and like you might be on you but come on up and put your

1039
00:55:36.701 --> 00:55:39.340
videos on here.
Well then you would have had somebody say,
oh no,

1040
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:41.320
come on over here that you would have had a real competition.

1041
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.990
So these social media,
they all know.
I mean this is zero to one.

1042
00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:48.880
These are natural monopolies.
This is been,
it was a a priori.

1043
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:51.820
This is what people thought and it's been established a post Jerry that that

1044
00:55:51.821 --> 00:55:54.400
they're natural monopolies.
So there,
there is no free market.

1045
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:59.570
<v 1>So here's the odd part,
okay,
let's,
let's buy your argument for the,</v>

1046
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.060
just for the sake of this.
So let's say we completely buy that,
right?

1047
00:56:02.061 --> 00:56:06.170
Well now what I see happening is I see conservative saying,
where is Trump?

1048
00:56:06.171 --> 00:56:09.380
Where is Trump?
The government's got to come in and break it up or it's got a,

1049
00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:11.090
they've got to regulate these things or whatever.
Now,

1050
00:56:11.091 --> 00:56:14.690
I understand this might be a moment where you might want to do this,

1051
00:56:14.691 --> 00:56:17.450
especially if what you just laid out about 2020 is true.

1052
00:56:17.451 --> 00:56:18.440
You might want to do it right now,

1053
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.940
but would you Mike Cernovich want a hand that power over to the government when

1054
00:56:22.941 --> 00:56:24.100
it's possible Trump

1055
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.970
<v 2>loses.
And then you've got silicon valley full of postmodern leftist,</v>

1056
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:30.400
and then you've got Bernie in the White House and then,

1057
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.200
and then what do you have?
They'll do it anyway.

1058
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:37.300
Obama or the IRS to investigate all these people and illegal audits done in a

1059
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:39.820
John Mccain and Obama.
So to me,

1060
00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:43.900
the thinking is this tit for tat is so for running a game theory simulation.

1061
00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.840
Well,
if I do it,
they'll do it.
I'll do okay,

1062
00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.660
but they've already done it and they do it.
It's the same thing with tweets.

1063
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:53.290
People go,
well,
don't you think by digging up tweets,
they might retaliate.

1064
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.190
And I'm like,
oh.
So they might dig up my treats 10,000 times.
Oh my God.

1065
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.310
And that's where we are.
The left.
They're going to do it anyway.
Now,

1066
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:05.050
the irony of this conversation is if Hillary Clinton had won,

1067
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.500
none of this would've happened because here's why.

1068
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.380
She left these idiots over there,
bark in the corner.

1069
00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.120
They don't have any real power.
What they learned is there's real influence.

1070
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:19.210
There's real power.
These people aren't just eat.
Remember East Aleppo,

1071
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.073
this is the celebrity.

1072
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.560
You don't hear that much anymore because people realize the idea is we actually

1073
00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:27.100
jumped.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Like when I walk around,

1074
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:30.700
I remember when I was at the RNC,
there was MSNBC guy there,

1075
00:57:30.701 --> 00:57:34.000
I think Chris Hayes's name,
but more people recognize me than him.

1076
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.870
Just from Easel Leb,
right?
Yeah,
and they,
they would have,

1077
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.370
that would have been happy,

1078
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.610
let these people scream and rant and rave while we actually govern,

1079
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:46.630
and then they realized that no,
they do have real influence.

1080
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.280
Now we have to do something about it.
And the,

1081
00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:52.240
the big trend now is they're getting rid of the big pro Trump influencers.

1082
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.390
Now they're nudging.
There's a,

1083
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:57.970
there's a great book that everybody should recall nudge.

1084
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:01.540
And the idea is how can you as a government help people make better choices?

1085
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:05.080
The prototypical example is organ donors.

1086
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.450
If you just have people opt in,
it's a good thing.
Societal good donate organs.

1087
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:13.000
We all agree.
If you ask people,
do you want to donate?
Most people say no.

1088
00:58:13.001 --> 00:58:16.000
If you just say,
do you want to opt out?
Most people said,
no,
I'll be one.

1089
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.450
So that's a nudge.
You're not telling people what to do.
You just nudging them.

1090
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.530
That's where the tech trend now is.
So if people Google Dave Rubin,

1091
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.830
they're gonna find the hate pieces,

1092
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.010
they're going to find the hate articles there and they're going to bury anything

1093
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:31.720
about you and your channel.

1094
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.080
And that's another way that the narrative has been manipulated in the native is

1095
00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:37.780
being influenced.
So,
so what would you want then?

1096
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:42.050
Right now for Trump to do oh fourth or the government related to all the tech

1097
00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:43.750
hub?
Okay,
well it's too late now,

1098
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:47.920
but if I had a magic wand then when Trump had a republican majority in both

1099
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:50.110
houses,
they would have said,
you know what?

1100
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.790
Why is it that if somebody liables me on Facebook,
I can't sue Facebook?

1101
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.640
Facebook says,
well,
we're a platform,
not a publisher.
You can't.

1102
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.360
So they have CDA section two 30 just abolish it.
No,

1103
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:05.500
you want to be publishers now and you want to just to clarify this for people

1104
00:59:05.501 --> 00:59:09.160
that aren't fully on all this,
the idea of the platform versus publisher.
Okay.

1105
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:14.890
Okay.
So there's a provision of the millennial millennial digital copyright act

1106
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.520
section or a CDA comedian Decency Act Section 230 and under this act it says

1107
00:59:21.171 --> 00:59:25.310
that no platform will be liable for third party content.

1108
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.880
Example.
I'm sure there's,
right now Sony and Youtube calling me the,

1109
00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:32.750
the most awful things that I could still have for,
I can't say youtube for that.

1110
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:37.640
I can go sue that anonymous bro for that under only because section two 30,

1111
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:42.140
uh,
exists.
And the rationale behind that was,
I mean,

1112
00:59:42.141 --> 00:59:43.340
you can't expect somebody to,

1113
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:46.280
you can't expect Facebook to please 2 billion people.

1114
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:48.680
They're just providing a platform for people to share their minds.

1115
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.340
But they're not a publisher like the New York Times or like you.
So you,
Dave,

1116
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:55.790
Ruben,
your publisher,
if you say something bad,
okay,
we'll,
you're a publisher.

1117
00:59:55.791 --> 01:00:00.610
You're not a platform.
And Youtube is fine though.
So the ideas is what?
What?

1118
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.800
No,
they're acting as they're acting as publishers now they're calling themselves

1119
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:08.090
publishers because they are now deciding who can exactly.
Right.
Okay.

1120
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:11.060
So you don't get this precious little mute anymore.
Now you would limit it.

1121
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:13.670
So you know,
some guy with a blog or something,
right?

1122
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.940
You would say anybody with revenues of over a billion dollars a year or

1123
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:21.830
something like that shall be held liable.
And you eliminate that.

1124
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:24.870
But then what's going to happen with tech companies and freak out,
right?
Well,

1125
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.890
tough luck.
You're publishers now.
So you'd hold them to that too.

1126
01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:32.450
Is the FTC finding his Facebook make it 20 billion?
We all know,

1127
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.980
we all know that we're,
you and I are here.
And I said,
Oh boy,
I sure am Craig.

1128
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:38.540
You know,
playing a game of basketball.

1129
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.310
And then we all know there's going to be an APP.

1130
01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:42.470
It's gonna appear for Spalding basketball.
We just know it.

1131
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.780
We know they're spying on us.
We know this is illegal.

1132
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.280
We know this is why our tap criminally prosecuted them and dine them and died

1133
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:51.290
them under the five Federal Wiretap Act.

1134
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.680
These are all laws on the books and by the way,
what they're doing,
and again,

1135
01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:58.820
this goes back to the glibness of our age where because everything's outrageous,

1136
01:00:58.821 --> 01:00:59.654
nothing is,

1137
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.140
it truly is outrageous that even if you opt out of Facebook's spying program,

1138
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.990
they still spy on you.
Even if you do everything right,
they can still spine.

1139
01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.000
This is human human spine,

1140
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.870
like never up an item and item Federal Rico Kiss.

1141
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:18.500
So in that Trump doesn't have congress now and did not.
Well,
he couldn't.

1142
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.750
Doj could do that without him.
So Doj couldn't die.

1143
01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:23.150
Facebook for privacy violations.

1144
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:25.310
The Federal Trade Commission could say 5 billion isn't enough.

1145
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.460
You need to pay 20 billion,
100 billion.
There's nothing enough a,

1146
01:01:29.461 --> 01:01:33.290
a DOJ antitrust enforcement could go after,
could go after youtube.

1147
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.450
So there's already enough laws on the books too,

1148
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:38.210
which is why when people were like,
oh,
we need to,
there's already laws here.

1149
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:42.020
We don't need a new law.
Where do you think Trump's thinking right now?
Oh,

1150
01:01:42.021 --> 01:01:46.400
I didn't that head Trump thinks that he won with is Samsung and iPhone.

1151
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.830
Trump is so oblivious to what is happening.
Trump's greatest flaw,

1152
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.010
and this triggers Trump supporters.
But that's the beauty of being French.

1153
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:56.930
I can trigger everybody and make them mad.

1154
01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.390
A good leaders worried about the troops,

1155
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.660
good leaders like what's going on with the troops.
He doesn't care.

1156
01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:05.360
Trump cares about Trump and it always triggers.

1157
01:02:05.361 --> 01:02:07.820
I'll probably lose 5,000 Twitter followers.
I don't care.
Actually,

1158
01:02:07.821 --> 01:02:11.330
I got rid of most of them.
But Trump cares about Trump.
So in Trump's world,

1159
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:14.360
he's not thinking about these people downstream.
He,
you know,

1160
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:15.950
he's living his own life or whatever.

1161
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:21.190
Then he has to be an odd sort of disconnect because obviously what catapulted

1162
01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:23.670
him was to be in touch with that.

1163
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.020
But do you think that's just the nature of now you've attained power,

1164
01:02:27.021 --> 01:02:30.990
so you just started to disconnect from that phone?
No,
no.
I mean,

1165
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:34.680
I've talked to people with personal knowledge and everything.
No,
no,
he doesn't.

1166
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.580
He doesn't think the Facebook ads,
Cambridge Analytica band,

1167
01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:39.990
he just thinks he won with this phone.

1168
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.570
That that has really Trump the beauty of Trump.

1169
01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:44.090
And this is why every time I criticized him,

1170
01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:47.400
I smile too because he is unlike anything we've ever had,

1171
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.720
at least in my lifetime.

1172
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.260
And the beauty of him is that he's so self confident that you can't take them

1173
01:02:54.841 --> 01:02:57.540
down.
I mean if the media went after me,
the way they went after him,

1174
01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.480
I'd probably would have a panic attack or something and probably have PTSD.

1175
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:05.340
But that self confidence is also based in it adjusted total self involvement.

1176
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.070
Where in his world he's like,
I just tweet it in.
The magic happens.

1177
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.970
She doesn't realize.
No,

1178
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:12.540
I mean there's network nodes and there's ways messaging get across.

1179
01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:16.070
It just doesn't work this way.
So do you think he's a failure then the,

1180
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:19.740
I mean this strikes me that the free speech stuff in the platform stuff.
I mean,

1181
01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:24.640
you know,
that's my,
my core stuff.
I mean do you think he's a failure then it,
if,

1182
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:26.730
if everything you're sort of predicting here is going to happen,

1183
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.670
it's a leadership failure.
Yeah.
He failed when,

1184
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.450
when he fired General Flynn and he let General Flynn plead guilty and he didn't

1185
01:03:33.451 --> 01:03:34.920
pardon General Flynn.
That was a major failing.

1186
01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:38.640
It's one that I will not forgive and people,
uh,

1187
01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:43.200
so what people that understand is generally there's a deep state or whatever,

1188
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:45.840
which is just another way of thinking of that bureaucracy.
The people,

1189
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.440
you're going to go to DC and you think you're hot shit,
your AOC or hot.

1190
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:51.720
There's people that are before you and there's people who are going to be there

1191
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:53.850
after you leave.
Is that how you would describe deep state?

1192
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:57.090
Because I know people are going to say Ruben had conspiracy theorist.

1193
01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.430
That's another one.
I forgot about that one.
Yeah,
so deep,

1194
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.870
deep state is you think you're hot shit.
It's just like Hollywood,

1195
01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:06.690
the stig industry.
When people talk about Hollywood,
they talk about the industry.

1196
01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.610
I'm a big star now.
You've got three years.

1197
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.520
Billy Cory talked about this and Joe Rogan,
you've got three years,

1198
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:14.970
Mr Corgan smashing pumpkins.
The industry is going to be there before you.

1199
01:04:14.971 --> 01:04:16.020
It's going to be there after you.

1200
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.200
And the deep state is essentially that the bureaucracy,

1201
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:22.170
this Byzantium complex of people and networks.

1202
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.750
So you could argue whether that's good or bad.
Right,
right.

1203
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:28.610
And why it may be has to exist in some you there all three are a bit,
right,
but,

1204
01:04:28.611 --> 01:04:31.770
but it's not a conspiracy.
You're not saying that there's some sort of,

1205
01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.270
cause I think people think automatically,

1206
01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:36.920
you mean that there's some sort of group that is some sort of shadowy,
right,

1207
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.260
right.
That's because they don't fit well there,
there isn't.
There isn't.

1208
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:43.110
I mean there's,
I've been part of conspiracies,

1209
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:45.750
everybody's been part of a conspiracy.
Ryan Holiday's book conspiracy.

1210
01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:48.660
I wasn't part of that conspiracy,
but that was a conspiracy.

1211
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:53.220
So in Gawker was a conspiracy and actual conspiracy orchestra by Peter Teal and

1212
01:04:53.221 --> 01:04:57.150
Mr [inaudible] or Mr axe or whatever.
And they took down Gawker.

1213
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:02.040
So the deep state conspiracy and shifts in terms of there were people that were

1214
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:04.050
pro Trump and they saw what Trump did.

1215
01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:08.280
A General Flynn got out peace CEO,
you know,
when you leave town,

1216
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.520
that was a major leadership failing.
His is a major moral failing of him.

1217
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.970
General Flynn had Trump's back when that meant something and that was hard.

1218
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.770
Now everybody,
Oh,
you know,
you can,
you can graft,

1219
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:20.490
you can make all that money off of him.
Whatever Flynn had Trump's backs,

1220
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.510
I won't forgive that.
And the,

1221
01:05:22.511 --> 01:05:25.690
the good guys or whatever the deep state people want to talk about.
So He's,

1222
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.140
that's absolutely a moral failing as solution failing.

1223
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:34.120
And a largely that has to deal with his energy,
has masculine energy,

1224
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:37.720
is still very shadow.
He isn't that fully integrated,

1225
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:43.060
fully self possessed man who realizes you're a servant leader,
you're president,

1226
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:44.410
United States,
whatever.
Uh,

1227
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.330
you never heard me say hardly anything about about Obama.

1228
01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:47.980
I still want to this day didn't like his policy.

1229
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.340
Obama had a sense outside of himself and Trump doesn't have that sense of,

1230
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:57.280
you know what,
I'm,
this is a major responsibility.

1231
01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.800
Now the flip side is if Trump felt that way,

1232
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.380
he might have a nervous breakdown because of the attacks.

1233
01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:05.400
And this was all very complicated.
You know,
you're serious.

1234
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.790
<v 1>Be Weird and warped psychological,
uh,
situation because it's like,
yeah,</v>

1235
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.040
if he was maybe more evolved,

1236
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:16.990
let's say all the hate would probably get to the middle way that would crush any

1237
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:20.440
human being's.
Exactly.
And yet he's not.

1238
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.690
So it offers the defense,
which is allowing him

1239
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.240
<v 2>to functions.
Exactly.
Yeah.
That's a,</v>

1240
01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:30.290
that's something I've spent a lot of time thinking about Trump.

1241
01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:34.370
And even when I think about,
and even when I'm criticizing guy,

1242
01:06:34.371 --> 01:06:35.360
just by smile,

1243
01:06:35.361 --> 01:06:38.280
there's just this affection where it's like son of a bitch actually.

1244
01:06:38.281 --> 01:06:40.970
So he is right.
And if he weren't that person,

1245
01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.300
nobody could have withstood the attacks that Trump was stood,

1246
01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:48.020
no human being ever problem.
I don't know from the history of the world,

1247
01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:52.540
but you'd be crushed.
And everyday he just kept showing up.
He doesn't have,

1248
01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:55.190
you know how the presidency agents people and that he does,

1249
01:06:55.220 --> 01:07:00.180
he's a 72 year old man.
I think he's 50 right in my mind.
Right.

1250
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.830
I read his books.
It's going to be aging the way there's no stick.
Exactly.

1251
01:07:03.831 --> 01:07:04.161
You know,

1252
01:07:04.161 --> 01:07:09.161
cause he doesn't have that moral complexity and the nuance that would,

1253
01:07:09.411 --> 01:07:13.310
when you walk in you're like,
holy fuck man,
I'm president.
I'd stays.

1254
01:07:13.311 --> 01:07:17.300
What the fuck is this?
Right?
You just get in like,
Yep,
Oval Office,
son of a bitch,

1255
01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:21.020
bring me a diet coke.
Change those,
change the drapes,
drapes or ugly.

1256
01:07:21.021 --> 01:07:23.210
We need to refurbish this old dusty place.

1257
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.850
<v 1>Yeah.
What?
Okay.</v>

1258
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.180
If for the people watching this that are going to selectively edit it,

1259
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.740
that no matter what either of us say,
gonna do whatever they're going to do.

1260
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.450
If you were to try to offer a little out of this mutually assured destruction,

1261
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:39.400
what,
what would you want out of them?

1262
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:43.240
What would you want to see that might get us out of this mess?

1263
01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.090
I don't think you want to be suing these guys.
And,
and you know,

1264
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:47.310
you were explaining some of this stuff with,

1265
01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.060
with your daughter and your wife before,

1266
01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:53.440
and you can expand on it here if you want,
but I know that's not fun.

1267
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.513
That's not right.

1268
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.420
<v 2>Well,
there's,
there's different layers to it.</v>

1269
01:07:57.421 --> 01:08:00.630
So one is to the really creepy,
evil people.

1270
01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:01.860
They're always gonna be creeping evil.

1271
01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:06.630
And I'm dealing with them in ways that they,
yeah,
they have no idea.

1272
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.490
Um,
but the people in the middle,
the people who they are,
they're on my beat.

1273
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:15.060
This is what gets me there.
Are they everything I do,
they tweet about,

1274
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.260
they write about,
they know what's happening.
Say The fucking right thing.

1275
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:22.520
Just say,
you know what?
I don't like Cernovich he's a scumbag.
This is fucked up.

1276
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:25.790
No more of this bullshit.
Call Your own side.
That would be my message.

1277
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.180
Because if they don't,
people are going to get more and more and more militant.

1278
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:32.630
There's no reason the world,
multiple reporters attend my events.

1279
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.970
If a Jewish guy gets,
it shouldn't matter that you show,

1280
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:38.630
which by just bringing up to show how complicated it is or why Antifa guy beats

1281
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.310
up a Jewish Trump supporter.

1282
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.270
But the article in the Guardian is angry white men party with Cernovich.
No,
no,

1283
01:08:44.271 --> 01:08:47.150
no,
no.
The angry white man beat the fuck out of some Jewish guy.
No,
no,
no.

1284
01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:51.980
You're just,
you're just liars.
So the decent people in the middle,
hey,

1285
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:54.650
I don't need you to love me.
You can dislike me,
that's fine.

1286
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.790
But if you know something's wrong,
I don't,
none of this.
I was my side.

1287
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.670
Don't pretend like you don't know.
Don't pretend like it's not on your beat.

1288
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.370
Don't pretend like you can't write about it when you write about everything else

1289
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:07.350
that I do or that happens to me.
Just do the right thing.
Have some integrity,

1290
01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.810
a gut check time for everybody.
Yeah,
and likewise,
likewise,

1291
01:09:11.811 --> 01:09:15.590
I call that the minute that solute bull shit happened.
I was right there like,

1292
01:09:15.591 --> 01:09:18.350
who are these people that Nazis Lou thing.

1293
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:23.150
You know I was Ca Kovich and you know k.
I.
K.
E.
O.
Yeah,
I was,
you know,
every,

1294
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.760
I was the victim of antisemitic slurs,

1295
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:29.540
which shows you what weird world we live in.
But I just said,
all right dude,

1296
01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.480
like Nazi salutes.
Okay.
This was what I thought it was.

1297
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:35.510
I thought you guys were just,
you know,
trying to have different ideas.

1298
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:39.950
You're bad people and the left 34 this is violence.
Call it out.

1299
01:09:40.230 --> 01:09:42.270
<v 1>Part of the problem that they,
we sort of hit on this early,</v>

1300
01:09:42.271 --> 01:09:44.070
but they can always get away with it.

1301
01:09:44.071 --> 01:09:47.340
Like the machine somehow moves to always let them get away with it.

1302
01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:50.040
So for example,
when Biden put out his,

1303
01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:52.140
his video announcing that he was running for president,

1304
01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:55.830
it was based on the lie that Trump was saying that there were good people on

1305
01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:59.760
both sides of the Charlottesville,
uh,
marches.

1306
01:09:59.761 --> 01:10:03.990
And it's very clear right before that nobody shows it.
But Trump said,

1307
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.330
and his language,
you looked,
the way he speaks is weird.

1308
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:07.980
His sentence structure is weird.

1309
01:10:07.981 --> 01:10:10.860
He backs up and forwards and reverses around and does all these,

1310
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:14.820
these weird things and maybe there'll be a book written none on the psychology

1311
01:10:14.821 --> 01:10:18.330
of why he speaks that way or whatever,
or all his strange,
his strains,

1312
01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:19.500
intonations and all that.

1313
01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.470
But he clearly didn't say they were good people on both sides,

1314
01:10:22.471 --> 01:10:24.060
meaning that the Nazi side was good.

1315
01:10:24.061 --> 01:10:27.510
He met some of the people that didn't want the statue taken down.
We're good.

1316
01:10:27.511 --> 01:10:29.900
And he condemn the races and the way now she's,

1317
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.650
but they know they can get away with it.

1318
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:36.120
So every few months the video just goes viral again because CNN people retweet

1319
01:10:36.121 --> 01:10:37.830
it and the blue check and it's like,
man,

1320
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:43.250
<v 2>okay,
well that's called,
let's call the erosion of trust and the these people,</v>

1321
01:10:43.251 --> 01:10:44.084
they,
if you're,

1322
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.890
here's the way I try to explain to people who don't live in this bizarre will

1323
01:10:47.891 --> 01:10:50.480
that you live in.
And I live in probably in the weeds a little bit,

1324
01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:53.810
even more than you do,
which is,
you know,
imagine,
I don't know,

1325
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:56.900
whoever made this glass company thing,
I drank it and I buy a piece of glass,

1326
01:10:56.901 --> 01:10:59.060
goes in my mouth and I report on,

1327
01:10:59.061 --> 01:11:03.380
I'm bleeding and it'd be like a PR crisis.
Town halls,

1328
01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.490
what is going on?
Like when Tylenol had contaminated bottles.
Yeah.
Town halls,

1329
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.870
brand trust.
You now have,
even Democrats don't trust the media anymore.

1330
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.510
This should be treated if you're in the media and you believe so.
Like,

1331
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:16.950
let's just say I'm,
I'm a,

1332
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:20.880
I'm thinking in terms of a good journalist acting in good faith and I'm speaking

1333
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:22.110
to a journalist back in good faith,

1334
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.610
you don't have any influence anymore because you won't call out your side.

1335
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.000
So then when you do attack me or other people or even people who are

1336
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.190
legitimately bad,
nobody's going to believe you.

1337
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:34.680
You'll never take off the Jacob Walls in the world.
Why?

1338
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:37.830
Because even I don't believe the articles I read a bottom Micah,
you know,

1339
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.200
maybe he did.
Maybe you didn't.
The probably just making it up.

1340
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.340
I just don't believe it.

1341
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:44.520
And if you're a journalist and you really want to tell the truth and you want to

1342
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:49.230
speak truth to power,
you're done.
It's over.
You don't have any influence.

1343
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.300
And the only power,

1344
01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:55.620
they don't think about this because they're not philosophical people.

1345
01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:01.140
The media's power comes from moral legitimacy.
There's this thing,
I wrote it.

1346
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.363
You read it.

1347
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:06.390
You realize that what you're reading about is bad and you want to take some kind

1348
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:10.320
of action.
The minute assault,
tabloid gossip,
you're not going to take any action.

1349
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:11.870
They'll never be able to effectuate a change,

1350
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.110
<v 1>so that's what we're getting.</v>

1351
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:16.410
We're too far gone on this because that's sort of where I'm realizing now.

1352
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:21.330
It's like,
okay,
you know,
2040 years ago we had ABC,
CBS,

1353
01:12:21.331 --> 01:12:25.080
NBC.
They were all basically within a certain prison,
one lean one way,

1354
01:12:25.081 --> 01:12:25.741
one lean the other,

1355
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:30.210
but it was you basically as a nation got a certain amount of similar
information.

1356
01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.210
Now we split it off a gajillion different ways.

1357
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:36.120
There's a lot of good out of that and it's allowed other voices and I would say

1358
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:39.810
I'm included that it's allowed me to do this so I'm not complaining about it

1359
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.943
fully,

1360
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:46.130
but that the ultimate risk is we will continue to just crumble off into

1361
01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:50.100
different ways that you are going to be walking down the street and it'll be

1362
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:53.700
basically like everybody that you look at will be living in another digital

1363
01:12:53.701 --> 01:12:56.640
world and then what does that leave us in reality?

1364
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.340
<v 2>Yeah.
There's multiple ways to thinking about,</v>

1365
01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:01.110
one is a term people are going to hear more and more about us fortune,

1366
01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:03.080
aeration warfare for Gw,

1367
01:13:03.081 --> 01:13:07.790
which is just the idea of you have decentralized armies now where the army's

1368
01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:11.390
aren't in a uniform and you don't know who it is and who isn't.
Right.

1369
01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:13.730
It's decentralized.
Very Philip k Dick.
Yeah.

1370
01:13:13.731 --> 01:13:17.540
And now we're in a world where it's decentralized mimetics where,

1371
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:20.960
well there's nobody really,
even Joe Rogan said this,
he goes,
he said,

1372
01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:24.290
I used to watch CNN and I don't even trust CNN anymore.
That used to be,
ah,

1373
01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.040
that's what,
yeah,

1374
01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.310
that's why they got bad ratings because they were honest and nuanced and

1375
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:29.144
everything like that.

1376
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:32.210
And I think less of probably about this society is going to fracture.

1377
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:36.440
And then I think,
well I remember we had in bend,
that's the way it was.

1378
01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:40.210
We went to Vietnam,
killed a bunch of people,
get,
you know,
dump,

1379
01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.750
dumped all this chemicals,
Agent Orange on them.

1380
01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.600
I've been in museums and Vietnam,
the d,

1381
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:49.370
The form faces and the landmines is still there.

1382
01:13:49.371 --> 01:13:52.850
And because of what the US did in Vietnam and flew over Cambodian airspace at

1383
01:13:52.851 --> 01:13:56.030
Kramer Rouge rose up and they're still a little children with legs being blown

1384
01:13:56.031 --> 01:14:00.260
off because their mind fields everywhere we were United.
So United American,

1385
01:14:00.261 --> 01:14:05.030
we got Vietnam War,
we've got the war in Iraq based on lies about WMDs.

1386
01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.480
We had the Cold War scare is a de centralized world where you actually have to

1387
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.260
consensus.
Maybe that's better.
Maybe it's better that you have to say,

1388
01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:17.410
you know what,
you might not like these people,
but you know,
you're,

1389
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:18.760
you can work together on an issue.

1390
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:22.450
You have to have some kind of consensus now rather than a centralized authority

1391
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:25.810
figure telling you what to do or what to think.
Or it could be awful.

1392
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.490
<v 1>Right.
And then that,
that is the unanswered question I suppose.</v>

1393
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.710
But it's so interesting because I do see for whatever,

1394
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.760
whatever frustrations or distance I have with some of the people on the right

1395
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:38.190
right now,
and we've talked about some of them here.

1396
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.360
It's like I see these people willing to talk about things and it's like they're,

1397
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:46.230
I don't meet any racist.
Well,

1398
01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:49.650
I only get invited by conservatives and Libertarians and people on the right.

1399
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:52.710
I don't see any racist.
I don't see bigots.
I don't see homophobes,

1400
01:14:52.711 --> 01:14:55.470
I don't see misogynists any of these things.

1401
01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:59.910
I see something very rich and interesting happening there and it's not what I

1402
01:14:59.911 --> 01:15:04.140
ever would have thought because I was only getting information from one side.

1403
01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:09.230
<v 2>Well you're being told what to think and this idea that you passively consume</v>

1404
01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:10.591
news,

1405
01:15:10.591 --> 01:15:14.190
and this is ironically that Sophie video she talked about the same thing she

1406
01:15:14.191 --> 01:15:17.190
said were Gen z,
we don't trust anything.
And by the way,
that's why people,

1407
01:15:17.191 --> 01:15:18.810
how do people know I was falsely accused of rape?

1408
01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.230
Well I knew some gen Z or we'll find it out somehow because these people are so

1409
01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:25.470
smart,
you know,
whatever.
So you just,
you get out,
you just put your apo out there.

1410
01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:29.460
You're just say,
look,
here's all the apo on me,
here's all the apple on that.

1411
01:15:29.461 --> 01:15:31.320
Let's just bare our souls.

1412
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.040
And then let people decide whether to,
you know,

1413
01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:38.490
like you are not like you are recognize that most people are complicated.

1414
01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:40.890
And you know,
for example,
Tupac went to prison for rape,

1415
01:15:40.891 --> 01:15:44.620
but they don't want the band to Bach's music from the radio.
Why?
Why is that?

1416
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:46.770
I mean,
he literally went to prison for four years for rape.

1417
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:49.160
<v 1>The new Michael Jackson document.
Exactly.</v>

1418
01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:51.100
And it's like nobody's taking those songs off the radio.

1419
01:15:51.101 --> 01:15:53.900
And I'm not saying they should,
should the weird.
Right,
right.

1420
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:58.060
But it's this weird thing where we selectively pick Roseanne's got to get her

1421
01:15:58.061 --> 01:15:59.530
syndication taken out.
But

1422
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:03.290
<v 2>yeah,
so we have decentralized network where he and I have to have consensus.</v>

1423
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.430
And again,
that's why the blue check marks get so frustrated and angry is,

1424
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:12.520
and their world,
they're very important people and know they're not there.

1425
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:15.110
Their legitimacy comes from the publications they work on,

1426
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.100
but they're shitting on their publications so much by just running garbage for

1427
01:16:19.101 --> 01:16:22.160
the people don't even believe them anymore.
So now what do you have to do?

1428
01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:26.000
You have to,
again,
you have to be an adult.
Kaitlin Johnstone,

1429
01:16:26.001 --> 01:16:29.660
she got a bunch of heat because,
you know,
some of my views are economic populous,

1430
01:16:29.661 --> 01:16:32.000
which left wing,
but I believe in a living wage.

1431
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:35.800
I don't know that I believe $15 is the right amendment wage,
Duh Duh Duh Duh.
But,

1432
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:38.450
um,
some of my ideas would be quite offensive to you,

1433
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:43.220
including that I think CEO pay should be tagged to the median worker salary.

1434
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:46.340
I don't think you should have a see a 300 and I'm,
you know,

1435
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:51.240
going far left man that right.
So if your,
if your,
um,
left eight,

1436
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.390
you're like,
well,
I think service is kind of a bad guy.

1437
01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:58.250
Don't really like them that much,
but,
but that's a good idea.

1438
01:16:58.310 --> 01:17:02.360
Why don't you know,
we worked together on that idea or,
or not,
but,

1439
01:17:02.361 --> 01:17:04.160
but those are the conversations people are going to have.

1440
01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.240
Now you cancerous come out and say,

1441
01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:08.350
this is the way it is or this is the way it was.
And people blind,

1442
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:12.650
they believe you and you.
So give me,
give me some predictions because uh,

1443
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.540
I know people love being in the prediction game.

1444
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:16.160
So you've been sort of critical at Trump here,

1445
01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:19.340
but I know you have a sort of basic,
you sorta like it still,

1446
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:20.720
or at least better than the alternatives.

1447
01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.680
What do you think's going to happen here?
They're,

1448
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.370
the Democrats are having a knife fight.
They should have won 20,
20.

1449
01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.820
It should be no problem.
But there and me,
I was,

1450
01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.120
I'm Kinda like you like first trimester on abortion.
You know,

1451
01:17:32.121 --> 01:17:34.310
I'm a little squishy on that.
Um,

1452
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:39.170
but I'm becoming like just a pro lifer because you'd see this Brian Sims guy

1453
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:42.410
harassing teenage indeed.
It's like frick all these people.

1454
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.410
And unfortunately that is that.
Well,

1455
01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:46.820
let's just sit with them for a second because that is that another perfect

1456
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:50.390
example of the double standards.
It's like if that had been a young conservative,

1457
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:55.070
big buff,
conservative,
uh,
politicians,
state senator,

1458
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.060
anywhere else doing something reverse,
so it wasn't at an abortion clinic,
um,

1459
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:01.160
the media would have destroyed him and they would have said,

1460
01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:02.210
this is Trump's America.

1461
01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:05.030
This is the evil and the patriarchy and all of those things.
And instead,

1462
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.820
did CNN even touch the pieces,
made it,
did they cover the,
the,

1463
01:18:08.821 --> 01:18:11.750
the rally that happened after or any of them?
No,
they ignore it.

1464
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:15.530
Or if they ignore it,
the story becomes a backlash.
Right?
If we're nine pounds,

1465
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:19.010
they pounces on this guy.
You guys are always bouncing.
Exactly.

1466
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:23.750
And what gets me is that's it.
He should be banned from social media.

1467
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:29.090
He used periscope to insight.
He offered money to docs under age girls.

1468
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.040
Yeah.
And so let's go to their house.
Okay.

1469
01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.710
There is no and no world is that not you get banned.

1470
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:36.680
And this by the way happened,
what?
Two days after the,
the Alex Jones,

1471
01:18:36.681 --> 01:18:40.220
Paul Joseph Watson,
right,
exactly.
It's like,
okay bro,
you gotta be in it.

1472
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:42.770
And that's where you're learning that the social media companies,

1473
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.510
they're not regulating behavior.

1474
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.740
They're regulating ideas because if you're regulating behavior and patron had

1475
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:51.950
the same problem with you,
they came in and he said,
we only regulate behavior.

1476
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:55.580
And he calmed me.
Everybody believes in me.
It just came off as so credible.
Like,

1477
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:58.820
well what a sociopath.
And you know,
he just sat here and was like,
yeah,

1478
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.510
no ideas are off limit.
When he said manifest observable behavior,

1479
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:04.960
which is the acronym is mob,
I should've known something was wrong.

1480
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.270
That was memetically.
I found that interesting.
She was,
we followed the mob rule.

1481
01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:12.260
And I'm a rule.
And then even then you're like,
well,

1482
01:19:12.261 --> 01:19:15.050
I mean Lauren southern was in the boat and I don't think she actually did it,

1483
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:19.130
but you could at least there are things where you can disagree,
but you're like,

1484
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:21.740
why are you see where you're coming from?
I think he made the wrong choice,

1485
01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:25.160
but I recognize your reasoning and there's rule and now you realize,
no,
no,
no,

1486
01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:27.110
they're just there.
They're saying ideas are off limits.

1487
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:30.110
You can't talk about certain things.
You know what my final Straw was with them,

1488
01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:31.240
sorry to interrupt,
but it was when,

1489
01:19:31.241 --> 01:19:34.610
when the thing happened with Sargon and I called him,
I texted him first,

1490
01:19:34.611 --> 01:19:38.060
we got on the phone for a second and he immediately said,
you'll never be banned.

1491
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.760
Like jumped before I even said anything.
And I thought,

1492
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:43.340
well that means I'm going to be bad.
You know what I mean?

1493
01:19:43.341 --> 01:19:45.860
Like you'll never be bad at it as if that would've been enough for me.

1494
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.040
Oh well bad everybody else.
But as long as I'm okay,
we're good to go,
you know,

1495
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:53.720
bright and he,
but,
but his rule was around idea behavior.
Okay.

1496
01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:57.050
You're out in public.
If you're out in public saying,
I have these bad ideas.
Okay.

1497
01:19:57.051 --> 01:20:00.170
You know,
maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe that's preventing a certain kind of culture.

1498
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:01.370
I can at least see the reasoning,

1499
01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.760
but this guy is inciting the docks of underage girls sims.

1500
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.790
Now we're talking about,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Now we're,
yeah,

1501
01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:12.810
we're not talking about patriot.
We're talking about this Philadelphia guy under,

1502
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:14.610
no,
that's a use case.
You're just like,
okay,

1503
01:20:14.611 --> 01:20:16.920
you got to ban them and if you don't ban him,
then you don't.
You can't,

1504
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:19.890
you have no rules.
If that guy,
you won't be banned.

1505
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:23.790
Or if I trolled the way I used the troll in 2015 you know,

1506
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:26.310
I don't think a lot of people would shed any tears like,
well,

1507
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:28.980
I mean you shouldn't be calling people fat.
This is kind of being,
you know,

1508
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:33.600
just Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
but behavior,
it isn't ideas,

1509
01:20:33.601 --> 01:20:36.180
but they're targeting ideas and not targeting behavior.

1510
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.350
And if you're on the left,
you can do whatever you want to do on social media.

1511
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:43.820
<v 1>Are you saying the ship,
the ship has sailed,
then you think it's that it's over.</v>

1512
01:20:43.821 --> 01:20:47.420
Trump's not going to fix this.
Even if it was in his purview to fix this,

1513
01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:48.200
you think it's just,
Oh,

1514
01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.550
like it seems like all stories will still come back to this,
this issue.

1515
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.730
<v 2>There's massive college.
So for first of all,</v>

1516
01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:58.050
I said this at the beginning of the last year is going to get worse.

1517
01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:02.160
It's going to get worse.
Social media platforms is just scratching the surface.

1518
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.810
You won't be able to have a bank account.

1519
01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:06.050
You're going to be on a hate and it's already happening.

1520
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.300
Alex Jones is happening to Laura Loomer is happening in a few other people.

1521
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.550
You want to be able to have a bank out.
Now,

1522
01:21:11.551 --> 01:21:16.551
the problem with mass human psychology is it tends towards an overcorrection.

1523
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.810
And if I,

1524
01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:22.470
and I gotta be careful how I say this because I disavow any kind of violence,

1525
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:25.710
but that's always been my position.
That said,

1526
01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:28.980
they're creating people with no livelihood.
Okay?
So you can't have a voice.

1527
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.840
You can't have a bank account.

1528
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.800
Those people are either going to go homeless or we're going to have our own

1529
01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:37.320
homegrown jihad is,
but they're not Muslims.
They'll be on,

1530
01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:40.120
we're creating literally,
which the lesson of terror,

1531
01:21:40.121 --> 01:21:43.110
and this is why I don't like the way of Trump people talk about Muslims,

1532
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:45.410
I'm going to lose 5,000 more.
I don't care.
I've,

1533
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:48.310
I've ever tweeted it repeatedly over and over again or tweak this a lot.

1534
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:51.210
I discussed it.
It's disgusting.
No,
and not only that,

1535
01:21:51.211 --> 01:21:54.530
but you radicalize moderate Muslims because they're like,
well fuck it.

1536
01:21:54.531 --> 01:21:56.820
These people hate me.
But you know,
at least those people,

1537
01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:01.230
modern Muslims are killed more by the jihadis than any other group of people.

1538
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:05.000
So I see the stuff and I'm just not only subjectively disgusted,

1539
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:08.850
but the strategically,
this is not smart.
You want to show people no,
no,

1540
01:22:08.851 --> 01:22:10.020
we have a release valve.

1541
01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:14.040
So what we're doing now is we're creating our own jihadis.
You know,
she,

1542
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:17.130
hot is a poor word,
but they're like,
okay,
you can't make a living.

1543
01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:18.870
You can't have a voice.
You can have a bank account.

1544
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.320
So you can either go be homeless somewhere,
you know,

1545
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:24.000
they'll commit suicide or something.
Or we know what happens.

1546
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.530
We see what happens in the Islamic world.

1547
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:29.370
We see what happens when you leave a little pockets of people to radicalize

1548
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:34.060
versus not difficult to see.
This is mass ecology,
the also this

1549
01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.070
<v 1>pleasure in the destruction of people.
And again,</v>

1550
01:22:37.071 --> 01:22:39.410
you've said at the beginning of this,
you've traded in some of this.

1551
01:22:39.411 --> 01:22:40.070
It's like when,

1552
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:43.760
when Laura Loomer was changed outside of Twitter or when she went to Pelosi's

1553
01:22:43.761 --> 01:22:44.594
house or any of this,

1554
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.640
doesn't even matter what I think about Laura Loomer or whatever I met,

1555
01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:52.520
I met her once briefly.
Um,
the pleasure that I saw people taking in,
Oh,

1556
01:22:52.521 --> 01:22:56.270
this woman,
this,
this is a human being.
She has been destroyed.

1557
01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:00.910
She has been destroyed.
You d person,
her,
your unperson here and,
and,

1558
01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.530
and maybe she's having a mental breakdown or I,
I have no idea.

1559
01:23:03.531 --> 01:23:06.010
You know what I mean?
I actually have sympathy for her in regard,
but it's

1560
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.490
<v 2>like the pleasure that you watch.
The,
the good guys,</v>

1561
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.090
the tolerant people taken destroying people.
I mean,

1562
01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.740
that is a road to hell right there.

1563
01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:19.890
Howard bloom talks about that and the Lucifer principle and there's,
you know,

1564
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.220
like there's,
they're kind of like a reading list.
The human nature,

1565
01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.710
pessimists reading list would be Howard Bloom,
Lucifer principle,

1566
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:30.190
and then sapiens.
And then,
I dunno,
uh,
Jordan Peterson podcast.
It's something,

1567
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.840
but the idea that there's an inherent kind of evil and all of us and Western

1568
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:38.620
civilization and,
and you know,
there was,
this is another thing too,

1569
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:40.510
I don't like about the people who,
you know,
attacking.

1570
01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:44.200
There were Islamic civilizations in a Syrian culture long before Western

1571
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:44.801
civilization.

1572
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:49.240
So the Confucian culture is quite beautiful Japanese Shinto culture.

1573
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:53.260
But the idea of civilization had attains people in a,

1574
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:55.450
in a way that's productive and healthy and good,

1575
01:23:55.690 --> 01:24:00.690
but there's always that nastiness inside of all of us that the inner chimpanzee

1576
01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.690
and you should,
you should police fat,
not trust in yourself and others.

1577
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:07.750
And when people are saying,
lol,
a little lower limb is going to kill herself.

1578
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:11.400
Okay.
That's actually not funny.
You know,
that's not,
that isn't funny at all.

1579
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:15.280
This is funny that she is having these problems and these kinds of challenges

1580
01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.300
and what's worse is there's no road to reformation.

1581
01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:22.830
There's no road to redemption.
What do you do?
She's 24.
Well,

1582
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:24.400
what are you going to do with somebody like that?

1583
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:27.430
And people should think about that just on a human level,

1584
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.300
but they should also think about it as a societal of assistance DEMEC level.

1585
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:35.410
Is it good that we're making people who have nothing to lose?

1586
01:24:35.411 --> 01:24:38.050
Is that good for the social order?
It's actually quite disastrous.

1587
01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:43.051
People take it for granted because they're Glib and they haven't lived through

1588
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:46.900
real adversity and maybe they haven't even read history.

1589
01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:50.570
You there parts of the world,
you're just,
you know,
we're right here,
boom,

1590
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:51.970
car car bomb goes off.

1591
01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:56.680
Do you think a lot of that is just sort of a function of western success that we

1592
01:24:56.681 --> 01:24:59.770
don't know?
I mean,
we're roughly the same age.
You know,
it's been,

1593
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:01.540
it's been a pretty good ride.

1594
01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.480
It been a great run and it was a better run before us because,
uh,

1595
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:09.970
the United States at a time post World War II had a booming economy.

1596
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:14.050
They have low immigration.
So you had all this space,
the California dream,

1597
01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:18.670
and have a good job.
People middle class lifestyle in California used to be,

1598
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:21.010
you'd have a house,
two cars,
take a two week vacation,

1599
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:24.430
maybe have a boat that was just like a normal middle class life.

1600
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:29.150
Now that's like a millionaire life,
right?
I'm gonna [inaudible] bunker.

1601
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:34.870
Right,
right,
right.
Exactly.
And so we all got spoiled.

1602
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:36.010
We all got used to it.

1603
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:40.420
And then the problem everybody's making is you have left wing populism,

1604
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:42.670
which is radical socialism,
which has been tried.

1605
01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.650
We know how that ends empirically on how it ends.

1606
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.320
And then we have right wing populous.

1607
01:25:46.321 --> 01:25:48.640
And that's how people describe it is I'm like,
I'm economic populous.

1608
01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:49.300
What does that mean?

1609
01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:53.770
I care about the median wage earner when I'm at Costco and I'm walking out and

1610
01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:56.770
there's a person whose job is to check my receipt.
I'm like,
ah,
you know,

1611
01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:58.420
I hope that person is able to pay their bills.

1612
01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:00.820
I hope that person is able to maybe have a little bit of leisure time.

1613
01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.710
One thing AOC said that I liked,

1614
01:26:02.711 --> 01:26:06.920
and this is why people who sleep on her making mistake is there's the sense that

1615
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:09.470
as a human being and the richest country in the world,

1616
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:14.180
the only conference you deserve,
our animalistic her words,
she's so good.

1617
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:16.220
Or whoever is their handlers,
animalistic,

1618
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.930
animalistic desires.
And I thought,
what a great way to frame it,

1619
01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:23.060
where you're saying you're conservatives.

1620
01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.420
You think only people have the right as of their base animalistic desires,

1621
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:30.080
and we want something more and the human spirit always wants something more.

1622
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:34.250
There's always this aspirational vision and those are my views.
Yet we do.

1623
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:37.160
We want the difference between me and the left and the Socialists.

1624
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:40.910
I want you to have a living wage,
but to have a living wage,
we have to,

1625
01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:44.460
we have to cap immigration because it's a basic supply and demand issue.

1626
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.190
This is just basic economics.

1627
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:50.530
Somehow we forget this and we want people to have a good way to,

1628
01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.550
we want people to have those.
Libertarians would disagree with you,

1629
01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:55.550
even though you said you were,
you sort of have a lot of libertarian leanings.

1630
01:26:55.551 --> 01:26:58.810
They would say the pure libertarians would say open the borders,
no tires,

1631
01:26:59.490 --> 01:27:02.880
and let's pretend there's no democracy and people wouldn't come in and vote for

1632
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.960
liberty.
You had that.
That's the beauty of the libertarian position.

1633
01:27:05.961 --> 01:27:08.750
It's kind of like the NRO capitalism,
you know,
they have,

1634
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.960
I like it intellectually.
I mean that's what I would say when I have some,

1635
01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:14.150
I've had some of these medical guys on and it's like,
I like it intellectually,

1636
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.250
but I,
but this is where I would say a classical liberal,

1637
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:19.250
it's just slightly basically like a more realistic libertarian.
Yeah.
Look,

1638
01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:22.340
what are you going to do when they come in and we abide by the nonaggression

1639
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:24.230
principle.
Great.
That's not human nature.

1640
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:27.380
What are you gonna do when they come in and take your shit?
We need weapons,

1641
01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:28.970
but guess what would you give men weapons?

1642
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.950
This is the problem where like libertarianism in capitalist and it's a very sort

1643
01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:35.570
of male brain,

1644
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:41.090
completely ignorant of history and just human nature and human psychology where

1645
01:27:41.091 --> 01:27:42.620
you're like,
okay,
but when you,

1646
01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:45.830
if you follow the nonaggression principle and you give men guns,

1647
01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.840
they don't just keep falling.

1648
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.840
The nonaggression principle that changes the psychology.
Now you have an army,

1649
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:54.770
will armies do things,
mission,
creed.
This is again,
mass ecology.

1650
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:58.910
More people should read extraordinary delusions and popular madness of crowds

1651
01:27:59.270 --> 01:28:01.460
and you're like,
oh,
people talk about the Salem witch trials.
Okay,

1652
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.670
we have a witch trials now you're a witch.
You're racist.
You're home.
Okay,

1653
01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:07.910
this is all happening in the differences.
They would burn them literally.

1654
01:28:07.911 --> 01:28:11.000
Although actually it's a historical,
not that many people being burned.

1655
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:14.000
This is something that comes part of the popular myth,
those,

1656
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:16.460
but now we're making people in a way,

1657
01:28:16.461 --> 01:28:19.990
we're making it so people can't make a living,
which is,
I don't,

1658
01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.270
I don't want to say it's worse than killing a person,
but that's,
I mean,
I mean,

1659
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:28.130
think about it.
I got a guide,
a fired once.
I felt really bad about it.
It wasn't,

1660
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:32.240
it wasn't,
I did nothing wrong so to speak,
but just on a human level.

1661
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.800
And I was like,
um,
you know,
it's kind of rough.

1662
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:36.770
I report it truthfully on what he said and blah,
blah,
blah.
And,

1663
01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:39.890
but this guy will be fine.
He was Harvard educated,
privileged,

1664
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:44.960
and you think about it,
your executing people,
this is but,
but,
but,

1665
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.890
but,
but,

1666
01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.850
but meanwhile are you got to take a lot of people out to get to their youtube,

1667
01:28:49.851 --> 01:28:53.870
but if you're in prison,
you better come.
Well,
yeah,
but I love the left is,
Oh,
you,

1668
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:57.860
oh you,
you commit you prison.
You got to come back into society.
Oh,

1669
01:28:57.861 --> 01:29:00.710
you made a bad tweet.
You made a bad joke.
You said a bad thing.

1670
01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:05.220
You said a bad thing about Muslims.
Loomer you know,
like the Uber thing,
you know,

1671
01:29:05.221 --> 01:29:09.030
I was like,
Loomer what are you doing bro?
Come on man.
Come on.
You know,
I love it.

1672
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.380
I love the kid,
but I'm like,
come on Bro.

1673
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:14.940
But that said that that doesn't give you your executed.

1674
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:19.470
You don't deserve,
that doesn't merit that behavior.
That Marissa behavior.
Like,

1675
01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:22.770
Hey,
you need to come on in and like,
come on Bro,
this is,
this is bullshit.

1676
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:26.340
And there's no sense of that.
They want to crush and destroy people.

1677
01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:28.920
So what's going to happen,
it's going to be at the trends are,

1678
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:34.020
and I said this a year and a half ago,
domestic terrorism,

1679
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:36.120
America's you similar come like a way of life,

1680
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.330
which is just going to be like a thing like in Beirut or whatever.

1681
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:40.111
You're drinking,

1682
01:29:40.111 --> 01:29:43.500
your espresso and everything and there's always going to be this cloud is that

1683
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:48.300
something could pop off at any time because everybody's being radicalized,

1684
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:53.100
everybody's being attacked.
And I,
I'm the guy here,
like,
please don't,

1685
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.890
don't let this happen.
There's way too ways to avoid it.

1686
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:59.820
Studied the Islamic world study high,
treat moderate Islams.
Uh,
you know,

1687
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:03.450
you've got to have a pipeline for people.
And I don't like to say that with us.

1688
01:30:03.451 --> 01:30:06.030
My prediction.
Why do you think you haven't been booted?

1689
01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:09.870
Why were you not included in this whole crew?
I broke a number of reasons.

1690
01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.730
One is I broke a lot of legitimate news stories.

1691
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:17.750
So I went from troll whenever that is to commentate or whatever that is to like

1692
01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:21.150
know,
like Susan Ryan,
say like I broke that.
I'm asking you.

1693
01:30:21.151 --> 01:30:22.110
So this is a big story.

1694
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:26.430
I broken a lot of legitimately newsworthy subjects and I cleaned up my act.

1695
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:31.110
Um,
there,
there are just certain things.
Well,
and also to luck,

1696
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:35.160
I've never cared about the transgender thing other than they have a tough go

1697
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:39.510
hold there.
Only two genders.
Fucking Glib.
I don't,
I don't like that.
This is Glib.

1698
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.600
These are people.
Body dysmorphia is a serious thing,
you know,

1699
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:46.740
there's just that really nastiness under earner current of a lot of this

1700
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:50.830
rhetoric all over.
So I've never really cared about that other than the,
you know,

1701
01:30:50.831 --> 01:30:52.380
this is there.
They got a tough go,
you know,

1702
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:56.460
I'm not going to add to that and this on stuff,
I've always been like,
you know,

1703
01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:57.850
I don't like the way people talk about it.

1704
01:30:57.851 --> 01:31:00.120
And those are the two triggers right now.

1705
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.820
So if you're a trans folk or an Islamophobe,

1706
01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.050
that right now is what's getting people going to get people moved away.

1707
01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:11.850
And I just happened to fall on the right side of the issue.
And then also there,

1708
01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:16.500
there was a sense I was breaking real news and so it just,

1709
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:19.230
I think I just did the lines moved and I just barely made it.
All right,

1710
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:22.410
so how do,
if we had to,
we did some predictions in some way,

1711
01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:25.500
but if we have to predict what the blue check guys watching this right now,

1712
01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:28.890
what are they going to write about?
Um,
number of things.

1713
01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.170
One is that they don't write about it at all.

1714
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.320
They didn't write about hoaxed 106 countries.
I did,

1715
01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:39.240
I played a little trick on them when I released the trailer for hoaxed.

1716
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:43.080
I deleted every tweet other than the trailer.

1717
01:31:43.770 --> 01:31:48.120
And you know what they wrote about Cernovich deletes tweets trying to cover his

1718
01:31:48.121 --> 01:31:50.430
butt.
They didn't write about the trailer.
Why?

1719
01:31:50.431 --> 01:31:54.600
Cause it looked good because you're like,
Whoa,
this is a real production,

1720
01:31:54.601 --> 01:31:58.110
real quality film.
They never went after Jordan Peterson for being in the film.

1721
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:02.350
So I was,
I predicted for sure.
I'm like poor Jordan.
Cause when Jordan did it,

1722
01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:05.680
he was,
you know,
he wasn't Jordan fucking Peterson.
He was like Jordan here said,

1723
01:32:05.681 --> 01:32:08.390
you know,
hi,
how are you?
I was bigger than him at the time actually.

1724
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:09.930
So he was happy to be at,
you know.
Yeah.

1725
01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.390
And they never went after him for it because the film is so good,

1726
01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:14.830
they don't actually want people watching it.

1727
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:20.040
So this interview I think is so powerful that the angry little weird left

1728
01:32:22.181 --> 01:32:23.200
people.
The freaks,

1729
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:26.920
the one weird Mike and the people who support my family being harassed.

1730
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.090
They'll do all the dunking on Twitter,
but no outlet media.

1731
01:32:31.091 --> 01:32:34.390
I may be maybe gutter gutter,
stuff like that.
I'll put a little thing here,
there.

1732
01:32:34.391 --> 01:32:36.760
The daily beast,
a little gutter thing there.
Daily beast by the way,

1733
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:40.030
they take money from Qatar.
Isn't that interesting?
Interesting.

1734
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:41.890
How foreign influence is a real problem.

1735
01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:46.060
Mike Cernovich homophobe guitar,
you go to jail for being gay,

1736
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.280
but we'll take your money.
Well,
the doe,

1737
01:32:47.281 --> 01:32:50.680
her forearm and flies first class and everything like this.

1738
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.530
But other than the real gutter outlets,
it'll be ignored in the gunner.

1739
01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:56.710
Outlist might ignore it too,

1740
01:32:56.711 --> 01:33:01.390
because they don't want people to see the full unedited conversation.

1741
01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:03.940
I mean,
would you just can't,
it's like,
here's my past to Phillip said,

1742
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:04.661
here's what I've done.

1743
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:09.661
I don't have any fear of confronting it that that bothers them because they,

1744
01:33:10.471 --> 01:33:14.050
they want the cray car coachers and they're not able to create a car.

1745
01:33:14.051 --> 01:33:18.460
Katra so I think like with hoax movie,
they'll pretend this never happened.

1746
01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:22.330
I'm going to actually look down while sitting right in front of you to see if we

1747
01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:24.670
hit on all the,
all the big stuff here.

1748
01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.340
Yeah,
we pretty,
we pretty much did let the chips fall where they may,
I suppose.

1749
01:33:33.570 --> 01:33:36.120
Uh,
my pleasure.
Um,
you know,
it's,

1750
01:33:36.150 --> 01:33:40.130
it's unfortunate office of Mike ibn and we forgot to talk about him.
Who,
um,

1751
01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.250
he's like orthodox Jewish Trump supporter.
Oh,

1752
01:33:42.251 --> 01:33:44.890
this is the guy that did the Michael Moore.
Oh wait,
let's,
let's,
yeah,

1753
01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:49.440
so this is the guy who did the parody,
AOC press,
Twitter accounts,

1754
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:53.140
which said it was a parody 100% yes.

1755
01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:57.700
This is allowed to be on Twitter.
They booted him about a week ago.
Yup.

1756
01:33:57.730 --> 01:34:02.560
And that's because he was too effective?
Yeah.
One of the things he tweeted out,

1757
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:06.580
it showed up on my timeline and I was like,
oh,
that's funny.

1758
01:34:06.581 --> 01:34:10.120
It was actually a real tweet copy and pasted from AOC because some of the things

1759
01:34:10.121 --> 01:34:12.790
she said are there beyond,
it's like Poe's law.

1760
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.990
You don't even know if it's true or not.

1761
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.660
And because he was funny in effective band,

1762
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:18.810
<v 1>so,
okay.
So they banned this guy for parity.</v>

1763
01:34:18.811 --> 01:34:21.000
Even though they say you're allowed to have parody accounts,

1764
01:34:21.001 --> 01:34:23.520
as long as you say it's a parody account.
Now of course they're not abandoned.

1765
01:34:23.521 --> 01:34:26.280
All the Trump parody accounts,
and I'm sure there's more than two.
There's Cerner,

1766
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:29.210
there's Cernovich parody account.
I mean there's,
I'm sure there's,
we haven't,

1767
01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:29.361
they,

1768
01:34:29.361 --> 01:34:32.670
they fricking make them every day and they blow and I block them and then they

1769
01:34:32.671 --> 01:34:34.980
make more of them the same,
you know,
the same people over and over.
Okay,
fine.

1770
01:34:34.981 --> 01:34:35.810
Who Cares?
Yeah.

1771
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:40.640
<v 2>Um,
so what,
what happened to this guy?
I mean they just banned them.</v>

1772
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:44.930
They claimed cause then they ban his real account to right being as real account

1773
01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.640
and they claimed his name by the way,
Mike,
the office of Michael Suspect.

1774
01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.410
I think his last name's Morrison,
but I'm not really sure.
Okay.
Yeah.

1775
01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.400
But he's a cool guy.
He's been to all the Trump things and he was just,

1776
01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:58.760
he was just too effective and they to claim that he was coordinating with other

1777
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:00.980
accounts.
But they wouldn't tell you why or how.

1778
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:03.830
And I mean you want to talk about these guys that we've been talking about,

1779
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:05.030
this whole,
this whole blue check crew.

1780
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:07.390
I mean they coordinate with anonymous accounts.
Exactly.

1781
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:10.190
Can you explain a little bit of that?
Because I know this is going on.

1782
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:11.990
I have my ways that I know also,

1783
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.780
and some of these people have real stupid cause they keep trying to get me,

1784
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.701
but it's like they're,

1785
01:35:15.701 --> 01:35:20.390
they're using anonymous accounts that seem like it's nobody to selectively edit

1786
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:20.750
the videos.

1787
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:24.230
Then suddenly all the daily beast and vox and Huffpo reporters at both of you

1788
01:35:24.231 --> 01:35:28.240
guys,
they then retweet it all and it's like,
well that's strange.
You retweet in,

1789
01:35:28.241 --> 01:35:31.030
uh,
an account with six followers.
And it's like,
it's like,

1790
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.230
how'd you find this information laundering?

1791
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.630
And here's the way information laundering works.

1792
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:40.070
You have something as a reporter that you couldn't post on your own thing

1793
01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:43.430
because you know it's garbage.
So you either yourself,

1794
01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:44.840
and I think a lot of times it's them,

1795
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:47.600
you either yourself or through these other bot networks,

1796
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:51.770
have some them in a throwaway account,
put this video up,

1797
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:56.180
and then you have the level below.
You start to retweet it and then you say,
oh,

1798
01:35:56.181 --> 01:35:59.570
there's this video.
I'm not vouching for the truth or falsity of it,

1799
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.450
but here's this thing out there that I could talk about now.

1800
01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.390
And that's how they launder information.
That's what that guy,

1801
01:36:05.391 --> 01:36:07.070
I am 99% sure I want to get this wrong,

1802
01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:10.610
but I think it was the CEO or the editor in chief,
I think of gaining knowledge.

1803
01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.210
Oh,
they did was they went after me and you know,
one of these,
I'm all right.

1804
01:36:14.211 --> 01:36:14.930
Whatever it is,

1805
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:18.720
they take this quote where I say the alt right from years ago when the,

1806
01:36:18.721 --> 01:36:22.010
all right,
we're still much more a morphous.
I say the thing about it being,

1807
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:24.680
you know,
let's say this about the racist.
No,
good.

1808
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.380
Then I say this thing about the joke makers in the meme makers,
one of they,

1809
01:36:28.381 --> 01:36:30.590
somebody selectively edited a random anonymous guy.

1810
01:36:30.591 --> 01:36:33.500
The editor in chief then retweets it.
And then I say to him,
well,

1811
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:35.840
how come you didn't put it in the previous sentence?
Then he ignores me.

1812
01:36:35.841 --> 01:36:39.050
It's like,
exactly.
And so that's one way the information launder.

1813
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:42.110
Another way that they do is they do have bots.
So there's been articles,

1814
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:46.190
this is what I love about being a lefty.
There's articles,
um,

1815
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:49.160
there's people again on Twitter claiming they have revenge porn of me.

1816
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.940
And as long as I'm in good shape,
you know,
but it's technically a sex crime.

1817
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.190
That's sexual harassment.
By the way,
this is again us,

1818
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.530
you know me being glib because I live online so much.

1819
01:36:57.531 --> 01:36:59.720
So could you imagine if I tweet it out,

1820
01:36:59.721 --> 01:37:02.840
I have a sex tape of Anderson Cooper and I'm going to post it on Twitter.

1821
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:07.790
How long would I survive Twitter?
30 seconds.
Five minutes.
But they,
oh yeah,

1822
01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:09.170
we have a sex tape.
We're going to post it.

1823
01:37:09.171 --> 01:37:12.890
Here is a picture of Cernovich with his genitals blown out and are blurred out.

1824
01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:16.220
And we're going to post this and here's no problem.
Not only that,

1825
01:37:16.221 --> 01:37:18.860
but the daily beast,
which again,
they'd have taken money from Qatar.

1826
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:23.450
They wrote an article saying far right wing trolls get a dose of their own

1827
01:37:23.451 --> 01:37:25.520
medicine.
And the article was,
ha ha ha.

1828
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:28.070
Isn't it funny that this is happening to Cernovich is failing?

1829
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.750
Rolling Stone wrote a piece.
Oh,

1830
01:37:29.751 --> 01:37:33.870
isn't it funny that Cernovich's wife is getting death threats because,
oh lol.

1831
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.190
So not only,
so either they,

1832
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:41.720
so they information launder or they characterize it a ways.
It's kind of funny,

1833
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:44.750
but they're there.

1834
01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.650
They're making a mistake because they admit that these people use bots.

1835
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.940
And that's why I'm linking it back to the Bob thing.
Yeah.

1836
01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:54.290
Because when they write about a splinter wrote an article about two people who

1837
01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:57.510
harass you and the same people who were asked my family,
they,

1838
01:37:57.570 --> 01:38:00.690
there's an article going,
oh,
they're using bots to troll the alt right.
It's like,

1839
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.110
oh.
So in other words,
you're admitting that you're using bots and that's,

1840
01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:05.250
and that's how they phrase it.

1841
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:08.670
And one of the articles is actually how I found at the AOC was actually

1842
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:11.760
roommates with one of the people going after my wife and daughter.
So,

1843
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.600
so there's a lot of things in play in that regard.
But yeah,

1844
01:38:15.601 --> 01:38:19.260
the media admits the far left wing or they call them weird Twitter or whatever

1845
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:23.130
they admit the weird left uses bobs and that's all being overlooked.

1846
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:27.480
Now the problem with Twitter,
if we're looking at chess pieces,

1847
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:31.730
is do they think,
I don't talk to people in Congress,
right?
They do.

1848
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:35.490
The congressman talked to me in public,
right?
Yeah.
I mean,
you can,
you can see it.

1849
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:39.270
So all of this stuff that the media is using to say,
lol,
isn't it funny?

1850
01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.090
Cernovich's wife is getting death threats and his daughter getting death
threats.

1851
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:44.660
Hahaha.
It's good for him.
It's like you,

1852
01:38:44.661 --> 01:38:49.661
you think that I haven't not only sent that to every reporter who says that.

1853
01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.270
So one day they'll get sued,

1854
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.460
they'll get gawkers that'll all turn up in discovery.

1855
01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:58.230
I've sent out to every legal department of Facebook and I building that dossier

1856
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:00.360
in Congress.
So they have no idea.

1857
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:03.150
They basically the social media companies who think they're getting away with

1858
01:39:03.151 --> 01:39:05.280
these double standards there,

1859
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:10.850
that you just take a step back and think that if it's Mike Cernovich who's very

1860
01:39:11.191 --> 01:39:14.850
nice to people now he's getting death rescues his wife and child,

1861
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.610
you think that he's not doing something about that behind the scenes.

1862
01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:23.230
Do you think it's weird that this is what your life is this absurd?
Yeah.
Uh,

1863
01:39:23.231 --> 01:39:27.960
I think about every day how I ruined my life by ever becoming a public figure.

1864
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:32.070
And I could just write my books and live a good life and nobody knew who I was

1865
01:39:32.071 --> 01:39:36.390
and were for Trump ran.
I was in a Parisian cafe just riding,

1866
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:38.550
having fun with my wife,
walking around,

1867
01:39:38.551 --> 01:39:40.650
looking in Notredame before it burned down and everything.

1868
01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:46.220
And every day I think I ruined my life by becoming a public figure because just

1869
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:50.880
the fundamental and decency of it all is not something that I was prepared for.

1870
01:39:50.881 --> 01:39:51.960
I'm prepared for a hit,

1871
01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:57.590
but when it's my family being targeted and the same people who hit me and follow

1872
01:39:58.981 --> 01:40:03.780
everything I do can't say something about that,
that that does make you in a way,

1873
01:40:03.781 --> 01:40:04.650
it makes you sad.

1874
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:10.250
And the problem with making people like me sad is sometimes I hold my daughter

1875
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:14.010
and I think about the people who are trying to hurt her and I think about the

1876
01:40:14.011 --> 01:40:19.011
people who know is happening and they're not saying anything about it and I wish

1877
01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:20.310
that they would do the right thing.

1878
01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:24.930
I wish the media would do the right thing and start policing themselves and quit

1879
01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:28.560
pretending like it isn't newsworthy and quit pretending new knowledge.

1880
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:31.740
Here's a great example of two new knowledge.
The CEO,

1881
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:34.250
they talk about disinformation,

1882
01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:38.010
but he got caught buying Russian boss or people and then he goes to the news and

1883
01:40:38.011 --> 01:40:42.240
the news says,
oh,
according to the CEO of new knowledge,

1884
01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:46.410
Russian boss falling Roy Moore.
But when he bought the box and then Renee,

1885
01:40:46.411 --> 01:40:49.560
I forget her last name,
goes on,
Sam Harris goes into a broken Russian bots,

1886
01:40:49.561 --> 01:40:52.150
conspiracy theorists far right people.
I was like,
wait a minute,
what?

1887
01:40:52.151 --> 01:40:56.680
What about your CEO though by People Bob's.
So this,
this idea,
this,

1888
01:40:56.681 --> 01:41:00.220
this information that's all these people that write about disinformation and I

1889
01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:03.040
always email them at their official work office so that everybody knows and I

1890
01:41:03.041 --> 01:41:06.520
always CCH Ron legal just so there's a record because one day,

1891
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:09.130
one thing you are going to get sued and then that'll turn up like,
well yeah,

1892
01:41:09.131 --> 01:41:11.260
why didn't,
why didn't you write about these threats?

1893
01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:13.300
But if you write about this information,

1894
01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:15.430
why don't you write about this inflammation on the left?

1895
01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.440
How many articles are there about,
did you get,

1896
01:41:17.441 --> 01:41:21.580
there's this information about you,
they don't correct it.
And this is again,

1897
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:24.190
is going to just further radicalize people further,

1898
01:41:24.191 --> 01:41:27.940
eliminate public trust and take society in a bad direction.

1899
01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:33.000
<v 1>All right,
so let's just do one more thing to really troll the trolls here.</v>

1900
01:41:33.001 --> 01:41:33.870
So all the people,

1901
01:41:33.871 --> 01:41:36.450
let's say that some of these blue check guys are gonna write some of this stuff

1902
01:41:36.451 --> 01:41:37.530
and buzzfeed and the rest of it.

1903
01:41:37.531 --> 01:41:42.300
Is there anything that you would like to say directly about the alt right about

1904
01:41:42.301 --> 01:41:44.560
white supremacy,
about do

1905
01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.660
<v 2>any of that?
I'll give them a headline for,</v>

1906
01:41:47.661 --> 01:41:52.490
I'll give them a headline about Trump because this is something I was talking to

1907
01:41:52.491 --> 01:41:55.840
'em because what people don't realize is yeah,
we always have Jews,

1908
01:41:56.370 --> 01:41:59.210
Orthodox Jews at 90% pro Trump,
right?
You just,

1909
01:41:59.211 --> 01:42:02.000
you don't see people with the kippah and you know,
the Hasidic Jewish community.

1910
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:06.950
So I was,
I was taken aside by very,
uh,
a very kind person and he goes,
you know,

1911
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:10.280
I wish you had said something more about,
this is two years ago.
It's like,
oh,

1912
01:42:10.281 --> 01:42:13.010
we should have said something more about the Nazi people on everything.
And I go,

1913
01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:15.830
Eh,
it's not really my job to be the Adl light.
You know,

1914
01:42:15.831 --> 01:42:18.980
plus people have lied about me so I don't even know.
And he goes,
okay,

1915
01:42:18.981 --> 01:42:22.670
he was very compassionate and I wish that I had to realize,
yeah,
I do.

1916
01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.880
There is a problem with antisemitism in America.
The just,
they're just subject,

1917
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:28.760
there's been shootings now.
So that seems like an obvious thing to say.

1918
01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:34.520
And I,
and the problem,
Trump should come out more strongly against it,

1919
01:42:34.521 --> 01:42:38.840
but then the medial say Trump admits his supporters and I summarize,
right?

1920
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:41.960
So if you're a journalist and you actually give a fuck and you actually want to

1921
01:42:41.961 --> 01:42:46.340
make the world a better place,
you would give room for people like Trump to say,

1922
01:42:46.341 --> 01:42:49.100
I didn't realize this was a problem.
It's a fucking problem.

1923
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:51.710
And if you're about that life,
you need to get away from me.

1924
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:55.280
And if you could just say,
okay,
Trump,
clear stance,
you guys antisemitism.

1925
01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:59.570
If that were the story,
did the incentive structure would be to,
to create that.

1926
01:42:59.571 --> 01:43:02.600
But I'm saying that he hasn't done that or that they won't acknowledge it.

1927
01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.380
He's done it cause he's done it to the idea that he's an anti Semitism no,
no.

1928
01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:10.490
The idea is,
and it isn't.
Um,
but I think a,
a just a real clear,

1929
01:43:10.491 --> 01:43:13.910
strong condemnation along with,
if you're about that life,

1930
01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.570
I don't want your votes,
don't come to my rallies,
just stay away from me.

1931
01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:20.450
And then the media,
they're still going to lie.
There's still going to spend,

1932
01:43:20.451 --> 01:43:21.920
they're still going to talk about dog whistles.

1933
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:26.600
But that's something I wish I had done sooner.
The Islamophobia.
Um,
I,

1934
01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:29.270
that's why,
you know,
I've just been very clear about it.

1935
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:32.030
I remember I was at my own event in DC and I was like,
oh,

1936
01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:35.240
people are talking about is I'm on my guy,
you know,
whatever is moderate Islam.

1937
01:43:35.241 --> 01:43:38.750
And people are like,
there's no such thing as a moderate Islam and my own event,

1938
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:42.860
people are like yelling at me because there's pro.
So I'm like,
okay,
you know,

1939
01:43:42.861 --> 01:43:45.470
this is okay or not the Adl light.

1940
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
I don't need to be tweeting about Islamophobia everyday.

1941
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:50.270
You're gonna Semitism everyday or whatever the issue is every day.

1942
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:54.170
But really do think that as,
and this is the left to call out the,

1943
01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:55.760
I want to kill white people.
Bullshit too.

1944
01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:00.080
If you are a public figure and you're in your eye,
a leader,

1945
01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:04.970
act like a leader.
And if you see bad trends developing,
hey,
it's okay.

1946
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.370
Just be very clear about it.
Be Clear that you're not cool with that.

1947
01:44:07.371 --> 01:44:08.240
You're not down with that.

1948
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.930
Try to steer the world and a little bit of a better direction and know that this

1949
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:13.350
is going to take a long time.
Yeah.

1950
01:44:13.650 --> 01:44:16.290
<v 1>All right man.
Well on that note,
I hope we cleaned up some of this.</v>

1951
01:44:16.291 --> 01:44:20.370
The chips will fall where they may and uh,
we'll both keep going I suppose.

1952
01:44:20.371 --> 01:44:24.570
And my pleasure.
Thanks again.
Yeah,
good talking to Ya.
And uh,

1953
01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:26.590
make sure you're subscribed to our channel.
We,

1954
01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.700
we crossed the million subscribers this week.
I normally don't do promos.

1955
01:44:29.701 --> 01:44:32.760
I meant they're not a promo.
We crossed a million subscribers this week,

1956
01:44:32.761 --> 01:44:36.390
but they're just crushing us on the algorithm and the unsubscribed and all that

1957
01:44:36.391 --> 01:44:39.030
nonsense.
So make sure you're subscribed.
Click that little bell.

1958
01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:39.781
Thanks for watching.

1959
01:44:39.781 --> 01:44:43.950
This will be up as a podcast audio podcast later this afternoon,
and,
uh,

1960
01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:47.160
we're back to the regularly scheduled programming next week.
Thanks everybody.
