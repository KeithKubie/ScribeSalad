thing that is going to lead us away from
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390
thing that is going to lead us away from
using fossil fuels until to something

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
using fossil fuels until to something
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950

from the fuels we're using now when we
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.599
from the fuels we're using now when we
find something that's cleaner cheaper

above right we're not going to quit

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
above right we're not going to quit
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229
above right we're not going to quit
using fossil fuels just because we

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
using fossil fuels just because we
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.110
using fossil fuels just because we
decide oh well I want to run my car on

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

broccoli or whatever it doesn't work
that way we have to have an alternative

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
that way we have to have an alternative
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.330
that way we have to have an alternative
that is workable so I think the price

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
that is workable so I think the price
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100
that is workable so I think the price
the higher prices while painful are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
the higher prices while painful are

the higher prices while painful are
maybe part of the transition to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
maybe part of the transition to
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819
maybe part of the transition to
something else and what is that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
something else and what is that
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680
something else and what is that
something else I can't say but we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
something else I can't say but we
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150
something else I can't say but we
clearly see a whole lot of money going

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
clearly see a whole lot of money going
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.060
clearly see a whole lot of money going
into alternative energy now look google

think that's the to bet on solar and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
think that's the to bet on solar and
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030
think that's the to bet on solar and
they may be right they could be wrong

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
they may be right they could be wrong
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.969
they may be right they could be wrong
but the point is we're not going to quit

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
but the point is we're not going to quit
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520
but the point is we're not going to quit
using what we're using now I think for

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
using what we're using now I think for
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530
using what we're using now I think for
for decades to come because it's taken

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
for decades to come because it's taken
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240
for decades to come because it's taken
us a century or more to get where we are

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
us a century or more to get where we are
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.090
us a century or more to get where we are
so at the transition away from oil and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
so at the transition away from oil and
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.560
so at the transition away from oil and
other fossil fuels is going to be a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
other fossil fuels is going to be a
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.560
other fossil fuels is going to be a
protracted transition because we have so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
protracted transition because we have so
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539
protracted transition because we have so
much infrastructure already in place to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
much infrastructure already in place to
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.360
much infrastructure already in place to
use what we have

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370
 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.710
well I think so one of the things that I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
well I think so one of the things that I
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060
well I think so one of the things that I
think would be a smart move is to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
think would be a smart move is to
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.590
think would be a smart move is to
encourage more use of natural gas

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
encourage more use of natural gas
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
encourage more use of natural gas
particularly in terms of natural gas

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
particularly in terms of natural gas
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.810
particularly in terms of natural gas
fueled vehicles natural gas fueled

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
fueled vehicles natural gas fueled
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670
fueled vehicles natural gas fueled
vehicles are they met less greenhouse

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
vehicles are they met less greenhouse
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.340
vehicles are they met less greenhouse
gases then then do gasoline or diesel

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
gases then then do gasoline or diesel
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.470
gases then then do gasoline or diesel
vehicles they emit virtually no air

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480
vehicles they emit virtually no air
 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.890
vehicles they emit virtually no air
pollutants and they are on a BTU basis

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900
pollutants and they are on a BTU basis
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.510
pollutants and they are on a BTU basis
their fuel is about a third cheaper than

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
their fuel is about a third cheaper than
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450
their fuel is about a third cheaper than
gasoline so that's a positive thing I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
gasoline so that's a positive thing I
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.590
gasoline so that's a positive thing I
think that government could do by

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
think that government could do by
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.980
think that government could do by
providing incentives but clearly that

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990
providing incentives but clearly that
 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.630
providing incentives but clearly that
hasn't happened and and at one of the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
hasn't happened and and at one of the
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610
hasn't happened and and at one of the
amazing things is that today Brazil

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
amazing things is that today Brazil
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.650
amazing things is that today Brazil
which everyone talks about ethanol and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
which everyone talks about ethanol and
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.920
which everyone talks about ethanol and
Brazil well at Brazil has ten times as

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
Brazil well at Brazil has ten times as
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.320
Brazil well at Brazil has ten times as
many natural gas vehicles as the u.s.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330
many natural gas vehicles as the u.s.
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.540
many natural gas vehicles as the u.s.
even though the US has more than ten

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550
even though the US has more than ten
 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.120
even though the US has more than ten
times as many motor vehicles as Brazil

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
times as many motor vehicles as Brazil
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.699
times as many motor vehicles as Brazil
so yes government could be providing

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
so yes government could be providing
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.710
so yes government could be providing
incentives if it wants to reduce oil

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
incentives if it wants to reduce oil
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.470
incentives if it wants to reduce oil
consumption but instead it's providing

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
consumption but instead it's providing
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449
consumption but instead it's providing
mandates and the ethanol mandate being

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459
mandates and the ethanol mandate being
 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.940
mandates and the ethanol mandate being
clearly one of the most pernicious of

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
clearly one of the most pernicious of
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.150
clearly one of the most pernicious of
the mandates that are now in place
