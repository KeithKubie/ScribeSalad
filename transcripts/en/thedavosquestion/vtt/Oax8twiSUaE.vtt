Good day everyone. I'm Tebogo from South Africa.
I think Africa as a continent will benefit

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.660
from the 2010 World Cup. Many lives of ordinary
citizens will be changed for the better, numerous

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.389
job opportunities will be available to citizens,
nation building and diversity of different

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.589
cultures will be putting ideals into work
simply, because football is a universal language

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.960
which gets the world speaking in one voice.
This prestigious event will leave a lasting

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.830
legacy and tourism without doubt will be exposed
to create among the exposure. Thank you.
