00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.630
Um,

5
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.840
Came back to see my family at my daughter in there.
Um,

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.930
greatest fucking day of my life.
So excited.
Um,

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.970

hanging out,
having an awesome time and uh,
it's all I did.

8
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.880
That's all I did all day.
Just hung out with the Kiddo,
my lovely wife and uh,

9
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.180
everything's good.
Dealt with the stack of mail,
you know,
as you do,

10
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:47.800
you come back to all the bills.
Keep coming.
Don't they write 20,
40,

11
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.490
6,800.
Get the fuck out of here.
What do you want?
Four or 500 bucks?

12
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.900
Fucking pastors.
They just won't let you just,
I don't understand.

13
00:00:55.901 --> 00:01:00.130
I don't get how you retire.
It's like you have to become like,

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.310
you got to become like this feudal fucking landowner will.

15
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.330
You've got a bunch of people with tuberculosis living in some shit hole that you

16
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:11.290
fucking own.
That's the only way to not end this ride,

17
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.470
eat and fucking owl Paul,
you know,
waiting for a bus.
I don't know how you do it.

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.670
They just won't let you sit fucking still,

19
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.290
you know?
Say what you want about the caveman days.

20
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:30.610
How the only lived to be like 26 and he looked like they were 105 is fucking

21
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:35.590
people could chill out.
Go out.
You kill a fucking woolly mammoth.
I mean,

22
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:37.780
yeah,
you gotta be good for a while,
right?

23
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.190
Just fucking laying around.
This is amazing.
I guess.

24
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.380
Then you've got to fight off other shit that tries to kill it.

25
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.290
Just say,
you know,
once you fucking,
yeah,
you kill some.
You brought it back.
Lace.

26
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.140
Let's go.
Let's get a fire going sweetheart.

27
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.630
You just fucking sat around.
Your little fucking furry me on bees.

28
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.990
Made out of some platypus.

29
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.260
I don't know yet.
I'm telling you man,
the devil runs the fucking planet.

30
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.120
The whole thing.
Just fucking,

31
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.560
the whole thing is set up on somebody above you.
Make some money off of you.

32
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.350
Right?
And if there's no one below you

33
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.760
that you're making money off of 10 your fucking eating dog food.

34
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.550
That's how it goes.
It's just fucking,
it's unbelief.
It just fucking,

35
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.490
I told you guys,
I saw this guy,

36
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.340
I've number of times I've just seen homeless people just,

37
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:46.200
I saw this guy just sitting in the sun,
right?
Burning up.

38
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.860
Even then he was just sit there submittal the afternoon,

39
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.970
just one of these restaurants that has tables out on the sidewalk and shit and

40
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:56.160
they didn't really know.
They're not policing them.
There's nobody there.

41
00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:01.161
So he's just sitting there sleeping sun on his face and he's got a fucking cold,

42
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.620
45 empty quarter left.
I don't know what.

43
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.310
And I'm walking down the street fucking sitting there and thinking about all

44
00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:11.630
this shit I gotta handle.

45
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.560
That's what I made in Atlanta and I just looked at that guy.
No,
it's just like,

46
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:20.120
you know what,
that,
that doesn't look that bad

47
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.910
obviously.
You know,
day in and day out.
It sucks.

48
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.070
But you know how they have like Earth Day,
the honor just have like,

49
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.400
just like a homeless day.

50
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.740
It's just something where it's just okay to be in public,

51
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.560
taken a nap,
shit faced in the middle of the day.

52
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.690
Why everybody else goes to work like you,
you get it.

53
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.610
It's like getting called for jury duty,
except it's fun.
Hey boss,

54
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:45.220
I'm not going to be in to work on Tuesday off.
Fuck.
We need your I,
I,

55
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.280
I got a homeless day.
I ain't fair enough.
Fair enough.
And then you just go out,

56
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:52.380
you grab your fucking drink at choice,

57
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.370
you'll find a bench and he just get fucking hammered.

58
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:59.550
You just fight one in the afternoon.
You're asleep.

59
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.843
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

60
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.380
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

61
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.700
Maybe this is because I've been on the wagon here for fucking nine weeks then

62
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.020
I'm looking at stuff like that.
But,
um,
I dunno.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.760
I have no idea.
So I flew back,
took the first flight back.

64
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.610
I can't wait to tell you guys about this fucking movie.
Uh,

65
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.910
I've got to do a scene with one of my favorite actors of all freaking time and

66
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:25.300
one of my favorite people and I was having such a good time.

67
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.600
I didn't even get a goddamn picture with them.
Um,

68
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.120
which is always fucking,
he can't,
he can't really do that.

69
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:35.560
But I know that I already knew this guy before,
uh,
before I did it.
Um,

70
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.220
but we should've,
we should've got a fucking picture.
But anyways,
um,

71
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.570
so on the flight back,
I watched a cool hand,
Luke,

72
00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:49.510
one of my favorite movies of all time and fast times at Ridgemont high.
Uh,

73
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.470
it was just both movies totally held up.
And,
uh,

74
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.260
one of the greatest fucking lines that has never quoted in fast times at

75
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:05.240
Ridgemont high,
his Dimone,
when he knocks up Jennifer,
Jason Leigh,

76
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.900
and once he,
he goes,
you know,
is it mine?
And he goes,
get shores.

77
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.330
He goes,
you know,
I suppose you want me to pay for it?

78
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.330
Oh my God,
what a fucking line.
I suppose you want me to pay for it?

79
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.810
It's like,
buddy,
she's fucking given you a do over.

80
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.630
You just fucked your whole life up.
You fucked her life up.

81
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.860
She's given you a fucking do over.
If he can live with it,

82
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.810
if you could fucking live with it.
You know what I mean?
I,
you know something,

83
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.640
I can't even talk about that talk cause I don't even know where the hell I stand

84
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:49.180
on that thing.
Um,
I don't even know where I stand,

85
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.720
but like when people say it's to take it a little of a life,
I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,

86
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:57.230
it is.
It is it,
my argument is if you didn't have that procedure there,

87
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.340
there would be a person

88
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.010
somewhere along the line somebody got whacked because there's one less person.

89
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.540
Yeah.
That's all I'm saying.
I don't know who the Hitman is.
You know,

90
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.120
you're sort of the dawn,
you know,
if you have the procedure done,

91
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.910
you say gotta you gotta fucking take this guy out.
And then somebody,

92
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.800
then the doctor goes in and he's like the fucking,

93
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.800
he's that dude in the white suit in the untouchables.
Really built,

94
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.430
you're going to fucking joke about abortion.
I don't know.

95
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.480
I don't plan these things.
I just start talking,
you know,

96
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.520
and I got some fucking 20 make fucking cunt face giving me shit that I got too

97
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.820
much sports,
dribble on it,
dribble on this thing.

98
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.780
Rarely dribble like the fucking shit coming out of the side of your mouth when

99
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.000
you sit there watching the Guy Damn Kardashians.

100
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.050
Is that what you want me to talk about?
Oh,
did you see what Miss New York said?

101
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.970
The flavor flavor?
I don't give a fuck.
Ah,
but you know,

102
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.210
if you're into it,
that's,
you know,
that's your thing.
Do your thing.

103
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.150
It's your fate.
What she want to watch.

104
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.620
I can't tell you.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

105
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.400
so I watch cool hand Luke and uh,
I haven't seen that in a minute.

106
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.940
I forgot how creepy.
Uh,
what's his face?
Oh my God.

107
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.110
He just fucking flaked on his name.
Kennedy,
George Kennedy,

108
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.130
that his fucking name.
Oh,
Jesus.
But I gotta look it up now.
George Kennedy,
he is,

109
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.720
and he's a big mother fucker and he had a pot belly and he lived to be like 91

110
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.050
years old.
That doesn't happen.
Those big guys,
you know,

111
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.470
they slap people around for six decades and then all of a sudden they just face

112
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:35.030
down in a newspaper.
Mike,
Mike,
are you okay?
Um,

113
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.040
hang on a second.
Uh,
is it George Kennedy?
Yeah,
that's it.

114
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.470
George Kennedy,
when he's,
when he,

115
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:45.350
when you know the girl who washes the fucking car,
he keeps calling.

116
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.900
Oh Lucy or name scattered the Lou.
She,

117
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.710
I got to watch it again to try to get his accent down.

118
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.270
She was older.
They're
often at Carl.

119
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.540
All your pinhole in it.
Hold it together.

120
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.080
I didn't understand like they couldn't like,

121
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.310
like back then they couldn't talk about like prison rape and shit.

122
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.510
So they just had these guys sitting in there like reading like dirty fucking

123
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.800
stories about like red shoe diaries,
shit to each other and then what?

124
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.080
They get all fucking frustrated.

125
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.800
I mean at that point somebody is going to fuck something or beat the shit out of

126
00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:26.160
somebody,
but it never does.
Um,
but anyways,

127
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.040
what a fucking great,
what a God damn.
Great movie.
I fucking love that movie.

128
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.040
Yeah.
Well I love how that's his fucking attitude.
Yeah.
Well,

129
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.650
you know,
his mother comes to fucking visit him,
basically says,
yeah,

130
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.830
I'm going to die while you're in here.
I'll see you later.

131
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.700
Cackling and fucking hacking up a lung.
Um,

132
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.060
I love that movie.
And you know what I love about cool hand Luke,

133
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:57.450
he's like a fucking,
you know what I mean?

134
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.470
Fucking hates authority.
You tell them to go left,

135
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:03.390
he's going to go fucking right eat taking him.

136
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.450
Obviously he's doing this at a prison level.
I don't,
I don't recommend that.

137
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:07.530
But there's all,
there's a through,

138
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:09.240
like when I watched that guys like this fucking,

139
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:12.900
this is like the kind of guy in high school that you'd hang out with.

140
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.050
Like people,
there's been a problem with,
with people driving their car,

141
00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:23.420
students driving their cars too fast.
I don't know who's driving on the property.

142
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.630
And then the second you fucking say that,
that's it.

143
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.300
He's going to take his car and that weekend he's going to do fucking donuts.

144
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:33.880
Laughing his balls off.
Just knowing that it's going to irritate somebody.

145
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.790
I don't know,
maybe I'm missing the point of the movie,
but um,

146
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.050
<v 3>yeah,</v>

147
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.110
<v 1>just a fucking great movie.
Do you know,
uh,
actually one of the,
uh,</v>

148
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.910
when they go to pave the road,

149
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.610
they're throwing the sand on top of whatever the fuck they're spraying on the

150
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:50.540
road.
Um,
that music was composed for that scene.

151
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:52.370
And then somebody connected with the movie,

152
00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:56.300
sold it to the nightly news and that became the nightly news song.

153
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.400
And uh,
some of the actors were upset because they felt it ruined that scene.
Uh,

154
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.490
you don't hear it now,
but that was the song that they played for like decades.

155
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.470
Uh,
whatever the fuck that was.

156
00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:11.360
I think I've actually already talked about this on the podcast.
Um,
anyways,

157
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.710
what do you want from me?
All right.
Onto my sports drivel.
All right.

158
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.640
Um,

159
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.640
what enough fuck is going on with these fucking New York Yankees Day or Goddamn

160
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.233
buzzsaw.

161
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.750
This is the second series in a row where they play rope a dope.

162
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.230
They lean on the ropes,
they let you win game one.
Oh good.
We won game one.

163
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.650
Who Fuck it,
hold it home court here,
holding home serve whatever they say.

164
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.370
And then they win game two.
And then you think you got them.

165
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:38.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

166
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.890
<v 1>You're thinking to yourself,
these fucking morons.</v>

167
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.270
Now they gotta win four out of five or they got to win the next three in a row.

168
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.840
Why do they do the Yankees right now are given the epitome.

169
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.710
If you look up right there,
Fred,
in the fucking dictionary,

170
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.920
that's what they're doing.
That's what they're doing.

171
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.690
And what the fucking Indians and astro is.

172
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.750
That dawn is a classic example of cold lotion.

173
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.810
What they're doing to their fence or what the Indians did,

174
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.570
they won the first two.
They got 'em all fucking excited.

175
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.800
Whether you went 22 fucking games in a row and then you lose three in a row.

176
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:14.640
I have to be up to two to two zip in a five game series.

177
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.930
<v 3>Um,
anyways,</v>

178
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.820
<v 1>the fucking Dodgers are up three games to none out here.
You'd never know.</v>

179
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.493
You'd never know.

180
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.100
You know what I realized with the Dodgers being up three games to none,

181
00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:30.900
one game away from the world series and I don't,

182
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.110
I didn't even fucking know about it.
You know what it is.

183
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:38.111
I don't have enough Mexican friends out here because those people,

184
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:42.350
God bless them,
are single handedly keeping that franchise here in La.

185
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.090
I swear to God,
if they were going to the games,

186
00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:50.990
that fucking team would have left somewhere.
I don't know when the 80s.

187
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.243
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

188
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 1>I don't know what it is.
I know there's,
I don't,</v>

189
00:11:56.081 --> 00:12:01.081
I don't want to know where the white guy fucking grew up here in la baseball fan

190
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:07.080
lives.
I just don't know where the fuck they are.
I haven't seen,

191
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.920
they were up three games to none.
I didn't see,

192
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.760
I drove from lax all the way to my house.
I didn't see one banner.

193
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.090
I didn't fucking feel any buzz.
Nobody with the hat.

194
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:19.070
Nobody with a Jersey Zip,

195
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.713
<v 4>nothing.</v>

196
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.090
<v 1>Um,
I was stunned when I,
I mean,
I've been working so I wasn't paying attention.</v>

197
00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:27.350
I thought,
I thought it was like two one,

198
00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:30.560
somebody I didn't know it was three games to none.

199
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.170
I didn't know they are right on the fucking break.

200
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.983
<v 4>MMM.</v>

201
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.560
<v 1>Do you realize,
okay,</v>

202
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.590
if the fucking Yankees win and the Dodgers win and we have a Yankees dodger

203
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:48.460
fucking series,
okay.
They're going to do the whole

204
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.680
Brooklyn Dodgers.
I got the name dad years.

205
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.960
They were the trolley Dodgers and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
Blah and Ebbets field.

206
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:57.190
And somehow somewhere,

207
00:12:57.191 --> 00:13:00.670
some fucking old bastard is going to come out of the woodwork and start talking

208
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:01.504
about it,
right.

209
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.713
<v 4>You know,</v>

210
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.130
<v 1>fuck all of that.
All right,
not fuck all of that baseball is,
is,
is,</v>

211
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.570
is as,
as sport steeped in history,
as long as they bring up Vince Scully,

212
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:14.530
it's going to be fucking great.

213
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.310
But all I'm saying is that takes me back to when I first started watching

214
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:19.120
baseball,

215
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.120
1977 1978 back to back fucking years.

216
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.910
I rooted for the Dodgers because the red sox could not beat the fucking Yankees.

217
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.793
And then we,
you know,

218
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.310
and that was the Bucky Dent Year was 78 and I would root for them

219
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.930
and they lost 77 to Dodgers and I rooted for them again and they lost again.

220
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.410
Then the next year was pirates first the orals orals up three games to one gave

221
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:52.840
their fans the old cold lotion.
Pirates came back with the right there,

222
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:54.430
Fred one at seven.

223
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.430
Then you had 1980 was a Pete rose.
Ah,

224
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.380
let me get 50 on your fucking page.
Boy Haircut.

225
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.840
He gig goes over to the Phillies.
Right.
I quit the fuck.

226
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:10.300
Did they play in the world series?
I think it was Kansas City.

227
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:14.920
They finally got past the Yankees.
That's what it was.
Um,
yeah.

228
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:16.240
Every year I root for Kansas City,

229
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.010
then they'd lose and then a root for the Dodgers.

230
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:23.230
But Kansas City got passed and then Pete Rose fucking led the Phillies to their

231
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:26.380
first world series victory in a hundred fucking years.

232
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.200
They won one in like 1881 or some shit.

233
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:33.760
And then 1980 they were actually the cubs before the fucking cubs.

234
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:36.580
Just everybody forgets.
Um,

235
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.160
then 1981,
the Dodgers play the Yankees again and I'm like,

236
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:43.330
what the fuck?

237
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.953
<v 4>You know,</v>

238
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.690
<v 1>third time's got to be a chairman.
They finally fucking one.</v>

239
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.800
I believe that was with Fernando Valens Waylon,
wasn't it?

240
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.290
Dave winfield and Port Tommy.

241
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:57.620
John played for the Dodgers and 77 loss to the Yankees.

242
00:14:57.621 --> 00:15:02.570
Played for the Dodgers and 78 lost to the Yankees and 81.

243
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.730
Hey,
switch tapes.

244
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.530
Eight plays for the New York Yankees and he loses to the fucking Dodgers.

245
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:12.423
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

246
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.810
<v 1>Oh,
Jesus.
Can you imagine how quiet that fucking ride was home with his,</v>

247
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.800
with his wife?
My goodness,
Tommy.

248
00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:23.050
At least they named a surgery after you.

249
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.163
<v 4>MMM.</v>

250
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.110
<v 1>Anyways,
by the way,
I know there's everybody's fucking,</v>

251
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.530
I don't know,
talking about this horrific injury.

252
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.403
<v 4>MMM.</v>

253
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.820
<v 1>I gotta make sure I get his name right.
He's brand new.
He said,
Hayward,</v>

254
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.010
that poor fucking guy
a,

255
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.470
I'm going to write Haywood is that guy on the white shadow,

256
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.190
Hayward Gordon Hayward.
You know,
here's the thing.

257
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.650
Everybody's freaking out about it.
Like,
oh my God.
I was like,
yeah,

258
00:15:56.651 --> 00:15:59.710
it was fucking grotesque.
But,
uh,

259
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.671
if I was him,

260
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:06.671
I would be psyched that it was a bone and not blowing out your Achilles or your

261
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.720
fucking ACL.
Because according to this guy I talked to in a bar one time,

262
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.010
who is not a physician on any fucking level,
he,
uh,
I don't know,

263
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:18.200
maybe we of these sports center things,
I don't know what he's,

264
00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:22.610
I overheard at some point that when you break a bone,
if it's set right,

265
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.320
when it grows back,
it's actually strong.

266
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.880
So he's going to come back with a bionic ankle and tendons.
Fine.

267
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:30.650
I think it will be backed by a,

268
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:34.520
I'm going to say is a non doctor and not looking at the xrays that I don't know

269
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.840
how to read.
I'm going to say in February,
I say it comes back in February.

270
00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.093
<v 4>MMM.</v>

271
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.670
<v 1>It'll be fine.
It's just,
it's just that his fist fucking,</v>

272
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.410
yeah,
the angle that his foot was that um,
yeah,
that was brutal.
But I'll tell you,

273
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:54.560
it's still not as bad as Joe Theismann.
It's not as bad as Joe Theismann.

274
00:16:54.561 --> 00:16:56.840
It's not as bad as far as grotesque.

275
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.460
That fucking kid was at Louisville a few years ago with the kids just ran away

276
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.020
when that happened.
Um,
I still haven't looked at that one.

277
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:08.270
And then there was a time I saw in the UFC,

278
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.660
this guy fucking kick somebody compound fracture and he brought his leg back to

279
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:18.200
put weight on it and he didn't realize he had broken both bones down there.

280
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:20.060
What's,
what's,
what's below your knee,
what is that?
That,

281
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.640
that the radius and the Ulna.
That's your fucking arm.

282
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:26.600
Then you got the humerus and you get your femur.
You got your Patella,

283
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.040
you get your tarsals,
you metal tarsals and your flange is,

284
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:34.640
what the fuck is down there?
Your Fibula and your tibular.
Oh,
frick and frack it.

285
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:36.680
A leg there,
right?
The twins,

286
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.670
the twins fucking hanging around like the little fish in the,
you're famous,

287
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:43.160
the whale there,
they're a little fishies underneath it.
Right?

288
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.120
He fucking broke both of those things and he goes to put all his weight on the

289
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.710
Goddamn leg and his,

290
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.570
you ever see a little kid put on adults like rain boot on that goes up to their

291
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:59.430
knee and then it just kind of fold.
That's what the fuck happened.
Ah,

292
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.410
yeah,
that was a gross.
Well,
let's talk about the broken leg.

293
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.940
Obviously Joe Theismann is sort of the,
um,

294
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.130
one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

295
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:12.650
That's like the fucking lunar landing of broken bones on,

296
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:17.580
in sports.
That's,
that's sort of the original as far as I remember.

297
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.840
And then there was,
of course,
the,
uh,
the guy walked in,

298
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.450
I never know the fighters names.
The guy fucking walked in.

299
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.460
He'd come walking in like a crab or a spider and he's fucking around that one

300
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:32.610
fight,
acting like he wasn't hurting than the guy fucking really knocked him out.

301
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.680
Then he was like,
all right,
I'm coming back.

302
00:18:34.681 --> 00:18:37.110
And he went to go kick him and he fucking broke both bones.

303
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:40.170
That was fucking brutal.
And I,
I left the room.
I was like,

304
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:42.310
I don't want to see that again.
And My,

305
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.300
my wife rewound that like fucking,

306
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.680
I don't know how many times was fascinated by fascinate.

307
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.930
It's unbelievable.
I can't fart in bed,

308
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.110
but she can fucking sit there and look at that.
I mean,

309
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.810
I mean women try to figure them out.
Um,

310
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.960
anyways,
whatever.
Was it 19 minutes in Jesus,
Chris,
tell me more.

311
00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.060
Fuck that.
I get it.
I don't have my advertising with me.

312
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:10.530
I'm just going to plow through this.
Um,
oh man,

313
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:14.340
I got to a nice political debate up here.
I'll tell you,
you know,

314
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.660
this is what you gotta do.

315
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.770
You pray if you're in a red state right now or if you're in a blue state,

316
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.350
you're probably sick of people that agreed with you.

317
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:26.370
So what you need to do is you need to go to another state and just wait til

318
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:28.620
politics comes up and you just argue the other side.

319
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:31.320
You have a great fucking time.
You know,

320
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.730
like when I'm in a red state,

321
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.400
if I say anything about Trump or whatever,
like people,
the heads almost explode.

322
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.030
Okay?
Like it,
she tells me fucking Hillary with a fucking,
you know,
they do that.

323
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:48.570
And then out here and see exact opposite.
Um,

324
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.740
this person I was arguing with today just kept grabbing their head
like they,

325
00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:59.130
they couldn't believe
they were talking about like,

326
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.600
that Hillary didn't win because she was a woman.
And I was just like,

327
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:09.170
I was basically saying that there was probably some sexism obviously.

328
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.790
Right.
But like it's just,
it's not just one fucking thing.

329
00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:17.170
There's a whole bunch of things.

330
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.930
There's also the fact that people are sick of the Clintons and the sick of the

331
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:25.630
bushes,
the bushes in the,
I want Jeb Bush came along.

332
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.870
It's like how many times did he bang Barbara [inaudible] how many are there

333
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.240
after awhile?

334
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.110
Like a political family just gets played out and you just don't want it.

335
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:38.750
You just don't want to see him get you want the bushes and the Clintons are

336
00:20:38.751 --> 00:20:39.584
right now.

337
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.670
Do you remember whether they would like in the 10th season of the office and

338
00:20:43.671 --> 00:20:45.740
even Steve Carell was like,
dude,
this is over.

339
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:48.550
He like fucking left and they just can't make it more of a,

340
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.290
that's what the Clintons and fucking bushes are.
It's just it,
it's over.

341
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.753
It's over.

342
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.913
<v 0>Okay.</v>

343
00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.640
<v 1>Gets your residuals and ride off into the sunset.
They just won't do it.</v>

344
00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:05.030
They keep coming back for another season.
Um,

345
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.360
yeah,
so it's unbelievable.

346
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.540
So if you bring up anything that Trump does to Trump people,

347
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.150
they lose their fucking minds.
If you bring up anything that like,

348
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.690
like all these sees what the other person fucking did,
it's unreal.

349
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.810
That would be like me as a sports fan,

350
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.840
not being able to see like how amazing it is,

351
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:29.660
what the Yankees are doing right now.
I'm not saying like,
you know,

352
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.290
I can't say I'm rooting against him.
I gotta be honest with you.

353
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.890
It's a fucking red sox fan.
49 years old.

354
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.960
The for me,
the movie was all for me.
Did I just say I said that for real,

355
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.640
for real.
Z for realsy.
I just feel like for me,

356
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.210
2004,
that was it.

357
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:54.170
That was the end of the movie roll credits.
You know it's fucking over.

358
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.180
You can't shit 1918 at us anymore.
No matter how much you say we choked,

359
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.520
we'll never going to choke more than you guys did.

360
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.520
There was a historical fucking choke.
No one's ever done that.

361
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.510
Noah ever do that again with a $200 million fucking team.

362
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.650
No one will ever be first again.
You know what I mean?
There'll be the Kobe,

363
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.900
they won't be the Jordan of choking.
Um,

364
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.620
there'll be the second one doing what had already been done.
So I'll be,

365
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.200
that was the end roll credits.
It's over.

366
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.750
And then we want to more so who gives a shit?

367
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.670
What do we were going to catch the Yankees,

368
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.350
this 30 fucking teams now that you can't then all of those sports,
you can't,

369
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:40.740
you know,
unless she got two teams going at it,
like Celtics and Lakers.

370
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:41.850
Um,

371
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:46.850
although the Lakers caught up with the Celtics as even as all these teams

372
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.360
increased.
So I fucking hate saying that as a Celtics fan.
But what they've done,

373
00:22:51.361 --> 00:22:52.410
I feel is the most amazing.

374
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.910
They won the most championships in my fucking lifetime since 1968.

375
00:22:56.911 --> 00:22:59.580
I fucking hate saying that,
but it's true.
These fucking bastards,

376
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.970
they could build a team.
And then when it went into the free agent thing,

377
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.790
they had all these fucking whores out here,

378
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.550
all these starlets for these fucking guys to bang.

379
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:10.800
And they had the great weather and we just couldn't keep up with them.

380
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.700
We couldn't keep up with them.
We had fucking winter,
you know,
we,
uh,
you know,

381
00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:18.550
we had racist racism and shit.
They got racism out here to Jesus Christ.
You know,

382
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.300
it's the racisms fucking equal.
But you know,

383
00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:26.280
so then the tipping point becomes the weather in the Hollywood fucking who was,

384
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.100
I mean right there.
It's over.
It's over.
It's fucking over.

385
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.020
We've got palm trees and Hollywood fucking who was all right.
What do we get?

386
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.890
What do we got?
We got the freedom trail and a Sam Adams beer.
I mean this,

387
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:45.380
you know,
I mean,
come on,
you're just not going to some,

388
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.430
you might want to get one of those big goofy European guys to fall for that
shit,

389
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:57.380
but you're not going to get an American.
Um,
anyways,

390
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.550
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.
Uh,
I will say that this is,

391
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:06.470
this is the fucking thing.
Houston astro fence.
Uh,

392
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.440
I'm apologizing now cause I love your uniforms.

393
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.010
Reminds me of the fucking orange crushes back when they put the real fucking

394
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:15.860
sugar in them.
Uh,
uniforms.

395
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.600
Who great till you hit a rough three games.
Okay.
Um,

396
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.300
did you guys notice?
All right,
I was joking with this comic,

397
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.790
Yannis Pappas,
right?
I was joking with them how,
you know,
he's going,

398
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:35.240
Houston's a strong team at home.
And I was like,
all right,

399
00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:39.980
but like the Yankees fan base,
like

400
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.750
<v 5>okay,</v>

401
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.150
<v 1>the sound of the crowd is this.</v>

402
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.000
They used to winning and there's an expectation even though that you know,

403
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.920
I mean a drought for them as they haven't won since 2009 okay.

404
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.810
There's an expectation and there's an n the they have a level that's

405
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:04.490
unacceptable.
Okay.
And there's very few crowds.
You hear that in a Celtic crowd.

406
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.560
You hear that in a Yankee crowd.

407
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.200
I hate to say that she hear that with Montreal Canadian,

408
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.610
but they're hanging on by the fucking
skinny their teeth.

409
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.450
Cause it's been so fucking long that they at this point have two generations

410
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:20.880
that have never seen a fucking Stanley Cup.
So what you need,

411
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.940
you need that continued fucking success to get that train fucking rolling.

412
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.790
All right.
Houston astro crowd.

413
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.430
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

414
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:35.090
<v 1>I mean you guys sound like you guys are one of those towns where it's a playoff</v>

415
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.560
game and it's in your big fucking deal is you're going to,

416
00:25:38.561 --> 00:25:42.460
everybody's going to show up and where the same colored free tee shirt,

417
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.640
you know what I mean?
Somebody's going,
are you

418
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.823
<v 5>rolling?</v>

419
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.770
<v 1>Right.
Doing that dumb shit.
Um,
I dunno.</v>

420
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.860
I Dunno if you need to win a bunch of championships to get that fucking sound.

421
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:01.970
But uh,
I don't know,
but you don't hear it that often.

422
00:26:01.971 --> 00:26:04.130
And when I listened to the Yankees in October,

423
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.400
the Celtics and fucking Megan in June,

424
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.060
I'm the old forum had that sound.
I think,
you know,
if,

425
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.400
if you sit in the upper deck at Staples Center,
I think you'd probably hear it,

426
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:19.640
but like a staples centers I've said for a long time,

427
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:21.950
one of the most hostile fucking venues there is,

428
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.020
it's just if you've got money you down below and if you don't,

429
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:29.540
you're up top go fuck yourself in the moat.

430
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.850
Inbetween is just three stories of luxury boxes.

431
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.130
I mean,

432
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.000
I dunno if you've ever gone to a third world country where there's like 10% of

433
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:42.590
the people have,

434
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:47.650
have like fucking all the money and then everybody else has a 10 fucking shack.

435
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.990
The staple center.
That's the way it's set up.
Um,

436
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.080
anyways,
so who knows?
I'm going to watch that game six if I'm not working.

437
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:02.830
I don't know when the fuck it is.
I think Friday,
uh,
uh,
work.

438
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.570
I'm in Austin.
Oh,
that's right.
I'm in Austin,
Texas this weekend.

439
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:09.900
I got two shows Friday both sold out.
Thank you very much.

440
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.610
And then I got one on Saturday and I,
you know what I decided because my,

441
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.080
my Madison square garden recording ain't happening.

442
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.160
I don't know what to do with it.
It's a,
I fucked up.
I thought when I said,

443
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:24.750
told him that I wanted to record,

444
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:28.110
that they understood that I was making an album and they just took it right from

445
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:32.190
the board.
So I sound all loud and happy.
Like I'm killing it.

446
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:36.300
Madison Square Garden.
And then the crowd sounds like it's a coffee house.

447
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.460
So the recording sounds ridiculous.
Like why is this guy so excited?
You know,

448
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.980
he's not doing that well.
Um,

449
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.160
so I've decided when I go to the cool venues like this Austin city limits,

450
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.170
I'm just going to start recording my shit and I don't know what I'm going to do

451
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:56.100
with it.
I think I'm just going to randomly put out some vinyls,

452
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.030
like some vinyl albums and,
um,

453
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:06.510
whatever.
Just to fucking have him.
Who knows?
Someday I'm fucking dead and gone.

454
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.950
There'll be these different versions of my hour of bullshit then I was working

455
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:13.200
on.
Right.
That'd be interesting.
Maybe.
I don't know.

456
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.260
I don't know if that works with jokes.
Uh,
so when he was,

457
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.300
I'm going to be recording this weekend,
so,
uh,

458
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.740
I don't know if that's an added fucking little
cheese.
It,

459
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:24.420
that'll get you to come down there.
I have no idea.

460
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.540
I'm working with fucking Dean del Rey and then we're hanging around on fucking

461
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:31.440
Sunday and we'll go into the formula one race,

462
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.120
maybe going to see Louis Hamilton wrap it up.
Um,

463
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.050
I've been so fucking busy.
I haven't been watching the moto GP.

464
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:44.460
I did see that fucking highlight of a mock Marquez,

465
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.570
uh,
passing.
What does David Coc divisio.

466
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.350
So it's the oca one of the great fucking names of all time and I always screw it

467
00:28:52.351 --> 00:28:56.970
up in the rain.
Fucking passed them on one of the final turns.

468
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.970
It's just such a tremendous sport.
And,
uh,

469
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
whoever the fuck it was in my podcast that suggested that I should watch it.

470
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:06.780
I want to thank,
I want to thank you.
Um,

471
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.810
what am I up to here at 29?
God Damn minutes.
Um,
all right.

472
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.390
I had such a fun time argue in politics and in the end,
uh,
you know,
a hug,

473
00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:20.940
the other person could come on.
All right,
we're all Americans here,
right?

474
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.530
Everybody relax.
Everybody relax.

475
00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:27.960
Stop watching CNN 24 hours a day or watching Fox News 24 hours a day.

476
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:30.870
What you do is you watch him each 12 hours,
right?

477
00:29:30.871 --> 00:29:34.470
And then you balance out you fucking propaganda.
You know what I mean?

478
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:38.340
Then you go to an NFL game,
you watch them sell your war.
You know,

479
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.030
it's sort of like a,
what?
We'll go war rally before the game.

480
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.060
They do everything but actually asked you to buy war bonds.
Um,

481
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.750
I think that's the Pentagon,
making sure everybody stays on the same page.

482
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.420
We don't end up with the Vietnam here.
They don't need a,

483
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:01.720
we don't need a bunch of fucking hippies out there.
Bernie,
they're puking draft.

484
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.010
God,
you get me get up and just say,

485
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.980
just get everybody out there to support the troops.
And uh,
I dunno,

486
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.230
I'm a cynical mother fucker,
you know,

487
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.390
I feel like they use in those kids.
I'm probably wrong.
I am a fucking idiot.
But,

488
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.990
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno about that one.

489
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.470
At the very least,
at the end of all of it,

490
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.160
even if the Pentagon and everybody's heart is in the right place to fucking NFL

491
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.510
is making money off of it and it's so fucking gross.
It's gross.

492
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.630
Just stay in your own lane.
Okay.

493
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.220
You know.
Hey,
you know what the,
you know,

494
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.710
the NFL has in common with their fucking military.

495
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:44.800
They don't take care of that veterans either.
Oh,

496
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.520
I'm not right.
I'm done.
I'm fucking around with you guys.

497
00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.390
See if I get a little bit of hate mail.
All right.

498
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.990
You want to talk music for a second?
You write finally downloaded.
I downloaded,

499
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.880
uh,
uh,
I can never met.
Not a love supreme

500
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.000
steak on you staying Connie.
It was Andre 3000,

501
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:08.080
and then there was the other guy.

502
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.010
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

503
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.230
<v 1>I just downloaded cause I like the fucking trumps,</v>

504
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.253
<v 4>you know,</v>

505
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.640
<v 1>my brain doesn't work fast enough
for some of them.
To me,</v>

506
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:24.780
this is modern music.
I'm so far behind.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's fucking ridiculous.

507
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.200
What the hell did I,
uh,
did I download?

508
00:31:28.201 --> 00:31:30.900
What does the name Stanko not stink on you?
What the fuck is that?

509
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.120
That's not what it's called.
Is it outcast?

510
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.280
This has to sound like you fucking parents.
You know why I like,

511
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:43.090
I liked that.
The,
the outsider status outcast.
Um,

512
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.700
not even then because this is like fucking 20 years old at this point.

513
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.170
2017 years.
Yeah.
Stank on yet.
There you go.

514
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.671
And I gotta be honest with you.

515
00:31:53.671 --> 00:31:58.140
I downloaded this shit because I thought that this would be a good bass drum

516
00:31:58.141 --> 00:31:59.190
exercise right here.

517
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.820
<v 5>That's it.
Yeah.</v>

518
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.760
<v 1>Go,
go,
go.
Denka uh,
dead.
Dead.</v>

519
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.900
[inaudible] dead.
Just do that for fucking an hour then.
Could I play good times,

520
00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:18.430
bad times?
I Dunno.
Bill,
would anybody give a shit?
Yeah.

521
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.753
<v 6>Hi.</v>

522
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.360
<v 1>All right,
I'm going to stop here.</v>

523
00:32:22.361 --> 00:32:25.240
I'll probably get the advertising later on tonight.
No fucking,

524
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.550
I'll go to read that.
Um,

525
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.980
does the Thursday afternoon podcast just before Friday,
Thursday afternoon,

526
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:35.470
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Just checking in on you,

527
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:39.370
seeing how your week is going.
Enjoy the Thursday night football.

528
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.610
All right.
Support your candidate.
Support the troops.

529
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:47.750
Support the global warming.
[inaudible] sign with the Lakers.

530
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.730
Can we just do the whole fucking ramp up here?

531
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.700
It's better to break an ankle then the blow out a knee.

532
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.160
That's basically the physical,
uh,
burden of hands.

533
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:02.600
Better than two in the bush.
Oh look who's here.

534
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.810
Look who's here with a shirt that says flawless.
You know what?

535
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.590
I agree.
Isn't that just,
you know what,

536
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.650
what is about what I just said there and here?
It was sweet,
but it wasn't,

537
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:16.920
it just a little too sweet.

538
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.470
It wasn't just a little too on the nose now and I don't think so.
No,

539
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.100
you believed it.
What do you say?
You weren't being genuine?
Well,

540
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:32.110
I am like aware that there's people listening to this CD or phony.

541
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.860
Well,
there's going to be an element of phoniness.
I see.

542
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.630
Are you on the mile with their yak?

543
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.290
I don't know what that means.
Sorry.

544
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:51.900
I thought he thought with that yet.
30 so with that hint dog,
he said that's it.

545
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.190
Yeah,
but he says I'm one half mile with that yet.

546
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540
To me that's good weather and he's on the back of a yak is literally on a Yak

547
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.690
and Yak.
In my world,

548
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.440
in my white world,

549
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:14.470
a yak is either you puked from drinking or instead farm animal.

550
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:19.070
I've never seen.
Right.
No.
Actually we saw at that time we went out to that,

551
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.990
that wine winery that also had the zoo's for tax purposes.

552
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.180
Malibu wines advisory.
A lot of people don't know that.
If you actually,

553
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:32.820
if you have a giraffe skin,
sorry.

554
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:37.040
If you have a giraffe on your property and you actually lowers your taxes,

555
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.510
unless you have to have a certain amount of kids coming by looking at it going,

556
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.500
whoa,
whoa,
mom,
that's great.
Then the government goes,
oh,
all right.
All right.

557
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.710
Remember that girl got bit by the,
by the camel.
What?

558
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.850
You don't remember when the girl got bit by the camel kind?
Oh,

559
00:34:55.851 --> 00:35:00.290
that group of girls did see broads in front of us and the guy goes,
all right.

560
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.520
Uh,
if you go to feed the camels and you run out of food,

561
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:08.360
make sure you're not basically within their,
their camel

562
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.120
was it?
And it was at a Llama.
Yeah.

563
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.050
Isn't like a,
a camel's a Lama with like osteoporosis,
isn't it?

564
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:25.850
It's got,
it's got lumps.
Right.
Personally,

565
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:29.660
my favorite outkast album.
Why are you,
why are you looking at that?

566
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:35.370
Oh,
cause I downloaded it just cause I like the bass drum.
Oh,
okay.
This,

567
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.493
this bass drum.

568
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.830
<v 7>Oh,
ready</v>

569
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.603
to go?
Good.

570
00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.800
<v 1>MMM.
Yeah.
Do you not remember that he whatever the fuck it was.
It was something,</v>

571
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.340
yeah.
Not from this country.
Right.
Lamas don't have the green card.
Do they?

572
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.520
Is Trump getting rid of them too?
I'm probably,
I stand with the llamas.

573
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.760
They're filthy that rapists.

574
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.113
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

575
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.820
<v 1>Yeah.
They take now the jobs that are eaten all the grass.
Right,</v>

576
00:36:13.821 --> 00:36:17.750
exactly.
Then all the cows are like,
oh,
fucking forum.

577
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.080
Um,
is that a fat joke?
I don't think it was.
Anyway,

578
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.700
so he tells him whatever the fuck it was.

579
00:36:22.701 --> 00:36:26.240
It was alarm or if I got an a guess three animals.

580
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:30.890
It was either a camel.
I think it was a camel.
Okay.
Um,

581
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.420
so the beginning of a joke,

582
00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.770
a camel along camel and a Lama and a giraffe are all at a winery.

583
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:42.170
So the guy on the fucking,
the guy was dressed like a,
the man with the yellow

584
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.690
<v 7>hat says to these dead tends to everybody in the fucking truck.</v>

585
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.100
He was getting dressed the way they are.

586
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.870
They always dressed with those safari closed and then not doing anything is

587
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.920
you're just riding in a truck with me.
You could we wearing sweatpants,

588
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.370
the yellow hat.
Ah,

589
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.240
<v 1>Doug is jarring.
Oh,
curious George.</v>

590
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.600
I'm curious.
George W.
Bush.
Um,
so he says,

591
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.000
he tells these ladies,
he tells everybody,
he goes,

592
00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:13.460
if you run out of fucking whatever the fuck we were feeding them,

593
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.490
make sure you're not in their wheelhouse because then they just going to chomp

594
00:37:16.491 --> 00:37:21.020
down on you.
Uh,
because they're,
they're lunatics,
right?

595
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.470
So I forget what the fuck he said.
So these,
these,

596
00:37:24.471 --> 00:37:29.210
these ditzy ladies go over there and she tries,
she runs out of fucking grass.

597
00:37:29.211 --> 00:37:32.300
And then she turns around and tries to do a selfie in this thing came down and

598
00:37:32.301 --> 00:37:35.840
just chopped her shoulder.
She kind of pulled away quick enough.

599
00:37:35.841 --> 00:37:39.260
I remember she had some sort of,
yeah,
just like nipped her or whatever it was.

600
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.970
Yeah.
That was the greatest thing ever.
She came back to the track like,

601
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.620
<v 7>oh my God,
it's,
you see that it's just totally good.</v>

602
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:47.580
My shoulder,

603
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.620
<v 1>and then the fucking curious.</v>

604
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:53.070
George Guy had shades on and he just so everybody can hear it.
He just went,

605
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.450
I fucking told you.

606
00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.860
<v 7>I was like,

But that was a good time.</v>

608
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.390
We went from mom's birthday.
That was nice.
Yeah.

609
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:08.850

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.890
<v 1>can imagine all those people who learned to play the fucking saxophone in the</v>

615
00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:24.630
50s thinking like that was never going to end.

616
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:29.010
There was always a saxophone solo and then all of a sudden it just fucking
ended.

617
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.720
You know,

I mean there is,

633
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.710

Saxophone,

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.640
Lionel Richie Saxophone,
the Alto Sax.

Wait.
Does he play it?
No.
And he was in the Commodore's.

636
00:39:50.461 --> 00:39:53.310
He was like,

637
00:39:53.311 --> 00:39:55.260
Phil Collins is playing drums and I'm suddenly singing,

638
00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:00.990
but I don't know.
I don't think he played at Lionel Richie.
Oh,

Although sec.
No,

00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:07.380
but he played the fucking horn.
Fine evidence.
Where are the receipts?

Do you want to bet?
Yeah.
How much?
Five bucks.

But you 50 bucks.

643
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.560

It doesn't look like it.

657

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.610
Um,
well the hipster beard.
Who Knew?

You're right.
Alright.

703
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.140
[inaudible] Hey,
what's up?
I'm back.
Here's the fucking read here.

704
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.033
Lift everybody.

705
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.810
Lyft knows that their drivers are what keeps them moving.
Oh Geez.

706
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.180
They're really on it aren't they need so they do everything they can to make

707
00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:53.730
sure where their drivers are happy on every trip.

708
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.020
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

709
00:44:58.170 --> 00:44:59.940
Lift believes that being a ride,

710
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:03.510
sharing drivers should be fun if you're having a good time.

711
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:04.860
So are the passengers.

712
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.050
Lift was also first to offer in APP tipping.
When you drive for Lyft,

713
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:11.880
you keep 100% of the tips.

714
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.930
Drivers have been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was first

715
00:45:15.931 --> 00:45:16.710
introduced.

716
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:21.710
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting weeks.

717
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.960
Almost instantly there's a loophole there.

718
00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.170
Lift has even taken the guesswork out of pickups.

719
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:33.171
The new amp amp device uses color coding to help passengers find their driveway.

720
00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:37.050
You could earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
One,
earn more money,

721
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.830
drive mower.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

722
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:43.770
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

723
00:45:43.771 --> 00:45:46.380

740

797
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:51.770
from Spain.
And if he came to Boston and try to get a job,

798
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.650
he'd be really fucked with most of the people he'd interview with.

806
00:51:22.771 --> 00:51:27.720
book.
He sale in 1492 he sailed the ocean blue.

807
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.330
He thought he was going to the West indies.

808
00:51:30.331 --> 00:51:35.250
This is like there once was a man from Nantucket there once was a man from

809
00:51:35.251 --> 00:51:40.140
Spain,
a wet and his balls,

810
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:45.120
a pain.
He couldn't get laid.
He tried every day.
So he said,
fuck it,

811
00:51:45.121 --> 00:51:46.920
I'm going to sail.
So I have something to talk about.

812
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.611
I don't know guys.

813
00:51:50.611 --> 00:51:54.090
This is funny to me and I'm buzzing pretty fucking good and I really don't give

814
00:51:54.091 --> 00:51:57.420
a shit.
I do give a shit.
I care.
I care about you.

815
00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.240
And how did you enjoy Columbus state?
What did you do?

816
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:05.300
Did you put on like a fucking George Washington wig and stand on the neck of the

817
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.840
tennis person that you know,
in celebration of all the great things he did.
Um,

818
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:13.710
I've always had difficulty once I got past a certain age with the fact that that

819
00:52:13.711 --> 00:52:15.450
guy,
they said he discovered,

820
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:21.090
he discovered like he discovered it for Europe.
He didn't discover it.

821
00:52:21.091 --> 00:52:22.830
There was already people here.
You know what I mean?

822
00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:27.090
Just sitting here living off the land,
you know,

823
00:52:27.091 --> 00:52:31.440
a little mud flap over that junk using up every bit of the animal.

824
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.880
They did nothing wrong.

825
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.540
That's the overcorrection of native Americans where they've now become like

826
00:52:36.541 --> 00:52:40.200
these godlike people where none of them were bad.
You know,

827
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.970
none of them would have fucked you out of your four zero one k money had they

828
00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:49.410
understood what a 401k was and could tie a tie.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

829
00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:53.280
people are people.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's get down to brass tacks here.
People.

830
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.593
All right.

831
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.010
Just because you sit in their philosophy with the fucking bison tendon doesn't

832
00:52:59.011 --> 00:53:02.190
mean that,
you know,
if you had a car,

833
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:07.860
you wouldn't get a little grabby on the first date.
All right?
Okay.

834
00:53:07.861 --> 00:53:12.000
And if you can't do the math on that,
that I can help you.
Um,

835
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:16.750

You sitting there with half a fucking erection looking at some chick next to you

838
00:53:22.411 --> 00:53:27.411
and there's some guy in a Goddamn tweed coat talking about a Vinny del Negro.

839
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.640
What was he yelling?
What was,
what was the other guy?

840
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.830
The other world explorer.

841
00:53:33.831 --> 00:53:38.220
It was a merry go Vespucci it was Christopher Columbus and then there was a guy

842
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:41.310
who had like a Vinny del Negro name,
but it wasn't Vinny del Negro.

843
00:53:41.311 --> 00:53:42.300
But though that's in my head,

844
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:45.570
so I'll never be able to think of what the fuck was it?
Was it Marcus?

845
00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:49.530
The Lafayette?
Was that him?

846
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.310
And he wasn't the trader in the revolutionary war.

847
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:57.590
That was benedict Arnold.
Marcus the Lafayette.

848
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.960
Did he start Marquette University?
He did something.

849
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:04.950
He wasn't with Lewis and Clark.
I don't fucking know.

850
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.310
You know what's funny is just all the shit that was done to create this country

851
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:12.660
and they kind of boil it down to like 14 people.
These guys sailed up a river.

852
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:17.640
This guy found it.
This guy said,
I can't tell a lie.
And a the other guy said,

853
00:54:17.641 --> 00:54:20.310
hey,
why don't you lay off the black people for a minute?
You know?

854
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:25.311
And that's pretty much the first 200 years of history in this country as far as

855
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:31.080
I can tell.
You know?
And for all you Europeans listening and all you Australians,

856
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:33.390
that doesn't mean your country's better.
Alright,

857
00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.680
so fuck you when your fish and chips and your vegemite sandwiches because nobody

858
00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:40.770
gives a shit.
All right?
You just just felt these,
we are

859
00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:47.440
<v 10>good
in
months</v>

860
00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.490
in the summer,
the body's waking,

861
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.280
I've been

862
00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.180
with
smoking,

863
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.360
<v 12>can't protest without getting teargassed shot at you</v>

864
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.250
<v 8>all around the world.</v>

865
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.120
<v 12>You know,
they act like you,
you know,</v>

866
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:19.710
we want to hear from our people and you go out there,
he just sitting out there,

867
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:20.320
all you doing it,

868
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.990
you got signs in your chanting and then the cops come down there and they start

869
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:27.450
pushing people around and they throw fucking tear guests.

870
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:33.060
I don't understand why,
why can't you do that?
Why aren't you allowed to protest?

871
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:34.171
Look,

872
00:55:34.171 --> 00:55:37.170
I understand if you go down there and you start breaking windows in that type of

873
00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:40.470
shit.
Uh,
but I,
I actually believe,

874
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.530
and I know you guys are gonna think that I'm paranoid.
If I was in power,

875
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:45.030
I would just say,
hey,

876
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.600
how old you kiss sun is set them out there and have him throw a rock through a

877
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:51.810
window so we could look justified when we get rid of these fucking people out

878
00:55:51.811 --> 00:55:53.730
here.
Um,

879
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:58.000
<v 8>Adam,
I'm sorry,
I'm going back down the fucking rat hole again.</v>

880
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.240
Somebody sent me a great rant that this guy went on,

881
00:56:01.241 --> 00:56:05.280
on a news program and he was talking about the bankers.
Uh,

882
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.070
cause I can't even watch the news right now with our government might shut down

883
00:56:09.071 --> 00:56:14.071
in a couple of days with this guy was basically going off saying all that banker

884
00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:14.914
shit.

885
00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.600
<v 12>I was trying to say a few years ago when I started watching those videos and</v>

886
00:56:18.601 --> 00:56:19.740
everybody was saying,
Oh yeah,

887
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:24.550
these are fucking fat guys living in their mother's who?
A,

888
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:26.740
they don't have any lives.
And you just,
you know,

889
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:30.460
you're drinking the Koolaid and all this shit that look,
a lot of that stuff.

890
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:32.920
We never landed on the moon.
I'll give you all that shit.

891
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:34.100
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

892
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.280
<v 12>okay.
Maybe all of that stuff.
Nine eleven's in inside job.</v>

893
00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:40.880
I'm not talking about any of that fucking crap,
but that banker shit,

894
00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:46.180
I'm telling you,
that banker shit is dead on,

895
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.140
dead fucking on.
It's not the left.
It's not the right,

896
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.130
it's those cuts right in the middle with money on both sides of the ball.

897
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.400
It's those guys.
And um,
I have to tell you,
dude,

898
00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.930
the fact that the president only makes 400 grand a year and it just,

899
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:05.400
the way they frame it,
like,
oh,
he's a public servant.
And bookbub.

900
00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:08.470
It's the biggest crock of shit out there.

901
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.500
The only person who would take that job,

902
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:14.760
you'd have to be the biggest fucking yes man on the planet just to get there.

903
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:17.890
Yeah.

904
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:21.790
Who the fuck would run for a job where it cost 100 million to get it so you can

905
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:26.610
make 400 grand a year.
Yeah.
That isn't a red flag to anybody.

906
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.320
Then you get to go around giving speeches,
a million dollars a whack like that.

907
00:57:31.321 --> 00:57:34.050
Isn't he a kickback for fucking pushing through whatever they wanted.

908
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.690
I just think it's,
it's so beyond corrupt.

909
00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:38.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

910
00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:43.800
<v 12>And I used to think shit like I can't believe we're letting these pencil pushing</v>

911
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:47.160
banking policies push us around,
but it's not them.

912
00:57:47.161 --> 00:57:49.350
It's the fact that people will do anything for money.

913
00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:53.730
So when you have that kind of money,
you can hire psychos and uh,
you know,

914
00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:56.640
I dunno,
you get that.

915
00:57:56.641 --> 00:58:01.020
You get that Lincoln town car ride the convertible in Dallas.
All right.

916
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.540
I spoke about it vaguely,
but you know what I'm saying?

917
00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:09.100
<v 10>Slow down.
Watch the spin around freedom.</v>

918
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.770
<v 11>Wait,
the Dan</v>

919
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:22.430
[inaudible] got 21 that's

920
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.860
the hand gun down the back down
again.

921
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:50.410
[inaudible]

922
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:50.890
<v 12>going on.</v>

923
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.880
It is a bill burn it just the Monday morning podcast and it sounds really

924
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:59.380
fucking loud.
Why is that?
Why is that?
Cause my volumes up.

925
00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:04.000
There we go.
I'm not red lining.
Mia.
Hello.
Test One,
two C.

926
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:06.970
I usually do that part before I get on the fucking thing.
But I didn't,

927
00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.500
I didn't this time cause I'm doing it,
uh,

928
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:13.090
on Sunday night because for some reason I have the whole apartment to myself

929
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.630
other than my dog chilling out and a whatever.

930
00:59:16.631 --> 00:59:20.970
This is the Monday morning podcast.
How are you?

931
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.760
Oh,
that's fantastic.
I'm actually in a great fucking mood.

932
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:32.060
I don't sound like it.
I'm in a great mood.
You know why?
Because,
well,

933
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:34.880
because of a number of things.
Okay.
First of all,

934
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.830
as any man,
a happy story,
I just don't want to forget to tell this story.

935
00:59:39.831 --> 00:59:44.831
I was out at a friend's birthday party and a ranting about the Yankees.

936
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.550
Of course,
my hatred of the Yankees.
It's literally,
it's getting embarrassing.

937
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.030
It's like at a child like level.
Um,

938
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:56.780
I th I get infuriated every time somebody brings up the Yankees and they don't

939
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:59.000
mention that they've spent $200 million.

940
00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:02.960
Why wouldn't they be up two games to none over the fucking angels?
Okay.

941
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.240
It just annoys me.
You know,
I already fucking,
I just,

942
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:10.460
but I have to stop because people out here don't give a fuck.

943
01:00:10.461 --> 01:00:14.150
And I'm talking to like some guy from fucking Milwaukee and he's like,
yeah,

944
01:00:14.151 --> 01:00:17.660
you know,
uh,
you know,
you guys kind of take our players too,

945
01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:20.240
so I don't really give a shit.
And I'm like,
no,

946
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.280
but the Yankees are in our division.
What do we,

947
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.020
what the fuck are we supposed to do?
You know,

948
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.100
we're trying to end an 80 year curse that one fucking time,
right?

949
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.680
This pen a tour to million dollars.
What are we supposed to,

950
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:33.290
baseball's not stopping him.
What the fuck was he?
Look,
here I go again.

951
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.920
Here I go again.
Just like that awful Whitesnake song.
So anyway,

952
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:39.770
so I'm at this birthday party,
right?
I'm sitting there,

953
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:44.690
I'm having a couple of Budweiser's,
you know,
because I want to,
you know,

954
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.780
and this lady comes over,
you know,
it's the birthday time.

955
01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:51.050
Happy Birthday dear touche bag.
Right?

956
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:54.320
And they bring that it's not a douche bag,
but they bring the fucking cake over.

957
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.250
Okay.
And then little Susie,
Miss uh,

958
01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:01.010
cunty box starts cutting up the fucking cake.
You know,

959
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.830
there's always that fucking,
you know,
soccer mom to be,

960
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.580
who just has to all of a sudden start fucking running things like the fucking

961
01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:08.900
control freak that she is.

962
01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.980
So I'm sitting there drinking beer and she comes over with this fucking piece of

963
01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:17.870
cake and she just sets it down here.
You want a piece of cake?
And I'm like,
no,

964
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.240
no I don't.
And she goes,

965
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:23.420
why not first red flag.

966
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.520
Then I'm dealing with a pushy comment.
Would you like some cake?
No.
No I wouldn't.

967
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.940
Why not?
Because I,

968
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.900
you fucking asked me that and that's what my inside said.
No,
I don't want cake.

969
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.290
I've got to give you a follow up find.
You want to follow up fucking answer.

970
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:43.820
I'll tell you why.
Because the cake is blue.
It's a blue cake.
She goes,

971
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.730
that's not the cake.
It's the,
that's just the die.

972
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.140
And she walks away and leaves the cake there.
Stupid as fuck and response ever.

973
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:56.060
That's not the cake.
It's the dye.
You mean the dye in the cake?
Oh,

974
01:01:56.061 --> 01:01:59.090
I all,
I go,
oh,
I get it.
I get it.
All I do is just eat the cake part.

975
01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:01.100
I don't eat the blue part.
Exactly.

976
01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:04.790
Where do I enter the cake to get to the part that actually looks like fucking

977
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:09.620
cake and doesn't look like a,
you spilled one of those roofie drinks on it.

978
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.120
Oh,
just fucking annoyed me.

979
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.740
And then I'm watching a bouncing around just handing people cake with his stupid

980
01:02:15.741 --> 01:02:20.100
skirt and her smart looking fucking shoes.
You know,

981
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.950
little miss fucking PTA.
She just,

982
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.370
she does look like the kind of fucking broad that,
you know,

983
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.520
he's got nothing better to do.
This is,
this is her future.

984
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.210
She's going to have a couple of fucking kids and she's going to be all involved

985
01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:37.140
in the fucking school and she's going to know everybody's God damn names and

986
01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:37.974
just ah,

987
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:42.660
and it's just going to be her agenda and her agenda is going to fucking pass,

988
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.800
you know,
the same way I said no to the cake.
And this twat takes,

989
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:50.550
does not take no for an answer.
Would you like some cake?
No,
I wouldn't.
You know,

990
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:53.130
why is it socially unacceptable for me?

991
01:02:53.131 --> 01:02:57.210
I should have just picked that fucking piece of cake up with the plate and just

992
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.073
mushed it.

993
01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:03.030
I said I didn't learn any right in their fucking face there.

994
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.960
My faith is blue.
Oh,

995
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:11.720
that's just the die fucking Douche bag.
So anyways,

996
01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:16.470
sorry.
I had to get that out.
I actually had a,
had a great week,
you know,

997
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:22.140
um,
as most of you know,
I had a,
uh,
had a bad experience on us air this past week.

998
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:26.430
They charge 25 bucks for the first bag and a,
when I landed,

999
01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:29.760
I had to wait almost an hour to get my bag,
you know?

1000
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:35.130
And I actually got the email and I promised you guys I was going to complain to

1001
01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:38.370
him.
You know,
and I know what you guys are probably thinking,
oh,

1002
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:42.420
it's a fucking corporation.
What the fuck are you going to do?
This is what I did.

1003
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.490
Okay.
You know,
because you have to,
I'm telling you,
you have,

1004
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.910
we have to start looking at the psycho.
I'm actually using the word weak,

1005
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.030
which I never do.
I believe that,
uh,

1006
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.520
people need to start questioning some of the,

1007
01:03:56.521 --> 01:04:00.990
some of the demands that these corporations are making on people because it's

1008
01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:04.950
getting ridiculous.
You're sitting on a flight,
there's 300 people on the flight.

1009
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.130
Nobody wants to pay 25 bucks for the first bag yet everybody does because

1010
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:15.030
nobody's bitching or they take the,
uh,
every man for themself route.
Well,

1011
01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:19.140
I'll just fucking bring one shirt and a jock strap and that way I'll shove it

1012
01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:22.470
underneath the seat and I'll save my own ass,
you know?

1013
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.160
And those of you who do that,
your own little selfish fucking way,

1014
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:30.150
I hope you're married,
that chick with the blue cake.
Um,
so anyways,
as you notice,

1015
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:32.730
I have a temper.
If you're new to my podcast and I don't give a fuck,

1016
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:35.770
I think it's refreshing to sit here and do,

1017
01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.930
that's the kind of shit that kills you.

1018
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.780
A little blue KC moments fucking kill you after.

1019
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.370
Why you just hold onto it and it's like,

1020
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:45.780
well she is kind of pushy and then you slowly just start eating the fucking
cake,

1021
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.733
you know,

1022
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.710
sound of children's wet feet running across concrete as you sit there and that

1023
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:56.400
stupid fucking hourglass shaped pool right outside of that.

1024
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.470
And is that what you guys do out there in the suburbs?

1025
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.540
Some sort of rock formation,
artificial waterfall.
Um,

1026
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:06.220
anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?
See,

1027
01:05:06.221 --> 01:05:09.930
what you have to do is you have to learn how to complain to these corporate

1028
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:11.790
fucks.
Okay?
Um,

1029
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:15.240
like here's an example of someone who actually writing,
you know,

1030
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:18.460
what do I really have time to read that?
Do I want to read it?

1031
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.740
What do you guys want to do?
You want to hear the way not to do it?

1032
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:23.020
Like one of those old little fucking school film strips?

1033
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.960
You know Eddie,
correct way,
Susie.
Wrong way.
All right,
here's the wrong way.

1034
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.970
A bill.
Here's a story regarding,
uh,
poor service.
About two years ago,

1035
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:37.960
I took my,
uh,
my family wife and two sons,
ages six and four at the time,

1036
01:05:37.961 --> 01:05:41.580
social security number's nine,
seven,
eight up to New Hampshire in a,

1037
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:42.521
the white mountains.

1038
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:46.330
And we went to the wild west themed amusement parks so we could have some fun.

1039
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.030
Now,
generally,
I'm a pretty angry guy,

1040
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:53.230
but I try not to be so fucking miserable around my kids because I don't want

1041
01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:54.490
them to be the same as me.

1042
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:59.940
So I try and act like a normal human being and let shit go when I get a,

1043
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.920
when I get fucked to a certain degree.
Dude,

1044
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:04.870
I can't even tell you how much I relate to that,
you know,

1045
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.030
of course my wife will encourage this as well.
Um,
just calm down.

1046
01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:15.010
Everything will be all right.
I don't understand why he gets so upset.
Um,

1047
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.350
he literally said,
insert your chip voice there.
Of course,
you know,

1048
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:19.660
I was going to do that.
Um,
anyway,
uh,

1049
01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:23.980
we decided it's time to get some lunch at the old wild west show and we go into

1050
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.340
some shitty little pizza stand inside the park that's in quotes.

1051
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.990
You can already feel as anger.
Um,
and the line's pretty long,
but,
uh,

1052
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:33.940
it's lunch so it's expected.

1053
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:38.260
I then tell me wife and kids to wear it outside as I will order for the kids.

1054
01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.630
And so the kids don't get antsy,
you know,

1055
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:44.290
take them over to some fucking struggling actor dressed as Winnie the pooh while

1056
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.050
I go get the pizza slices.
Basically.

1057
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.640
This is how I'm going to start compensating for my fucking bed.

1058
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:52.810
Reading out loud skills is,
I'm just going to start paraphrasing anyway.
So,
uh,

1059
01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:54.970
as I waited about 20 minutes to order,

1060
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.780
I'm looking at the cluster fuck that's going on and passing for an organ

1061
01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.590
organization behind the counter.
Um,

1062
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:07.510
apparently some mid 40 ish year old douche bag who does the hiring has decided

1063
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:11.560
it would be great to hire all 20 year old chicks or chicks in their twenties

1064
01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:14.440
with Russian based,
uh,
from Russian,

1065
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.550
from Russia,
based on their hotness.
Sorry guys.
Um,
and they were pretty hot.
Well,

1066
01:07:21.551 --> 01:07:23.560
I'm a married man with my wife and kids with me.

1067
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:26.020
So at this point I don't give a fuck how,
uh,
um,

1068
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:29.510
I don't give a fuck as I'm not banging any of them anyway.

1069
01:07:29.511 --> 01:07:34.360
So I finally ordered and I began to wait.
After about 40 minutes of waiting,

1070
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:38.950
my oldest son comes in and tells me his mother sent him to us where the food is.

1071
01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:44.260
Now,
keep in mind that this is a full 60 minutes with no food in his mind.

1072
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:46.600
So I tell him to go back and I'll be out soon.

1073
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.410
Now my wife sends him back because she doesn't want to lose the prime dirty

1074
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:53.740
table that she is cleaned herself up.

1075
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:57.190
Those amusement park tables are the worst.
So I ask in a polite way,

1076
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:01.540
when my food will,
we,
when my food will be ready,
can't even fuck,

1077
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.770
and this Russian looks at me and says in five minutes,

1078
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.710
I then watch her go over there and reread my slip.

1079
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:12.610
And then I watch your sprinkle the bullshit toppings that I asked for on my

1080
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:17.330
piece of Cardboard Shit than I'm paying $25 for to begin with.

1081
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:21.560
And she begins to cook it.
I then asked her if that's what happened,

1082
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:25.220
basically saying,
did you forget my fucking order?
Um,

1083
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.380
and she says,
no.
So I'm fucking starving.
And I'm furious.

1084
01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:32.600
So I start acting like a fucking asshole.

1085
01:08:32.601 --> 01:08:37.130
And I start talking really loud saying that I've been here for 40 minutes

1086
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:40.760
waiting and I'm watching people leave before me who ordered after me,

1087
01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:44.890
and then I say,
just tell me,
Jill,
my phone's ringing in the other room.

1088
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.970
I'd have to ignore it.
He goes,
ah,
just tell me that what you did.

1089
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:53.270
Wait,
just tell me that you did one.

1090
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:58.271
I know you did and that you made a mistake and that you just made my pizza.

1091
01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:02.330
You basically Joe Pesci in uh,
and casino.

1092
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:04.430
I'm going to give you the money.

1093
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:07.850
Just tell me you gambled you fucking degenerate piece of shit.
Right?

1094
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:12.170
So it's at this moment as I should have realized that I'm 36 years old at the

1095
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:13.080
time,
about six,

1096
01:09:13.081 --> 01:09:16.880
two and 200 plus pound yelling at probably a five foot 10 inch skinny Russian

1097
01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:21.850
chick who's about 22 years old.
But of course I didn't.
Um,
however,

1098
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:25.580
some country,
45 year old chick sure did and starts,

1099
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:28.700
I guess this is another customer and starts to button and tell me to leave her

1100
01:09:28.701 --> 01:09:29.420
alone.

1101
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.350
I then blow up and tell her her mind around fucking business as well as you

1102
01:09:33.351 --> 01:09:35.930
should have.
Anyways,
I'm sorry,

1103
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:38.540
that was a blue Cape woman seeping into this.

1104
01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.900
I tell her a minor on fucking business and stay the fuck out of it.

1105
01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:46.670
And I turn around to the other 25 people or so people waiting in our already

1106
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:48.320
paid douche bag section,

1107
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:52.760
holding our slips and I try to garner some momentum and say something like,

1108
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.980
aren't you all waiting here to this?
This is ridiculous,
right?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Uh,

1109
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.441
I was then,

1110
01:09:57.441 --> 01:10:02.330
I noticed my six year old with his eyes and mouth wide open looking at me and

1111
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:05.240
either or shame,
I'm still not sure which.

1112
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.360
So I asked you as another angry guide.

1113
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:12.050
You think I should have just kept my mouth closed and continued to be part of

1114
01:10:12.051 --> 01:10:17.051
some fuck ups scenario in which some retard wants to fuck a young Russian and I

1115
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:21.770
have to suffer by receiving poor service or continued to call out bullshit when

1116
01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:26.390
I see it.
All right?
See if you are 100% the right there.
All right?

1117
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.890
Uh,
no.
You shouldn't start screaming and yes,

1118
01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.720
she shouldn't do that in front of your kid.
Um,

1119
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.800
what you should've done it was you should have asked to see a manager and he

1120
01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:39.620
should've complained.
And uh,

1121
01:10:39.621 --> 01:10:42.860
what you should've done was basically,

1122
01:10:42.861 --> 01:10:47.600
there's a magic word that you use in there and it's not,
fuck,
it's unacceptable.

1123
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.950
Okay?
You just have to keep your cool and you say,
listen,

1124
01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:55.880
I've been waiting here for 50 minutes for a slice of pizza.
Okay.

1125
01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.510
And when they go,
oh,
it's coming right up.
Just be,
it's unacceptable.

1126
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.330
I just saw you put toppings,
you read my slip,
you put topics.

1127
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:03.440
I feel that's what happened.

1128
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.410
I want to speak to a manager and then when the manager comes over,

1129
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.670
you just tell them in a nice,
calm tone,
what's going on,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1130
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.610
That's the way to go about it.
And you just say,
I want some sort of compensation.

1131
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.400
And when they say that they cannot give you any compensation,

1132
01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:21.810
you just keep saying that is unacceptable and you keep asking for people above

1133
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.370
them.
If they are not there,

1134
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.710
you get a phone number and when you get a phone number,

1135
01:11:25.711 --> 01:11:29.430
then you write a fucking email and you have to go that route.
And I swear to God,

1136
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.990
good shit happens.
Why?
Why would I know that?

1137
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:37.680
Because this is the second half of my a US airways story.

1138
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:41.130
All right.
They basically,
you know,

1139
01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:45.390
they sent me to their Internet to complain that I had to wait an hour for my

1140
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:49.910
fucking bag,
that I paid 25 bucks for it.
So I go onto their website.
All right.

1141
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:52.470
I think I explained this last week.
So you know,
what do I get?

1142
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.980
What do I get from these assholes?
They have a whole page where as I'm,

1143
01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.660
I'm trying to register to complain,
they're sucking out even more information.

1144
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.780
So I've decided that that was unacceptable.
I'm not fucking doing that.

1145
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:07.500
So I called the number and I called the people at,
at a US air.

1146
01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.340
I said very nicely.
I said,
look,
I understand that you,
you don't make the policy.

1147
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:12.690
I'm not upset with you.

1148
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.160
I'm upset with the guy sitting on the yacht with the US airways tie tack right

1149
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:21.600
now.
Um,
sunning himself with my $25,

1150
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:26.490
you know,
and a,
I want my money back.
And they said,
well,
go to the website.
I said,

1151
01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:29.070
I don't want to give you all that information.
And The lady said,
well,

1152
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:31.080
that's the only way you can get your money back.
And I said,
well,

1153
01:12:31.081 --> 01:12:33.660
that's unacceptable.
I'd like to speak to somebody else.

1154
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.650
So she gives me somebody else.
They tried to take me to the back to the website.

1155
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.380
I say,
that's unacceptable.
I don't want to give you all that information.

1156
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:44.100
There's no reason for me.
I have to give you all that information.
She goes,
well,

1157
01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:47.940
that's our procedure.
I said,
that's unacceptable.
So finally,

1158
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:51.480
after just keep saying unacceptable and I wouldn't curse,
I didn't lose my cool.

1159
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:53.760
I wouldn't get off the phone.
All of a sudden,

1160
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:58.170
now all of a sudden they have some new direct email to give me to some person at

1161
01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:02.280
us airways and all you have to do is leave my name the flight I was on,

1162
01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:03.570
what the situation was,

1163
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:06.360
and give them a callback number and they'll get back to me within two days.

1164
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:11.460
So this is the letter I sent him.
I said,
my name is William Byrd.

1165
01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.860
I use William when I'm complaining.
Uh,
I flew us airways from uh,

1166
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.300
Pittsburgh de Los Angeles connected here in Phoenix,
Arizona Sunday,
October 11th.

1167
01:13:21.301 --> 01:13:24.570
I paid the outrageous sum of $25 to have my first bag checked.

1168
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:28.920
When I landed in Los Angeles,
I had to wait 55 minutes for my bag.

1169
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:33.810
55 is capitalized as to stress that that is an outrageous amount of time.

1170
01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.540
Anyways,
I said,
at no time during the hour long wait,

1171
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.640
did any employee of US Airways make any attempt to inform its customers as to

1172
01:13:40.641 --> 01:13:43.500
what the problem was?
When I finally found an employee,

1173
01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:47.760
I was told that US airways had employed a skeleton crew on this particular day.

1174
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.833
In other words,

1175
01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:52.800
there were not enough people working that day to handle the workload.
Hence,

1176
01:13:52.801 --> 01:13:56.730
my girlfriend had to pay for parking at the airport and we had to sit for almost

1177
01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.450
an hour until the skeleton crew was able to get me,
get my bag to me.

1178
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.800
I fly every other weekend and recently flew to Sweden with my girlfriend on US

1179
01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:06.330
airways.
As a loyal customer,

1180
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.070
I need some sort of gesture on your part to show that you respect the fact that

1181
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.370
I use your airline and that you care about the service that you provide provide.

1182
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.020
Therefore,
I feel I am entitled to a full refund of my $25 bag fee.

1183
01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:25.380
I would like to be contacted at this number between the hours of this and this,

1184
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:30.710
this Thursday,
October 15th to resolve this matter.
Sincerely,
William Burb,
blah,

1185
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:34.750
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
All right,
so I'm all geared up.

1186
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.120
I'm clearing my schedule for the four hour window.

1187
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:40.390
Wait for this person to call fucking the next day I get an email.

1188
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:44.510
Dear Mister Burn,
due to the circumstances of you have described,
um,

1189
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:49.090
as a one time courtesy,
I have authorized a refund of your baggage fee.

1190
01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:54.130
Please allow up to 30 days for posting back to the original form of payment.

1191
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:56.081
Okay?
First of all,

1192
01:14:56.081 --> 01:14:59.140
what I love about this shit is they act like they're doing me a favor.

1193
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.100
Do the circumstances you have described as a one time courtesy.

1194
01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.500
Now,
this isn't a courtesy.
This is standard business.

1195
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.980
This isn't a one time courtesy.
This is an every time courtesy.

1196
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:15.840
I'm never waiting 55 minutes for my bag that I paid 25 bucks for.

1197
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.480
That's unacceptable.
It's unacceptable.

1198
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:23.040
Magic word people unacceptable.
But this is the great thing about corporations.

1199
01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.810
Even though I'm getting my money back,

1200
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.870
they still gonna make me crawl through another hundred yards is shit.

1201
01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:29.550
This is the next paragraph.

1202
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:34.170
While customer relations is unable to view our refund department's computer

1203
01:15:34.171 --> 01:15:35.004
system,

1204
01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:40.650
you may check the status of your refund via our website.
Uh,

1205
01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.650
click on the refund inquiry ink link.

1206
01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:48.270
Proceed to the check refunds status link on the following screen.

1207
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:50.700
Input your 13 digit ticket number.

1208
01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:53.970
Please direct all future refund status in Greece.

1209
01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:58.230
Inquiries to our refund department.
So wait,

1210
01:15:58.231 --> 01:16:00.330
do I have to do all that shit?
They get my money back.

1211
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.630
I guess that's the view,
the status of it.
It's gonna take like a month.
So,

1212
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.740
uh,
but anyways,
there you go.
So I did that.

1213
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.930
I asked for my fucking money back.
That is James Brown on the background

1214
01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:26.260
and I got my fucking 25 bucks back and I never quit.

1215
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:36.820
Sorry.
I thought the,
I'm king quicker.
I can never be a DJ.

1216
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.660
These fucking assholes,
man.
I got my fucking money back.

1217
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.460
I had to go through a bunch of shit.
But I'm telling you,

1218
01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:47.050
the key word is to say unacceptable.
It's fucking unacceptable.

1219
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:51.640
And you know what?
It is unacceptable.
It's unacceptable that you got to pay $25.

1220
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:55.780
It's all bullshit there.
They're charging $25 you know why?

1221
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:59.590
Because American Airlines did it and they got away with it and nobody fucking

1222
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.540
complaint.
I'm not saying you have to fucking complain,
but you should.
All right.

1223
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:08.920
Nobody is sticking up for regular fucking people.
And I hope this little,

1224
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:14.040
we'll encourage you to complain.
What is wrong with my voice?

1225
01:17:14.041 --> 01:17:14.970
I've got too many shows.

1226
01:17:14.971 --> 01:17:19.971
How many times is it going to crack to complain when it's time to change and he

1227
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:24.480
fucking Brady bunch fans out there.
So there you go.
I got my fucking money back,

1228
01:17:24.481 --> 01:17:27.330
I guess.
Although I have to check the status of it,

1229
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.380
guarantee I don't get it back and then I got to remind them,
oh yeah,

1230
01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:33.870
that's right.
And then they sit in the conference room.
Jesus Christ,

1231
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.280
he's part of the 0.1% who actually checked the status of his fucking refund.

1232
01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:46.090
So that's the new me.
That's what the new me does.
They knew me.

1233
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.070
When I get fucked by a corporation,

1234
01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.240
I do not lose my shit and curse the way I do on this thing.

1235
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:54.670
That's why I love this podcast.
I just vent.
Okay.

1236
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.730
The new me is I basically,

1237
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:03.210
I keep my cool and I just say that things are unacceptable and I want some sort

1238
01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:06.610
of resolution.
That's what I want.
And if you can't help me,

1239
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.010
if I would like to speak to the person above you,

1240
01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.630
if there's no more person above you,

1241
01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:15.660
I want the name and number and email of the person that I can get in contact

1242
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:17.770
with.
Okay?

1243
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:21.640
So I can have a resolution to this problem.

1244
01:18:21.641 --> 01:18:26.560
I'm telling you that's the way you gotta do it.
So if I was at that park,

1245
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:30.550
I mean sometimes you got to let it go.
I mean,
you're at,

1246
01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:35.380
you're at an amusement park.
Um,
I got to watch out.
My girlfriend's coming home,

1247
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.830
going to make sure mom's not here,
so I can say gut bombs here.

1248
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.720
That wouldn't be good.
Nino.
Hey,
what's up?
Are you by yourself?

1249
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:49.360
Okay,
so I can say cunt and not offend your mother.
Yes,

1250
01:18:49.361 --> 01:18:52.960
I am back.
I'm getting the,
uh,
doing the podcast.
That's what I'm doing.

1251
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:56.620
Where you're coming from.
What do you mean you're not here?

1252
01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:59.260
What are you supposed to be on?
Somebody else's podcast?
What do you achieve?

1253
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:03.400
Not me.
Oh,
okay.
What did you say

1254
01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:09.520
you saw good hair?
Was it a good movie?
A good movie?

1255
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.750
What is it about?
Is it about hair?
That's good.
Oh my God.

1256
01:19:13.751 --> 01:19:18.250
I really enjoyed it.
People had good hair and other people didn't.

1257
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.820
But in the end we realize,
are we all just people?

1258
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:26.800
I might have good hair,
but you have a better shirt.
Oh my God,

1259
01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:32.120
I have to call my brother.
Oh,
that's awesome.
Um,

1260
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.590
so anyways,
uh,
I had a,
I actually had a great week.
I'm out here.

1261
01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:40.970
I was getting off the roads doing a stand up six of the last seven weeks.

1262
01:19:40.971 --> 01:19:45.971
So as I mentioned last week that my surprise from my lovely girlfriend was that

1263
01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:51.070
I was going to rent a corvette convertible for the day.
Yes.

1264
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.180
Which is actually,

1265
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:56.520
it was such a great gift because it was something that I could totally enjoy.

1266
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:59.170
I'm going to tell you something right now.
I know.
Shut up.

1267
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:04.000
You don't talk on the fucking podcast unless I talked to you.
What are you saying

1268
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:08.010
was for you and

1269
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.420
<v 13>I got to participate in it.</v>

1270
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.660
<v 12>Is that how you viewed that?
When I took you up to Pch,</v>

1271
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.020
the fucking Pacific coast highway people vacation,

1272
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:19.890
they fly out here to do that and I took you up there and a corvette convertible

1273
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.750
with the fucking top down.
Like goddamn Steve McQueen.
We rolled right up there.

1274
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:29.010
We had a wonderful lunch.
We Watch people surfing out the fucking window on a,

1275
01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:33.240
on a,
on a w a Thursday,
Thursday.
Most people are at work.

1276
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.480
It was awesome.
Have I spoiled you that bad that you take that for granted?
No,

1277
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:41.400
I just,
I thought it was more like a presence then.
Why?
Why,

1278
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.740
why are you belittling me on my podcast?

1279
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:46.910
<v 13>Well,
they don't you,
I just,
I just felt like it was more,</v>

1280
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:50.270
it was like a present for you that I got to participate in and I loved it.

1281
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.433
But it was like

1282
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:53.860
<v 12>you listen to,
to uh,
try to warm her way out of this.</v>

1283
01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.060
<v 13>I know it was just,</v>

1284
01:20:55.061 --> 01:20:58.540
it was you or you had been talking about the corvette and the doing the thing

1285
01:20:58.541 --> 01:21:01.270
like it was,
it was your thing that you really wanted to do.

1286
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.210
And I was lucky enough that you allowed me to participate.

1287
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:07.380
<v 12>Yeah.
And then they come over and your kids.
Yeah,
and that makes it all better.</v>

1288
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.280
Right?
Sweet.
Sweet.
Get out of here.
See what you just,

1289
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:13.920
I didn't have to do that.

1290
01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.670
I could've got that and I could've gone a could've gone by myself.

1291
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:23.360
Huh?
What do you keep coming with me with that attitude?
Like we're not,
yeah,

1292
01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:26.370
I,
oh my God.
He really annoy me.

1293
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:29.970
Then we went to the Hollywood hills and I took you like driving like fucking

1294
01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.100
James Dean and we thought we were going to go off the cliff,

1295
01:21:32.101 --> 01:21:34.740
but we didn't because of those fat fucking tires.

1296
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.830
That a 22 times the size of the Prius.

1297
01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.790
<v 13>It was amazing.
I wasn't trying to go live a lit just huh.</v>

1298
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.190
<v 12>No,
you didn't know.
This is what you did.</v>

1299
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.290
All of a sudden you started acting like a Oh yeah.

1300
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:48.300
It was really a present for you.
Yeah.

1301
01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:50.490
Obviously it was something I know I wanted to do,

1302
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:54.790
but like I didn't mean like you were reading.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1303
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:59.400
You know what I mean?
You get,
you get the fucking car.
How much fun did you have?

1304
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.780
I had a great time.
Was that not one of the best fucking days you've ever had?

1305
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:07.650
That was one of the best days I've ever had.
Yeah,
100% exactly.

1306
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.610
We spent the day together.
Yes it was,
and I spent all the money.
Right.
I'm sorry.

1307
01:22:12.611 --> 01:22:16.810
I should,
yeah,
there you go.
I would have gotten all dolled up.

1308
01:22:16.811 --> 01:22:19.650
If someone's going to take me for a ride in a corvette convertible,

1309
01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.140
I would have what?
A jerk.

1310
01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:24.730
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1311
01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:26.710
<v 12>All right.
I'm not going to lie to you.
It was for me also.</v>

1312
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:35.080
Oh,
there's one for you guys,
so that's what you do.
Next time a girl say,

1313
01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:39.190
you don't take me anywhere.
I'm telling you,
just go out and rent.

1314
01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.760
Rent the fucking why.
Guys need to hear that.

1315
01:22:42.761 --> 01:22:47.200
I'm balancing out the Oprah universe.
Oh,
shut the door.

1316
01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:49.270
Go fucking watch when he had dumped shows.

1317
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:53.800
10 whores in a house.
What are you watching this week?
Huh?

1318
01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:01.620
Fucking 20 chefs try to compete to get the next fryer later job at Tgi Fridays

1319
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:07.030
and they let themselves get belittled by some fucking chef because he has an

1320
01:23:07.031 --> 01:23:07.864
accent.
Do you know what,

1321
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:11.380
if we ever have a fucking kid and he wants to be a chef and he goes on that show

1322
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:12.400
and he lets that guy,

1323
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:17.050
that hell's kitchen guy talk to him that way and not stab them with one of his

1324
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:20.860
gins,
suse,
I will disown him as a son.
I'll disown him as his son.

1325
01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:26.410
He comes home and tells me he's gay.
Whatever,
be who you are.
I don't give a shit,

1326
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.680
but you,
you do not let somebody fucking scream and yell at you like,

1327
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.330
Hey fucking believe the way they do it.
I would make a fucking omelet.
Alright.

1328
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.490
Cheese always holds its heat to and I would just mush it right in the guy's
face.

1329
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:41.860
No,
I hate that show.
That show makes me fucking even angrier than I am.

1330
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.170
What are you doing?

1331
01:23:44.171 --> 01:23:48.400
Get the fuck out of the kitchen to two inches from their face.

1332
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:53.950
Ugh.
All right.
Get out of here.
Get out of the room or,
right,

1333
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:58.630
you're fucking up the podcast.
This is really going good.
It's going good.

1334
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:01.030
No.
Then then all of a sudden it becomes like a,

1335
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:04.030
we're like fucking George Burns in that,
that brought,

1336
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:07.420
he married that died before him.
You know,
I love about George Burns.

1337
01:24:07.421 --> 01:24:11.020
His wife died before him.
It's a very rare thing,
you know?

1338
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.950
Why do you guys usually outlive us?
It's an inspirational story.

1339
01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.400
Kind of like when you watch that show with that chick who holds up the union

1340
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:23.080
sign.
Remember her
Billy Joe McIntyre and what is her name

1341
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:29.530
or his or her name?
Sally field.

1342
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:37.030
All right.
That's why I said Billy Joel,
but I was talking about the actress.
Oh,

1343
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:40.180
get out of here.
It's just fucking takes them forever,
Deena.
Okay.

1344
01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:43.510
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna tell the story about you.
Me leaving today.

1345
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:50.620
We'll then get outta here.
We'll grab your whole bag and get out.

1346
01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:55.570
Get Out,
get out of what you're doing.
Yes.

1347
01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.040
Can you close the door please?
See that I knew she was going to say no.

1348
01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:03.310
I had to give her one little bit of a victory as she went to leave.

1349
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:06.970
That's how you do it.
So anyway,
so I rent this fucking car right now.

1350
01:25:06.971 --> 01:25:09.710
Those of you who are new to my podcast.
Um,

1351
01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.790
thank you.
Thank you sweetheart.
There's no reason to take the dog.

1352
01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.790
Uh,
really that's going to be like,
we get married someday.

1353
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:24.250
We get divorced as Ellen Omen calling our Harry kid out of the room.

1354
01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.320
All right,
let's plow ahead.
So,
uh,
yeah.
Um,

1355
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:31.300
one of the things I always wanted to do,
I've always loved,

1356
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:35.770
I've always loved cars,
always loved the corvette.
So I just said,
fuck it.

1357
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.760
I'm going to rent one costs 350 bucks for a day.
I know that's a lot of money.

1358
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.760
All right,
but I'm telling you,
you're not gonna regret it.

1359
01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:46.360
I didn't regret one fucking dime of it.

1360
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.600
It was one of the best days I ever had.
And he's a,

1361
01:25:48.601 --> 01:25:53.080
even as a redhead in the Goddamn desert,
I just put on some sunscreen.

1362
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:58.090
I had a fucking hat.
I know.

1363
01:25:58.091 --> 01:26:00.100
I really just made myself look like a Douche bag.
Like,

1364
01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:01.750
I had a big fucking straw hat I didn't,

1365
01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:06.890
I had a baseball hat on and it was just fun.
It was tremendous.

1366
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:12.100
I can't even describe it.
Going from a Prius to a Chevy corvette,
ash,

1367
01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:16.730
it was just fucking awesome.
And uh,
and they only gave me 50 miles.

1368
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:18.080
This is why you got to love a recession.

1369
01:26:18.081 --> 01:26:21.410
I bumped it up to a hundred or can you give me a hundred?
And I was by ray say,

1370
01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:24.260
I'll pay you more than the guy goes,
all right,
I'll give you a hundred.
Right?

1371
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.250
And you'd be surprised.
100 hundred miles is a lot of fucking miles.

1372
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.980
It's a lot more than it seems.
And uh,

1373
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:35.270
but I actually learned something if I ever could afford that Goddamn car,

1374
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:39.580
I wouldn't get one out here because,
um,

1375
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.960
there's just way too many people like during the day,

1376
01:26:41.961 --> 01:26:45.110
the fastest I could get the car going with 85 miles an hour.

1377
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.280
And it was absolutely fucking terrifying because there were so many people on

1378
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:50.540
the road.
Unfortunately,

1379
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.720
I'm a 41 year old guy and I understand ramifications at least at that level.

1380
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.550
And I'm just like,
this is stupid,
Bill.
You're going to hit somebody,

1381
01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:00.660
you're going to kill him and you,
you know,

1382
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:03.470
your whole dreams going to go down the toilet.
So I fucking slowed down.

1383
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.130
But at night that's a different story.

1384
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.710
Night was a different story.
Put the top down.

1385
01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:13.490
I went up to Hollywood hills and I went through Mulholland where it's,
you know,

1386
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.460
you feel like you're on top of the world,
you know,

1387
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.890
and I drove like an absolute maniac and scared the shit out of Nia,

1388
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:25.550
but she liked it on some level,
just an unbelievable fucking car.

1389
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.260
And I don't know why I,
you know,
it's that Catholic fucking upbringing.

1390
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:34.160
I bust my balls,
I work my ass off and I never get myself anything.

1391
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:38.420
And finally I was like,
fuck this.
So,
um,

1392
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:42.050
I don't know.
Long story short,
it was a great thing.

1393
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.440
It's a great thing to do and uh,
you don't need to get the,
for the,
you know,

1394
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.880
the Ferrari just to let you know,
the Ferrari and a Lamborghini,

1395
01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:53.360
which you can fucking rent.
It's 1500 bucks for the day.

1396
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.250
So
this is what you can do.

1397
01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:02.240
You can get you in 15 [inaudible] 14 of your closest friends.

1398
01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.620
You all go in in it for a hundred,
then I would still suck.
Then you only get out,

1399
01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:11.621
you get a hundred miles divided by 15 Jesus Christ.

1400
01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:15.590
What'd you get?
Four or five miles each.
That would suck.

1401
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:19.160
Has got to be a fucking way to do it.
It's gotta be a way to do it,

1402
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.890
but I mean you get like a Porsche was like 900.
That's ridiculous.

1403
01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:26.810
But the Corvettes,
350 bucks.
Okay.
You know,

1404
01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.550
stop drinking for like a month.

1405
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.420
That'll pay for at least half of it if even if you go to a dive bar.

1406
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:37.550
Um,
definitely,
definitely.
That's my underrated,

1407
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.770
underrated for this week.
Underrated is,
is,
you know,

1408
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.760
spending some money on yourself for once for someone who doesn't do it.

1409
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:50.180
So I don't know,
this whole podcast went off the fucking rails.
At some point.

1410
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:54.970
Nia came in.
Um,
that really bugged me on sir.

1411
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:59.360
And that was actually,
I was actually for you at some level.
Yeah.

1412
01:28:59.390 --> 01:29:02.430
Obviously it was,
but it was something we did together,
right.
Doesn't that matter?

1413
01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:04.140
You know,
I'm gonna tell the fucking story.

1414
01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:07.410
So we go to the gym this morning and I want to go watch the patriots game.

1415
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:11.430
Patriots won 59 did nothing,
by the way.
And uh,

1416
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:16.320
I dunno,
you know,
I don't want to say I called it,

1417
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:20.910
but I said Sanchez when they were saying the star is born because he beat the

1418
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:22.470
titans in the first fucking week.

1419
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.960
I'm not saying that the guy's not going to be a good quarterback,

1420
01:29:24.961 --> 01:29:29.700
but what the fuck is with the New York media with debt skitzo fucking reporting

1421
01:29:29.701 --> 01:29:32.750
that they do these guys the greatest do ever.

1422
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:36.200
Cause he wins one fucking game and then they go through,
you know,

1423
01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.970
and then they beat the Patriots when Brady still,
you know,

1424
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:43.230
playing his first games after a year and a fucking half.
And did they destroy us?

1425
01:29:43.231 --> 01:29:47.940
They won like 13 to fucking seven and a fucking jet fans.

1426
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:51.210
They're already talking super bowl.
And what happened?
Ah,

1427
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:55.560
you lost the last fucking three games in a row.
Idiots.

1428
01:29:56.270 --> 01:30:00.360
It's stupid fucking firemen.
They gotta show him every five fucking minutes.

1429
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:03.210
It's just the,
I hate people who dress up for football games,

1430
01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:08.010
which means I hate half the people in the Oakland Coliseum.

1431
01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:12.270
Half of them are called.
Half of them look like Ken Stabler the other half.

1432
01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.930
I know I've talked about this before,
but I just don't understand.
It's like,

1433
01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:20.460
are you remaking the thriller video?
Who Do you think you're intimidating with?

1434
01:30:20.461 --> 01:30:25.380
Your fucking plastic spikes coming out of your shoulder pads.
I had just,

1435
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.830
why is my voice cracking shoulder pads

1436
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:34.890
anyways,
so there you go.

1437
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.930
Things are returning to normal in the AFC east and if you're a giant fan,

1438
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.210
uh,
don't sweat that lost today.

1439
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.210
I'm actually actually predicting right now the giants are going to beat the

1440
01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:48.120
saints in the playoffs just because they've been there before.

1441
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:52.580
And Tom Coughlin is a great coach and he's going to use this loss to build on at

1442
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:56.040
the end of the day,
you got your ass kicked in October.
Who?
You know,

1443
01:30:56.041 --> 01:31:00.270
who gives a fuck?
You're going to be fine.
Eli has that.
I Dunno.

1444
01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.020
I Dunno to look at his face.
You wouldn't fucking think I told you.

1445
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:07.170
He looks like that kid who comes to school every day and he always has a fucking

1446
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:07.710
cold.

1447
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:11.460
There's just something about the way the helmet and has cheeks together that he

1448
01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:14.130
just doesn't look like he's going to get it done.
But I'm,
I'm telling you,

1449
01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.420
he just had a bad fucking game.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

1450
01:31:18.421 --> 01:31:22.980
Let's get on with the questions for this week.
Um,
all right,
Bill.
Uh,

1451
01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:26.370
I guess I have to jump right in.
It's kind of a long question here.

1452
01:31:26.371 --> 01:31:27.450
It's actually a story.
Um,

1453
01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:30.780
have there ever been times where you felt that you needed to be funny but the

1454
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:35.160
situation you were in just left you feeling completely uninspired?

1455
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:39.360
Like he had some unfunny script to work with or a,

1456
01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:42.720
you are working in some situation where you looked at the material given to you

1457
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:47.640
and thought,
man,
there is no way I can make this funny.
Uh,
yeah,
definitely.

1458
01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:51.780
Especially with the acting stuff as I'm not established as an actor.

1459
01:31:51.781 --> 01:31:56.160
So I basically take any audition I can.
Um,

1460
01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.570
let me read the rest of us.
Uh,

1461
01:31:58.571 --> 01:32:02.080
I guess what brought the this question about is that I recently graduated

1462
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:06.460
college and I'm attempting to make my way as a professional photographer since

1463
01:32:06.461 --> 01:32:10.180
I'm graduating at such a great time.
That's obviously sarcasm.

1464
01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:14.560
I had been left with some less than ideal job offers.
I did,
however,

1465
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:19.030
managed to grab a job working as a photographer in some studio at an upper class

1466
01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:23.260
mall in northern Virginia.
Doe,
I'm happy to have a job.

1467
01:32:23.261 --> 01:32:27.130
This new found position is made me realize that there is an entirely different

1468
01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:32.110
dynamic to being a professional creative person than I originally thought.

1469
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:34.390
Throughout my experience in photography,

1470
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:38.950
I have always had full control over how things work.
I choose the people,

1471
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:39.940
the locations,

1472
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:43.210
how it's going to look and what kind of ideas are going to be conveyed.

1473
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.980
But now I'm stuck in a limited studio shooting some of the most boring people

1474
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:50.500
you've ever seen in your life.
Uh,

1475
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:55.530
but basically this guy used to take photos from an artistic standpoint and now

1476
01:32:55.991 --> 01:32:59.060
evidently he's photo taking foot,
you know,

1477
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:01.650
photos of people,
uh,

1478
01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.920
who I guess are the real life version of the office.
Um,
anyways,

1479
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.600
to get back to his question,
he goes,
I guess I feel that,
uh,
this is a similar,

1480
01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:13.540
this is similar to comedy in that I,

1481
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:18.350
I have always thought you have to kind of feel a joke when you're saying it.

1482
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.950
If you thinking about it then you probably already fucked it up.
Dude.

1483
01:33:21.951 --> 01:33:25.100
That's a grip.
Brilliant insight.
Yeah,
that's exactly the way it is.

1484
01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:30.240
And there are times a,
yeah,
I didn't,
you know,

1485
01:33:30.241 --> 01:33:34.950
if I have an audition and the material is horrible,
what you,

1486
01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:37.680
what you do is you call it shine and shit.

1487
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:40.810
You'd go in there and you try to make it as funny as you can.
And,
um,

1488
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:44.630
I always think of Jim Carrey whenever I have a,
uh,
uh,

1489
01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:46.590
if it's like a comedy,
um,

1490
01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:51.790
if it's a comedy audition and I just think it's really not funny,

1491
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.220
I usually start to Improv.

1492
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:55.090
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:59.130
<v 12>And,
uh,
I dunno,
I always think of that beginning,</v>

1494
01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:02.100
but I think the most brilliant bit ever,

1495
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:06.900
one of the most underrated bits ever is the beginning of Ace Ventura part too.

1496
01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:11.460
When he's in that fucking Yak suit or water buffalo,
I dunno what he's in,

1497
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:15.390
but he's filming some people doing some bad shit to animals and just

1498
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:21.090
basically what happens is all of a sudden the fan or something inside the fake

1499
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:26.110
Yak breaks and he starts getting so hot because he's in the desert or whatever,

1500
01:34:26.111 --> 01:34:27.670
the fucking Serengeti,

1501
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:31.690
he starts taking off all of his clothes and it's still hot.

1502
01:34:31.691 --> 01:34:35.470
He's literally butt ass naked and the only way to get out of this fucking Yac is

1503
01:34:35.471 --> 01:34:38.140
to come out the back end.
He literally,

1504
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.400
it looks like this Yak gives birth to a naked adult and the brilliance is he

1505
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:49.450
comes out the back and he literally falls on the ground the way I've seen a baby

1506
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:54.200
giraffe fall out of a mother giraffe and he's fucking totally naked.
It's,

1507
01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:57.680
it's one of the most brilliant fucking bits I've ever seen and it gets no

1508
01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:01.970
respect whatsoever.
When people talk about comedy,

1509
01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:05.990
and that's one of those things,
I just look at it and I'm like,
how did that,

1510
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.900
how did that come about?
Was he watching the discovery channel?

1511
01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.580
He saw baby giraffe fall out of the back of it.

1512
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:19.970
And that got his mind going.
Like,
what if I fucking fell out of the bag?

1513
01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:21.180
And I think that's one of those,

1514
01:35:21.181 --> 01:35:24.270
like those are the most brilliant jokes to me where I can't even find the

1515
01:35:24.271 --> 01:35:25.230
beginning point

1516
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:27.510
<v 4>of it.
Um,</v>

1517
01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.700
<v 12>so anyways,
I kind of use that guys is,
is like an inspiration.</v>

1518
01:35:32.701 --> 01:35:36.390
Like he would totally commit to shit.
There's like legendary stories.

1519
01:35:36.391 --> 01:35:39.510
They had that guy going on auditions wearing his clothes on backwards.

1520
01:35:39.511 --> 01:35:44.190
He did everything.
A lot of fearless stuff.
So,
um,
if I was you,

1521
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:47.430
when I was taking pictures of a bunch of boring people and my passion in life

1522
01:35:47.431 --> 01:35:50.550
was to be a photographer,
I would mock the,

1523
01:35:50.551 --> 01:35:55.551
silently mock the situation and I would put these people in ridiculous poses

1524
01:35:56.821 --> 01:36:01.800
that,
um,
they didn't notice were ridiculous.
And,
um,

1525
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:06.580
I would secretly be keeping an album for yourself,

1526
01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.160
you know,
and keep some of the worst photos.

1527
01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:13.630
So as you're giving them the photos they want for their regional director of who

1528
01:36:13.631 --> 01:36:17.710
gives a fuck,
you're actually building a coffee book table.

1529
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.740
<v 4>Um,
coffee book table</v>

1530
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:23.430
<v 12>coffee table book too.
I might do,</v>

1531
01:36:23.431 --> 01:36:28.080
I might fucking just dyslexic without even reading.
What did I say?

1532
01:36:28.081 --> 01:36:32.580
A coffee book table,
a coffee table book your own private one.

1533
01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.080
Do that would be a,

1534
01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.080
that's what you work on for in the future when you become a famous photographer

1535
01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:40.530
and you need your,

1536
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.880
and you're telling your inspirational story of how you got where you're at is

1537
01:36:44.881 --> 01:36:47.310
just start keeping this diary of,

1538
01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:52.370
of of horrific photo like photo shoots that she had to go on.

1539
01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.240
And you're gradually basically building a book,
you know.

1540
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:59.940
So in the end when you have your famous ones have,
you know,

1541
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.520
taken a picture of some navy guy

1542
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:07.880
doing shit that you know nowadays would be sexual harassment.

1543
01:37:07.881 --> 01:37:11.360
Just grabbing a woman in,
jamming your tongue down her throat I guess.

1544
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:14.300
Cause you take it in black and white that,
that makes it art,
whatever.

1545
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:17.570
When you get that fucking picture and you make a name for yourself,

1546
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:18.950
you'll have all this,
you know,

1547
01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:23.030
kind of like a comedian has like all this hell gigs stories and uh,

1548
01:37:23.031 --> 01:37:25.280
I just don't know what the rule is with the rights.

1549
01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:27.533
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1550
01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:30.950
<v 12>You know,
do you have to the people that have to sign off to be like in the book,</v>

1551
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:34.250
don't you have like some sort of form that you own the rights for all these?

1552
01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.610
Are you working for these corporate cons where they own everything?
Fuck that.

1553
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.180
Just make one on the side that'll make your friends laugh.

1554
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:45.170
So as you're taking pictures of these boring,
stupid ass,

1555
01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:46.730
so can people in the back of your head,

1556
01:37:46.731 --> 01:37:49.670
there's a joy when it's awful because you're like,
oh,

1557
01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:51.230
that's going to be a great one.
You know,

1558
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.010
it's like back in the day when I used to work in a dental office,

1559
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:58.050
way back in the fucking day as I was,
you know,

1560
01:37:58.051 --> 01:38:02.040
certified to take x rays of people.
They'd say something fucking stupid.

1561
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:05.070
I would write it on the Little Manila envelope and I would later,

1562
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:08.880
I would try it later on that night and I used to get such a kick out of that,

1563
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:13.770
that these people had no fucking idea that they were actually writing an act for

1564
01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:16.650
me.
Those are some of the,
my original jokes.

1565
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.330
Did I ever tell you in some way original jokes?
They were basically a,

1566
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.920
what the fuck was a joke?
I used to do

1567
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:28.150
die and I don't know what the problem is.
I'm a,

1568
01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.050
I can't believe I got another cavity.
I mean,

1569
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:34.920
I brushed my teeth almost every day and that was such a great setup to my

1570
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.930
punchline,
my crude punchline of Oh,

1571
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.660
yet do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit.

1572
01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:45.240
I had some clean ones back then.
I used to work clean.

1573
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:50.850
One of my big lasts was a four years of neglect is not cured by a tic tac in the

1574
01:38:50.851 --> 01:38:54.150
waiting room.
Huh?
Isn't that clever?
Isn't that clever?

1575
01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:57.660
That was one of my earlier ones,
so that's what I did.
That's what I did.

1576
01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:02.100
So you're basically working in the dental office right now.

1577
01:39:02.101 --> 01:39:06.390
So what you do is you,
yeah,
he just,
you know,
do this.

1578
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.870
Just because you have this job doesn't mean you can't be doing something else on

1579
01:39:09.871 --> 01:39:12.570
the side.
That's what you do.
This is your hustle during the day.

1580
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:15.900
You take pictures of fucking,
you know,
these boring as people.

1581
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:20.280
And then on on the side,
you'd do your other shit,
you know,

1582
01:39:20.281 --> 01:39:24.240
and then somehow the whole thing fucking comes together.
And next thing you know,

1583
01:39:24.930 --> 01:39:27.270
it's Tuesday in the afternoon and you just decide,

1584
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:31.020
I'm going to run a fucking corvette.
And you go do it in life is great,

1585
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:36.200
you know?
All right,
let's go to youtube videos.

1597
01:40:23.201 --> 01:40:26.100
I was a little bit short.
Um,
I got a little thrown off.

1598
01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:29.670
My girlfriend came fucking walking in and I kind of lost my whole train of

1599
01:40:29.671 --> 01:40:31.650
thought about who's kidding,

1600
01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:34.860
who I have no fucking game find for these goddamn things.
I'm exhausted.

1601
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:36.780
I have a bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow.

1602
01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:41.550
I have to try to get some fucking health insurance as my health insurance ran

1603
01:40:41.551 --> 01:40:45.570
out because I was on the road and I didn't make the payment.

1604
01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:50.250
And you have 8.2 days to make the payment.
So,
uh,

1605
01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:54.340
I'm just going to say fuck it.
I'm going try and get the best.
Uh,
yeah.

1606
01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.620
That's such assholes.
I already called these fucking people up.

1607
01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.080
It's such a goddamn racket.
You know,
Mike,
even the evening,

1608
01:41:01.081 --> 01:41:03.510
I'm not even bummed out that I lost my health insurance because my health

1609
01:41:03.511 --> 01:41:06.660
insurance basically covered everything except for what the fuck I went in for.

1610
01:41:06.661 --> 01:41:10.020
Right.
So I call up blue cross blue shield and I say,
look,

1611
01:41:10.050 --> 01:41:13.410
I just want to be covered for some shit.
I don't give a fuck how much it costs.

1612
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:19.760
<v 8>I said,
how about some dental?
I just want to be covered for dental cleanings.
Yep.</v>

1613
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:22.910
All dental cleanings Iraj are covered.

1614
01:41:23.150 --> 01:41:27.470
Dental cleanings are free.
You get two free cleanings a year or some shit.

1615
01:41:27.471 --> 01:41:30.260
And I'm like,
fantastic.
That's exactly what the hell I'm looking for.

1616
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:34.490
So I can go to my dentist and get a free cleaning if I give you all this loot

1617
01:41:34.491 --> 01:41:37.010
every month.
So technically it's not even free.

1618
01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.790
Is that what the fuck you're telling me?
Well,
yeah,

1619
01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.550
they're part of the fucking provider.
Fucking cunty fuck,
fuck right.

1620
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:45.260
And I find out they're not.

1621
01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:46.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:41:46.890 --> 01:41:48.000
<v 8>And basically that they,</v>

1623
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.620
that if they're not part of their list of dentists that I can go to what they,

1624
01:41:52.621 --> 01:41:57.180
basically the money that they give is a $55 for a cleaning.

1625
01:41:58.690 --> 01:41:58.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1626
01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.300
<v 12>All right.
I Dunno what state you guys live in,</v>

1627
01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:06.301
but there's no place in Los Angeles that I can get a cleaning for $55 that is

1628
01:42:07.871 --> 01:42:11.470
not in a strip mall and the person speaks fucking broken English.

1629
01:42:13.170 --> 01:42:15.630
It's such,
it's such a fucking scam.
You know what you're doing.

1630
01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:18.900
You're paying the vague just in case you get hit by a helicopter or some

1631
01:42:18.901 --> 01:42:23.250
bullshit.
But other than that,
it's the biggest fucking scam on the planet.

1632
01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.970
You know,
a buddy of mine told me a long time ago,
you go to the city,

1633
01:42:26.971 --> 01:42:29.970
what are the two tallest buildings you will we see.
Yeah.
You know,

1634
01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:33.360
all they're owned by banks and they're owned by insurance companies and they

1635
01:42:33.361 --> 01:42:35.310
don't get that way by fucking pay.
And people,

1636
01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.760
somebody sent me a great video clip to about microchips,

1637
01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:40.410
bought them microchipping people.

1638
01:42:40.411 --> 01:42:43.350
For all you guys who think I'm a crazy fucking conspiracy theorist.

1639
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:48.360
Just go on the youtube,
go on the youtube,
go on youtube and a checkout.

1640
01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.070
Uh,
just search microchips,

1641
01:42:50.071 --> 01:42:53.130
human beings and look at some of the shit that they have coming out.

1642
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.580
I wish,

1643
01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:59.350
I wish I could find with a fucking link was they showed this creepy commercial

1644
01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.040
of all these old people who's a entire,
um,

1645
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.620
medical histories on the,
in is on a microchip that's in them.

1646
01:43:08.621 --> 01:43:11.140
And the doctors scans them and you know,

1647
01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:14.770
of course they fallen down so they can't explain what's wrong with them,

1648
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:18.480
but he just scans them in.
Oh,
thank God.
Uh,
they,
they,

1649
01:43:18.481 --> 01:43:22.360
they have a microchip in them so I know exactly what to do for them and there's

1650
01:43:22.361 --> 01:43:24.070
all these people sitting there,
you know,

1651
01:43:24.071 --> 01:43:29.071
given the thumbs up and it's really warm and fuzzy and it's delivered at this

1652
01:43:29.471 --> 01:43:34.210
speech where it causes you to stop thinking.
I'm telling you,
it's,
it's,

1653
01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.130
you feel like they're trying to hypnotize you.

1654
01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.830
It's all part of the end game people.

1655
01:43:39.370 --> 01:43:41.710
This is where I go off the rails and I lose most listeners.

1656
01:43:41.710 --> 01:43:45.130
It's all part of this new world order shit where they're going to have one world

1657
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:45.964
government,

1658
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:50.240
one world fucking bank and everything you ever fucking did is going to be on

1659
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:52.400
this microchip.
All your money,
everything,

1660
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:56.960
all you people out there who are accepting direct deposit,
don't fucking do it.

1661
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.980
Go down their cash party a check,
use cash.

1662
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:04.850
Don't get lulled into this.
Oh yeah,
it's easier to use your car.

1663
01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:09.710
I'm telling you that they're funneling the herd right down the shoot they want

1664
01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.800
them to go into and I'm telling you we're all going to be fucking microchipped

1665
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:13.420
and then those,

1666
01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:17.360
you think those guys have us by the balls now if everybody is microchipped and

1667
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:20.780
you can track where everyone is and all your money and financial shit,

1668
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:23.780
all your information is on a microchip that is in you.

1669
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.130
The second you fuck with the deal and you start complaining too much,

1670
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.620
all they have to do is turn off your chip

1671
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.920
and you'll instantly be homeless and you you can't revolt anymore and I'm sure

1672
01:44:35.921 --> 01:44:37.060
they'll have degrees of it.

1673
01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:41.560
There'll be the first warning shutoff where they shut off like two thirds of

1674
01:44:41.561 --> 01:44:44.930
your fucking bank account disappears or something like that.
Um,

1675
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:49.090
I'm telling you guys that's,
that's way too much fuck at power.
I mean,

1676
01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.040
I don't know how to stop it,
but uh,
uh,

1677
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:57.370
this is just fucking crazy shit.
I really believe that.
I am want to get into it.

1678
01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.920
I just,
I think we're headed

1679
01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:00.680
<v 8>towards some crazy shit.</v>

1680
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.480
I suggest all of you rent a corvette now while you still can get yourself a pit

1681
01:45:05.481 --> 01:45:09.470
bull like me.
Um,
I don't know.

1682
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:14.430
Get some powdered food and get a gun.
I wish I,

1683
01:45:14.431 --> 01:45:17.270
I wish I grew up with guns.
You know,
I wish he had a fucking gun.

1684
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:20.330
What are you going to do?
You can't fight it.

1685
01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.820
You can't fight it because when the shit goes down,

1686
01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.970
they're going to sick your own fucking people on you.

1687
01:45:25.971 --> 01:45:28.640
Whatever organization they have.
I don't want to shoot a cop.

1688
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:31.490
That's what I'm going to do.
Just some regular guy doing his job.

1689
01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.300
I don't fucking do that.
Well,
they round you up.
Do I sound fucking crazy?

1690
01:45:36.301 --> 01:45:40.320
I should cause I just made a huge leap right there where I would end up shooting

1691
01:45:40.321 --> 01:45:43.980
a cop.
I didn't explain like 40 other things in that scenario.

1692
01:45:43.981 --> 01:45:46.740
How that ends up going down.
Um,

1693
01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.790
I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.

1694
01:45:50.791 --> 01:45:53.040
I just know there's a bunch of crazy shit that's going on.

1695
01:45:53.041 --> 01:45:54.360
I don't know how to link it together.

1696
01:45:55.290 --> 01:45:57.450
Why do I have to be microchipped in the future?

1697
01:45:58.710 --> 01:46:03.660
Why do they have to know where I'm at at all fucking times and they keep selling

1698
01:46:03.661 --> 01:46:05.790
it to me.
Like they're trying to protect me.
They're not,

1699
01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:10.770
they're trying to get full fucking control over me and I don't like it the same

1700
01:46:10.771 --> 01:46:11.720
way.
I don't like dead

1701
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.650
<v 12>bitch telling me to eat that fucking blew cake.
I don't want you up my ass.</v>

1702
01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:20.670
I'll defend myself.
Thank you very much.
There's enough control right now.

1703
01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:25.230
There was enough control.
That's it.
You already got those awesome planes.

1704
01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.430
We can fly to 2000 feet and nobody even knows and they can see if he just,
shit,

1705
01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:33.830
baby guys did use that on 60 minutes.
One of the coolest things ever.
Oh,

1706
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:35.760
there's killing those fucking terrorists over there.

1707
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:37.140
They're doing it like right out of like

1708
01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:43.790
way out there on like the Mojave desert or some shit.
I Dunno.

1709
01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:46.490
I think it's cool as hell.
That aspect of it,
you know?

1710
01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:48.950
And as long as they shoot and terrorist,
I have no fucking problem.

1711
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:51.990
But I don't trust banks as far as you can fucking throw him.

1712
01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:55.650
And I think they're just slowly taken over the goddamn world.
I'm telling you,

1713
01:46:55.651 --> 01:46:57.990
people read up on the,
just read up on banks.

1714
01:46:58.410 --> 01:47:01.530
I'm too fucking stupid to explain this to you,

1715
01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:05.880
but read this book are the case against the Fed and just really read what the

1716
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.950
Federal Reserve is.
Man,
it's really a frightening fucking thing.

1717
01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:13.710
This is what I want somebody to answer to me.
Where did all the gold go?

1718
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.900
That's what I want to know.
You know,
back in the day,

1719
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:19.770
gold was used as money,
but it was too heavy.

1720
01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:23.550
It was inconvenient and it was scary.
It was.
It was.
It was dangerous to carry.

1721
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:25.230
So the banks cove will tell you what,
give us,

1722
01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:28.530
give us your gold and when you give it will give you these pieces of paper that

1723
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:31.020
will represent the gold in anytime you want.

1724
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:35.100
You can bring the pieces of paper in the cash and you can get your gold.

1725
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.740
And at some point they took us off the gold standard,

1726
01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:42.180
but they kept the fucking gold.
They kept the gold,

1727
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.900
they've never been audited and they can't be audited the way they're set up,

1728
01:47:45.901 --> 01:47:47.160
they can never be audited.

1729
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:51.600
So do you honestly think that that goal is sitting there in Fort Knox?

1730
01:47:51.630 --> 01:47:54.930
I don't think it is.
I really don't.
I don't think it is.

1731
01:47:54.931 --> 01:47:59.931
I think it's just fuck it's fucking paper and it's the greatest crime in modern

1732
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:02.154
history.

1733
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.360
They got everybody to come down to the banks and give them their fucking life

1734
01:48:09.691 --> 01:48:14.691
savings and they cap it and in return they gave people pieces of fucking paper.

1735
01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:21.790
That's basically what's going on and now they can invent more pieces of paper.

1736
01:48:21.791 --> 01:48:24.510
I had satisfied as fucking ugly.
Why?
How did I get on this?

1737
01:48:24.930 --> 01:48:26.970
How did I get into this?
I don't know how I got into this.

1738
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.210
The fucking lady with the blue KC pissed me off.
Anyways,

1739
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:33.960
that's the podcast for this week.
Oh,
I know what I forgot to bring up.

1740
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:37.440
You know something I love,
if you're still listening to this right now,

1741
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:40.770
I love you for listening to this because I know why you're listening to this.

1742
01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:44.910
It's like a train wreck.
It's just fun to just sit here and listen to me.

1743
01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:49.380
Fucking slowly lose my mind and my little compound here.
Um,

1744
01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.970
this is the deal this week I'm going to be at the DC Improv,
uh,

1745
01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.640
the Improv in Washington DC.

1746
01:48:56.641 --> 01:49:00.480
For those of you who are our geographically challenged.

1747
01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:03.780
And um,
as of about four days ago,

1748
01:49:03.810 --> 01:49:08.810
all my shows are sold out there and in the business that's called going clean.

1749
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:13.920
And when clean Thursday,
Friday and Saturday,
one show,
Thursday two shows,

1750
01:49:13.921 --> 01:49:16.860
Friday two shows Saturday,
sold them all out,

1751
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:21.870
ridiculous support out there.
So I got a lot of emails of people saying,
you know,

1752
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:24.600
if I had half a brain on what a hype us in the beginning rather than talking

1753
01:49:24.601 --> 01:49:27.240
about this chick with the blue cake.
Um,

1754
01:49:27.241 --> 01:49:30.030
so we added a second show,

1755
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:32.910
a late show Thursday night,

1756
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.740
and I'm really looking forward to that because what kind of a person goes out to

1757
01:49:37.741 --> 01:49:40.590
the late show to a comedy club on a Thursday night?

1758
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:45.510
You know what my kind of person,
okay the kind of person who,

1759
01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:49.030
uh,
maybe it doesn't like job,
you know,

1760
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:53.410
or maybe feels that they're not getting paid the way they should be paid and

1761
01:49:53.411 --> 01:49:57.280
maybe they've done enough work for the week.
Thank you very much.
You know,

1762
01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.040
I wrote a whole list of,

1763
01:50:01.041 --> 01:50:04.940
it came up with 10 reasons why someone would come out to see me on a late show.

1764
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.810
Your boss is one of the three people in America that actually caught the swine

1765
01:50:08.811 --> 01:50:13.040
flu.
So now it doesn't matter what [inaudible] when you fucking roll in at 11 the

1766
01:50:13.041 --> 01:50:17.150
next fucking day,
you know,
was that three reasons?

1767
01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:21.800
Let's see if I can get up to 10 cause you've got to go to 10 for your,
uh,

1768
01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:22.401
your fucking,

1769
01:50:22.401 --> 01:50:27.401
your boss and he got him by the balls so you can go see a late show or your

1770
01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:31.460
bosses married and you know who he's fucking and he knows that,
you know,

1771
01:50:32.690 --> 01:50:37.100
so you can kind of,
you guy,
you've got a little more freedom.
Was that six?

1772
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.883
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1773
01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:45.390
<v 12>You're unemployed and a,
you're good at sneaking into comedy clubs.</v>

1774
01:50:45.391 --> 01:50:47.730
I don't fucking know.
I'm out.
I'm out of it.
All right.
That's it.

1775
01:50:47.731 --> 01:50:51.030
That's the fucking podcast for this week.
Thank you everybody for listening.

1776
01:50:51.150 --> 01:50:53.700
This one really was a cluster fuck,
but I hope so.

1777
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:56.620
You got something out of it as far as like complaining,
um,

1778
01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.940
you can't get your money back.
You just have to say it's unacceptable.

1779
01:51:00.630 --> 01:51:04.560
It's unacceptable.
Just all right.
I've already said this 10 fucking,

1780
01:51:04.561 --> 01:51:07.240
I can't get out of this in order this too,

1781
01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:11.970
as I close the windows and my room here because I curse a lot and it's hot as

1782
01:51:11.971 --> 01:51:16.680
fuck right now.
And I'm literally sitting here sweating like a,

1783
01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.190
I feel like I'm in a bunker right now,
you know,

1784
01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.790
and with this country's been taken over by the fucking world's been taken over

1785
01:51:23.791 --> 01:51:27.990
by aliens and I'm just leaving this hoping that somebody's going to survive like

1786
01:51:27.991 --> 01:51:32.850
Lee majors in that movie where,
uh,
he drives a race car.
I'm all right.

1787
01:51:32.851 --> 01:51:36.300
That's it.
That's,
that's the less feeble attempt.
I'm going to make it comedy.

1788
01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:40.710
And you're getting a good chuck a lot of this,
huh?
Uh,
this,
this is,
you know,

1789
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:43.950
is a certain kind of comedy fan out there that just really enjoys train wrecks.

1790
01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:48.330
So a,
I dedicate the last 47 minutes of this podcast.

1791
01:51:48.331 --> 01:51:51.090
The first two minutes we're good.
Um,
and that's it.

1792
01:51:51.091 --> 01:51:55.380
That's the podcast for this week and now you know why it's free.
Um,

1793
01:51:55.410 --> 01:52:00.150
if you cannot make it out to the second show in Washington DC,

1794
01:52:02.010 --> 01:52:05.880
um,
I don't know what to tell you cause I'm sold out for the week,
but fear not.

1795
01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:09.780
I have other shows.
I'm going to be at the town hall in New York City.

1796
01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.330
That one might also,
that one's coming very close to selling out and uh,

1797
01:52:15.331 --> 01:52:19.170
that's going to be a great night.
It's going to be me,
Paul Versey and uh,

1798
01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.050
Joe Derosa.
Um,
New York City.
That's a huge night for me.
Manhattan,

1799
01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:29.460
New York City selling out of fucking theater would be unbelievable.
So,
uh,

1800
01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.790
if he got some scratch,
