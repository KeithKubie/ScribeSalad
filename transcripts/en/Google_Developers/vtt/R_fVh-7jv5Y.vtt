00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.663
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:05.246
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello
again, everyone.

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.885
AUDIENCE: Hello, Tim!

00:00:07.885 --> 00:00:10.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So welcome to
day two of the Ubiquity Dev

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.092
Summit.

00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:13.050
Before we begin, I'd like
to speak a little bit

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.770
about building across devices.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.670
Now, some of you have
heard this before.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.160
If you have, please forgive me.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.000
For those of you
that are new to it,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.060
it's just a simple outline
of why and how to think

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.730
about building across devices.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.810
You see, ubiquitous
computing is just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.780
a fancy phrase for technology
that's accessible to the user

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.120
whenever and wherever they want.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.620
Right?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.390
We talked a lot about
that on day one.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.740
Well, here's just a
little bit more detail.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.030
Imagine your users
wherever they might be.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.530
Right?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.690
They might be
having some friends

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.300
over watching cat
videos and playing

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.220
video games in the living room.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.000
They're outside going
for a bike ride.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.980
Or maybe it's time
for a road trip.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.100
You're going to want to
make sure that in any

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.230
of these situations that your
users can access your service.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.650
You don't want this where it's
like, which device do I go to?

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.730
Instead, you want it
available on any device

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.349
that they might have at hand.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.040
And this is what we mean
by ubiquitous computing.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.390
And these as devices, the
number of them is staggering.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.770
So you as a developer are
thinking about all the places

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.380
your users can go
to for your service.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.780
It's a pretty large number.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.910
In fact, this study by Intel
says 200 billion in 2020.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.149
Or as Gayathri put it the
other day, 26 connected devices

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.440
for every person on the planet.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.490
Now, not all of these
are in their pocket.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.020
Right?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.770
Some of these are
spread across the world.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.390
But a handful of these are
associated with their users.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.014
And that's a ton of smart
devices in the world.

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:40.430
And another number
that you really

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.120
should keep in mind,
especially if you're a startup,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.330
is that half of the
solutions for IoT

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.700
are going to be from startups
less than three years old.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.680
Half!

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160
That's just a really big number.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.310
So the question
really is have you

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.330
started building for
this reality already?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.650
And the good news is that it's
not as hard as it might seem.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.150
Right?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.800
What I'd like to leave
you with is this idea

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.190
of building across these
devices as a holistic approach

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.030
for your app and your service.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.920
Right?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
And you can think less about
having say a single service

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.130
for each device.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.780
Here's an example of
that architecture.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.710
Now the traditional approach
is for different devices

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.310
to make an app for each
device as these devices become

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.919
available to the users.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.710
And this is, I mean,
this is kind of crazy.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.126
It's typically
meant a new project

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:38.070
for each device developed
and supported independently,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.390
a new engineering team
in your company often.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.550
And the ironic thing
is that most of us

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.621
already think about this whole
experience as one experience.

00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:48.120
Right?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.580
So building it as separate
apps, separate projects,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.620
separate products is just
the wrong way to go about it.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.970
What you want to
think about it is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.590
having a single app and
each of these devices

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.106
as a view into that service.

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:04.480
And again, this
is really what we

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.220
think about when we think
about ubiquitous computing.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.460
This is the model.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.370
Right?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.950
Is your service wherever the
user might want or need it?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.220
And then also
reducing this equation

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.750
so you don't have
to think so much

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.910
about the technical
implementation or the glue

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.200
in between these apps.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.940
But you're just
thinking about what's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.380
the right thing on
each form factor

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.030
for the user in that context.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.640
And that's how we're trying to
build our platform so that you

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.240
can go from one
device to the other

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.730
by just extending it with
a few additional APIs.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.650
And we're going to
talk about those today.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.196
We're going to talk first about
the living room with Rishi

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.910
Chandra, vice president of
product management for Google

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.091
Cast and Android TV.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.619
Rishi.

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:53.660
RISHI CHANDRA: Thank you.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.137
Good morning.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:59.470
So today I'm going to talk
to you about the living room.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.150
But actually, it's going to be
a little bit more than that.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.100
The living room is just
one room of where consumers

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.801
consume entertainment.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:10.050
Ultimately it's about the
home and home entertainment.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.090
That's really how we're
looking at this opportunity.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.310
And the opportunity
is pretty immense.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.110
It's estimated that
50% of all audio

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.660
is actually consumed
in the home.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.590
And if you look
at TV consumption,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.070
you'd think it's going
down, but it hasn't.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.570
It's still more than four hours
a day per household in the US,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.040
and more than three
hours a day globally.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.620
So there's an
immense opportunity

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.570
to reach consumers
where they are actually

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.620
spending their
time and consuming

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.790
entertainment and
applications and experiences.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.850
So today what I
wanted to do is talk

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.260
a little bit about how
Google sees the living room

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.860
opportunity.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.260
and more particularly a home
entertainment opportunity.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.310
And we'll start with a
couple trends that we see

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.169
and then how we're looking
at building platforms

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.710
so that developers
can take advantage

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.279
of this immense opportunity
in people's homes.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.820
So let me start with the first
opportunity, or first trend we

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.020
see, which actually
seems obvious now,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.670
but wasn't that obvious
just 18 months ago, which

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.780
is the content world
is transitioning

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.300
to an online distribution world.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.050
And this is really,
really important

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.740
because historically, the
content that you had access to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.086
in the home was actually
very siloed and very limited.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.010
You had a limited
choice, and now you're

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.150
moving to unlimited choice.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.610
You had a generic
set of content,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.130
and now you have
personalized content.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.100
And before you can only view
it on a single, specific device

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.930
in one room in your house.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.500
And now you can view it
anywhere across any device.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.550
It's a major transformation
that's happening.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.044
And it's particularly
impacting the home.

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:42.460
So the content
industry is leading

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.220
the way, driven by consumers
who are demanding this access.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.130
But what hasn't yet
caught up are the devices

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.590
that you actually consume
this in your home--

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.216
the speakers and
your televisions.

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:56.840
And so there's a
really big opportunity

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.270
of how we can rethink the
experience of these devices,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.889
bringing applications, bringing
new services that never were

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.180
there before, and opening up
an opportunity so that you

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.850
can actually innovate where you
could never innovate before.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.320
There's a really
interesting time.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.410
And now is the right time.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.740
I mean, just last
year, the new services

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.680
that are being launched
with an over the top way

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.716
opens up a lot of new engagement
opportunities within the home.

00:06:19.716 --> 00:06:21.340
And so I think this
is the perfect time

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.756
to be looking at the living
room as an immense opportunity

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:25.690
that you could
take advantage of.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.090
The second trend is
a little more subtle,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.280
which is that we're shifting
from how you actually

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.330
interact with your home
entertainment devices.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.500
Historically, it's been through
the directional pattern which

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.350
was invented 40, 50 years ago.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.100
And it's really simple, but
it's also very limiting.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.810
And what we're finding is that
this shift is happening today

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.680
where the mobile
device is becoming

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.040
increasingly the center
of your digital life.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.020
Where it has a much more
powerful processing power.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.820
It has a lot more capabilities
with the touch screen.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.320
It's more personalized.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.120
It's where you're already
organizing your life.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.990
So whether you're at home
or at work or in the car,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.360
consumers want to have the
same experience now when

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.390
they're coming home.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.098
And so we're seeing
that the mobile phone

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:15.735
is becoming a really
increasing part of that center

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.610
of your digital life.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.240
And the reality of
how you're going

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.510
to start interacting with
all these different devices

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.820
in the home today.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.540
So it gives a new opportunity.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.757
We need to rethink how
does a mobile phone

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:27.340
play into these
entertain experiences?

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.430
And how does it play with
all your different devices?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.229
Now not everyone's going
make this shift right away.

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.020
Some consumers have
already made the shift,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.889
some obviously still
recognize that they prefer

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:39.180
the traditional remote control.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.120
But we do see a shift happening.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.950
So, those two
insights really drove

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.410
the product definition for
the first product we launched

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.260
called Chromecast in July 2013.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.070
It was optimized for this world.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.687
It's the first the mobile
first online distribution

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.770
based product where we can
deliver an amazing user

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.710
experience around that use case.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.720
And we're really happy with it.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.310
We started with four apps
when we launched Chromecast.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.620
And now we have
thousands of apps.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.780
We have over 20 million
devices sold in a little

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.810
over two years of the
product being launched.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.750
And we have over
three billion presses

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.270
of the Cast button-- those are
each opportunity of engagement

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.936
that consumers had with a
content app on the big screen.

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:29.520
So we see a lot of momentum
there and it's really based off

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.360
this simple idea of how do we
bring a mobile first experience

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.120
to the living room.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.010
In September, we
actually updated,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.080
we refreshed the product
by improving the Chromecast

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.049
with better Wi-Fi
capability and better speed.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.550
But we also launched
another version

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.760
of the Chromecast,
Chromecast Audio.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.270
So similar to how Chromecast
takes your existing smart TVs--

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.220
or existing TVs and
make them smart--

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.390
Chromecast Audio can take
your existing speakers

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.756
and make them smart as well.

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.630
And we're just really
excited at the momentum

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.560
we're seeing both on Chromecast
and Chromecast Audio.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.120
But, obviously the
opportunity of the living room

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.500
is much bigger than just
a single point product.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.300
Our ultimate goal with the
platforms that we're creating

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.320
is to help developers connect
all their amazing content

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.590
with all the different
devices that a consumer can

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.160
have in their home today.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.570
So we started with
streaming devices

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.340
with Chromecast and
Chromecast Audio.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.150
But ultimately, we want to
be embedded in televisions,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.350
in every speaker in your home,
and even your set-top boxes

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.520
that you may get from your
operator, your TV operator.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.160
As many devices,
we want to touch

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.760
the one billion households
that have home entertainment

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.260
devices.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.230
We need to think bigger.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:45.070
And that's why Google has two
great platforms for how we're

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.369
approaching the living room.

00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:48.910
And there's a reason
why we have two.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.970
We started with Google Cast,
which is the technology

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.960
that powers Chromecast.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.830
And that's really based off
this mobile centric world.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.770
Make it incredibly easy
to take your existing

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.980
iOS app, your existing Android
app, or existing web page, web

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.990
app, and extend it to all
these different devices.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.790
But like I mentioned
before we recognize

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.690
there are a set of
consumers out there

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.540
who haven't yet
got mobile first.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.040
And they still want to have
all the great capabilities

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.980
that a rich platform can enable.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.550
And that's really why we
launched Android TV in 2014.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.350
It takes the Android
operating system, embeds it

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.060
into a whole host of
different devices,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.080
and now you can take
your mobile Android app

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.490
and bridge it and extend it
to the television as well.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.410
So consumers can have a
traditional experience

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.100
with a remote control, but also
run great, powerful, native

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.510
applications.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.040
And we're going to continue to
invest in both these platforms

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.820
to make them really the
de facto way that you can

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:49.170
engage all the different devices
that you'd see in a home today.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.650
But of course, Google's approach
is always about ecosystems.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.932
So we also don't think of
this as just a point product

00:10:54.932 --> 00:10:56.140
that Google's going to build.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.223
We're really happy with
the success of Chromecast.

00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:00.150
It's built by Google,
designed by Google,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.114
marketed and
distributed by Google.

00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:03.780
But ultimately, we're
not going to touch

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.510
a billion different
households with one product

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.380
from Google or two
products from Google.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.140
We have to think bigger
in terms of an ecosystem.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.630
And so it's really
important for us

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.890
to build partnerships
with the OEM community.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.720
And this is really what made
Android really successful.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.370
This is what got
us to the billion

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.130
different mobile devices.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.230
And so we've been
spending a lot of time

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.830
as part of a living
room strategy

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.700
to really think about how do
we engage with OEMs and device

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.080
manufacturers in a really
compelling and deep way.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.220
And we see a lot of success
over the last 18 months.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.980
So smart TVs, we want to
make sure that if you ever

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.100
buy a new TV, that you have
Google technology built

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.760
into it, whether it be Android
TV which also then includes

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.180
Google Cast.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.510
So we launched last year
Android TV with Sony.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.250
They announced last CES
and had a great year

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.490
selling televisions.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.539
And just this past
week, I was at CES

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.580
and they talked about all
the new sets of devices

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.510
they have built an Android TV.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.360
Really compelling, great story.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.306
There's a whole host
of new TV manufacturers

00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:03.680
that we're embedding
into as well

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.840
that you'll see over
the next few months.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.880
In the speaker market,
we want to make sure

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.740
that any speaker you
have that you buy

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.460
will have Google
Cast built into it.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.230
So we partnered last
year with Sony and LG

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.240
and they launched a whole
bunch of sound bars,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.520
avrs, wireless speakers, with
Google Cast technology built

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.410
in.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.690
And now we've announced last
week a whole host of new OEMs

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.370
as well.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.870
Ultimately, you'll
see the products

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.437
over the next,
again, six months.

00:12:31.437 --> 00:12:33.270
But we're really excited
to see the momentum

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.140
around really Google Cast as
being a de facto way that you

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.120
can bring great services and
applications to these speaker

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.380
devices.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.904
And then the last category
is pay TV set-top boxes.

00:12:45.904 --> 00:12:48.070
Every operator you get,
these are the operator boxes

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.950
you get when you sign
up for TV service.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.480
They'll actually bring
your a device in your home

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.364
that you can use to connect
to your linear TV service.

00:12:56.364 --> 00:12:57.780
Every one of these
operators today

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.762
is looking at this
changing environment

00:13:00.762 --> 00:13:02.220
of what's happening
in the industry

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.199
and looking at
refreshing their devices.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:05.740
So how can they
bring compelling sets

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.311
of applications on top of their
TV service they have today.

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.560
And so we've been partnering
with a whole host of them

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.544
so that as consumers are
getting upgraded to new devices

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.460
and boxes in their home,
they're automatically

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.870
getting a platform that is
rich and compelling based

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.620
off Android TV and having Google
Cast built into it as well.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.080
We think we have the
only strategy which

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.510
includes both point
products built by Google,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.917
but also a really wide set
of partnerships with OEMs

00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:35.250
to really build a scalable
model so that developers like

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.900
you can actually build
awesome experiences on top

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.100
of a wide range of devices.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.849
It's the only way we're
going to get scale

00:13:40.849 --> 00:13:43.330
to make it really impactful
for the consumers.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.400
So now let's talk about
the technology themselves.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.460
So we start with
the Google Cast SDK.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.918
This is the development Kit
that allows you to take, again,

00:13:50.918 --> 00:13:52.710
your existing Android,
iOS, or web app

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.600
and extend it to your TV.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.460
It's a really simple model.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.610
You embed it in the existing
app you're already in,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.596
that you already
own, and all you

00:14:01.596 --> 00:14:04.220
do is enable the Cast button and
now you can actually extend it

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.210
to another device.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.860
The power for this
is for consumers,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.870
they don't have to
learn anything new.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.275
If they already use Spotify, for
example, in their daily lives,

00:14:13.275 --> 00:14:14.650
then all they're
going to see now

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.920
is a button to now use
Spotify to extend it

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.260
to their speakers or TVs.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.850
Or Netflix, or
YouTube, what have you.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.382
It's a really simple
development model.

00:14:23.382 --> 00:14:25.590
And from a developer's
standpoint, all you need to do

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.919
is embed the Cast
SDK and have some way

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:29.460
to actually render
the content, which

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.150
we'll take care of for you.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.720
So it's really simple,
easy development model.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.320
It allows any app developer,
any media based app developer

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.350
to extend their content in
a really easy, simple way.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.750
Now we're continuing
to innovate on the SDK.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.370
Last year, in conjunction with
the Chromecast Audio launch,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.580
we launched audio support.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.050
So you can have an audio
only mode for your content

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.611
so it can work on
devices like speakers.

00:14:54.611 --> 00:14:57.110
And what was really exciting,
we launched multi-room support

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.180
last December.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.000
This allows you to
synchronize your audio

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.650
across multiple different rooms
in the home, any device that

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.070
has a Chromecast Audio in it.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.202
It works really well.

00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:09.160
If you haven't tried it
out, please try it out.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.770
It's amazing value for a
product that's only $35.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.860
And we're going to be,
just like I mentioned

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.360
before on the
ecosystem, we're going

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.720
to extending that capability
to the ecosystem as well.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.330
So whether you get
a Sony AVR and you

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.930
want to pair it
with a JBL speaker,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.080
you can do that using
the Cast SDK to actually

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.130
have synchronous audio
across multiple rooms.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.729
Again, we'll do that on
behalf of the developer.

00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:33.270
So it makes it really
simple and easy

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.699
to make a really compelling
killer use cases.

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.240
Now the other area
we've been looking

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.940
at is really about
how do we think

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.900
about multi-screen experiences?

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.100
The amazing thing about
having the phone connected

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.735
to these home
entertainment devices

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:47.685
is it's not just a
one way transaction.

00:15:47.685 --> 00:15:50.510
It doesn't have to be hey,
I'm listening to content here.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.200
I want to send it
to another device.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.862
But you can actually have
the devices work together.

00:15:55.862 --> 00:15:57.820
So how do we make that
a compelling experience?

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.110
How do we unlock that
capability for developers?

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.650
Well, last IO we launched a
capability called the Remote

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.930
Display APIs.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.370
And we focus it
initially on gaming

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.355
because we believe that has
a really compelling use case.

00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:12.980
And the idea here is can we take
advantage of the most powerful

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.188
computing device that most
people have in their homes

00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:18.440
today, which turns out to
be their mobile device.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.730
So what we do is we take
advantage of the GPU And CPU.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.196
And the phone itself
will render two screens.

00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:24.820
One screen plays
locally and one screen

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.340
goes to the Chromecast
or the Android TV device.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.372
And now you have two screens,
you can do two different UIs,

00:16:31.372 --> 00:16:33.330
you can have a consumption
UI on the big screen

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.160
and a interactive
UI on the phone.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.460
So now you can think of
multi-screen experiences.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:39.960
right?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.800
This breaks through
to how you can

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.330
think about how you actually
build an application itself.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.260
And so we launched
this last-- we

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.019
launched the APIs in last IO.

00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:52.810
And we have a whole
bunch of game companies

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.893
actually launch over the
last few months including

00:16:54.893 --> 00:16:56.220
Angry Birds Go and WGT Golf.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.015
And we're seeing
a lot more coming.

00:16:58.015 --> 00:17:00.140
But the great thing is this
capability doesn't only

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.859
have to work with games.

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:03.400
If you remember, we
actually launched

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.869
Google Photo support
for Google Cast as well.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.839
And actually that
uses these APIs.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.569
The Photos app just
uses the big screen

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.680
to render the highest
quality image that you can.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.900
And it has all the
navigation on the phone.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.869
So you have this two
tiered experience.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.149
It's a really simple development
model for developers.

00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:24.190
And so we're super excited
to see what developers

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.981
can do with it now that
they start thinking

00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:29.010
about a multi-screen experience
as a look about entertainment

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.050
in the home.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.990
So that's Google Cast.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.980
Now let's talk about Android TV.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.220
So every Android TV
device, first of all,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.870
includes Google Cast in it.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.420
So that's part of the
actual platform itself.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.620
But the idea of
Android TV was, again,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.760
to take this rich operating
system we have with Android

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.290
and extend it to many devices
including televisions.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.892
And we believe Android's
the de facto one.

00:17:54.892 --> 00:17:56.350
It should be the
de facto one given

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.790
the presence around all
the different devices

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.180
in consumers' lives today.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.290
And the great thing is it's
the same Android platform

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.380
that you have on your
other devices, which means

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.050
for developers the same SDK.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.080
You can take your
existing mobile app

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.270
and actually bring it directly
to now television devices.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.380
The great thing is with
some small modifications,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.130
you can then optimize
for different screens.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.350
Right?

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.460
So if you want to
build for phone,

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.584
you want to build for
tablet, you can build for TV.

00:18:22.584 --> 00:18:25.220
With some small changes you can
actually optimize automatically

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.274
for all the different
screens in the users' lives.

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.690
And the other great
thing, it just

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.440
uses the exact same
Play Store mechanisms.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.880
All your merchandising, and
all your billing and payments,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.726
automatically come with you.

00:18:36.726 --> 00:18:37.850
It's a really simple model.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.890
We really thought through how
to make this really incredibly

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.990
easy for developers to
bring their applications

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.790
direct to TV.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.100
Now, of course,
with Android TV, we

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.320
need to rethink the user
experience a little bit

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.760
in terms of how do we
make it TV centric.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.049
So this is the home screen
of an Android TV device.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.340
And you'll see a couple things.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.680
One is that it's content
centric versus purely

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.990
being app centric.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.779
We want to bring content
to the foreground.

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:04.320
So we have this
recommendation shelf.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.250
This is actually just a Android
TV API that any developer can

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.910
plug into to actually
showcase here's

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.840
content I want to
recommend to a consumer.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.650
So, there is
paradigms we developed

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.030
to make it really
simple and easy

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.613
for a developer to
integrate, but also

00:19:17.613 --> 00:19:19.700
make it more of a consumer
experience optimized

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.440
for television.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.960
And we also have
universal search

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.330
built as part of
this product as well.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.670
And the great thing is from
a developer standpoint,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.520
we've tried to really make it
simple to take existing apps

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.940
and then optimize it for the TV.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.300
We don't want to have to
make you rewrite everything

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:35.990
to make it work.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.960
And so we have some
simple paradigms.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.822
This is from the
Leanback Library.

00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:41.530
And we have these
things called fragments

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.770
where you can just publish
your content into a fragment,

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.690
and we'll render it in
a really high quality,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.970
beautiful way on the TV screen.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.580
This is called the
Browse fragment.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.370
So I encourage everyone
to take a look.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.120
It's really simple to
actually bring your app,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.460
depending on how much you
want to actually optimize it.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.876
But we can give
you some paradigms

00:19:58.876 --> 00:20:01.320
to make it really simple
and easy to do it.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.640
And lastly, a different
approach to gaming

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.750
is obviously using
a remote control.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.690
And so Android TV tries to
bring all the gaming paradigms

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.730
that we have in Android and also
brings them to the television.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.550
So now you can run
a game which has

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.510
a traditional remote control
directly on the big screen.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.940
And again, using
similar paradigms

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.380
I just talked about with Android
TV or Android in general.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.850
So that's a quick summary
of the living room

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.430
strategy from Google.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.500
We're looking at to
great platforms that

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.199
allow us to actually bring
experiences to consumers.

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:35.240
A mobile first approach,
which is about extending

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.896
your existing mobile app.

00:20:36.896 --> 00:20:39.020
And the Android TV approach,
a TV centric approach,

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.070
where you can take your app and
optimize it for the big screen.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.300
We're super excited to see
what you guys will do next.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.320
OK, with that I'll head
it back to Timothy.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.930
Thank you.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.305
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you, Rishi.

00:20:49.305 --> 00:20:51.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:55.461 --> 00:20:57.210
All right, let's
continue our conversation

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.810
with the senior US designer on
Android Wear, Krystal Higgins.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.000
KRYSTAL HIGGINS:
Thanks, Timothy.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.220
And hi everyone.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.490
Thank you for joining us on
the second day of Ubiquity.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.850
I am personally very
excited to be here

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.290
because I have been working on
Android Wear and Android Wear

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.220
watches since the
day I joined Google.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.080
Because I personally believe
that wearables are the most

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.800
versatile and the most
personal connected objects

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.927
we can have the pleasure
of designing for.

00:21:28.927 --> 00:21:31.010
In a few moments, I'm going
to share with you some

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.980
of the new ways
that we have enabled

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.450
you to build great wearable
experiences for Android Wear.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.060
But first, I want to add just
a layer of context around what

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.090
we're trying to do here.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.250
This might be a bit
of refresher for some,

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.410
but it's an important
foundation that will

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.480
anchor what I talk about next.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.160
So this is the kind of situation
that we're solving for.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.560
I don't need to remind you
or tell you how awesome,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.430
how great and useful mobile
phones and tablets can

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.740
be in our everyday lives.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.490
There are great
use cases for them.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.570
But Google's also
been looking into ways

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.600
to use technology so
that we can actually

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.560
be just a bit more connected
to the world around us,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.540
even while being more connected
virtually to those people who

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.370
are not with us.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.150
And it's Android Wear that
aims to complete that picture

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.590
by giving you useful
information at a glance,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.050
but letting you stay in the
moment when it's appropriate.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.020
And this becomes clearer if we
break this down in a bit more

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.460
of a visual manner.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:37.960
Right?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.980
This might be a day
with your phone.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.480
Notice the length
of time it can take

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.400
to get your phone out, unlock
it, navigate to where you

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.534
need to go, and engage with it.

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:48.950
And there are
certainly times when

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.600
it's great to get
lost in your phone.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.100
Right?

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.470
Maybe you're on a commute
or waiting in line.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.370
But there's also a hefty
time and attention cost

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.810
if all you really
wanted to do was just

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.180
check some bit of information
or feel slightly connected when

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.220
you're out with friends.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.890
Now if we look at the
same set of interactions

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.630
on a wearable
device, then we can

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.660
see that there's a reduced
overhead per interaction.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.220
We can actually help you be more
physically present in the world

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.440
around you, even
while being more

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.670
connected to the virtual one.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.540
And what this means for
developing user experiences

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.110
on these watches is
that we just have

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.780
to think a little
bit differently

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.240
about what we build.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.390
Because it's a fundamentally
different interaction model.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.590
And you can tell just by
looking at some of the watches,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.750
they're fundamentally different
than other mobile devices.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.570
So we have to
rethink it a bit when

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.650
considering which features
of your service or your app

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:57.990
you want to bring to the wrist.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.840
It's really about
thinking what couldn't we

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.390
do on the mobile
app before that we

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:07.490
can now extend, that we can
now make possible in the wrist.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.980
For example, Google Fit
has a great mobile app

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.340
that helps you keep track
of your fitness goals

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.010
throughout the day, the
week, or even the month.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.450
But the watch doesn't
need all that information.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.400
It is positioned in a way that
it can give you experiences

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.360
that the mobile app can't-- like
to track repetitions as you do

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.500
things like push ups or squats.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.770
Things that weren't possible
before, but a natural extension

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.330
of the app that
existed on the phone.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.310
So with Android
Wear watches, you

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.579
can bring things to the
watch that you haven't

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:44.370
been able to do with
the phone before, more

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.530
meaningful experiences.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.170
And our philosophy for how to
design for Android Wear apps

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.880
is all anchored and
inspired by something

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.890
that we've done with
watches for a long time.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:57.390
Right?

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.270
Telling the time.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.330
It's a simple action.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.210
You glance at your wrist, you
get the information you need,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.450
and you make a decision
in fractions of a second.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:11.710
Its glanceable, it's
actionable, and it's effortless.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.980
And these create the
cornerstone for how

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.860
we think about designing
for Android Wear apps

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.950
and how we have extended our
platform support to enable

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.560
you to do the same.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.260
Since day one we've
made it so that apps

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.280
can provide glanceable,
actionable, and effortless

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.310
experiences on the watch
with notification bridging.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.400
If your apps send notifications,
they will automatically

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.600
synchronize with Android Wear.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.040
If you use media APIs,
you'll get that for free.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.510
But it's the Android
Wear experiences

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.110
that go beyond the
notification layer

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.819
to deliver something more
uniquely wearable that actually

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:53.652
are more successful.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:01.120
So ever since we launched
with notification support,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.010
we've been extending
the platform,

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.250
growing it so that we can
give you more opportunities

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.710
to create those great
meaningful wearable experiences.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.270
You have the ability to
leverage sensors from heart rate

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:17.510
monitors to accelerometers,
haptic motors, and microphones.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.570
We enabled Wi-Fi support
in May and introduced

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.510
wearable friendly interaction
methods like emoji recognition

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.080
and wrist gestures.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.990
And we've continued to grow our
watch portfolio so that there

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.430
will always be a watch
that fits your users

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.380
and their unique needs.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.355
So when you build
for Android Wear,

00:26:41.355 --> 00:26:43.790
you know that the
opportunities to create

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.740
meaningful experiences will
only get better over time.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.030
And there's actually
two recent features

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:52.860
that I want to call out as
providing you with the means

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.350
to create the right wearable
experience for your app

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.070
or service's unique use case.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.120
First, with Android
Wear watches,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.410
you have the ability to create
always on app experiences.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.710
And you can now marry
aesthetics with utility

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.850
with interactive watch faces.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.730
As a designer, I'm
really inspired

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.730
by these ones, excited by them.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.260
Because these give
you the options

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.890
you need to cover a
whole slew of use cases

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.810
that you might run into.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.550
Now, Android Wear watches
are unique in their ability

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.070
to have screens on 24 hours
a day, seven days a week

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.130
without user
interaction required.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.810
And we can do all of this
while also saving on battery.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.020
Never before in the
history of computing

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.660
have we had this opportunity
to have so many always on,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.170
always accessible screens.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.980
So we should be taking
advantage of it.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:56.060
Now we started by enabling
always on experiences

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.550
with the watch face level.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:01.350
We figured that hey, when
people choose a watch face,

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.530
it's a personal choice.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.190
It's a style choice.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.915
And so it should always be
represented in some manner.

00:28:06.915 --> 00:28:09.230
The screen shouldn't
just go black.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.920
So we made it so
that the watch face

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.330
would display in a
low power ambient mode

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.400
when the watch was not in use.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.140
And we quickly
realized that there

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.700
were great app activities
that would benefit

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.320
from the same kind of behavior.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.840
The watch didn't always have
to go back to this low power

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.380
state of the watch face.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.070
So we made that
available for you.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.670
You can now create always on app
activities for ongoing sessions

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.830
when that information
is necessary.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:43.500
So let's look at a few examples
of ways that you can use this.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.050
Shopping, a great example.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.820
I might create a shopping
list while I'm at work.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.570
But when I get to the store
I want to put it on my wrist

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.440
so that it's easily
accessible and readable as I

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.550
go through various aisles.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.290
Now I can do things like
check off vegetables

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.040
when I get to that
aisle, interact with it

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.420
for a split second.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.780
But even as I'm busy going
through the rest of the store,

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.380
it will go into a low
power black and white state

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:15.240
so that it's always visible
for as long as I need it.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.810
Maps, navigation.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.410
That's another great use case.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.850
I might be exploring
a new neighborhood.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.420
So I want to put maps
directions on my wrist,

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.850
but I don't want to
constantly be looking at it.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.600
With this always on capability,
maps are always available to me

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.180
while I need it
without me needing

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.750
to fiddle with the watch
or tap on the watch face.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.440
It's just a glance away.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.870
And fitness, as well,
I do a lot of workouts.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.760
And I like having my workout
stats available to me.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.910
But I don't need my
watch to be constantly

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.060
in an interactive,
full color state.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.700
I can save on
battery while still

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.410
get the information I need,
all while it's relevant to me.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.870
So these always
on app experiences

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.692
are great because they don't
require you to be interacting

00:30:00.692 --> 00:30:02.400
with the watch to get
the information you

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.750
need at the time you can.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.130
You can provide to your
users the experiences

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.370
that give them the information
they need at any given moment.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.820
And it's great for session based
activities or ongoing sessions.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.010
Now, complementary to
always on experiences

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.930
is that we are allowing you
to build interactive watch

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.810
faces for those times
when you want information

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.480
to be accessible, but
that don't need to be

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.020
tied to an ongoing app session.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.590
Since late 2014, you've been
able to create your own watch

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.910
faces and maybe
some of you have.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.930
They are a great way to provide
that perpetual information

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.540
at a glance without requiring
people to open an app.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.010
Now, as watch faces
evolved, after we

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.560
made this capability
available to you all,

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.470
we noticed people building
rich complications,

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.080
really informative watch
faces, to the extent

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.920
that people were tapping
on them, expecting

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.120
another layer of interaction.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.070
So we recognized that need and
made that accessible to you.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.570
Now you can bubble
up key actions

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.720
into the watch face that
are just a tap away.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.770
And we can see this if
we look at a few examples

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.260
like this interactive
watch face called Bits.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.150
It shows me, well, bits of
information about my day

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.600
so I can see my day at a glance.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.050
But any time I want a
deeper level of context,

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.900
all I have to do is tap on
one of those complications.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.090
I can see the next hour
in the weather forecast,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.780
or exactly who I'm meeting
with in the next 50 minutes,

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:42.450
all without feeling like I've
ever left the watch face.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.960
And in this example
from the Moto 360 Sport,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.900
I can have my fitness stats
ongoing, present on my watch

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.350
face all day long in
an ambient manner.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.070
But at any time I can tap
on one of these sections

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.680
to get a deeper look
at my steps count.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.990
Or I can go ahead
and decide that it's

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.320
time to start a workout.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.780
And I have that shortcut
right from the watch face.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.700
So again, with always on apps,
and with interactive watch

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.230
faces, we're giving
you the tools

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.450
you need to provide the right
experience to your users

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.320
at the right time.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.470
And also great about
building for Android Wear

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.470
is that you can reach
people, no matter

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.950
what their style, taste,
or their fashion sense.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:28.450
Right?

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:34.820
We have a number of watches that
we make available to consumers.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:39.290
So there's always going to
be a device, a watch, that

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.800
fits your users and their
unique lifestyle needs.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.840
And we released new
devices this fall

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.830
and also announced three
new ones last week.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.400
And when you build
for Android Wear,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.240
you will also have
the opportunity

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.580
to have global reach.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.860
We have support in 42
countries and language pairs.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.240
And this is all on the
platform that you're already

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.690
familiar with.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.330
You can take 99%
of your knowledge

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.500
about building for Android
and apply it to Android Wear.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.450
And in fact, today, you
can do more and learn more

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.790
about how to build these
experiences with some

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.520
of the sessions that
we have going on.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.760
We have some great
sessions after lunch.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.180
Talks specifically on how to
build always on experiences

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.570
and interactive watch faces.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.840
Starting at 2, we
have office hours.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.220
And we have code labs all day.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.680
So you can try Android
Wear and talk to us.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.220
Ask us questions.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.970
And if you need
other resources, we

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.010
have a community on
Google Plus as well as

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:50.090
our developer website where you
can get articles, tutorials,

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.090
and more.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.460
So I look forward to
seeing what you build.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.150
And thank you very much.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.987
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:57.987 --> 00:33:59.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:04.220
All right, we have
one more product

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.303
to discuss with you today.

00:34:05.303 --> 00:34:06.560
And that's Android Auto.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.280
So I'd like to welcome
product manager Daniel

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.000
Holle to the stage.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.685
DANIEL HOLLE:
Thank you, Timothy.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.330
Hi, I'm Daniel Holle.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.614
I'm product manager
on Android Auto.

00:34:19.614 --> 00:34:21.739
And I want to show you
today a little bit about how

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:25.960
the future of apps could
look like in the car.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.530
A couple years back,
we looked at where

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.716
Android is used the most.

00:34:30.716 --> 00:34:32.090
And we found that
a lot of people

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.580
are using Android in their
cars while they're driving.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.469
Actually 100 million Americans
spend more than one hour a day

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:41.880
in the car.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.710
That's a lot of potential
for a true digital experience

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.679
in the car.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.730
Of course, many people
use their trusted devices,

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.280
their smartphones,
bring them into the car,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.405
and use them while driving.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.700
We talked to users and
they told us this is

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.140
a really cumbersome experience.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.640
Right?

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.670
You have to focus on
two different things.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.780
The phone layout is not
really optimized for the car.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.120
And it's also actually
really, really unsafe

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.420
to do that while driving.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:17.830
Actually 25% of the accidents
in the US involve a smartphone.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.480
And this is really
not how we imagine

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.630
a great experience in the car.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.970
So we felt we really
needed to fix this.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.470
So we set out to build
with Android Auto

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.347
to build a safer and better
user experience in the car.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.230
We wanted to have the product
be focused around your phone.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.170
The phone is really
the central piece

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.250
of user's digital experience.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:49.010
We always have it with us and
it carries are very personal

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.580
information on there.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.880
We designed the product
so you can plug your phone

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.710
into the car via USB cable.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.630
And it then takes
over the big display

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.270
that you have in your car.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:04.630
We also tie in touchscreen
controls, rotary controllers,

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:08.330
and steering wheel controls
so you can actually control

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.130
your apps on the screen.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.666
The apps still run on the phone.

00:36:12.666 --> 00:36:14.290
And that's the
beautiful thing about it

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.080
because we can
update the product.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.410
And you can update
your apps on the phone

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.810
just as we used to do
through the Play Store.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:26.040
So there's no trip to the
dealer required to update

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.079
the in-car experience.

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:29.370
You just update your apps
and they just work in the car

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.060
as well.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.480
So we put a lot
of work into this.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.610
And nearly a year ago,
we launched Android Auto.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.910
And I have a video that
I want to share with you

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.282
about the product we built.

00:36:44.282 --> 00:36:46.240
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: Cars
are integral to the way

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.310
that people live
their lives today.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.400
We use cars for taking
our kids to school.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.265
We use our cars for
commuting to work.

00:36:52.265 --> 00:36:55.520
But when we look at cars
today, they're fundamentally

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.492
disconnected vehicles.

00:36:56.492 --> 00:36:58.200
PATRICK BRADY: People
don't want to check

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.700
their phones at the door when
they get behind the wheel.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.900
So we partnered with auto
manufacturers and technology

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.600
partners to figure
out the best way

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.530
to bring Android into the car.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.380
Today we're announcing Android
Auto, which extends the Android

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.830
platform into the car.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.490
Android Auto combines
the best of both worlds.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.180
You get the connected apps and
services on your smartphone

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.390
with the physical controls
that were optimized

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:21.686
for driving in your car.

00:37:24.917 --> 00:37:26.500
We had to go back
to the drawing board

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.270
and really take
an experience that

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.760
was designed for a
smartphone and break it down

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.822
to its bare essential.

00:37:31.822 --> 00:37:34.030
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: We focused
it down to the features

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.890
that the user really needs
within the driving space.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.360
We've made Google Maps really
easy to use for the car.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.370
We've got nice, easy to access
touch targets and a simplified

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.350
interface.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.850
The voice technology that
we're using within the car

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.009
is super conversational.

00:37:49.009 --> 00:37:50.800
PATRICK BRADY: Your
hands are on the wheel,

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.927
your eyes are on the road.

00:37:51.927 --> 00:37:54.010
MALE SPEAKER: Set a reminder
to get gas on the way

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:54.800
back to work.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.890
Pick up my dry cleaning.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.040
Remind me to get
tickets on the way home.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.498
PATRICK BRADY: Google brings
you just the right information

00:38:00.498 --> 00:38:01.470
at just the right time.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.680
So when you set reminders
while you're driving,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.370
your phone will
remind you later on

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.440
even if you're outside the car.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.520
Android developers will soon
be able to create entirely

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.727
new experiences for the car.

00:38:13.727 --> 00:38:16.310
HENRY NEWTON-DUNN: We're really
excited about this opportunity

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.377
because for us, this is really
very much at the beginning.

00:38:19.377 --> 00:38:20.960
And you know, we're
really going to go

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.314
on a long journey with this.

00:38:29.205 --> 00:38:30.580
DANIEL HOLLE: So
this is actually

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.640
a really amazing product.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.970
This will change the way we
experience our time in the car.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.250
We showed this to a lot of OEMs,
the car manufacturing industry.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.100
And they were really
excited about it.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.320
Since we launched this, the
Open Automotive Alliance

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.790
has been growing.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.700
And we have nearly
every manufacturer

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.860
around the world
now working with us

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.310
to bring this to their car
models and to users out there.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.910
So they gave us lots of
backing for this product.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:07.880
In 2016, we will continue this
great momentum in several ways.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.040
There will be more
cars hitting the road.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.280
We have about 10 cars,
models, out there right now.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.080
And there will be 40
more coming this year.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.150
This will really bring the
reach to a lot of users.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.460
There's also more countries.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.960
We launched with a
couple countries.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.090
But this year, we
are really extending

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.260
it to be a global
reach of Android Auto.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.030
And there are more
apps coming to Android.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:36.620
Today, we have more than 500
apps enabled for Android Auto.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.450
And this is actually
the part that I'm

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.920
most excited about is the app
developer ecosystem that we

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.920
can finally bring to the car.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.370
You know, before Android Auto it
was really cumbersome and hard

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.880
for developers to
build for cars.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.530
You had several different
car operating systems,

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.470
different models, different
screen sizes, different input

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.100
methods to your apps.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.040
And that made it really
hard for developers

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.140
to get reach across cars and
across models and regions.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.150
So I'm glad that we solved
this part for app developers.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:20.060
Because today, you
actually have one platform,

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.620
one single platform to
build for across car models

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.350
and across countries.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.180
And this gives you
the fundamental reach

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.170
that you need for
your apps in the car.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.100
And the good news
is it's Android.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.700
So if you have an
existing Android app,

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.020
it's really simple to just
enable that app for Android

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.250
Auto and play in the car.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.710
So let me give you in a nutshell
how this could work for you.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.190
We focused on the
core driving use cases

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.800
and have an SDK
ready for media apps.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.650
So now apps like music,
podcasts, audio book players

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.630
can be enabled in the
car to extend the user

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.730
experience on their display.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.570
And this is a great use case to
stay entertained while you're

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.370
driving in a safe way.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:18.280
The APIs that we have available
can help to expose your content

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.160
in a menu structure, can
use your customized playback

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.420
controls.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.040
And you can adjust the UI to
really communicate your brand

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.679
still on the car screen.

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:33.220
It is really-- I'd
have to say-- it's

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.710
a very special magic moment
when you get in the car,

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:38.820
you plug in your phone, and you
see your personalized playlists

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.250
on the big screen.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.300
And you can just continue
playing your music

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.130
that you just heard
before on your phone.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:50.360
The second SDK is
the messaging SDK.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.600
This is geared towards
messaging and chat apps

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.840
to come to the
Android Auto screen.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.220
Again, a very dominant
use case because we

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.860
all want to stay
connected and communicate

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.300
while we're on our commutes.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.530
This messaging SDK gives you
the ability through those APIs

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.300
to show notifications if an
incoming message is there.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.410
It gives you the potential to
play back that message that's

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:17.950
being read out to you.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:21.170
And you can actually
reply via speech to it.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.570
And it works really well.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.750
I use it on my commute with
several different messengers

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:29.140
and it's a great experience
to stay connected in the car.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.805
And again, we really make
it safer through that.

00:42:31.805 --> 00:42:33.680
So you keep your hands
on the steering wheel,

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.300
your eyes on the road, and you
can still chat back and forth.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:43.880
Just imagine how much we
make our users' lives safer

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.750
with implementing this
SDK and bringing messaging

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.070
to the car in a safe way.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.080
So I want to share a little
bit about the road ahead.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.490
Of course, we don't stop here.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.770
We work fiercely to
get into more use cases

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.070
and to approve the existing
SDKs on the product.

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:06.575
The improvements
that are on the way

00:43:06.575 --> 00:43:11.680
are, for example, for the media
SDK, to expose more content.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.740
We have safety
regulations that we

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.650
adhere to to make it safe
how to browse your content.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.120
And we're working
on ways to expose

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:25.650
more content, your full set of
playlists for the media SDK.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:31.169
We also bring innovative car OEM
apps to Android Auto this year.

00:43:31.169 --> 00:43:32.960
Car manufacturers will
have the opportunity

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.690
to build their own apps and
use cases for Android Auto.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.140
And we'll also launch more
app categories in 2016

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.285
to the developer community.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.540
So with this platform,
we really believe

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:54.080
we can build a better and safer
user experience for the car.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.510
And with the SDK too, you can
participate in this mission.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:01.530
So I would really like to invite
you to enable your Android Auto

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.500
apps, your apps for
Android Auto today,

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.430
and join this mission to
make our users' lives safer

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.490
and a better
experience in the car.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:11.323
Thank you very much.

00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:15.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Timothy.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.788
Thank you, Daniel.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.653
So, I hope you all got
your toolboxes yesterday.

00:44:27.653 --> 00:44:28.301
Most of you?

00:44:28.301 --> 00:44:28.800
OK.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.520
We noticed that there was a
little extra room in them.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.490
So we thought we'd give
you something else that

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:38.950
was discussed today
to build for those.

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:42.360
And that will be both a
Chromecast and a Chromecast

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.228
Audio.

00:44:43.228 --> 00:44:49.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.930
So you'll be able to pick
these up at the afternoon break

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:52.870
later in the day.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:57.120
And thank you very much for
having a really great day

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.490
one at the Ubiquity Dev Summit.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.060
And let's make it
a great day two.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.120
Learning together how to build
beyond the internet of things.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.650
Thank you.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.700
