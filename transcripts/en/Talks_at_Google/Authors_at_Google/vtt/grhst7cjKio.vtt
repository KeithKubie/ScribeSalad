Eugenie Harvey: Thank you, Kate.
And thank everybody for taking time out of

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.490
your busy days to come and hear a little bit
about the work we do through our little organization,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.840
"We Are What We Do.”
You may not have heard We Are What We Do.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.869
It's not exactly a brand that trips off the
tongue.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.950
But, you might have heard of a couple of the
projects, which we're going to talk about

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.840
today.
One of which -- or two of which -- are the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
books that are on your seat.
Which I hope you've had a chance to flip through.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.260
And if you haven't, please take with you and
read and pass on and enjoy.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.350
And you most likely, I think, will have heard
of a project we did with Anya Hindmarch, which

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm going to talk a little bit about, a bag
called, "I'm Not a Plastic Bag.”

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.890
And if you haven't heard of either or any
of those projects, by the end of this year,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.329
I certainly hope "We Are What We Do" is a
brand which trips off your tongue, because

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.000
we are infiltrating your organization, and
working on an extremely exciting project with

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.410
you.
Which we're going to talk to you -- or Nick's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.820
going to talk to you about today.
At the risk of stealing your thunder, Nick,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.750
I'm going to say that the name of the project
that we're working on with Google is, "Share

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.360
Your History.”
That may be a working title.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.470
I don't think so.
It's sort of, you know, the way these things

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.940
do.
It's kind of -- seems to be sticking.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.360
And, in the spirit of sharing your history,
I'm going to begin my talk about We Are What

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.690
We Do, with a little tiny bit of my own history,
if you will indulge me.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.110
I am Australian, in case you hadn't guessed.
And I grew up in Australia.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.390
I spent the first thirty years of my life
there.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.660
I had a very, very happy fortunate childhood.
But two things happened to me when I was 12,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.930
which left an indelible mark on me, and I
think have really led me to want to do the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.660
sort of work that I do.
And the first that happened was that my mom

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.429
and dad got divorced, which is obviously not
a wildly unusual event, but it was -- as it

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.750
always is -- very traumatic for me and my
sister.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.980
And within 12 months after that, our house
had burnt down, and we lost everything that

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.640
we owned.
And so, it was a fairly intense period in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.200
my early teens.
And it gave me a very strong sense of the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.350
kind of sadness and unfairness that people
can and do experience every single day in

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.330
the world in any number of different forms.
And it made me very determined one day to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.190
try and do something with my life that could,
in some way, ease the suffering or improve

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.660
the circumstances of people who have been
the victim of problems like those that I had.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.360
So it's a long time ago, back in Sydney, Australia,
in the 70's and 80's.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.740
I went to university.
I did a mass communications degree.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.150
Enjoyed it very much.
I went and worked at a company called the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.680
Sydney Theatre Company.
I worked in the arts, at a time when we were

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.190
launching the careers of some very exciting,
famous Australian people.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.321
Then I went to work for Rupert Murdock in
his big pay, television start-up, which was

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.120
called FOXTEL.
It was our equivalent of SKY, and it was a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.290
very, very exciting time in telecommunications
and -- well, business in Australia.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.660
I did three or four years there, and by the
time I hit my 30th birthday, the net result

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.500
of those experiences was that I kind of burnt
out.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.950
I hadn't kind of burn out; I completely burnt
out.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.190
And, more to the point, that voice that had
been inside me since I was really quite a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.560
young girl of, you know, wanting to do something
to make the world a better place.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.090
That drive, which I've sort of managed to
keep at bay during my 20's, when there was

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.750
a lot of other things to be doing -- a lot
of other exciting things to be doing -- started

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.622
to get louder and louder and louder.
"What are you doing?”

00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:56.190
You know, "How are you going to make this
ambition of trying to help people come to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.030
life?”
And I had absolutely no idea because, as someone

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.990
who'd done a mass communications degree, I
clearly had absolutely no skills or experience

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.030
that really, you would think, could do anything
to improve the circumstances of people in

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.280
the world.
So I did the honorable thing.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.910
I have, thanks to my dad -- who is a wood-grain
lad -- I have a British passport.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.960
And so, as I approached my 30th birthday,
I took my British passport, and I jumped on

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.250
a plane and I moved to the other side of the
world where I virtually knew no one, and no

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.419
one knew me.
And I could embark on this mission, or reinvention,

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.900
to do this thing which was going to make the
world a better place -- whatever that might

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.760
be -- in glorious anonymity where nobody knew
me.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.680
I could kind of fail spectacularly and no
one would ever know.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.290
And the great thing was, I did fail spectacularly
on several occasions.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.500
When I got here, you know, with this determination
to find this new thing to do -- this better

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.220
thing with my life -- within you know, I think
six weeks, I was working just down the road

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.410
here for a PR agency, having moved to the
other side of the world to get out of PR,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.400
promoting the Australian Tourist Commission's
 -- or, well, promoting Australia, effectively

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.449
in the run up to the Sydney 2002 Games.
So I was on the other side of the world with

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.400
no family, no friends, no money, doing the
job I disliked, and promoting the country

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.270
I just moved halfway around the world from.
So it was a spectacular failure at, you know,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.660
reinvention.
So I did that for a couple of years, and I

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.000
really was very unhappy.
But the good thing that happened during that

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.120
time -- which I look back on really with gratitude
now -- was for the first time in my life -- and

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.170
I'm not proud to say this, because I worked
in the media for a decade at that point -- For

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.420
the first time in my life, I used to sit down
and read the newspaper.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.400
Because, obviously -- well, the media here
is so fabulous and it's very, you know, so

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.050
different to Australia where we just have
one newspaper.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.220
So I was very interested and engaged by this
incredible media that you have here.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.169
And I started to read the newspaper every
day.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.479
Not least, because I didn't have very much
money and was really sort of all I could afford

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.430
by way of entertainment.
I managed to have a couple of white wines

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.480
I think, too.
But, on the whole, I led a fairly solitary

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.540
existence.
And I started to read about problems in the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.470
paper.
And as I said, I've had -- ever since I was

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.150
quite young -- had this hope that I would
try and do something to make the world a better

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.259
place.
But I hadn't really ever -- if I was honest

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.270
 -- considered some of the issues, or the
issues that I might be interested or able

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.610
to participate in.
And so, reading the newspaper during that

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.130
period of time and really forcing myself to
think about the sorts of injustices and problems

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.000
and crime and terrorism and this thing called
"climate change", which was, sort of -- back

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.410
in 2001 -- starting to come on the agenda.
And to really think about those big issues.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.479
And the first thing that happened was, I became
incredibly dispirited and entirely overwhelmed.

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.600
And thought, you know, how naive and foolish
was I to think that one person with a mass

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.520
communications degree and a few years of PR
could in any way, shape, or form, have any

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.721
impact on something like infant mortality
or slavery or climate change.

00:07:13.721 --> 00:07:17.900
You know, there's just no way, really.
And so, I went through a period of feeling

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.970
pretty grim about things.
But, as luck would have it, I had a chance

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.740
encounter with someone.
And, I don't know if any of you have ever

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.310
been kind of scratching around to sort of
make a change in some aspect of your life,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.400
but what I was doing was kind of looking out
for any kind of foothold that I might be able

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.970
to get onto this new life -- whatever that
may be.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.949
And somebody came to my company -- I was working
at a different company then, at Brunswick,

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:50.370
a big financial PR house -- who was invited
to a -- they had a forum exactly like this,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.130
a kind of monthly opportunity for someone
to come in from a different company -- or

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.001
world -- to talk about their work.
And a man called David Robinson came in and

00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:04.169
talked about the charity that he founded in
East London, in Newham, which is called "Community

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:09.800
Links", and which he started, I think, about
25 years ago in his mom's front room when

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.930
he was a very young man, and has now gone
on to be an incredible force for community

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:23.419
solutions to problems that are affecting a
very poor part of London.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.410
And I think they help about 50,000 people
every year get back on their feet.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.070
You know, no small feat.
And so, David came, he talked about his work

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.870
and the sorts of things that they did.
And he was looking for people to do volunteering.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.209
And he was obviously seeing if anyone in the
room would like to.

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:39.060
So I thought, "Well, that's a good place to
start.”

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.940
And I went up to talk to him afterwards.
And I said, "You know, I don't think I've

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.410
really got much to offer, but I'm very interested
in your work.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.610
I was very inspired by what you said, and
I'd really love to come out and see your charity,

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.480
Community Links, in action.”
So I went out there, and I got to know David,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.869
and I got to know some of his colleagues.
And it was a really eye-opening experience

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.459
for me.
I've never really sort of been anywhere near

00:09:00.459 --> 00:09:03.540
that far east.
I think I've been further east than Liverpool

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.649
Street up to that point -- didn't know it
existed.

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:09.769
And I went out to Kennington.
And I started to talk to David and learn about

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:14.860
the work, and it was extremely interesting.
And I talked to David.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.700
I said, "David, you know, I think I'm like
a lot of people.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.490
I'm a really ordinary person who reads about
problems in the paper, who wants to do something

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.790
about these problems, but has absolutely no
idea how to begin, and no confidence that

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.839
anything I did do might make any impression
on any number of these problems.”

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:38.389
And he said, "Well, that's very interesting.”
He said, "Because I've been doing some thinking

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:43.639
myself.”
As his charity had come up to their 25th birthday,

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:50.069
and he had -- he said he had come to my company
to give this talk, because they couldn't get

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:53.529
people like me any other way to go and help
them with their work.

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:58.879
And he said when -- that the model for Community
Links is engaging local people who don't have

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:01.319
problems to help local people who do have
problems.

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:04.759
And when they launched the charity in his
mom's front room, he said, "We had more people

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:08.170
wanting to help the people in need than we
had people in need.”

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.050
He said, "It was a nice problem to have, but
it was a problem.”

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.790
He said, "These days it could not be more
different.”

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.529
They cannot get enough volunteers to come
and help them with their work in East London

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:23.379
to help people in real need.
And he showed me some research which substantiated

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:28.470
his experience.
And this is just one stat which I pulled out,

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.860
which I think really illustrates the point.
And that is, that back in the 1980's, sixty

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.040
percent of people in their 30's remember of
a local community association, club, or other

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.499
organizations.
That might be a church or trade union or a

00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:45.410
football club or a bridge club or a parent
PTA, something like that.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.329
But today, this figure has dropped to less
than ten percent.

00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:53.439
I think it's about six percent.
And I would be interested -- I think, you

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:58.389
know, this room is probably largely comprised
of that age range -- people in their thirties.

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:02.999
And I think -- I'm not going to do a "Name
and Shame" -- but, I'd be surprised if more

00:11:02.999 --> 00:11:07.389
than, you know, ten or twenty percent of us
in this room belonged to something.

00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:12.579
So we started to think about that, and I realized
that really resonated with me, because I realized

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:17.509
that I was very much one of those people who
was this sort of lost generation back 20 or

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:21.399
30 years ago, I probably would have connected
with something locally, an association or

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:28.389
a club or a charity or some kind of organization
that would have allowed me to participate

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:33.860
in something that would be worthwhile in helping
towards some kind of cause.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.699
Whereas, these days, the thought of joining
something and going regularly on Tuesday night

00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:41.610
to a town hall for a regular meeting was utterly
foreign to me.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:46.160
I just wouldn't consider a formal commitment
like that.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.519
And we could talk about the reasons for that.
I think it's, you know, not particularly scientific.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.449
It's things like: We move around more.
We're busier.

00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:56.819
We work harder.
We want more flexibility.

00:11:56.819 --> 00:12:01.620
It's a whole range of things.
But the net result is, people aren't joining

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:07.069
organizations like David or many others, and
those organizations are suffering.

00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:13.649
But equally, people who have found real purpose
and fulfillment from supporting causes are

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:21.110
not able to find that sense of reward.
So, we started to talk about that, and we

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.540
thought there was a real opportunity here
to come up with a way of bringing people together

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.459
around big problems we read about in such
a way that wasn't a formal seven o'clock on

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:36.079
a Thursday night commitment, but was a looser
association which would be expressed -- rather

00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:40.540
than through an actual regular commitment
 -- rather through our behavior, through the

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.660
things we do.
They would be the signifiers of membership.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:53.279
And we started to think about these big problems
of climate change, crime, health problems,

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.529
poverty.
And we started to break them down.

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:00.350
And rather than seeing them as these great,
big, massive problems that we couldn't have

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.299
any impact on, we started to think about them
in terms of our daily lives and the very small

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:09.089
practical things that we could do each day
that would have an effect.

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:14.820
So obviously -- and we have to bear in mind
this was back in 2002 -- we started to think

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.589
about things that would affect climate change.
And they were very practical, simple things

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:23.829
we could do around the way we used resources.
Around any number of very practical things

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:27.249
like recycling, and plastic bags.
And we realized that actually, there's quite

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.759
a lot you could do every day.
And that if we could get lots of people to

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:37.610
do these simple things, well, we would in
time affect the outcome of the problem.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.519
But, perhaps, more importantly, we would create
a consensus, a new way of being -- that these

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:45.209
things mattered.
And that would then go on to inform our decisions

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:49.290
which are taken by businesses and by governments.
So, not only was doing the action important

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.589
in connecting us and making a difference to
the problem, it created a new way of being,

00:13:53.589 --> 00:13:57.629
which would be noted and taken on by others
in authority.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:02.420
So we started applying that thinking across
a whole range of issues from, you know, you

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.379
can improve the strength -- you can strengthen
your community by getting to know the people

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.699
in your street.
You can have strong relations with your family

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:16.860
by sitting down and having meals together.
You can avoid spending three hundred million

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.570
pounds on cleaning the streets of chewing
gum by not spitting your chewing gum.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:25.410
Those sorts of things.
And we thought that we were perhaps onto something

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.710
by providing people with these very simple
entry points into these great, big issues.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:36.129
So we came up with this idea that we would
try and create a global movement, a loose

00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:40.279
association of people.
Not a formal membership organization, but

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:44.149
a loose association of people who would share
our belief that small actions done by lots

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:47.399
of people could and will change the world
for the reasons I've explained.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:55.459
So the first thing we did was -- that was
back in 2002 -- and I was still working at

00:14:55.459 --> 00:15:01.549
Brunswick, the PR company, and I thought this
was a very interesting idea.

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:05.429
And I thought David was a fantastic and inspiring
and wonderful man.

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:10.160
And I could see that he had gathered around
him a really interesting group of people largely

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.119
drawn from the creative industries who were
thinking about this idea along with him.

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:19.319
And I could see that there was the need for
someone basically to turn up to all their

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:23.489
meetings and take notes and write the actions
and chase people up and get the things to

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.019
happen.
Otherwise, it would just continue to be these

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:30.300
very stimulating conversations in cafes in
East London, and it actually wouldn't move

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.749
on.
So I took a sort of -- well, quite a risky

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:39.490
decision, but it seemed quite obvious at the
time, to quit my job and to take the small

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:43.290
amount of money that I'd saved and to use
that to live on for a period of time and to

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.499
join David as a volunteer.
Something I never sort of saw myself as doing,

00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:49.470
but I thought, "I'll be a volunteer," and
so I did.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:54.619
I turned up out at Community Links one day,
or Tuesday, and said, "Well, David I'm here.

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:58.149
I've quit my job.”
I think he was quite surprised, but nonetheless

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:03.779
we started from there.
And that was November 2002, and that was kind

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:09.480
of -- well, that was the start of my formal
association with We Are What We Do in my informal

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.389
association.
So the first thing we did was a piece of research.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:16.350
We asked the question, "What would you ask
one million people to do to change the world?”

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.180
Put that in the paper.
We e-mailed people.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.929
We wrote to people.
And we got thousands and thousands and thousands

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:25.749
of suggestions of very simple things.
Because I knew the things that I thought would

00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:27.549
make a difference, and David had his views
as well.

00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:31.809
But, we were really, really keen to make sure
that what we were proposing was actually the

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:34.139
sorts of things that people were willing to
do.

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:37.569
And we got, I think, three-and-a-half thousand
unique suggestions.

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:42.179
And the most frequent suggestion was "Smile,"
which is nice.

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:46.579
But other things were "Say no to plastic bags"
or switch off lights or turn the tap off when

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:51.259
you clean your teeth or write someone who
inspired you or share a bath with someone

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:54.350
you love.
Whole range of things -- most of which we

00:16:54.350 --> 00:17:00.889
threw out -- but a core number we held onto
as being symbolic of a whole set of behaviors

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:06.370
and connecting to a wide range of issues.
Then we had this list and we thought, "Well,

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:10.829
we will put them in a book.”
And I think that was a big shazam: we'll make

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.820
a book.
And we thought it would be a little black

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.600
and white printed book, and it would sit by
the tiller, and it would have a hundred things

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.120
you can do, and it would sell for five pounds.
And that would mark the launch of this global,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.699
social change movement which was about trying
to inspire people to use their every day actions

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:27.600
to change the world.
And we had a brilliant guy who was part of

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.870
our development group called Twivy, and he
 -- I believe he put the "red nose" in Red

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.190
Nose Day.
I believe he came up with the red nose.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.670
And he took me aside after one meeting and
he said, "Eugenie, I think this is all great,

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.380
but I think this little book of a hundred
instructions -- because that's what it's going

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.900
to be -- it's going to be incredibly boring.
I think you've really got to think a bit more

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.420
creatively about how you present these ideas.
I've got some mates who work in advertising

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.900
who I think will be quite interested in helping
you out.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.830
Here are the names and addresses.
Write to them." So I did.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.790
I wrote to these six men -- all in their middle
age and quite burnt out, I think -- and said,

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.860
"Would you come along and help us create a
book out of a list of several hundred actions?”

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:14.890
And to my surprise, they all said, "Yes, absolutely.”
And so, we began an 18 months creative process,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.830
where we sat down every month with these guys
going through these actions and coming up

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.810
with treatments for these very, very simple
spreads.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:30.620
And then, we had all these treatments, and
then we needed photographers and writers and

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.120
illustrators and copyrights and all sorts
of things to come in and bring those treatments

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.520
to life.
So we got, I think, about 130 people to donate

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.580
their skills to that phase of the process.
We found a publisher, Rebecca Nicholson, who

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.570
said that she would publish the book and not
make any money out of it.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:52.120
We found a distributor, TBS, who said that
they would distribute the book all around

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.050
the country and not make any money out of
it.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.400
And so, the only thing we were going to pay
for was the printing, which at a print run

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.590
of about 5,000 copies was around three quid
a unit, which was all great.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.280
It was fantastic, apart from the fact that
we decided that the book would be called,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:11.880
"Change the World For a Fiver," -- the "Fiver"
relating to the price -- and we were determined

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.130
that we would keep the price low so that it
would be accessible to as many people as possible.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.360
We didn't want this to be something that price
was a barrier to.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.570
But the problem about that -- as they're rolling
off the printing press -- was that, we'd forgotten

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.560
something quite important, and that is the
retailers.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:35.370
And you may not know this, but the retailers
take a cut and it's upwards of sixty percent.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.280
So we had a very nasty moment where a book
called "Change The World For a Fiver" was

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.430
going to have to retail for about six pounds
fifty to break even, [laughter] which was,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:50.770
you know, nothing short of a PR disaster.
And so, the only thing to do was -- well,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.420
cry obviously in the first instance and go
and have a stiff drink -- and then, somehow,

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.380
we got the phone number of the buyer at Waterston's,
and I had been hounding her.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.950
And I rang her up, and I said, "Jenny, look,
we've got a little bit of a problem here.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.270
We actually need you to take this book on
the same terms that everybody else has participated

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.610
in the book.”
And she said, "What are they?”

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.150
And I said, "Basically, make no money.”

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.150
[laughter]

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.760
And she roared with laughter, and she said,
"You have no idea what you're asking.”

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.850
She said, "The book trade is the toughest
trade there is.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.050
We fight for our margin.
It's just not going to happen.”

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.540
And we had one dummy copy of the book at that
stage that was available.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.310
So I said, "Look, can I send it over to you,
and can you show it to your boss, and see

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.440
what he or she says?”
And she said, "Well, do.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.560
But it's not going to go anywhere.
I assure you.”

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.660
So a very, very nervous couple of weeks as
this five thousand books.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.080
You know, I mean, we -- I don't know how we
were paying for the printing of them.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.350
It was all very dodgy.
Nervous couple of weeks until she rang up,

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.740
and she said, "Well, hello," you know, "I
have got some good news.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.220
It's not as good as you want.”
And I thought, "Okay, what is it?”

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.740
And she said, "We'll take it at ten percent.
We'll make 50 pence on every book, every copy

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.920
sold.”
And she said, "We have to do that, because

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.470
it costs us money every time, and we can't
lose money on this.”

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.880
And I said, "That's fine.
That is absolutely fine.”

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:10.250
And she said, "And we'll take -- I need to
place an order with you and we'll take 5,000

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.940
copies.”
So, in that one conversation, not only did

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:20.530
we solve the small problem of the price in
the cover, but we also solved our first quantity.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.020
And, of course, all the other bookshelves
fell into line, and it became a book that

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.740
was called "Change The World For a Fiver"
that sold for five pounds that made us a couple

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.870
of quid every time we sold a copy, which was
fantastic.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.850
And that book has now gone on to sell a million
copies around the world.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:42.540
It's been published in Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, Germany, USA, and most recently,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.480
in Spain.
You've got copies of it, and I hope you'll

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.981
take them and you'll enjoy reading it.
But we're very, very proud of that project.

00:21:50.981 --> 00:21:55.530
Because, as I said, it represented lots and
lots of people coming together around this

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.950
idea of contributing your small bit to make
something far greater than you could have

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.620
done on your own.
I think about two hundred people, in the end,

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:08.640
donated their time and talent to that book.
And I always describe that book as dropping

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.870
a pebble in a pond.
And, like a pebble in a pond, it made a big

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.230
splash.
I mean, it hit all the bestseller lists, and

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.090
it got loads of publicity, and it sold lots
of copies very quickly.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.510
But actually, the pebble in the pond isn't
the thing that's changing the world, that's

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.490
making a difference.
It's the ripples that it created.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.590
And what excites us is what that book has
started, what it's facilitated, what it's

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.760
leading to.
And I'm going to talk really quickly about

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.840
a couple of those projects.
Some of those ripples are Al's, like the one

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.040
I'm going to tell you about, like the project
with Google.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:46.640
Many, many of them are done by people in communities,
in schools, in hospitals, in villages, all

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.500
around the world doing very simple things
inspired by this idea of small actions done

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.230
by lots of people.
So "Plastic Bags", I mean, I hope you all

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:01.330
have seen that project.
The first action in the book is "Say no to

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.159
plastic bags".
After we published the book, I went to Australia,

00:23:03.159 --> 00:23:06.690
and within the space of 12 months, plastic
bags had gone.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.740
No one was using them, which was extraordinary
change.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.740
And I came back thinking, "Well, if that kind
of change has been made in Australia, it's

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.580
going to come here sooner or later.”
And so, we'd started to think about maybe

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.630
doing a bag around the plastic bag idea.
And, as luck would have it, Tim Ashton, who

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.340
is one of our designers on the book, went
to a wedding, sat next to Anya Hindmarch's

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.080
husband, happened to have a copy of Change
The World For a Fiver in his pocket, as you

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.960
do when you go to a wedding, showed it to
James, and he said, "Oh, I think this is great.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.720
I think Anya would really love this.
Let's have a conversation.”

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.890
So within about two months, the Anya Plastic
Bag Project was borne out of that.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:53.460
And what appealed to Anya -- and, I think,
is what's important and unique about us is,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.930
she appeared -- the tone of what we do.
She said, "It's just -- you speak about this

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.970
stuff in a way which isn't worthy, which isn't
boring.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.370
You're not pointing the finger at me and making
me feel bad.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.610
You're inspiring me." She said, "When I read
your book, I do quite a lot of those actions.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.000
It made me feel good, and it made me feel
inclined to do more.”

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.190
And she said, "I think your psychology is
bang on.”

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.180
She loved the creativity of the book and she,
you know, she felt that it really sat with

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.160
her brand aspirations, just to use a kind
of brand-speak.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.040
And so, it gave us this tremendous starting
point for this project, which went on to be

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:35.190
on the front page of every newspaper.
And ladies camped out overnight outside Sainsbury

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:40.980
stores to get one.
It sold out, I think, within two hours of

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.390
launching it at Sainsbury's.
When it was launched in -- Taiwan, I think

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:51.720
it was -- the police came, and they canceled
the launch at Anya's shop, because ladies

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.500
were rioting.
They were hitting each other over the head

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.300
with handbags.
And so, they canceled the launch of it, because

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.390
it was a health and safety risk.
But what this bag did -- and the whole kind

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:06.740
of phenomenon around it -- was it put the
issue of plastic bags fairly and squarely

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:12.390
at the heart of mainstream media, which is
exactly where we wanted it to be.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.591
And, as a result of that -- well, certainly
as a part of that -- supermarkets have now,

00:25:17.591 --> 00:25:21.900
since that project, achieved a 40 percent
reduction in plastic bags handed out, which

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.710
is incredible.
Now, we don't claim to have been the sole

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.481
reason for that.
We are part of a movement, of plastic bags

00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:32.310
movement, but I think we can certainly say
that we raised the profile of the issue.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:38.880
And when we talk about creating a mood to
which businesses respond, that's the sort

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.780
of thing that encourages businesses to bring
in new business practices which reflect what

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.910
people are saying, what they're doing, and
what's in the media.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.101
And I'll just quickly talk about "Teach Your
Granny To Text," which is our most recent

00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:53.310
book.
And it's our children's book, and we're very

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.880
proud of it.
The Department For Education rang us up and

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.910
said they'd like to give a copy of Change
The World For a Fiver to every school in the

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.920
country.
But, if you go to Action Eight? -- Eleven

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.090
 -- Eight, you'll see why that conversation
ground to a halt.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:15.570
There was no way, on God's earth, they could
put that book into every school in the country,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.360
which was a disappointment, but obviously,
they had some budget.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.350
And they were keen to find a way of working
with it.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.670
So we said, "Well, why don't we do a children's
book together?" And they thought that was

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.790
a great idea.
And the result was this book, "Teach Your

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.670
Granny To Text.”
In other words, Change The World, which came

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.970
about as a similar consultation with children,
asking them what simple action they would

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:41.100
ask a million people to do to change the world,
and taking their responses and creating this

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.230
book.
And "Teach Your Granny To Text" was I think

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.470
a favorite suggestion from a little girl called
Erica Ritchie, whose granny lives in Scotland

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.500
and who -- her mom and dad had got divorced,
and it was her dad's mom -- and she didn't

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.360
see her very often.
And so, when she went up to see her at Christmas,

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.800
her dad had bought her granny a mobile phone.
And she sat down and taught her how to text.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.930
And now, they're in touch every single day.
And, you know, she's gone from having a relationship

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.600
with her granny -- which is a couple of times
a year for a visit -- to a daily and very

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.240
regular exchange of news.
And, you know, if you said to Erica, "Oh,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.341
well done for overcoming the digital divide.”
Or, you know, "You've really overcome your

00:27:19.341 --> 00:27:22.559
family breakdown," she'd look at you like
you'd grown a second head.

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:26.540
But that's what's at the heart of that action.
Similarly, my favorite is -- I always tell

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.760
this wrong, but I'm just going to tell it
like this today -- from a little boy who told

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.630
us he suggests "Walk Your Dad.”
And he said, "My dad's really fat, and I haven't

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.280
got a dog.
So now, I'll walk my dad."

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280
[laughter]

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.700
Which I think isn't true, but it's just become
a truth in my mind.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.970
And the little boy who wrote "Speak Football,"
which was when he went on holiday in Tanzania,

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.140
and he took his football with him.
And he used to go around at the end of the

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.890
day and kick the football with the little
boys down the street.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.970
And he wrote and said, "I think everybody
should Speak Football, because I couldn't

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.330
understand what those boys were saying and
they couldn't understand what I was saying,

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:02.920
but when we had a football, we all knew what
to do." So charming, charming stories that

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.580
are at the heart of this book.
Now, there is a multiplicity of projects I

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.430
could tell you about, which -- don't give
me too much encouragement or I will -- things

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.630
like partnerships with Virgin Atlantic to
create a book about changing the world from

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.610
35,000 feet.
I could tell you about a woman in the Inland

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:26.840
Revenue, the HMRC, who came to talk like this
and has now collected more than 6,000 pairs

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.340
of spectacles, because she was so inspired
by the "Recycle Your Spectacles" action in

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.900
the book.
And she has a scheme that works out of 94

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.170
offices of the Inland Revenue around the country,
and began with a photocopier box next to her

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.760
desk.
I could tell you about a man in Uganda, a

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.940
teacher, who uses "We Are What We Do" to talk
to people in his village about the practice

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:54.820
of bigamy, and the way the practice of bigamy
 -- which is very much part of every day life

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.700
and very much encouraged -- it's obviously
contributing to this hideous spread of HIV/AIDS.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.600
And he uses what he calls the "spirit" of
the idea, we "are" what we do.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.120
We get world that we deserve.
It's a consequence of the actions we take.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.309
And he applies it in his community to that
issue.

00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:15.520
I could tell you any number of stories, but
I'm going to stop there and hand over to Nick.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.250
We have a wonderful new site, which we'd love
it if you go and have a look at it.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.270
You'll see more stuff about us.
But we want to spend the rest of the time

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:27.370
we have with you talking about the work we're
going to do with you, and I hope you'll find

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.950
that really interesting.
Thank you.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:33.350
And -- I just want to say "Ming, if you're
out there, I'm here because you gave me an

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.320
introduction to Sylvia.”
Ming in San Francisco who I saw earlier this

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.910
year.
Hi, Ming.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.910

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:39.970
