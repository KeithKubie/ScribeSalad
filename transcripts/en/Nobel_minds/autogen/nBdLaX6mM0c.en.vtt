00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.560
Olga Bochner this year's price must have

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570
Olga Bochner this year's price must have
 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.350
Olga Bochner this year's price must have
been the most anticipated price in the

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360
been the most anticipated price in the
 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.040
been the most anticipated price in the
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have
 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.620
Nobel Prizes history so why did we have
to wait for more than an hour

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
to wait for more than an hour
 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.710
to wait for more than an hour
for the press conference oh you have to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720
for the press conference oh you have to
 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.540
for the press conference oh you have to
understand that this the decision about

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550
understand that this the decision about
 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.179
understand that this the decision about
the cries is taking from the very same

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189
the cries is taking from the very same
 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.140
the cries is taking from the very same
day when it is not so there was a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150
day when it is not so there was a
 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.569
day when it is not so there was a
discussion and there should be a

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579
discussion and there should be a
 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.240
discussion and there should be a
discussion otherwise if the price is so

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250
discussion otherwise if the price is so
 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.370
discussion otherwise if the price is so
anticipated and no one in the Academy

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380
anticipated and no one in the Academy
 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.729
anticipated and no one in the Academy
even have to come to the decision

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
even have to come to the decision
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.950
even have to come to the decision
meeting and today there were a number of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960
meeting and today there were a number of
 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.450
meeting and today there were a number of
people there and there was a very good

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
people there and there was a very good
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.880
people there and there was a very good
discussion and we landed on the surprise

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
discussion and we landed on the surprise
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.990
discussion and we landed on the surprise
because in ours

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000
because in ours
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.410
because in ours
and these are two scientists Laden Vic's

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420
and these are two scientists Laden Vic's
 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.720
and these are two scientists Laden Vic's
who actually wrote the theory in the 60s

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730
who actually wrote the theory in the 60s
 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.520
who actually wrote the theory in the 60s
1964 so then I had to wait even longer

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530
1964 so then I had to wait even longer
 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.170
1964 so then I had to wait even longer
for the price I say well you know there

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180
for the price I say well you know there
 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.630
for the price I say well you know there
is a lot of theories out there and I'm

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
is a lot of theories out there and I'm
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.760
is a lot of theories out there and I'm
gonna experimental it myself so you have

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770
gonna experimental it myself so you have
 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.770
gonna experimental it myself so you have
to understand that my attitude church

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780
to understand that my attitude church
 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.460
to understand that my attitude church
theorist is okay so there's a fear there

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470
theorist is okay so there's a fear there
 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.260
theorist is okay so there's a fear there
a lot of theories out there there's a

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270
a lot of theories out there there's a
 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.800
a lot of theories out there there's a
lot of theories out there but in the end

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810
lot of theories out there but in the end
 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.900
lot of theories out there but in the end
it's the interplay between experiment

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910
it's the interplay between experiment
 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.840
it's the interplay between experiment
and theory which decides what nature has

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850
and theory which decides what nature has
 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.020
and theory which decides what nature has
chosen as the grand scheme of things and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030
chosen as the grand scheme of things and
 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.290
chosen as the grand scheme of things and
so it took 15 years for the prediction

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300
so it took 15 years for the prediction
 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.830
so it took 15 years for the prediction
they made in 1964 to turn out to come

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
they made in 1964 to turn out to come
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.050
they made in 1964 to turn out to come
true and the thing which makes the prize

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060
true and the thing which makes the prize
 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.090
true and the thing which makes the prize
interesting right now you asking why 50

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100
interesting right now you asking why 50
 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.969
interesting right now you asking why 50
years is because of this observation of

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979
years is because of this observation of
 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.980
years is because of this observation of
a new particle at CERN where the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990
a new particle at CERN where the
 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.310
a new particle at CERN where the
properties expected them by the theory

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
properties expected them by the theory
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.770
properties expected them by the theory
so this is why sometimes I have to wait

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780
so this is why sometimes I have to wait
 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.080
so this is why sometimes I have to wait
50 years and sometimes the theory may

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090
50 years and sometimes the theory may
 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.140
50 years and sometimes the theory may
turn out to not be true and this is this

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150
turn out to not be true and this is this
 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.430
turn out to not be true and this is this
so-called Higgs particle many people

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440
so-called Higgs particle many people
 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.500
so-called Higgs particle many people
have heard about it what why was it so

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510
have heard about it what why was it so
 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.699
have heard about it what why was it so
hard to get to discovery

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
hard to get to discovery
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.690
hard to get to discovery
well there are several things one thing

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
well there are several things one thing
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.600
well there are several things one thing
is that the theory predicted that there

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
is that the theory predicted that there
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.509
is that the theory predicted that there
ought to be a particle it could tell us

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519
ought to be a particle it could tell us
 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.580
ought to be a particle it could tell us
the properties of this particle so how

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590
the properties of this particle so how
 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.770
the properties of this particle so how
it interacted with other particles with

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
it interacted with other particles with
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.020
it interacted with other particles with
matter particles and force carrier

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
matter particles and force carrier
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.420
matter particles and force carrier
particles but it couldn't tell us what

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
particles but it couldn't tell us what
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.300
particles but it couldn't tell us what
the mass of this particle was and so we

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
the mass of this particle was and so we
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.960
the mass of this particle was and so we
didn't know where to look and so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
didn't know where to look and so
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.789
didn't know where to look and so
actually for the past 50 years this

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799
actually for the past 50 years this
 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.270
actually for the past 50 years this
particle has been looked for at every

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280
particle has been looked for at every
 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.410
particle has been looked for at every
accelerator in existence

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
accelerator in existence
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.740
accelerator in existence
so it has been looked forward the IOR it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
so it has been looked forward the IOR it
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380
so it has been looked forward the IOR it
has been looking for the SPS at CERN at

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
has been looking for the SPS at CERN at
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.180
has been looking for the SPS at CERN at
the left Collider at the Tevatron

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190
the left Collider at the Tevatron
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.880
the left Collider at the Tevatron
this is this was an ongoing harness so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890
this is this was an ongoing harness so
 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.570
this is this was an ongoing harness so
from other properties one could try to

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
from other properties one could try to
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.420
from other properties one could try to
narrow the range of mass and what did so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430
narrow the range of mass and what did so
 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.180
narrow the range of mass and what did so
both of them at lab and the Tevatron so

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
both of them at lab and the Tevatron so
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.820
both of them at lab and the Tevatron so
in the end we knew more or less that if

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
in the end we knew more or less that if
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.729
in the end we knew more or less that if
it existed it had to be bad and then the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739
it existed it had to be bad and then the
 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.490
it existed it had to be bad and then the
LHC came in it is the most powerful

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
LHC came in it is the most powerful
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.340
LHC came in it is the most powerful
accelerator in existence could produce

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350
accelerator in existence could produce
 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.060
accelerator in existence could produce
enough energy to make this happen and so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070
enough energy to make this happen and so
 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.840
enough energy to make this happen and so
we found the particle well the particle

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850
we found the particle well the particle
 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.960
we found the particle well the particle
in itself is not as important as the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
in itself is not as important as the
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.290
in itself is not as important as the
theory which is represents so the theory

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300
theory which is represents so the theory
 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.050
theory which is represents so the theory
tells us why we exist because as I said

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060
tells us why we exist because as I said
 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.229
tells us why we exist because as I said
in my talk this is a philosophical

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
in my talk this is a philosophical
 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.810
in my talk this is a philosophical
question then again but maybe tells us

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820
question then again but maybe tells us
 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.090
question then again but maybe tells us
why we don't float away like the photo

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
why we don't float away like the photo
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.030
why we don't float away like the photo
and we all know that we are massive we

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
and we all know that we are massive we
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.520
and we all know that we are massive we
know that we consist of atoms and the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530
know that we consist of atoms and the
 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.460
know that we consist of atoms and the
atoms have atomic nucleus protons and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
atoms have atomic nucleus protons and
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.310
atoms have atomic nucleus protons and
electrons and neutrons this is what we

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320
electrons and neutrons this is what we
 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.289
electrons and neutrons this is what we
consist of but according to their

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299
consist of but according to their
 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.360
consist of but according to their
theories which existed before the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
theories which existed before the
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.009
theories which existed before the
mechanism was proposed all these

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
mechanism was proposed all these
 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.770
mechanism was proposed all these
particles ought to have the massless and

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
particles ought to have the massless and
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.110
particles ought to have the massless and
we know that unfortunately we are

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120
we know that unfortunately we are
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.880
we know that unfortunately we are
massive from a more massive run of

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890
massive from a more massive run of
 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.750
massive from a more massive run of
people but definitely not massless so

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
people but definitely not massless so
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.300
people but definitely not massless so
there was something wrong and the theory

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
there was something wrong and the theory
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.670
there was something wrong and the theory
proposed their solution and this is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
proposed their solution and this is
 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.319
proposed their solution and this is
where the theory is important and the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329
where the theory is important and the
 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.940
where the theory is important and the
particles is important as a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950
particles is important as a
 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.890
particles is important as a
manifestation of

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900
manifestation of
 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.430
manifestation of
so all coordinates get the masses from

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440
so all coordinates get the masses from
 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.860
so all coordinates get the masses from
the Higgs field the Higgs field theory

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870
the Higgs field the Higgs field theory
 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.200
the Higgs field the Higgs field theory

there's also the question why the Higgs

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.020
there's also the question why the Higgs
 

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.330
there's also the question why the Higgs
is so light maybe there are more more

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:04.340
is so light maybe there are more more
 

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.640
is so light maybe there are more more
Higgs particle maybe this is just one of

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:06.650
Higgs particle maybe this is just one of
 

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.500
Higgs particle maybe this is just one of
them and are more to be found

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.510
them and are more to be found
 

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.230

so today the belief is that the standard

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240
so today the belief is that the standard
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.480
so today the belief is that the standard
model is a low-energy approximation of a

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:13.490
model is a low-energy approximation of a
 

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.000
model is a low-energy approximation of a
more complete theory and this whole

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.010
more complete theory and this whole
 

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.310
more complete theory and this whole
complete theory is what particle physics

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320
complete theory is what particle physics
 

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.650
complete theory is what particle physics
is after now so there are various

possible extension of the standard model

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:26.270
possible extension of the standard model
 

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.920
possible extension of the standard model
those are people speaking of extra

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:29.930
those are people speaking of extra

eventually show which theory is the

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:53.189
eventually show which theory is the
 

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:55.670
eventually show which theory is the
right one
