It's clear that the vpn to ppn mapping is in the guest operating system. Now

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.930
the question is, where should this ppn to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.920
mpn mapping be kept. In a fully virtualized

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.830
setting. Should it be in the guest operating

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.770
system. Or should it be in the hypervisor.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.460
And simirerly. In the context of a para

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.250
virtualized system, where should the mapping be between

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.950
PPN and MPN? Should it be in the guest operating system or in the hypervisor?
