University gas prices were really high
and that definitely pushes down consumer

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

several firms big firms are entering
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.720
several firms big firms are entering
their fiscal year and I think that that

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
their fiscal year and I think that that
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519
their fiscal year and I think that that
has a lot to do with their hiring

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
has a lot to do with their hiring
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.649
has a lot to do with their hiring

out of the labor force are likely to

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089
out of the labor force are likely to
 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.269
out of the labor force are likely to
enter back into the labor force as the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
enter back into the labor force as the
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.549
enter back into the labor force as the
economy gets moving and when you see

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559
economy gets moving and when you see
 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:29.929
economy gets moving and when you see
that you can actually see the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
that you can actually see the
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479
that you can actually see the
unemployment rate tick up it's very very

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
unemployment rate tick up it's very very
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.540
unemployment rate tick up it's very very
common I think that with graduations a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
common I think that with graduations a
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790
common I think that with graduations a
lot of students entered into the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
lot of students entered into the
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.279
lot of students entered into the
workforce and didn't have jobs and you

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289
workforce and didn't have jobs and you
 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.200
workforce and didn't have jobs and you
tend to see unemployment rate took up

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
tend to see unemployment rate took up
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209
tend to see unemployment rate took up
when that happens as well no I actually

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
when that happens as well no I actually
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.619
when that happens as well no I actually
don't think it'll be a long-term trend I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
don't think it'll be a long-term trend I
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180
don't think it'll be a long-term trend I
think we're going to see tick up this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
think we're going to see tick up this
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279
think we're going to see tick up this
month and I think it's going to stay

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
month and I think it's going to stay
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.560
month and I think it's going to stay
constant but it's going to be decreasing

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
constant but it's going to be decreasing
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.259
constant but it's going to be decreasing
throughout the rest of the summer and I

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269
throughout the rest of the summer and I
 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.759
throughout the rest of the summer and I
think it we're going to start seeing so

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769
think it we're going to start seeing so
 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.319
think it we're going to start seeing so
much lower unemployment rates as we get

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
much lower unemployment rates as we get
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110
much lower unemployment rates as we get
into early fall I think that we're

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
into early fall I think that we're
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.220
into early fall I think that we're
moving in the right direction even

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
moving in the right direction even
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.779
moving in the right direction even
though we unemployment rate he's ticked

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
though we unemployment rate he's ticked
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609
though we unemployment rate he's ticked
up a little bit the overall trend has

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
up a little bit the overall trend has
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620
up a little bit the overall trend has
been a downward trend and people get way

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
been a downward trend and people get way
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380
been a downward trend and people get way
too wrapped up in looking at one

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
too wrapped up in looking at one
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090
too wrapped up in looking at one
particular month rather than the overall

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
particular month rather than the overall
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.219
particular month rather than the overall
trend or what was happening during that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
trend or what was happening during that
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530
trend or what was happening during that
month our economy has been growing our

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
month our economy has been growing our
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060
month our economy has been growing our
economy has actually been doing very

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
economy has actually been doing very
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.330
economy has actually been doing very
well we have had very nagging and high

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
well we have had very nagging and high
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600
well we have had very nagging and high
unemployment but I think that one of the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
unemployment but I think that one of the
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.249
unemployment but I think that one of the
reasons for that has been firms have

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
reasons for that has been firms have
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.560
reasons for that has been firms have
been able to be profitable while running

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
been able to be profitable while running
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.359
been able to be profitable while running
very lean and they haven't had a need to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
very lean and they haven't had a need to
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.880
very lean and they haven't had a need to
hire workers and I still think that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
hire workers and I still think that
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130
hire workers and I still think that
they're substituting technology for

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
they're substituting technology for
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499
they're substituting technology for
labor and so even though the economy is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
labor and so even though the economy is
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.569
labor and so even though the economy is
strong unemployment is going to stay

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
strong unemployment is going to stay
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.029
strong unemployment is going to stay
high if you look at other indicators of

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039
high if you look at other indicators of
 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.730
high if you look at other indicators of
economic growth things like changes in

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
economic growth things like changes in
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910
economic growth things like changes in
the real GDP profitability of major

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
the real GDP profitability of major
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.920
the real GDP profitability of major
companies the ability of our car

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
companies the ability of our car
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010
companies the ability of our car
manufacturers to pay back their loans

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
manufacturers to pay back their loans
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.810
manufacturers to pay back their loans
that all of those point to a very strong

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
that all of those point to a very strong
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.999
that all of those point to a very strong
and robust economy yeah I think it's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
and robust economy yeah I think it's
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.490
and robust economy yeah I think it's
more positive than negative I think that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
more positive than negative I think that
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.029
more positive than negative I think that
we have shown that some industries are

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039
we have shown that some industries are
 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.429
we have shown that some industries are
based in in the united states have been

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
based in in the united states have been
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.880
based in in the united states have been
profitable have actually worked to put

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
profitable have actually worked to put
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.340

together a good business model and are
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.809
together a good business model and are
actually moving in that too

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
actually moving in that too
 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.850
