00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.809
Ask any movie fan to name a specific breed
of big screen adventure, and action is sure

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.100
to be among the first.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.770
Providing audiences with memorable heroes
and grand escapism, action movies have entertained

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.280
moviegoers time and time again, establishing
too many beloved characters and franchises

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280
to count.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.410
But which ones stand out from the rest?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.290
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 best action movies
ever made.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.340
Raiders of the Lost Ark

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.370
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg teamed up
to deliver a thrilling homage to film serials

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.340
of the ’30s and ’40s with this sweeping
adventure.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.000
Harrison Ford was perfectly cast as the lead,
injecting Indiana Jones with the same charm

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.540
and roguish attitude that made Han Solo a
fan-favorite.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.800
The action sequences were brilliantly crafted,
as everything from Ford’s truck stunt to

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.500
the airplane fight made good on the film’s
tagline of hailing the return of “the great

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
adventure.”

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.750
It also didn’t hurt that the villains Indy
faced were tenacious and terrifying.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.000
More than deserving of its Best Picture nomination,
Raiders is the definition of a timeless adventure

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.980
classic.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.980
First Blood

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.429
Though the Rambo series is now known for over-the-top
action, the franchise was born from humble

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.090
beginnings.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.789
In the first installment, John Rambo is simply
a Vietnam veteran trying to return to American

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.880
society when he is accused of being a troublesome
drifter by an abusive sheriff.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.859
Scarred and traumatized from his time overseas,
Rambo snaps and enters a fight for his life.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.430
Raw and authentic, First Blood features one
of Sylvester Stallone’s finest performances,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.649
filled with deep psychological subtext as
well as action.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.810
The film also raised serious questions about
how we treat our war veterans, giving it strong

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.759
substance to go with the spectacle.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.759
Lethal Weapon

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.319
One of the films that helped create the modern
buddy-cop subgenre, Lethal Weapon is one of

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.609
the most elite examples ever offered.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.889
A lion’s share of the credit goes to the
irresistible pairing of Mel Gibson and Danny

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.700
Glover, whose chemistry helped create one
of Hollywood’s greatest dynamic duos.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.430
More than the action, this film’s key strength
is the characters, who were just as entertaining

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.150
to watch bickering as they were in a gunfight.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.090
The mixture of Gibson’s loose cannon and
Glover’s by-the-books family man gave way

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.070
to a lasting friendship, rewarding audiences
with a heartwarming ending to a thrilling

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.720
ride.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.500
Die Hard

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.960
Arguably the best example of an action movie
in its purest form, Die Hard still holds up

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.310
more than 25 years after its release.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.670
The movie was noteworthy for painting John
McClane as a vulnerable action hero, and not

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.060
an invincible superhero.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.140
Every hit the New York cop took drew blood,
and forced him to push through more adversity

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.170
– to the point where he – and the audience
– believed he wasn’t making it out alive.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.300
We’d be crazy to not praise Hans Gruber,
one of the action genre’s most iconic villains,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.790
never slipping out of control, and able to
inspire feari in nearly anyone.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.930
Between great characters and standout set
pieces, Die Hard is required Holiday viewing.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.980
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.770
James Cameron upped the ante considerably
with his sequel to The Terminator and didn’t

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.770
disappoint.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.790
T2 was a watershed moment for the film industry,
pioneering CGI technology with the frightening

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.240
T-1000 and ushering in a new age of Hollywood
special effects.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.880
The director proved he was at the top of his
craft by helming nail-biting action sequences

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.281
that constantly escalated from one scene to
the next.

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:31.850
The film also had a powerful narrative and
themes about fate and friendship, centering

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.650
on the young John Connor and the Terminator
sent back in time to protect him.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.830
Even now, it’s hard not to shed a tear when
Arnold sacrifices himself with a final thumbs-up.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.280
Point Break

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.790
Forget the remake: the original tale of Johnny
Utah is where it’s at.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.352
Adrenaline filled and action packed, Point
Break introduced the masses to action star

00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:56.360
Keanu Reeves and paired the laid back actor
with the charismatic Patrick Swayze to give

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.620
audiences a strong and complex relationship.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.569
The FBI agent struggling to fit in while going
undercover gave the film an interesting and

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.910
uncommon angle, capitalizing on the audience’s
unwillingness to see Swayze as an unlikable

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.910
“villain.”

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.680
Aside from the thrilling sequences on land,
the ocean, and in the air, director Kathryn

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.810
Bigelow showed that a woman could deliver
testosterone-fueled drama as well as – or

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.950
better than – her male competitors.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.740
Bad Boys

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.569
Michael Bay may divide fans these days, but
his career got off to a rousing start.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.020
Combining a slick visual style with the energetic
coupling of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.310
Bad Boys instantly became one of the absolute
standout buddy cop flicks.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.099
The chemistry between the two stars was entertaining
to watch, and Bay made it clear that few directors

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.159
had his eye for large-scale action.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:48.560
Though the story didn’t reinvent the wheel,
it was still a blast to see it all unfold,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.990
with unexpected comedy, unforgettable set
pieces, and a killer soundtrack.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.660
Is it any wonder why people are begging for
a third instalment?

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.520
The Matrix

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.860
Equal parts creative and groundbreaking, the
Wachowskis gave a generation of moviegoers

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.389
one of their defining sci-fi films with this
tale of man vs. machine.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.439
The directors raised the bar for visual effects,
introducing moviegoers to the awe-inspiring

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.080
possibilities of bullet time, allowing them
to break convention and deliver something

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.449
never before seen.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.900
The movie also had great substance to go with
that style, giving Neo a great character arc

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.229
and rounding out the cast with talented actors
like Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving.

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.499
The Matrix inspired countless imitators, but
we never get tired of watching the pioneers

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:31.900
at their best.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.759
The Bourne Ultimatum

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.789
One of the few franchises that got better
with each installment, Paul Greengrass and

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.029
Matt Damon exceeded all expectations with
this trilogy finale.

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.349
Further developing his mastery of the “shaky
cam” aesthetic, the filmmaker incorporated

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.220
real stunts into his techniques, giving us
tense fights that always hit home.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.580
It also didn’t hurt that the talented cast
gave honest and compelling performances, with

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.279
David Strathairn proving a slimy and worthwhile
adversary for our hero.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.860
Unpacking more about Bourne’s past also
gave this film some dramatic heft to compliment

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860
the action.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.770
Fans can’t wait to see Matt Damon return
to the role, and given his send-off, it’s

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.949
easy to see why.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.669
The Raid: Redemption

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.490
In an age of CGI heavy tentpoles, The Raid
was a much-needed breath of fresh air.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.270
Director Gareth Evans combined the sheer awesomeness
of the spotlighted Indonesian martial arts

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.629
style, and revolutionary camerawork that immersed
viewers into the fights, giving audiences

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.729
one of the best crafted action films in recent
memory.

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.909
Evans also ramped up the tension by blending
in elements of a survival horror film with

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.979
villains that rival some of Hollywood’s
most notorious evildoers.

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.330
Inventive, jaw dropping, and a sheer delight
to see on-screen The Raid transcends the genre

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.439
and is a must-see for any movie fan.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.650
It’s just that good.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.490
Those are our picks for the best action movies
ever made.
