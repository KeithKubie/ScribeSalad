in the middle of an assessment I had
 

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.120
in the middle of an assessment I had
engineers in we were gonna look at all

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.130
engineers in we were gonna look at all

the systems somebody just whispered this

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200
the systems somebody just whispered this
 

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.290
the systems somebody just whispered this
in my ear all right I can get on the

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:56.300
in my ear all right I can get on the
 

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.700
in my ear all right I can get on the
plane home I know everything I need to

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:57.710
plane home I know everything I need to
 

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.890
plane home I know everything I need to
know about the system which I'll talk

00:18:59.890 --> 00:18:59.900
know about the system which I'll talk
 

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.200
know about the system which I'll talk
about the site and the company's

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.210
about the site and the company's
 

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.780
about the site and the company's
leadership right this happened to be an

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:04.790
leadership right this happened to be an

ammonia refrigeration system in a
 

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.710
ammonia refrigeration system in a
manufacturing site we would all use

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720
manufacturing site we would all use
 

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.770
manufacturing site we would all use
ammonia in our homes except it's deadly

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:10.780
ammonia in our homes except it's deadly
 

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.860
ammonia in our homes except it's deadly
and these guys disagreed on how to run

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:14.870
and these guys disagreed on how to run
 

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.990

that deadly system over a 24-hour period

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000
that deadly system over a 24-hour period
 

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.570
that deadly system over a 24-hour period
and they these are these were old guys

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:19.580
and they these are these were old guys
 

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.700
and they these are these were old guys
like me that just weren't enough for a

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:21.710
like me that just weren't enough for a
 

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.610
like me that just weren't enough for a
change and it took a while to to get a

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:24.620
change and it took a while to to get a
 

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.010
change and it took a while to to get a
handle on this and I'll just do a quick

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.020
handle on this and I'll just do a quick
 

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.200
handle on this and I'll just do a quick
quick ammonia sidebar and one of my

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.210
quick ammonia sidebar and one of my
 

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.500
quick ammonia sidebar and one of my
tours of an ammonia plant with it these

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:32.510
tours of an ammonia plant with it these
 

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.930
tours of an ammonia plant with it these
are all old guys no gender bias here

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:34.940
are all old guys no gender bias here
 

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.240
are all old guys no gender bias here
just let's be honest about what happens

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.250
just let's be honest about what happens
 

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.890
just let's be honest about what happens
in factories of America burnt out given

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:41.900
in factories of America burnt out given

the tour we're up in the kind of the

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320
the tour we're up in the kind of the
 

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.170
the tour we're up in the kind of the
depths of the mechanical system and we

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:47.180
depths of the mechanical system and we
 

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.760
depths of the mechanical system and we
all started to smell ammonia which is

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:48.770
all started to smell ammonia which is
 

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:49.570
all started to smell ammonia which is
not good

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:49.580
not good
 

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.120
not good
and so our tour guide who owned the

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.130
and so our tour guide who owned the
 

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.120
and so our tour guide who owned the
system looked saw from our faces that we

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.130
system looked saw from our faces that we
 

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.650

something was wrong is that you guys are

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:56.660
something was wrong is that you guys are
 

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.870
something was wrong is that you guys are
smelling ammonia yeah we're smell

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880
smelling ammonia yeah we're smell
 

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.230
smelling ammonia yeah we're smell
ammonia I worked here so long I can't

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240
ammonia I worked here so long I can't
 

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.260
ammonia I worked here so long I can't
smell it anymore right so these are the

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.270
smell it anymore right so these are the
 

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.480
smell it anymore right so these are the
things I'm alert to in trying to go out

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:07.490
things I'm alert to in trying to go out
 

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:08.800
things I'm alert to in trying to go out
and make sure these systems are run

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:08.810
and make sure these systems are run
 

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.620
and make sure these systems are run
properly but but this is my favorite now

coming out of that question there's this

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:33.590
coming out of that question there's this
 

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.530
coming out of that question there's this
issue of you know how do you get to know

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:35.540
issue of you know how do you get to know
