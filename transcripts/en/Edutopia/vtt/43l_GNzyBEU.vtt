00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.696
&gt;&gt;I made this in color.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.786
The wall, and the letters
in red to kind

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.236
of represent the blood that's
been spilled over there.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they are
presenting their portfolio

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:17.016
of artwork..

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:18.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: See, the
pressure launches this out.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:22.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or using a spud gun to
test a projectile motion equation

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.096
for a pre-calculus project,

00:00:24.186 --> 00:00:24.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Before we shoot it,

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:26.656
we're able to calculate
how far it's going to go.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep North
Central students do things

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:30.666
with the knowledge they acquire.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:33.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's close,
that's close.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.356
&gt;&gt;Michelle: In terms of
ensuring rigor, it's a question

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:40.716
that we've always struggled with,
and I hope we always continue

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:44.316
to struggle with, because I
never want any of our instructors

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:47.646
to be satisfied with the level
of rigor, I want us always

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:50.676
to be thinking of ways that we
can push the kids more and more.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And if this is where
Christopher Columbus landed,

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.706
then what can we guess,
or what can we assume?

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep North Central's
recipe for academic rigor includes,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:03.346
integration of core subjects
to deepen understanding,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:07.146
inquiry based project learning
to show real world relevance,

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:10.856
assess student work in a
holistic and comprehensive way,

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:15.096
and empower the students to become
self-reflective critical thinkers.

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:23.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: At 90 and 270, if you have
a quarter moon, it shouldn't look

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.356
like a crescent at all,
it should look like--

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:27.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In sixth and seventh
grades, core subjects are integrated.

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:31.466
Math, science a technology
are team taught in one block,

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:34.986
while language arts and
humanities are taught in another.

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:39.936
&gt;&gt;Luis: Hi, my name is Lou Salazar,
and this is a project that we did.

00:01:39.936 --> 00:01:41.096
It's called books of hope.

00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:43.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In a cross-curricular
arts and humanities project,

00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:47.156
seventh graders researched,
wrote and published books

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:51.166
on their favorite subjects to ship
to a sponsored school in Uganda.

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.356
&gt;&gt;Luis: And here I have,
in order, all the process

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.766
that I took, to make this book.

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:57.756
&gt;&gt;Katie: We taught them
how to write nonfiction,

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:00.116
and this took about a month
and a half, where they went

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:01.276
through this writing process.

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:04.126
The whole time, we kept reminding
them, you know, why we're doing this,

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.106
and what these books are
going to be used for,

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.166
and we found that the kids
were just incredibly motivated.

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:13.116
They really, really latched onto this
vision that we had, and they wanted

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.466
to make them perfect, because
they knew that kids were going

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.646
to be learning from them.

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:21.156
&gt;&gt;Luis: And I really didn't want
to focus on one specific culture,

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:24.136
because I thought it was better
for people to relate to it

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.976
if I made it, and a lot of cultures.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.586
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We're a project based
school, so the students are asked

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.976
to do things that are going to really
challenge them to think critically.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:36.286
&gt;&gt;Luis: And we had to revise
it ourselves, and then we had

00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:36.816
to give it to the teacher.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It excites them, so
they always talk about projects

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:43.756
and they're really
excited to do them,

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:44.886
because of those relevant
connections.

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:48.596
&gt;&gt;Luis: It's a good thing to do, like
to do service, help other people,

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:51.136
not because they tell you
to, it's good, because, like,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:56.086
you want someone, like, for example,
these books, I really put effort

00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:01.746
on it, I didn't put a lot of effort
for the grade, I put a lot of effort

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:02.896
so the kids in Uganda could learn.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:08.916
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Okay, I need you to
take out your rubrics quickly.

00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:12.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep uses a
variety of assessment tools

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:13.796
to track student progress.

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.626
&gt;&gt;Student: I wrote three sonnets.

00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:18.096
&gt;&gt;Rachel: The piece
that we're working on is

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.866
to make a literary analysis paper, so
that was kind of the main assessment,

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:24.606
but then we also had some
creative outlets for them,

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:27.926
where they created their own sonnets,
or a lot of people made poems,

00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:31.296
or raps, or you know, just
visual representations,

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:34.026
just to show their
artistic expression.

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:35.186
&gt;&gt;Student: What means
the world to you?

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:37.616
Being lost for a guy, or
being lost for a girl.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:41.416
To the world, you just mean somebody,
but to somebody you mean the world.

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:44.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To empower students to
take charge of their own learning,

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:48.246
the grading process is
completely transparent.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:51.356
The students are given
assessment rubrics at the beginning

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.506
of each project, so the
expectations are clear.

00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:56.756
&gt;&gt;Kristy: You can get a
just beginning, which is,

00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:58.526
you didn't put effort in it,

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:01.026
and you just slacked off
during the whole time.

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:05.106
Approaching, is when
you put some effort,

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:07.746
but it's like she could tell
you did it at the last minute.

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:11.726
Meets, is you met her expectations
on what she wanted you to do.

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:15.846
You did a very good job, and Exceeds,
is, you went above and beyond, like,

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:18.636
you created something that she
didn't even tell you to create.

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:20.316
It's really easy to get an exceeds,

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:22.036
because you already know
what's expected from you.

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:24.066
&gt;&gt;Student: The other AOI
I chose was environment.

00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:27.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Performance
assessment is used in every grade,

00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:29.116
so by the time they
reach high school,

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:32.126
YES Prep students are
experienced presenters.

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:35.596
&gt;&gt;Katie: To have them actually
verbally articulate their learning,

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.316
I think is a hugely important skill,
and one that our seventh graders

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:43.186
and sixth graders really need
to practice, so they feel sort

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.886
of the importance of, like, oh, you
know, my parents are going to come,

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:48.046
and ask me questions, and
other teachers are going

00:04:48.046 --> 00:04:49.046
to ask me questions.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:52.016
And so they tend to be a little
more motivated about the project,

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.446
so that they're more prepared.

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:56.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Please just
really give a lot of thought

00:04:56.286 --> 00:04:58.456
and introspect into this.

00:04:58.456 --> 00:05:01.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each spring, all students
must not only defend their knowledge

00:05:01.576 --> 00:05:05.156
of the core content, but prove
that they are adding value

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:06.676
to the school and the community.

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:08.566
&gt;&gt;Student: Like, math
has always taught me

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:10.866
that there's always more
ways to solve one problem.

00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:12.816
And I can relate that to life.

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:14.816
&gt;&gt;Michelle: They're
asked to think critically

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:17.666
about what they've learned, the
skills that they've acquired,

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:21.016
and then, on top of that, we want
them to think about themselves

00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:23.266
as people, and how they've changed.

00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:24.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Comparing it to
the beginning of the year,

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:27.576
I think I've improved
my communication.

00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:30.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Critical thinking is
a key skill for college readiness,

00:05:31.126 --> 00:05:34.806
and every person in the building is
working towards getting every student

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:35.576
into college.

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:36.966
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So you have
to work a little harder?

00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:37.546
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:38.026
And--

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:38.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And you do.

00:05:38.856 --> 00:05:39.236
&gt;&gt;Student: And I do.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:42.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But the hard work is
carried out with joy and passion.

00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:46.226
&gt;&gt;But the school is serious
and fun at the same time,

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:49.616
because we have awesome teachers, who
make class fun, and put a whole bunch

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:53.836
of work into the lessons and
make sure you get it deep

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:56.166
through your head, and make sure
that you have fun with it, too.

00:05:56.726 --> 00:06:00.996
&gt;&gt;Luis: They prepare us for
college, so like, it's really hard.

00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:03.226
It's really hard, like,
they're very challenging.

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:06.406
I really like it, because they
really care about your education,

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.816
and it's a good experience
being at YES.

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:11.886
