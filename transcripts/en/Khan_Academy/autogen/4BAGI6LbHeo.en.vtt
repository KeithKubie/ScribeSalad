00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.814
 When we first learn about the cells 

00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:03.972
 due to the images we see 

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:06.365
 in textbooks or even in some micro-pictures 

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:07.929
 under a microscope 

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.774
 imagine the cells as small bubbles 

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.048
 with a liquid around which various things swim. 

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.442
 This here 

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.346
 is a common image in textbooks 

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:20.111
 cross-section of a cell, 

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.481
 in which we see all its important parts. 

00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.966
 We can see the kernel. 

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.684
 We also see the endoplasmic network. 

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:27.331
 Like the Golgi Apparatus. 

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:29.120
 Here is the mitochondria. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.466
 In the way it is painted, 

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.535
 they seem to swim in an intracellular fluid. 

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.414
 They seem to swim in the intracellular fluid. 

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:37.826
 It is true that the cage contains plenty of water. 

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.358
 Even our bodies consist mainly of water. 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.771
 A large amount of that water contained in you is in the cage. 

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.652
 It turns out that in these types of drawings 

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:48.926
 is missing a very important part of the structure of the cell. 

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:51.061
 There is no intracellular fluid. 

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:54.823
 Intracellular fluid. 

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:57.331
 This is still something, 

00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.118
 which we are trying to understand better. How the intracellular fluid works 

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:00.465
 and how it helps 

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.460
 the cell, its structure, and how things are moving 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.084
 and shapes them. 

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:07.082
 "Cytoskeleton" is one word, 

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.986
 but I have written the different parts of the word 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.119
 with different colors, because the word itself literally means 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.536
 "Cell skeleton". 

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.578
 If I try to actually represent 

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:17.786
 this intracellular fluid 

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:19.852
 I will have all these structures. 

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:21.269
 I will use another color. 

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:23.965
 I have all these structures that cross the cell, 

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.028
 in different ways that have proteins, 

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:27.816
 related issues. They move 

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.558
 and grow, and so can 

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:30.997
 to help the cell move or help through 

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:32.971
 transferring things inside the cage. 

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.828
 and other things to attach to them. 

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.452
 That is why it is very, very, very much 

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:39.769
 more complicated than that, 

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.509
 which is depicted in this drawing. 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.063
 before I have the opportunity to write on top of it. 

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.387
 To help us imagine it, 

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:47.941
 I found this picture. 

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.172
 Here's a photo for public. 

00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:50.543
 I find it charming because it really helps 

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.328
 to understand the complexity, 

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:55.929
 which undergoes even one of the cells in your body. 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.272
 So let's look at some of the structures here. 

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:04.406
 This thing I'm following here, 

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:09.860
 is called microfilament. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.391
 This is a microfilament. 

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.668
 Let me write it down. 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.477
 So here's a microfilament. 

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:20.555
 Just to get an idea of ​​its scale, 

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.781
 its diameter - that diameter 

00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:25.800
 is about 6 or 7 nm. 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.677
 So, approximately 6 or 7 nm 

00:02:29.677 --> 00:02:32.603
 6 or 7 billion per meter. 

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:34.090
 To gain some insight into how this looks, 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.993
 when referring to the cell, 

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:41.079
 the regular cell may be 6 to 7 μm 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.936
 of diameter, even more. 

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:45.373
 This is essentially one thousandth 

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.579
 of the cell diameter. 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.319
 What I draw here, 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.175
 actually does not go so far in scale. 

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:54.638
 Even, maybe I would like to paint it even thinner. 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.868
 So you will not see her often 

00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:59.167
 in these diagrams because you will have to draw it very thinly. 

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.860
 The diameter of one of these filaments is approximately, 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.091
 of the order 

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:08.175
 of one thousandth of the diameter of an ordinary cell. 

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:09.661
 These things, however, are extremely important. 

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:11.731
 They help build a cell structure. 

00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:15.222
 They are made of actin proteins. 

00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:16.197
 You can see 

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:17.705
 there are such two actins, 

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:20.608
 you can imagine them as ropes, 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.187
 wrapped around each other. 

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:24.881
 The protein involved here. 

00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:25.832
 Let me change the color. 

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:27.550
 I use it too often. 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.126
 The protein found in microfilaments is actin. 

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:34.447
 It's actin. 

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:35.909
 What is important about these microfilaments is, 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.070
 that in the cage, as I have already mentioned, 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.139
 help build a structure. 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.161
 They help in doing many things. 

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.737
 In fact, they can be dynamic, 

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:43.294
 somewhat destroyed and built. 

00:03:43.294 --> 00:03:44.548
 Their lengths can change. 

00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:48.169
 This can help the cell move and even more - 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.701
 you can use them. 

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.234
 You can carry things between them. 

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:52.674
 You can pull them. 

00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:54.368
 There is a fascinating interaction 

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.689
 between the actin and what you see here. 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.197
 This is it 

00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:01.961
 made from myosin. 

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.238
 This is myosin. 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.165
 Let me write it. 

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:06.396
 It's hard to see. 

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:07.742
 This is myosin. 

00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:09.019
 The link to the actin is that myosin 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.784
 The link to the actin is that myosin 

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:14.569
 plays the role of something that shoots myosin. 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.497
 They can move together. 

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:18.980
 This is important for muscle contraction. 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.980
 It is remarkable to see, 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.115
 that even the proteins, 

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:23.949
 which are composed of a bunch of amino acids, 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.689
 can interact in these relatively complex ways 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.778
 and that you can have these myosines, 

00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:33.608
 who hit and move the actin. 

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:35.745
 This is myosin here. 

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.368
 We see ribosomes. 

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:40.064
 These ribosomes are the same ribosomes, 

00:04:40.064 --> 00:04:41.596
 which are not attached to the endoplasmic network. 

00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:44.243
 Here are free ribosomes. 

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:46.750
 So, you see how complicated it is. 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.656
 You can say, "Okay 

00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:52.370
 I see these microfilaments made of actin. 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.598
 I see one I have emphasized. 

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:55.899
 There are others here. 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.476
 I see another one there. 

00:04:58.476 --> 00:05:00.519
 I see one here too. 

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:04.350
 What, however, are these large, pipe-like structures, 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.000
 which we also see? 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.137
 For example, 

00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:08.322
 what is this? 

00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:10.387
 What are these trumpet-like structures? 

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:13.843
 Well they are called microtubules. 

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:18.112
 And so - microtubules. 

00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:21.562
 They look enormous compared to microfilaments. 

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:24.928
 However, they are relatively small on the cellular scale. 

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:26.901
 The microtubule is about 25 nm. 

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:31.947
 Again, they play an important role 

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:33.120
 in the cell structure. 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.675
 They allow some things to be arranged 

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:35.789
 and some things to be carried. 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.810
 They are also dynamic particles of the cell. 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.038
 They can be both built and destroyed. 

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:43.382
 They can also form the cell itself. 

00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.403
 In animal cells - 

00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:46.214
 the things I have described can be found in most cells, 

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:47.445
 but in animal cells 

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:49.906
 you will also find things called intermedia filaments. 

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:52.067
 In size are located midway between these two, 

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:55.410
 which also helps maintain form and other things. 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.870
 The purpose of this video 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.635
 is to make you appreciate more things. 

00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:01.470
 Maybe all the other videos we have about the cage, 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.536
 make you appreciate what beauty 

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.858
 and what complexity they have, 

00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:07.599
 which very often in everyday life 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.526
 we consider it as ordinary as a cage. 

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:11.896
 There are so many aspects of the beauty and complexity of the structure and, 

00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:13.892
 that it is often not described 

00:06:13.892 --> 00:06:15.842
 in the drawings of the cell, 

00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:18.072
 which you can find in your text books. 

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:19.860
 To appreciate it more 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.182
 Here are some publicly available images, 

00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:23.180
 which I found on cells you can see 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.524
 colored cytoskeleton. 

00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:28.055
 What you see in the picture, 

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.728
 in yellow-green color, 

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:32.327
 in fact, are cow lungs 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.903
 these yellow-green lines you see, 

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:37.413
 are microtubules. 

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:40.060
 And what you see in a pink or orange color 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.987
 are microfilaments. 

00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.355
 So you can appreciate how complex it is 

00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:47.675
 these things are structured, 

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.759
 which you looked like big spots.
