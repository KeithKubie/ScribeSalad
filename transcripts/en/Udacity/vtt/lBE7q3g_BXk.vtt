00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
To form the sum of these 2 vectors,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
take this vector and put its tail

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to the tip of this vector,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you'll see what's resulting--this vector.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So the last one is the right choice.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If I take twice this vector, I get this one.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
plus the negative of this one,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is this one,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and eventually, you'll see the first

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
choice is the right one.
