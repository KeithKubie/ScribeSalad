00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.978
- [Voiceover] Alright,
this problem is a classic,

00:00:01.978 --> 00:00:03.648
you're gonna see this in basically

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:05.617
every single physics text book.

00:00:05.617 --> 00:00:07.457
And the problem is this,
if you've got two masses

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:10.978
tied together by a rope, and
that rope passes over a pulley,

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.659
what's the acceleration of the masses?

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.826
In other words, what's the
acceleration of the 3 kg mass?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.961
And then what's the
acceleration of the 5 kg mass?

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:26.072
And if you're wondering
what the heck is a pulley?

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.027
The pulley is this part right here.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.027
This right here is the pulley.

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:33.498
So what a pulley does, a pulley
is a little piece of plastic

00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:35.788
or metal that can rotate.

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:38.258
And it's usually got a
groove in it so that a string

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.017
or a rope can pass over it.

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:44.149
What it does, is it rotates
freely so that you can turn

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.429
what's a horizontal tension on one side,

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.380
into a vertical tension on the other.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.912
Or vice versa.

00:00:49.912 --> 00:00:52.461
It turns vertical forces
into horizontal forces.

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.342
It allows you to transfer
a force from one direction

00:00:55.342 --> 00:00:56.741
to another direction.

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:58.793
So that's what these
pulleys are useful for.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.263
And if they can spin
freely, and if this pulley

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:03.954
has basically no mass,
if there's no resistance

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:07.161
to motion at all, then
this tension on this side

00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:10.542
is gonna be equal to the
tension on this side.

00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:14.092
This vertical tension gets
transferred fully undiluted,

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.459
into a horizontal tension
and these tension values

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:20.898
will just be the same if
this pulley can spin freely.

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:22.878
And if its mass is really small so that

00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:26.926
there's no inertial reason
why it doesn't wanna spin.

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:28.398
So that's the problem.

00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:30.459
Let's say you wanted to figure this out.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.899
What is the acceleration of the 3 kg mass

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.528
with the acceleration of the 5 kg mass?

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:38.949
Now, I've gotta warn you,
there's an easy way to do this,

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:40.616
and a hard way to do this.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:43.376
Now, I'm gonna show
you the hard way first.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:46.034
Sorry, no one ever wants to hear that.

00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:50.495
But, the reason is that, the
easy way won't make any sense

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:51.975
unless I show you the hard way first.

00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:54.436
It won't make any sense why
the easy way works unless

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:56.074
I show you the hard way.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.045
And for two, the hard way
isn't really all that hard.

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:00.186
So I'm calling it the hard way,

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.936
but it's not really that bad.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.185
And for three, sometimes teachers
and professors just wanna

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:05.944
see you do it the hard
way, so you should know how

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:07.186
to do this.

00:02:07.186 --> 00:02:08.019
So what do we do?

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.946
We wanna find acceleration,
well you know how

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.145
to find acceleration.

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:13.142
We're gonna use Newton's second law.

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:15.966
So we'll say that the
acceleration in a given direction

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.166
is gonna equal the net
force in that direction,

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.653
divided by the mass.

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:20.965
Now what do we do?

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:21.964
What mass are we gonna choose?

00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:23.824
We've got a couple masses here.

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:26.123
One thing we could do, let's
just pick the 5 kg mass.

00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:27.761
Just pick one of them.

00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:30.703
So I'm gonna say that the
acceleration of the 5 kg mass

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:34.613
is the net force on the 5
kg mass, divided by the mass

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.313
of the 5 kg mass.

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:38.845
And remember, we should always
pick a direction as well.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:40.694
So do we wanna pick the vertical direction

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.403
or the horizontal direction?

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.984
Well, since this box is gonna
be accelerating horizontally,

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:47.361
and that's what we're interested
in, I'm gonna put one more

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.843
sub-script up here, X, to
let us know we're picking

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:52.025
the horizontal direction.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.814
So I can fill this out
now, I can plug stuff in.

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:58.614
The acceleration of the 5
kg mass in the X direction

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:00.474
is gonna be equal to.

00:03:00.474 --> 00:03:02.695
Alright what forces do we
have to figure out what goes

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:03.923
up here?

00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:06.091
You always draw a force diagram.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.242
So what forces do I have on the 5 kg mass?

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:10.375
I'm gonna have a force
of gravity, I'll draw

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:11.933
that straight down.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:14.923
FG, and there's gonna be an equal force,

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.821
normal force upward.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:19.532
So this normal force up
should be equal to the force

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:23.113
of gravity and magnitude
because this box is probably not

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:24.823
gonna be accelerating vertically.

00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:26.283
There's no real reason why it should be

00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:28.172
if this table is rigid.

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:30.323
And there's one more force on this box.

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:31.981
There's a force to the right.

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:34.012
That's gonna be the force of tension.

00:03:34.012 --> 00:03:36.131
And if there's no friction on this table,

00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.259
then I have no leftward forces here.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.722
I'm ignoring air resistance since

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:42.444
we usually ignore air resistance.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:43.695
So that's is, the only horizontal force

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:45.675
I've got is T, tension.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:50.606
And I divide by the mass of
the 5 kg box, which is 5 kg.

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.944
But we got a problem.

00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:54.994
Look it, we don't know the
acceleration of the 5 kg mass,

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:56.115
and we don't know the tension.

00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:58.065
I can't solve this.

00:03:58.065 --> 00:03:59.865
Normally what you do in
this case, is you go to

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.933
the vertical direction, the
other direction in other words.

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:04.204
But that's not gonna help me either.

00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:06.214
That's just gonna tell me
that the normal force is gonna

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:08.546
be equal to the force of gravity.

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:09.594
And we kind of already knew that.

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:10.894
So that doesn't help.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:12.035
So what do we do?

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:14.492
Well, you might note, this
is only the equation for

00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:16.096
the 5 kg mass.

00:04:16.096 --> 00:04:18.613
And so now I have to do
this for the 3 kg mass.

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:21.506
So let's come over here, let's
say that the acceleration

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:25.575
of the 3 kg mass is gonna
be equal to the net force

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:29.742
on the 3 kg mass, divided by
the mass of the 3 kg mass.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.104
And again, which direction should we pick?

00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:35.444
Well this acceleration over
here is gonna be vertical.

00:04:35.444 --> 00:04:37.813
So let's solve this for
the vertical direction.

00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:40.854
I'm gonna add one more
sub-script, Y, to remind myself.

00:04:40.854 --> 00:04:43.211
And you should do this too so
you remember which direction

00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:44.296
you're picking.

00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:46.894
So what forces do I plug in here?

00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:48.554
You figure that out with a force diagram.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:52.606
I'm gonna have a force of
gravity on this 3 kg mass,

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:55.363
and then I'm gonna have
the same size of friction,

00:04:55.363 --> 00:04:57.906
or sorry, the same as
tension, that I had over here.

00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.784
So the tension on this side
of the rope, it's gonna

00:04:59.784 --> 00:05:01.554
be the same as the tension on this side.

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:05.744
Assuming this pulley offers no
resistance either by its mass

00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:06.852
or friction.

00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:09.816
So assuming that its mass is
negligible, there's basically

00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:11.792
no friction, then I'm
gonna have a tension.

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:14.681
That tension is gonna be the same size.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.733
So I'll draw that coming upward.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.592
But it's not gonna be as big
as the force of gravity is

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:21.662
on this 3 kg mass.

00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:23.230
I've got the force of gravity here.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.163
This tension is gonna be
smaller, and the reason is,

00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:28.793
this 3 kg mass is accelerating downwards.

00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:30.691
So these forces can't be balanced.

00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:33.063
The upward force of tension
has gotta be smaller

00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:36.142
than the force of gravity
on this 3 kg mass.

00:05:36.142 --> 00:05:37.942
But this tension here should be the same

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:39.780
as this tension here.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.934
So I'll plug those in.

00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:41.863
So let's plug this in.

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:46.582
A of the 3 kg mass, in the Y
direction is gonna be equal to,

00:05:46.582 --> 00:05:48.434
I've got two vertical forces.

00:05:48.434 --> 00:05:50.324
I've got tension up, so
I'll make that positive,

00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:52.103
'cause we usually treat up as positive.

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:55.525
I've got gravity down, and
so I'm gonna have negative,

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:59.692
'cause it's downward force of
3 kg times the acceleration

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.783
on Earth, is 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:07.858
Now what do we do?

00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:10.112
We divide by 3 kg, 'cause that's the mass.

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:11.724
But I've still got a problem.

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:14.974
I don't know this
acceleration or this tension.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.737
So what do I do?

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:18.522
You might notice, if you're
clever you'll say wait,

00:06:18.522 --> 00:06:21.093
I've got my unknown on
this side is acceleration

00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:22.362
and tension.

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:24.924
My unknown on this side is
acceleration and tension.

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:27.223
It seems like I've got two
equations, two unknowns,

00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:28.841
maybe we should combine them.

00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:30.784
And that's exactly how you do these.

00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:34.244
So I've got tension in
both of these equations.

00:06:34.244 --> 00:06:35.962
Let me solve for tension over here,

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.483
where it's kind of simple.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:41.564
And I'll just get the tension equals 5 kg,

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:45.731
times the acceleration of the
5 kg mass in the X direction.

00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:48.402
So now I know what tension is.

00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:49.894
Tension is equal to this.

00:06:49.894 --> 00:06:51.714
And that tension over on
this side is the same as

00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:53.374
the tension on this side.

00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:56.405
So I can take this and
I can plug it in for

00:06:56.405 --> 00:06:57.842
this tension right here.

00:06:57.842 --> 00:06:59.383
And let's see what we get.

00:06:59.383 --> 00:07:02.443
We get that the acceleration
of the 3 kg mass vertically,

00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:06.313
is gonna equal, alright, I'm
gonna have a big mess on top,

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:07.522
what am I gonna get?

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:11.039
I'm gonna get, so T is the same as 5AX.

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.622
So I'll plug in 5 kg
times the acceleration

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.131
of the 5 kg mass in the X direction.

00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:21.253
And then I get all of
this stuff over here.

00:07:21.253 --> 00:07:24.586
So I'll get the rest of this right here.

00:07:27.383 --> 00:07:29.971
I'll just bring that down right there.

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:31.322
Alright, now what do I have?

00:07:31.322 --> 00:07:33.533
I've got 3 kg on the bottom
still, so I have to put

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:35.022
that here.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:36.511
Are we any better off?

00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:38.412
Yeah, we're better, because
now my only unknowns

00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:39.913
are acceleration.

00:07:39.913 --> 00:07:41.973
But these are not the same acceleration.

00:07:41.973 --> 00:07:43.831
Look, this acceleration
here is the acceleration of

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.473
the 3 kg mass, vertically.

00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:48.733
This acceleration here is the acceleration

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:51.622
of the 5kg mass horizontally.

00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:53.781
Now here's where I'm gonna
have to make an argument,

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.100
and some people don't like this.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.213
But, it's crucial to
figuring out this problem.

00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:03.043
And the key idea is this, if
this 3 kg mass moves down,

00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:06.233
let's say one meter, let's say
it moves downward one meter.

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:10.502
Well then this 5 kg mass had
better move forward one meter.

00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:14.281
Because if it doesn't, then it
didn't provide the one meter

00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:17.980
of rope that this 3 kg
mass needed to go downward.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.780
Which means either the rope
broke, or the rope stretched.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.654
And we're gonna assume that
our rope does not break

00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:25.114
or stretch.

00:08:25.114 --> 00:08:25.993
That's kind of a lie.

00:08:25.993 --> 00:08:29.023
All ropes are gonna stretch
a little bit under tension.

00:08:29.023 --> 00:08:31.911
We're gonna assume that
stretch is negligible.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.251
So the argument is that if
this 3 kg mass moves downward

00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:38.131
a certain amount, this 5
kg mass has to move forward

00:08:38.131 --> 00:08:41.010
by that same amount in order
to feed that amount of rope

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.731
for this 3 kg mass to go
downward by that amount.

00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:45.741
Otherwise, think about it.

00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:49.630
If this 5 kg mass just sat
here and the 3 kg moved,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.070
or the 3 kg moved farther
than the 5 kg mass,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.880
then this rope is stretching or breaking.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.359
So if you believe that,
if you don't believe it,

00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:57.839
pause it and think about it.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.101
'Cause you've gotta
convince yourself of that.

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.560
If you believe that then you
can also convince yourself

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.369
that, well if the 3 kg
mass was moving downward

00:09:04.369 --> 00:09:07.260
at a certain speed, let's
say two meters per second.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.140
Then the 5 kg mass had
better also be moving forward

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.300
two meters per second
because otherwise it wouldn't

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.972
be feeding rope at a
rate that this 3 kg needs

00:09:16.972 --> 00:09:18.641
to move downward at that rate.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.412
And finally, if you believe all that,

00:09:20.412 --> 00:09:22.452
it's not too much harder
to convince yourself that

00:09:22.452 --> 00:09:25.198
this 3 kg mass, no matter what

00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:27.880
its acceleration downward must be,

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.692
this 5 kg mass had better
have the same magnitude

00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:34.341
of acceleration forward
so that it's again,

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:36.420
feeding the rope so
this rope doesn't break,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.357
or snap, or stretch.

00:09:38.357 --> 00:09:40.586
'Cause we're gonna assume
the rope doesn't do that.

00:09:40.586 --> 00:09:44.915
So what I'm saying is that the
acceleration of the 3 kg mass

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:48.592
in the Y direction had
better equal the magnitude.

00:09:48.592 --> 00:09:50.327
So these magnitudes have to be the same.

00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:53.337
The sign doesn't have to be the same.

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:56.707
So this 3 kg mass has
a negative acceleration

00:09:56.707 --> 00:09:58.797
just 'cause it points
down, and we're assuming up

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:00.666
is positive, down is negative.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.897
This 5 kg mass has a
positive acceleration 'cause

00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:05.957
it's pointing to the right,
and we're assuming rightward

00:10:05.957 --> 00:10:08.477
is the positive horizontal direction.

00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:11.068
So, they can have different
signs, but the magnitudes

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:13.167
had better be the same so
that your feeding this rope at

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:16.217
a rate that the other one
needs in order to move.

00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:18.897
And so we can say that the
magnitudes are the same.

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:21.175
In this case, since one
is negative of the other,

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:23.755
I can say that the
acceleration of the 3 kg mass

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:28.355
vertically downward is gonna
be equal to, let's say negative

00:10:28.355 --> 00:10:33.075
of the acceleration of the 5
kg mass in the X direction.

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:34.596
I could have written it the other way.

00:10:34.596 --> 00:10:37.206
I could have wrote that A of the 5 kg mass

00:10:37.206 --> 00:10:40.477
in the X direction is a
negative A of the 3 kg mass

00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:41.365
in the Y direction.

00:10:41.365 --> 00:10:43.583
They're just different
by a negative sign is all

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:44.647
that's important here.

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:46.447
Okay, so this is the link we need.

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:47.324
This is it.

00:10:47.324 --> 00:10:49.425
So this allows us to put
this final equation here

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:51.358
in terms of only one variable.

00:10:51.358 --> 00:10:54.235
'Cause I know I've got A3Y
on this left hand side.

00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:56.985
I know A3Y should always be -A5X.

00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:02.002
If I take this and just plug
it in for A3Y right here,

00:11:02.986 --> 00:11:07.153
I'm gonna get -A5X =, well
all of this stuff, so I'll

00:11:10.014 --> 00:11:11.135
just copy this.

00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:12.766
Save some time.

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:14.545
Copy, paste.

00:11:14.545 --> 00:11:15.663
Just equals all of that.

00:11:15.663 --> 00:11:19.055
All I did was plug in what I
know A3Y has to be equal to.

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:22.094
'Cause now look, I've got one
equation with one unknown.

00:11:22.094 --> 00:11:24.077
I just need to solve for what A5X is.

00:11:24.077 --> 00:11:25.584
It's on both sides.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.097
So I'll need to combine
these and then isolate

00:11:28.097 --> 00:11:29.815
it on one side.

00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:31.566
So there's gonna be a
little bit of algebra here.

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:35.107
Let's just take this, let's
give ourselves some room.

00:11:35.107 --> 00:11:36.816
Move this up just a little bit.

00:11:36.816 --> 00:11:38.534
Okay, so what do we do?

00:11:38.534 --> 00:11:39.783
We're gonna solve for A5X.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.315
Let me just get rid of this denominator.

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:44.232
Let me multiply both sides by 3 kg.

00:11:45.387 --> 00:11:49.470
So I'm gonna get -3kg x
A5 in the X direction,

00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:55.385
if I multiply both sides by 3 kg,

00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:59.302
and then I get 5 kg x
A5 in the X direction.

00:12:01.753 --> 00:12:05.920
And I've still got minus,
alright 3 x 9.8 is 29.4 Newtons.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.655
So we'll just turn this into
what it's supposed to be.

00:12:10.655 --> 00:12:12.412
29.4 Newtons.

00:12:12.412 --> 00:12:14.533
So let's combine our A terms now.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:17.484
Let's move this negative
3A to the right hand side

00:12:17.484 --> 00:12:19.435
by adding it to both sides.

00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:22.184
And let's add this 29.4 to both sides.

00:12:22.184 --> 00:12:26.254
So I'll get the 29.4 Newtons
over here with a positive,

00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:27.812
if I add it to both sides.

00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:29.794
And it'll disappear on
the right hand side.

00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:31.965
And then I'll add this term to both sides.

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:36.075
Add a positive 3 kg x A to both sides.

00:12:36.075 --> 00:12:40.242
It'll disappear on the
left, and I'll get 5 kg x A5

00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:45.741
in the X direction + 3 kg
x A5 in the X direction.

00:12:47.444 --> 00:12:50.411
Now we're close, look on the
right hand side I can combine

00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.578
these terms because 5A plus
3A is the same thing as 8A.

00:12:55.905 --> 00:13:00.072
So 29.4 Newtons, .4 = 8 kg x,
I'll put the parenthesis here,

00:13:05.115 --> 00:13:06.453
times five.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.165
85 in the X direction.

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:12.180
Now I can divide both sides
by eight and usually we put

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.034
the thing we're solving for
on the left, so I'm just gonna

00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:15.064
put that over here.

00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:18.647
I'll get 29.4 Newtons
over 8 kg is equal to

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:24.474
the acceleration of mass five.

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:27.225
The 5 kg mass in the X direction.

00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.435
And if we calculate that,

00:13:29.435 --> 00:13:30.964
I'll just put that into my calculator.

00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:32.797
29.4 divided by eight.

00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.293
I get 3.675.

00:13:36.464 --> 00:13:37.472
So we'll just round.

00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:39.722
We'll just say that's 3.68.

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:44.566
3.6 whoops, 3.68 and it's
positive, that's good.

00:13:45.709 --> 00:13:49.154
We should get a positive
because the 5 kg mass has

00:13:49.154 --> 00:13:50.742
a positive acceleration.

00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:55.534
So we get positive 3.68
meters per second squared.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.992
But that's just of the 5 kg mass.

00:13:57.992 --> 00:14:00.082
How do we get the
acceleration of the 3 kg mass?

00:14:00.082 --> 00:14:00.978
Well that's easy.

00:14:00.978 --> 00:14:04.959
It's gotta have the same
magnitude of the 5 kg mass.

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:06.658
All I have to do is take this number now.

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.521
I know what A5X is.

00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:10.579
So if I just plug that in right here,

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:14.579
well then I know that A3Y
is just gonna be equal

00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:18.546
to -3.68 meters per second squared.

00:14:22.258 --> 00:14:23.750
And I'm done, I did it.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.619
We figured out the
acceleration of the 3 kg mass,

00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:28.452
it's negative.

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:30.760
No surprise, 'cause it's
accelerating downward.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.508
We figured out the
acceleration of the 5 kg mass,

00:14:33.508 --> 00:14:34.841
it's positive, not a surprise.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.600
It was accelerating to the right.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.861
The way we did it, recapping really quick,

00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:41.780
we did Newton's second
law for the 5 kg mass.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.104
That didn't let us solve.

00:14:43.104 --> 00:14:46.061
We did Newton's second
law for the 3 kg mass,

00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:47.722
that didn't let us solve.

00:14:47.722 --> 00:14:49.811
In fact it got really bleak,
because it seemed like we

00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:53.229
had three unknowns and only two equations,

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:56.150
but the link that allowed us
to make it so that we only

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.140
had one equation with one
unknown, is that we plugged

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.401
one equation to the other first.

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.799
We had to then write the
accelerations in terms

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:07.180
of each other, that's
because these accelerations

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.410
are not independent.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.851
The accelerations have to
have the same magnitude.

00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:13.578
And in this case one
had the opposite sign.

00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:15.490
So when we plugged that
in, we have one equation

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.018
with one unknown, we
solve, we get the amount

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:19.321
of acceleration.

00:15:19.321 --> 00:15:21.951
So that's the hard way
to do these problems.

00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:24.551
So in the next video I'll
show you the easy way

00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:26.170
to do these problems.
