MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Talks

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.910
at Google in Cambridge,
Massachusetts to most

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.460
of the people here in
the room, and to everyone

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.790
joining us via live stream.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.000
Today, it's my enormous pleasure
to introduce Adrienne Mayor.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.790
Professor Mayor is here to
discuss her landmark new book

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.010
"Amazons: Lives and
Legends of Warrior Women

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.450
Across the Ancient World."

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.540
This is the first comprehensive
account of warrior women

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.580
in myth and history,
across the ancient world,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.260
from the Mediterranean Sea
to the Great Wall of China.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.370
Reading it, I'm not
sure which is more

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.250
thrilling the stories of
the women she makes come

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.350
alive for us, or the scholarly
rigor she brings to her work.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.520
This is really an
exceptional book,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.080
please buy it and read it.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.680
Professor Mayor is an
independent folklorist slash

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.379
historian of science who
investigates natural knowledge

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.560
contained in pre-scientific
myths and oral traditions.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.870
Her research looks at
the ancient folk science

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.920
precursors, alternatives,
and parallels

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.400
to modern scientific methods.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.050
She is Research Scholar,
Classics and History

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.610
and Philosophy of
Science at Stanford.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.210
Stanford is lucky to
have her on faculty,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.770
and we are fortunate to
have her here with us today.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.290
Please join me in
welcoming Adrienne Mayor.

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:36.835
ADRIENNE MAYOR: Thank you.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.890
Thank you.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.590
I'm really honored to be invited
to present my research here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.770
at Google, and I
want to thank women

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.670
at Google for
sponsoring my talk,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.070
and everyone else who made
my visit possible today.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.210
Well, Amazons seem to be
everywhere these days.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.450
First, there was "Xena, Warrior
Princess," then the animated

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.190
films "Mulan," "Brave,"
"The Hunger Games," Atalanta

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.760
in the recent Hercules
film, "The Shield

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.970
Maidens and the Vikings,"
the powerful women in Game

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.610
of Thrones, and now Marvel
Comics has actually introduced

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.940
a female Thor war
goddess, and Wonder Woman

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.420
is actually poised
to make a comeback.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.220
I hear that she's going to
have our own movie in 2017.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
And meanwhile,
women of all ages,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.850
we've been talking about
this earlier today,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.550
are taking up bows and arrows
in unprecedented numbers,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.400
and horse women archers,
calling themselves Amazons,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.380
are competing around the world.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.860
These are a few of them, you
could actually take the lessons

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.450
from these women to
learn to do this.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.340
Modern Amazons.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.650
At the same time, the
news from the Middle East

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.140
is filled with images of
an estimated 10,000 women

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.050
who are serving in the
Kurdistan Peshmerga

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.326
fighting Islamic state in Syria.

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:09.200
And they're fighting
because their very lives

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.450
depend on victory.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.230
So today, we're surrounded
by images of warrior women.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.450
And some 2,500 years
ago, the Greeks

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.640
also surrounded themselves with
stories and images of Amazons.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.970
The Greeks described Amazons
as the equals of men,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.670
independent, fearless,
foreign horse women

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.760
who gloried in
hunting and warfare.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.440
And these are just some
examples of some Amazon

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.590
images from Greek art.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.350
These are vases from
about 550 to 450 BC.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.490
And who were the ancient
Amazons in Greek mythology?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.710
They were fierce warrior
women of exotic lands,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.900
they weren't Greek.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.190
They were as courageous
and as skilled

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.170
in battle as the
mightiest Greek heroes.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.800
Amazons played a major role
in the legendary Trojan War,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.500
and every great Greek champion
from Heracles, to Theseus,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.040
and Achilles, they all
had to prove their courage

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.630
by killing a formidable
Amazon queen.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.950
Greek historians never doubted
that Amazons had really

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.010
existed in the
remote misty past.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.930
And many Greek writers
reported that women

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.240
living the lives of Amazons
still dwelled in the lands

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.450
around the Black Sea
and beyond the Black

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.390
Sea in the immense territory
the Greeks called Scythia.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.750
Historians and archaeologists
still use that word.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.140
It's a blanket term, and
I'll be using it today.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.460
In classical
antiquity, Amazons were

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.450
on view everywhere
you looked in Athens

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.020
and other cities in Greece.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.250
They were featured in
monumental public sculptures,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.020
in mosaics, and in frescoes
on public buildings.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.380
Amazons wearing patterned
trousers and boots,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.660
riding horses, shooting
bows, hurling spears,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.480
swinging battle axes, and
dying heroically in battle

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.030
were wildly popular subjects
in Greek vase paintings.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.750
More than 130 personal
names of Amazons

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.340
still survive from antiquity.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.660
They are on statue
bases, they're

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.780
labels on ancient vases, and
they are in many ancient texts.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.610
Every Greek man,
woman, and child

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.430
knew exciting Amazon
tales by heart.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.670
And little Greek
girls, we now know,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.790
even played with Amazon dolls.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.670
These are just two from the
collection in the Louvre.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.490
They have-- some of
them have movable arms

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.000
and legs like Barbie dolls.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.080
They could be dressed
in different costumes,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.510
and these were found
in little girls' graves

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.570
from classical Greece.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.560
So were Amazons real?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.860
Or were bold,
warlike women nothing

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.380
but fantasy figures
invented by the Greeks?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.020
Were they simply the
ancient ancestors

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.500
of Wonder Woman and
Katniss Everdeen?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.820
Do we have to say the
exhilarating world of Amazons

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.010
was just an elaborate
fiction brought

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.450
to life by the Greek
storytelling imagination?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.350
Until now, that is what modern
historians had been assuming.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.110
But now, thanks to spectacular
recent archaeological

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.080
discoveries across what
was once ancient Scythia,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.550
we have overwhelming
proof that women

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.390
fitting the descriptions
of Amazons in Greek art

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.670
and literature really did exist.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.140
So there were
historical counterparts

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.990
to the mythical Amazons.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.360
These women were
members of a network

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.400
of diverse, but
culturally related

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.530
nomadic tribes of
Eurasia and beyond.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.890
Each of those tribes
now, of course, they all

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.030
have their own names, they have
their own dialects, languages,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.090
and their own histories, but
they became known to the Greeks

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.540
as Scythians.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.540
And they-- their
cultures were centered

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.200
around archery
and riding horses.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.050
They were nomads.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.910
As nomads, The Scythians
left no written histories,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.090
so we have to rely
on their neighbors,

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.530
and their descendants,
and on archaeology.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.880
Long before modern
archaeologists

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.640
began excavating the graves
of real warrior women,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.930
the Greek writers had
already identified

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.420
Amazons as Scythians.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.420
These warlike tribes have
no cities, no fixed abodes,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.580
wrote one ancient
Greek historian,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.890
they live free and unconquered,
and they are so savage,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.650
that even the women take
part in war, he wrote.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.150
Amazons, remarked others, were
as courageous and as fearsome

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.845
as their Scythian husbands.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.090
The nomad women were
first described in detail

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.050
by Greeks in about 470 BC by
the Greek historian Herodotus.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.210
He, and later authors,
accurately described

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.440
the Scythian lifestyle
and preserved

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.500
details of their burials
in mounds called kurgans

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.780
on the steppes.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.500
And my talk today is going
to focus on the evidence

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.770
from ancient Greek art
and modern archaeology.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.620
This is a Scythian kurgan.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.440
On the left, that's
what they look like.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.799
They're very large,
very complex burials.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.360
That one was
excavated last year.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.040
And you can see the
typical finds inside.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.250
Among these Scythian
nomads, girls

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.670
learned to ride and handle
bows and spears along

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.800
with their brothers.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.640
They knew how to
defend themselves.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.280
They knew how to
hunt, and they knew

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.980
how to fight just like the men.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.000
The lives of those tough
nomadic girls and women

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.500
were so very different from
the lives of Greek women

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.790
in antiquity.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.450
In Greece, women and girls
were confined indoors

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.700
to weave and mind children.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.110
And that difference
in the two cultures

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.140
made a deep impression
on the Greeks.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.260
Rumors and descriptions of these
horse riding men and women,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.550
much feared for
their deadly arrows

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.830
and their expanding
conquests across Eurasia,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.040
began to filter back to Greece,
perhaps in the Bronze Age,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.970
and the Greeks first
began to directly contact

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.210
these people in the
seventh century BC.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.710
And that's when the
Greek cities began

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.930
to establish trading colonies
around the coast of the Black

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.630
Sea.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.280
And it's easy to
understand then,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.490
how genuine knowledge
mixed with garbled details,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.500
intriguing travelers reports,
curiosity, imagination,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.900
and a lot of speculation to
fill in the gaps, fired up

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.950
the Greek imagination
and lead to an outpouring

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.700
of exciting stories and
vivid pictures of Amazons.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.810
We now know about
these people because

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.000
of archaeological excavations
of more than 1,000

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.590
ancient Scythian graves from
the Ukraine, southern Russia,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.350
the Caucasus region,
and Central Asia.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.130
Now before the advent
of DNA testing,

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.500
it used to be taken for
granted that any time you

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.160
find human remains
buried with weapons,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.060
it was assumed they
belong to a male warrior.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.880
And that was just taken for
granted, that was routine.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.780
But scientific
analysis is calling

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.230
all of those assumptions
into question,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.100
and there have been some
spectacular reversals

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.320
of previous discoveries
announced as male warriors.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.000
I'll just give a few examples.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.290
In the 1960s, in ancient
Thrace, that's now Bulgaria.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.230
Two grave mounds from
the fourth century

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.850
BC, that's the time when the
Greeks were telling stories

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.300
about Amazons, those mounds
were discovered in the '60s.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.930
And each mound had
many weapons, armor,

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.550
they were filled with
gold and silver artifacts,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.880
and richly equipped horses.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.180
A pair of human skeletons lay
inside each of those mounds,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.880
and these remains were announced
as too powerful male warriors

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.270
who were buried
with their wives.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.910
50 years later, in 2010, DNA
tests were finally carried out,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.230
and the results
revealed that all four

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.420
of the skeletons in those
two mounds belonged to women.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.960
Another stunning discovery
of a warrior woman

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.590
was reported just last month.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:53.270
I think it's in this month's
issue of archaeology magazine.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.010
Since the 1970s, when the
magnificent tomb of Alexander

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.840
the Great's father, Philip II,
was excavated in Macedonia,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.940
archaeologists have
wondered about the identity

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.780
of the mysterious second person,
another person's remains,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.030
buried in other golden
casket next to Philip's.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.110
You see the two caskets here.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.730
A pair of gilded
bronze greaves--

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.310
greaves, leg armor, shin guards,
are shown on the right there.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.330
And there was a
fabulous golden quiver,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.340
you see the golden quiver on the
lower left, along with arrows,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.740
and parts of a bow.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.770
Those weapons posed a puzzle
to the archaeologists,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.900
because those weapons
are not Greek weapons,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.550
they're not Macedonian weapons.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.040
Those are typical
Scythian weapons

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.490
like those used by the
Amazons in Greek art.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.770
And even more curious, if you
take a look at those greaves,

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.200
the shin guards,
they're mismatched.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.480
They're not the same size.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.690
Well, scientific analysis
of those mystery bones

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:01.980
was just taken out,
taken a few weeks ago,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.900
and the analysis
revealed surprising news.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.860
The Scythian bow and the quiver
and those mismatched leg armor,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.090
they belonged to a woman.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.830
She was about 32 when
she died in 336 BC.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:21.130
Her bones showed the rigors
of constant horseback riding.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.370
One of her legs had broken
and had healed crookedly,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.970
leaving her with a--
probably with a limp,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.920
and the uneven
greaves had obviously

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.175
been custom-made for her.

00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:36.640
Now, who was this
real life Amazon

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.400
buried in the royal Macedonian
tomb with the King of Macedon?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.670
Theories about her identity
are being debated as we speak.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.820
We can go into that later
if you have questions.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.370
Now that DNA analysis is
available, it's very expensive,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.850
but it is available now, we
have more than 300 graves

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.370
of battle scarred women
buried with their weapons,

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.810
and more being found every year.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.950
And archaeologists
are now going back

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.010
to previously
discovered male warriors

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.470
to see whether those
might be women.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.330
The biggest concentration
of warrior women's burials

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.690
are in Bulgaria, Romania,
Ukraine, southern Russia,

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.470
the Caucasus, and
Kazakhstan, the very places

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.460
that were identified as
prime Amazon territory

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.545
by the ancient Greeks.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.920
In the Scythian kurgans,
warrior women were buried.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.370
They could be buried alone,
along with other warrior women,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.740
or with male warriors, they
were always buried as equals.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.830
Archaeology shows that
the Scythian women

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.320
were laid to rest with the
same honors as the men.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.900
There was evidence of
large funeral feasts

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.350
by the mourners, lots
of sacrificed horses,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.860
the women like the men were
buried with tools, weapons,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.710
golden treasures, personal
kits for smoking hemp,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.550
and food for the afterlife, a
cup of fermented mare's milk,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.770
and a chunk of
horse meat impaled

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.585
by an iron knife on
a wooden platter.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.410
Bioarchaeology and DNA can
reveal the sex, the health,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.860
the age at death with more
than 90% accuracy now.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.090
The DNA results tell us
that a substantial number,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:36.560
about 25 to nearly
40% of Scythian women

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.040
were active warrior women
buried with their weapons

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.470
when they died.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.620
Many of those armed
women had war injuries

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.440
like the male warriors.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.550
The typical grave goods
of the women warriors

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.310
in the heart of ancient
Amazon territory

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:00.800
included iron spears, massive
armored belts, leather and gold

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.870
quivers filled
with bronze arrows,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.920
bronze swords,
battle axes, shields,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.190
necklaces of beads
and animals claws,

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.450
gold earrings,
and sometimes even

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.330
clothing of wool,
leather, fur, silk,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.025
and hemp has been preserved.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.700
The youngest girl
warrior ever found here

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.250
she is-- oh, no, this is the
16-year-old-- I don't have

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.160
a picture of the youngest
girl warrior ever found

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.840
was about 10.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.890
This one was 16.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.610
The youngest ever found
was 10 when she died,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.320
and she was buried in iron armor
with two spearheads, evidence

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.730
that young children, boys and
girls, were trained for battle.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.730
Also nearby, this
was in the Ukraine

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.870
nearby, another
kurgan, or grave mound,

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.000
held the remains of
three young girls.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.490
They were aged 10 to
15, and their arsenal

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.700
included heavy cavalry items,
scaled armor, helmets, spears,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.859
shields, quivers full of arrows.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.180
And those girls also owned
tools, gold necklaces,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.264
and bronze mirrors.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.750
Three of the most ancient,
the earliest Amazon graves,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.780
were found in the
southern Caucasus

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.020
region, a land
strongly associated

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.313
with Amazons in antiquity.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.250
The women's
skeletons were buried

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:37.590
by their companions about
3,000 years ago in 900 BC.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.420
One woman was about
30 when she died,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.220
she was interred in
a sitting position

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.530
with her bronze sword across
her knees, and a dagger

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.900
and a spear at her feet.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.730
There's the original
report on the left there.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.600
The jawbone of her horse
and her shield were nearby.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.890
The left side of her skull
has a wound from a battle axe

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.020
that had begun to
heal before she died.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.580
The second woman in that kurgan
had an arrowhead embedded

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.850
in her skull, and
the third woman

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.550
wore a necklace of
lion or leopard claws.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.360
The scientific
studies of skeletons

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.690
are yielding some very
striking results and details.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.970
Some women's legs were bowed
from a lifetime on horseback.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.820
These were nomads, who traveled
great distances by horse.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.950
They suffered arthritis, they
had broken bones, probably

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.420
from constant riding and falls.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.820
Some women's hand
bones actually reveal

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.530
evidence of repeated
heavy use of a bow.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.480
Typical battle wounds of
women buried with weapons

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:53.530
include ribs slashed by swords,
arrowheads embedded in bones,

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:59.038
and skulls punctured
by pointed battle axes.

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:00.600
These are some examples.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.280
Pointed battle axes
are typical weapons

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.990
of Amazons in Greek
vase paintings.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.440
By careful analysis
of the bones,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.560
bioarchaeologists
can often determine

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.454
the direction of an
opponent's attack.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:24.120
They can tell whether
the blows occurred

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.900
while someone was fighting face
to face, on foot on the ground,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.060
or on horseback, whether
they were in motion when

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.640
the blow was delivered,
and whether or not they

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.000
tried to deflect the blow.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.930
Most combat injuries of
the women and the men

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.910
are on the left side, indicating
that their adversaries were

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.250
right handed.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.220
All of this
archaeological evidence

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.960
points to a level
of gender equality

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.000
unheard of among
the ancient Greeks.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.500
So it's no wonder they were
fascinated and horrified

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.750
by the barbarians
at the steppes.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.160
Their myths, we can see
them as a kind of exciting

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.590
what if story, pitting
these daunting strong women

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.595
against the Greek's
mightiest heroes.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.090
Here's Achilles
fighting and killing

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.430
Penthesilea on the
battlefield at Troy.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:25.490
And on the right is
Heracles killing Hippolyta.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.954
He looks a little nervous
there in that picture.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.710
These images were incredibly
popular in antiquity,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.650
second only to
pictures of Heracles.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.660
Unlike the restricted lives
of Greek girls and women

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.140
that I explained
before, being an Amazon

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.810
was an option for
women on the steppes

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.920
Why?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.690
Because of a series of
unique extremely successful

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.400
Scythian technologies
and practices,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.910
innovations perfectly suited
to their time and place.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.980
The Scythian way of
life, with opportunities

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.130
for women unheard of
in ancient cultures,

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.740
other ancient cultures,
ensure that mounted

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.350
nomad culture
flourished and dominated

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.200
on the steppes sweeping over
a Millennium from Eurasia

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:22.240
to China from about
700 BC to AD 500.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.600
In Scythia, young
girls were raised

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.310
to ride horses and shoot
bows and arrows, just

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.480
like their little brothers.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.940
And that made perfect
sense in a nomadic culture.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.030
Think about it.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:38.102
Small groups or bands, isolated
on the harsh dangerous steppes,

00:21:38.102 --> 00:21:39.560
they're always on
the move, they're

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.810
always facing attack
from hostile enemies

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.300
and other tribes.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.380
Everyone, male and
female, was a stakeholder.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.900
Young and old, male
and female, they're

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.760
all expected to
contribute, all expected

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.300
to take part in defense
and raids and hunting.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.800
On the plane from San Francisco
yesterday, it occurred to me

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.090
that Scythian way of life
might be of special interest

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.940
to Google, and maybe
some of you will discern

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.230
some parallels between
their world and your world.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.970
The Scythians forged an
extraordinary combination

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.900
of sophisticated technologies
and unconventional tactics.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.310
They were based on agility,
flexibility, speed, innovation,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.130
shared capacity, shared
knowledge, equality,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.460
individual merit, also
cooperation, teamwork,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.710
within an extensive network
of loosely related groups

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.320
of rivals as well
as potential allies.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.820
On the steppes, tribes waxed
and waned in size and power.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.250
Groups were free to split
off from the main unit

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.060
and establish new
alliances on their own.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.730
Small bands of
survivors or rebels

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.260
might be absorbed
into larger tribes

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.210
or ally with another tribe.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.280
The stakes on the steppes
were extremely high.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.810
Some tribes were decimated,
some vanished forever,

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.340
we have no trace them.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.370
Alliances alternated
with hostilities,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.820
former adversaries,
however, sometimes

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.250
united to pursue larger
goals of conquest,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:22.290
control over territory,
resources, trade.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.040
Tribes often coalesced
to meet and defeat

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.730
powerful invading enemies.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.200
The Scythians united, for
example, in the sixth century

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.800
BC to defeat the huge
Persian army that

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.130
was led by Darius the
first, and the Persian King,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.870
Cyrus the Great,
actually lost his life

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.340
fighting the Scythians
beyond the Caspian Sea.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.885
And they were led by the
warrior queen, Tomyris.

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:51.140
Two centuries later, even
Alexander the Great's army

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.280
failed to subdue the
Scythians and the step

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.030
nomads of inner Asia.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.754
The eastern Scythians held
the upper hand over China

00:24:00.754 --> 00:24:01.670
for several centuries.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.920
I think some step
nomads innovations

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.485
might have had enough magnitude
to qualify as moonshots.

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:16.650
Do you still use
that word, moonshots?

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.160
The first great leap forward was
the domestication of the horse.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.715
The Scythians, or their
ancestors-- the ancestors

00:24:23.715 --> 00:24:28.680
of the Scythians-- were the
first people to ride horses.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.230
First they domesticated it,
then they learned to ride them.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.320
Horses provided food,
drink, clothing, agility

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.230
in battle, speed, and
endurance over vast distances.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.250
And riding horses required
the invention of trousers.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.660
Essential tailored
action wear that zoomed

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.020
to success 3,000 years ago.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.219
Think about it, the
first tailored clothing.

00:24:54.219 --> 00:24:56.260
It's interesting that the
ancient Greeks actually

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.430
credited the Amazons with both
of those nomad discoveries.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.870
They said that Amazons
were the first ride

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.750
horses and the first
to wear trousers.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.400
Another awesome new
technology struck terror

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.160
into the hearts
of their enemies.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.550
The nomads of the
steppes perfected

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.880
the small but powerful
re-curve Scythian bow.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.660
Scythian archers were feared
for their terrific aim,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.230
and their ability to shoot
arrows at incredible speeds.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:32.520
And then they even went on to
concoct sophisticated and nasty

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.030
arrow poisons by mixing
viper venom with pathogens

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.240
so that you didn't even
have to have good aim, just

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.580
a scratch would kill the enemy.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.690
The Parthian shot, the
feet of twisting backwards

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.330
to shoot arrows as
one gallops away,

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.270
was another notorious
Scythian skill.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.560
And they also used
a floating anchor,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.340
which is an innovation--
or not an innovation--

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.200
but is known nowadays
and used by people

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.950
like this modern Amazon
of instinctive archery.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.480
You don't have a
fixed anchor point,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.780
you actually use
instinctive aim.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.950
So you have, it sounds
like an oxymoron,

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.180
but they have a floating anchor.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.650
And we see that in the
vase paintings of Amazons.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.600
By now it might be obvious
that the crucial change

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.990
with exponential advantages
for the Scythians

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.630
was the combination of
the horse and the bow.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.940
The horse combined
archery, that was

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.470
the great equalizer for
women on the steppes.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:47.240
Mounted archery was the catalyst
for women's full participation

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.950
in hunting and warfare and
all those other activities.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.420
Astride a horse with
a bow and arrows,

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.600
a woman could be just as fast
and just as deadly as a man.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.880
So among the Scythians, women
could achieve the same skill

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.600
sets as the men, and become
outstanding riders, hunters,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.470
and warriors, and rise
to leadership positions.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.640
According to the ancient
Greek historians,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.560
Scythian women typically
formed ad hoc bands.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.350
And these bands could either
be all women, or men and women,

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.900
and they formed these
bands for adventure,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.790
for hunting, and war campaigns.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.510
We have the names of
historical Scythian women

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.930
who rose to leadership roles,
and devised strategies,

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.090
and commanded armies.

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.490
I just mentioned
Tomyris was one of them.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.570
As the ancient Greeks
reported, and as archaeology

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:40.130
seems to confirm,
young women and girls

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.270
served as the active duty
warriors and raiders,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:46.090
while older women with
children could choose

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:50.050
to continue that marshal
lifestyle or not,

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.890
depending on what they
wished in the circumstances.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:55.130
But in emergencies,
because everyone

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.880
had been trained
to same, everyone

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.010
was capable of riding
out to meet the enemy.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.210
So whether by choice, or
compelled by circumstances,

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:07.150
ordinary women of Scythia
could be hunters and warriors.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.650
In other words,
these foreign women

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:11.060
could behave just like
ancient Greek men,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.510
glorying in physical
strength and freedom,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.800
roaming at will
outside, choosing

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.890
your own sexual
partners, chasing game,

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.140
and killing enemies.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.290
So archaeology,
as I mentioned, is

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.210
shedding new light on the
ancient Greek narratives

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.680
and the artistic
representations of Amazons,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.770
showing how some details
in ancient Greek literature

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.280
and art that were once
dismissed as fantasy

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.780
or just overlooked
altogether, now

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.700
turn out to be accurate
representations of step nomad's

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.620
customs and their life.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.920
And the step nomads were
the historical counterparts

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.820
of the mythic Amazons.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.370
We're now learning how
much the Greeks actually

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.700
knew, how much they got
right, maybe sometimes they

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.940
were guessing, but
they knew a lot

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.200
about real warrior
women of Scythia,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.390
and Scythian technologies
and practices.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.270
And I think I have time
for a few examples.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.400
As the Greeks learned more
and more about Scythians,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.580
they revised their
portrayals of Amazons,

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.840
adding realistic details in
written accounts and art.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.660
In the fifth century BC,
for example, Herodotus,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.400
I've already mentioned
the Greek historian,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.790
reported that the Scythians
enjoyed the intoxicating

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.200
smoke from burning hemp.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.890
As I mentioned earlier, personal
hemp smoking hits like this one

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.040
are among the grave goods
of Scythian men and women

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.790
buried in kurgans.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.940
Amazon clothing and
weapons are some

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.990
of the most striking changes
for accuracy in Greek art.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:49.320
The earliest images of Amazons
appeared on vase paintings

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.320
about 2,500 years ago.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.420
And those earliest most ancient
scenes show the women dressed

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:02.230
and armed, or in the custom of
heroic nudity, as it's called,

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.830
they were dressed like
Greek hoplite warriors.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.250
They're wearing Greek
helmets, armor, round shields,

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.440
and they're fighting
on foot with swords.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.360
The Greeks just portrayed
them as counterparts

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.360
of their own heroes.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.630
But soon, as they got
more and more information

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.340
about the Scythians,
the Greek artists

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.880
began showing the foreign
Amazons with Scythian style

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.310
clothing and weapons, and
they show them on horseback.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.480
And we can even see two types
of horses on the vase paintings.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.110
Some Amazons ride
tall, mean horses.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:43.180
Akhal Teke is the name
now for those horses,

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.250
they were bred for
speed in the desert.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.840
And they also rode small
sturdy steppe ponies.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.920
Both of those types
of horses correspond

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.340
to the two types of horses that
are found in Scythian graves.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.760
Some of them are
actually mummified

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.360
by the permafrost
and dry conditions,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.960
as in these examples.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.960
Scythian riders rode bareback.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.690
They didn't have stirrups.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.020
They had light, or
no reins at all.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.760
They guided their horses with
their thighs, knees, and feet,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.020
and voice commands.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.000
And many Greek
vases and sculptures

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.960
depict Amazons writing
barefooted with heel and ankle

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.080
guards against chafing.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.660
And this detailed vase
painting shows an Amazon tying

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.910
on ankle guards or spurs.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.220
Greek artists began to equip
the Amazons with real Scythian

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.370
weapons, just like those
found in Scythian burials.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.520
Amazons were now
shown as archers,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.060
and they were outfitted with
distinctive Scythian style

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.490
re-curve bows and
decorated quivers

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.340
with flaps that hung up
on belts at their waist

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.090
instead of at the back
of their shoulders.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.640
And here's another very
interesting realistic Scythian

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.780
cultural detail of
Scythian style archery.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.940
It's overlooked by
the art historians.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.520
When I showed vase
paintings of Amazon archers

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.570
to some archery experts,
they immediately

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.970
noted that the women are
using the nomad style thumb

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:26.620
draw, and also instinctive
archery with no fixed anchor.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.420
The thumb draw is sometimes
called the Mongolian draw.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.360
They were using those techniques
with their small bows instead

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.270
of the Mediterranean release
used by the Greek archers,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.070
using their bows
in vase paintings.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.750
You can see an example of
that in the upper left.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.510
And as we've already
seen, Greek artists

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.940
illustrated Amazons twisting
around on their horses

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.830
to shoot arrows backwards in
the notorious Parthian shot.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.600
That re-curve bow used
by Scythian archers

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.540
was an equalizer, as I
mentioned, for women.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.080
And the bows' curves
store a lot of extra force

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.010
under compression
because of those curves.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.730
And that makes it
very difficult,

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.690
impossible to string,
unless you know the trick.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.800
Instead of brute
physical strength,

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.680
one has to learn the
special technique.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.980
To attach the string, you have
to brace the bow onto your knee

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.430
while you're
sitting or kneeling,

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:34.050
and there are images
on ancient coins,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.810
as you can see above on
the left, and on vases

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.010
showing Amazons and Scythians.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.970
But especially
interesting that they show

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.820
Amazons stringing their bows
using this special Scythian

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.050
technique.

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.950
It can also be done
standing if you

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.920
brace one foot against a
rock or a helmet as shown

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.350
on this vase from the
Smithsonian on the right.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.060
Some Greek images
of Amazon archers

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.380
have been misunderstood
by scholars until now.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.510
For example, there's
a vase painting here

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.889
that shows an Amazon archer
between two riders, one

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.739
of them identified
as a Scythian,

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.610
the other one is Greek.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.090
The archer is bending
very far backwards,

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.770
seemingly aiming
randomly at the sky.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.250
The ancient vase specialists
and art historians

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.540
have interpreted
this scene as quote,

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.389
a dying Amazon
collapsing in battle.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:35.620
But in fact, the archers
stance is an accurate portrayal

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.870
of flight archery, shooting
an arrow a very long distance.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.060
The Greek and the
Scythian on the horses

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.239
appear to be observers of
a flight archery contest.

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.370
And flight archery
contests were described

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:51.520
by ancient Greek
historians, and we even

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.550
have some of the record
distances recorded

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.900
on an ancient inscription
on the Black Sea.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.390
The Scythians were
famous for their accuracy

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.980
and their long
distance shooting.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.020
Amazons were shown on
Greek vases holding

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.810
more than one arrow
while drawing their bows.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.520
That sometimes
puzzled art scholars,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:18.170
they thought it might be a
mistake by a careless vase

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.940
painter.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.260
But instead of a
mistake, those images

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.800
depict the proper technique
for speed shooting arrows.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.590
It allows an archer to
shoot in quick succession

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.800
without having to
constantly reach

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.710
for arrows from the
quiver at their waist.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.220
Scythian archers were also
famous for their speed

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.960
shooting, and they could
probably estimate-- estimates

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.130
today are that they could
probably release an arrow

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.720
every one to three seconds.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.010
They would be daunting enemies.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.510
Besides bows arrows,
Amazons were often

00:35:56.510 --> 00:36:00.550
shown with swords, battle
axes, and a pair of spears,

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.810
the typical weapons
that are found

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:08.650
in Scythian burials of men
and women as in these examples

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:13.520
from vase paintings
and one mosaic there.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.200
And this is a rather
famous vase painting

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.120
they're using all of
the weapons at hand.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.940
A unique and beautiful
vase painting

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.780
in the Metropolitan
Museum in New York

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.070
shows an Amazon taking
aim with a sling.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.170
Her two spears,
you can notice, are

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.350
stuck in the ground on the left.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.330
According to slinging
experts that I've talked to,

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.920
her stance is quite accurate.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.980
Piles of sling pebbles have been
found among the weapons buried

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.350
with Scythian women
in their kurgans.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.390
Several ancient Greek writers
describe step warrior women

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.590
skills with the
lasso, and they told

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.980
how they use them to rope
their enemies in battle,

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.200
and then finish them
off with battle axes.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.100
So I was pretty delighted when
I came across this rare vase

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.870
painting of an Amazon on
horseback twirling a lariat,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.840
just like Wonder
Woman's golden lasso.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.720
That Amazon there is charging
toward a Greek warrior,

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.490
you can't see him, but he is
cowering underneath his shield,

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:22.500
decorated with a snake
there, in the upper right.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.320
This action scene decorated
a Greek woman's jewelery

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.800
or cosmetics box.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.743
A lot of women's objects
contained images of Amazons.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.240
This Amazon is wearing a
patterned tunic and leggings,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.210
as you can see, that kind
of sensible practical action

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:48.160
wear invented by the nomads,
whose lives centered on horses.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.460
And the wild patterns, and
textures of the leggings

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.350
and sleeves worn by Amazons
in Greek vase paintings

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.240
match the textiles
in garments that

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.380
have been recovered
from Scythian graves.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.840
Amazons in the
vase paintings are

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.160
shown in long sleeved shirts
and trousers decorated

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.360
with geometric
designs, and sometimes

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.680
even griffins, lions, and
deer, as in the upper right.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.720
They wear high leather boots
if they're not barefooted,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.100
and soft pointed
caps with ear flaps

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.740
and spotted leopard skins.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.090
And all of those items are found
in the burials of Scythians.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.760
These are some artist
reconstructions

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.250
of warrior women's
garments from clothing

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.370
that was found in
Scythian kurgans.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:53.380
The Greeks were fascinated and
appalled by Amazons trousers.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.290
That was something no Greek
man or woman would ever

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.740
be caught dead in.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.160
Greeks wore simple
rectangles of cloth

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.680
held in place with
pins, like most

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.610
people around the Mediterranean.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:09.350
Trousers, as I
mentioned, were tailored.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.140
They were stitched together
from fitted pieces.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.930
And who invented trousers?

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.100
According to the Greeks,
it was the Amazons.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.160
And in fact, trousers
were, as I mentioned,

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.000
invented by the men and women
who first began riding horses.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.570
These are some
pictures of clothing

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.400
that has been found
in Scythian graves.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.090
And you can see the
patterns, decorations,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.620
look very similar
to what is portrayed

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.130
on Amazons in Greek
vase paintings.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.130
The earliest pair
of trousers were

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:48.860
found preserved
in Scythian graves

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.000
from nearly 3,000 years ago.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.620
I think I mentioned that
trousers were not just

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.240
sensible and practical,
they were necessary for life

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.250
on horseback.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.820
And they were equalizers.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.580
I think I have time for one more
example of an ancient artifact

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.900
that demonstrates how
Greek artists incorporated

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.640
realistic features
of Scythian culture

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.116
and life in
illustrations of Amazons.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.520
This beautiful golden
ring was made in about 425

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.480
BC, classical Greece.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.140
You can see it on display
in the Museum of Fine Arts

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.270
here in Boston.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.170
The full significance
of the scene

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:34.430
has alluded
understanding until now.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.040
At the Boston Museum,
the museum text

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.770
says it shows on Amazon
on a horse with her dog,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.580
hunting a deer.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.850
The Amazon is wearing a
belted tunic, as you can see,

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.470
her hair and the cape or
cloak are blowing back

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.290
to indicate speed and actions.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.400
She has the reins
choked up tight

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.600
to control the
spirited horse as she

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.180
is about to spear the
deer with her javelin.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:08.580
And the deer on this tiny ring
is so exquisitely detailed

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.850
that we could even
determine the species.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:16.090
It's a spotted fallow buck
with-- they have broad palmate

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.630
antlers.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.670
Her hunting dog is a type
of sighthound still used

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.360
in Central Asia today.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.860
And it's attacking
from the rear,

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.710
you can see that the
deer's left hind leg--

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:31.000
I think it's the left--
left hind leg is broken.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.450
And what about the large bird?

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.760
What-- why is that
included in the scene?

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.030
The scholars just
ignored that detail.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.890
But I was looking at photographs
of traditional hunters

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.710
on horseback in
Kazakhstan and Mongolia,

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.400
when I suddenly realized the
significance of that bird

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.850
on the ring in the
Museum of Fine Arts.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.240
This is Makpal
Abdrazakova of Kazakhstan,

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.840
and she's an eagle hunter.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.850
Falconry, training
raptors to hunt

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.300
has very ancient roots
among the step nomads.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.340
I learned about a
discovery in Central Asia

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.960
of a fully clothed mummy of a
horse woman in the Tarim Basin

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.750
area, she lived when
this ring that I

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.940
showed you was being
made in Greece.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:22.320
And she was buried with the
huge leather mitt on one hand,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.950
just like the one on this
modern female falconer's arm.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:31.270
I also learned that the
bird perched on the arm

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:35.470
is a golden eagle, and that
is the favorite bird of prey

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.750
to train for traditional hunting
on the steppes by the nomads.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.780
They hunt rabbits, deer,
foxes, and even wolves

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.760
with golden eagles.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.470
These are few more
young women who

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:56.220
are eagle hunters or apprentices
learning the traditional skill

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:56.720
again.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:04.310
So that bird hovering
above the deer's head

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:10.270
is not just a random decoration
as assumed by the scholars.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:14.510
It's an eagle with a hooked
beak, spread wings and tail,

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.800
it's about to attack the deer.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.130
So this stunning golden ring
illustrates an Amazon eagle

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.520
hunter on horseback
accompanied by a sighthound.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.020
All four, the Amazon, the
dog, the horse, and the eagle

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.760
are focused on the prize.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.930
By training these three
animals, the nomads

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.190
made the harsh,
unforgiving steppes

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:39.260
into a land rich
with accessible game.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.560
The scene on the ring
is compelling evidence

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.190
that the classical
Greeks had heard about,

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.820
or maybe even
observed, horse women

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:51.640
of Eastern lands who
trained eagles to hunt.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.380
Amazon figures may have
served many symbolic functions

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.850
for the Greeks,
but archaeology now

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.650
proves that warrior
women were not merely

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.270
figments of the
Greek imagination,

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.250
and the many examples
of naturalistic details

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.210
and ethnographic features
in ancient artworks

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:14.320
provide very strong evidence
that the Greek images and ideas

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.990
of Amazons were
certainly influenced

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.790
by real nomadic horse people.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.720
The Greeks interwove
threads of fact

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.420
with imaginative
storytelling to create

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.120
a panoramic world of Amazons.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.310
It seems fair to say
that Amazons as a dream

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.760
and as a reality
have always existed.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.540
Sometimes they're hidden or
suppressed, but at other times,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.980
the Amazons among us come
blazing into popular culture

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.040
and history.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.600
And there are strong signs that
a powerful Amazon spirit may

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.560
be awakening today, and as
the ancient Scythians would

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.470
tell us, that just
makes good sense.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.408
Thank you.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.400
Happy to take questions
if anyone has one.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:15.400
AUDIENCE: So you explained
how popular the Scythians

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.560
and Amazons were
with the Greeks.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.280
Did the Greeks
attempt to adapt any

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.620
of the horse riding
or the trousers

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.069
or the roles of women
in their fighting?

00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.860
ADRIENNE MAYOR: No.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.580
AUDIENCE: No, OK.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.870
But did they notice
that it was successful,

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.970
or they said, that's
just not for us?

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:34.110
ADRIENNE MAYOR: The Greeks
had such a strong aversion

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.400
to covering the arms and legs.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.950
They thought that was just an
outrageous and barbaric style

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.330
of dressing.

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:48.120
And they often mocked the
Persians for-- the Persians

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.100
actually did adopt the
Scythian way of dressing

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.020
because they became
horse people.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.540
They copied the Parthians and
the other Scythian tribes.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.330
And the Greeks
mocked the Persians

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:06.370
for wearing these
effeminate styles.

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:08.622
Leg coverings and sleeves.

00:46:08.622 --> 00:46:14.550
A manly man wore a miniskirt.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.060
And it's interesting that
Xenophon wrote a manual

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.930
on horsemanship for the Greeks.

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.340
And he does not-- he's a horse
rider-- he does not-- he's

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:30.800
in fifth century BC-- and he
does not recommended Greek men

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.260
wear trousers to ride horses.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.430
But he does say make
sure that you arrange

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.554
your cloak under you
so that you do not,

00:46:40.554 --> 00:46:42.470
especially when you're
getting onto the horse,

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:46.360
so that you do not present
a shocking spectacle

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.670
as you mount your horse.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:53.780
So even a horsemanship
manual could not

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.355
bring itself to
recommend trousers.

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.350
AUDIENCE: Excuse
me, did you come

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:07.080
across any evidence
in your research

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.700
that the tribes were either
matriarchal, or matrilineal,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.150
or was it simply
equal opportunity,

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:19.925
and it is the female leaders
that we've heard about?

00:47:19.925 --> 00:47:21.800
ADRIENNE MAYOR: As I
mentioned, the Scythians

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.770
didn't leave any
history, so we have

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:26.500
to go by what their neighbors
said and the archaeology

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.560
and then also look at-- you
can do comparative ethnography

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:35.380
by looking at people
who are following

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.120
a Scythian style of life on
the steppes in modern times,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.670
you can compare.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:45.320
So we don't have any evidence
of matriarchal societies

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.760
across the steppes.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.510
What we have is evidence of
equal opportunity, as you said.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.840
In that kind of lifestyle,
women could give counsel

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.480
in making decisions,
and of course, they

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:03.280
rose to leadership positions
because we have actually

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.250
documented by the neighbors
that there were women leading

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:13.400
armies against Persians, against
Egyptians, against Chinese.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.230
So we know that they did
have equal opportunity

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.540
in leadership.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.040
We don't have any
evidence for matriarchy.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.930
AUDIENCE: I guess my
question is slightly related.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:33.220
OK, so the Greek girls
have dolls of Amazons,

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.220
the Greek women have
icons of Amazons.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.260
Is there any correlation
between-- I mean,

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.230
the way the Greeks treated
women was terrible,

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.350
but it wasn't
uniformly terrible--

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.460
so is there any correlation
between how women were treated

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.300
in different city-states
in different periods

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.940
with the popularity of the
artifacts among the girls?

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:58.380
ADRIENNE MAYOR: The popularity
of the Amazon images

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.900
on women's perfume bottles,
on their jewelry boxes,

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:08.370
on some of their items
for sewing and weaving,

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.280
I think that really points
to a mystery about Greek life

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.480
that we don't really--
we can't explain.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.560
I mean Amazons were also a
popular, very popular, image

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.490
on crockery that we
know was in a shape that

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:24.600
was given to newlyweds.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.390
Why would you give newlyweds
pictures of Amazons?

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.760
There's something going on
there that we don't know.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.620
It's really very interesting.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.590
AUDIENCE: I mean, I know a
lot of feminists like to say,

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.670
OK Wonder Woman is going to be a
great icon for girls to empower

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.480
them, and I'm just
wondering, did that happen?

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.390
ADRIENNE MAYOR: According
to most scholars,

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:49.620
classicists have
argued and maintained

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.970
that all of these
images of Amazons

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:58.620
were like domestic propaganda
to discourage girls

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:02.670
from taking up archery,
horseback riding

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.440
and asking for equality.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.810
But the fact that the images
are so popular among girls

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:15.130
and women, and it shows
them in such a powerful way,

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.680
I don't think that argument
has any traction anymore.

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.080
Yes?

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
archeology question.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.710
So my question is,
has anybody examined

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:29.540
the bodies of the people
whose tombs you talked about,

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.480
and seeing if there's
asymmetrical development

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.007
on the long bones
of the upper body?

00:50:35.007 --> 00:50:36.840
Because I think we would
expect with archers

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.170
to find one side more
developed than the other,

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.860
and it would be a
way of determining

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.110
who got these grave goods
because of their occupation,

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:46.800
and who got it because of their
social status or their life

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.240
cycle.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.790
ADRIENNE MAYOR: For one thing,
the modern mounted archers

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.440
that I've spoken
to, the ones who

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.160
are using the
instinctive archery

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.440
technique and especially
the Parthian shot,

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.200
they shoot both sides, they
can shoot with both arms.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.070
They can just switch.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.710
So we know that these
nomads on the steppes

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:14.470
were practicing archery since
they were kids, little kids.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.010
So I don't think
we would see that.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.160
But I did mention, I
didn't call it out,

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.540
but I didn't mention that
they have found differences

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:26.310
in hand bones of the women that
have sh-- one hand might show

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.810
heavy use of a bow-- consistent
with heavy use of a bow.

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.190
So I think that's the kind of
evidence you're looking for.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.370
AUDIENCE: Somewhat
similar question.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.560
So the name Amazon
comes from a-mazos,

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:44.950
which is this myth that
Amazon women would remove

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.240
the breast so they could
shoot arrows better.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.119
Is there any evidence of that?

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:49.910
ADRIENNE MAYOR: No.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:50.451
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.330
ADRIENNE MAYOR: But that
idea sticks like glue.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:54.810
It's just like super glue.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.393
AUDIENCE: Is that a modern idea,
or did that trace all the way

00:51:57.393 --> 00:51:58.760
back to the Greeks?

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.080
ADRIENNE MAYOR: It's such an
interesting idea, wrong idea,

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.430
that I devoted an entire
chapter to Amazon breasts.

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:11.210
So quickly, the name
has absolutely nothing

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.230
to do with breasts.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:13.940
It's not a Greek word.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.490
The Greeks borrowed
the word Amazonis,

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.690
and no one knows
where it came from.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.470
Most linguists
believe that it might

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:28.920
be an ancient Iranian word that
derives from [INAUDIBLE], which

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.070
simply means warrior.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.450
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:40.400
But the Greeks had an obsession
with making non Greek words

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.350
in their language into Greek
words for patriotic reasons.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:46.470
So there was an etymologist
in the fifth century

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:49.350
BC-- he was actually
an historian dabbling

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.424
in etymology.

00:52:50.424 --> 00:52:51.840
And he said, well
let's figure out

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:54.090
what-- this must
be a Greek word,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:59.230
and so it sounds a
little bit like a-mazos.

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.870
Which, in Greek, would
sound a little bit

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.460
like without, a, mazos, breast.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.580
But he was
immediately challenged

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:13.260
by other historians of his day,
who said, that's ridiculous

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.130
of course not.

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.050
There is not one
ancient representation

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:22.920
of an Amazon with
only one breast.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.190
And as, if you watch
the Hunger Games,

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.720
or you looked at any of
the pictures I was showing,

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.810
it is physiologically
ridiculous.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.350
And yet the idea
just won't go away.

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:38.910
It's the one thing everyone
knows about Amazons.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.014
Yeah.

00:53:40.014 --> 00:53:41.930
AUDIENCE: This is
fascinating, the combination

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:44.471
of the archaeological evidence,
and the documentary evidence,

00:53:44.471 --> 00:53:45.820
the imagery and so on.

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:49.990
So you've mastered art history,
and archaeology, Greek sources.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:51.820
But I'm going to ask
you if you've also

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.280
looked at HIttite and
Persian and so on sources.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.630
And if they say anything,
or if there's evidence

00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:00.554
that they need to be re-read in
the light of what you've found.

00:54:00.554 --> 00:54:02.720
ADRIENNE MAYOR: I haven't
looked at Hittite sources,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.720
but there is a chapter on
Persian stories about Amazons

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.890
in my book.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:14.150
The Persians did tell stories
about step nomad women,

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.130
and we have them.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:19.480
They're preserved for
us because of the Greeks

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.870
who went to Persia and
preserved and recorded

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.190
the stories told
by the Persians.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.480
There was a Greek
doctor named Ctesias

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.620
who served as a physician
for the Persian King.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:36.820
He wrote a book about Persian
stories about step nomads.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.590
So we have his reports.

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:45.620
We have the names of many
step nomad warrior Queens who

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.880
fought Persians, and
we have their stories.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.560
So yes, other cultures
bordering Scythia

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.870
who encountered step
nomads definitely

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:59.630
had stories about warrior
women, Amazon like women.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.460
There was a papyrus
found recently,

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:06.950
and then even more recently,
has been finally translated

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.740
and it's in tatters, but
you've got enough of the story

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.850
to see that the title is The
Egyptians and The Amazons.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.340
And it's about an
Egyptian prince

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.370
who goes out to fight an
Amazon queen and her warriors.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.145
So many, many other
ancient cultures

00:55:22.145 --> 00:55:23.520
told stories about
warrior women.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.950
AUDIENCE: At what point do
the Amazons start vanishing

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:33.710
from the historical record?

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:37.295
Because I know the bow
eventually turns up in Mongolia

00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:39.270
and is used by the
Mongol-- the Mongol

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:43.430
horde to devastating
effect against the Chinese

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.370
and much of Europe
at that point.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:50.630
And the Mongol women
also shot, but at

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:54.770
what point do the Amazons
disappear from the record?

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:57.090
ADRIENNE MAYOR: It's
interesting that as you

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:01.530
read the ancient Greek and
then the Latin, Roman sources,

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:06.060
they tell an exciting story
about historical warrior Queens

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.750
who are from Scythia, and
then they say, and then

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.020
with her death, the
Amazons disappeared.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.730
And then the next
writer that you read

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:17.790
says, but there were pockets
of them, there were vestiges,

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.760
and they keep reappearing.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.820
So I don't think
there's any end point.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.840
As you say, the Mon-- there's a
book called The Secret History

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.660
of the Mongol Queens that
is about Genghis Khan's

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:37.250
granddaughters
saving his empire.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:40.320
The story, my last
chapter is on China.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.650
And we have Chinese
chronicles about warrior women

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.420
from those step tribes.

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.540
What's really interesting
is all of these other groups

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:54.270
from antiquity who tell
about Amazon like women

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:57.440
have a radically different
script for the stories.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.470
They want them as
lovers, as allies,

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:04.260
whereas the Greeks
kill them all.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:08.750
All of the Greek mythic
script dooms them to death,

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:11.590
whereas all these other
cultures say no, we

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.190
want them on our side.

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:18.140
So I don't think there's any
historical endpoint unless you

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.580
get to the Arab conquest
and then Islamic era.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.660
But even then there are
stories in the Middle Ages

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.580
about women who go to war,
and it goes all the way up

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.700
through the Middle Ages.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.581
And now it's back.

00:57:36.982 --> 00:57:39.330
OK, thank you.
