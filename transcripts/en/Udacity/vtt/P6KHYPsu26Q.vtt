Let's start off by
going to our settings.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.290
We'll go to accessibility,
click on voiceover,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.490
and then I'll turn
the voiceover switch on.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.440
&gt;&gt; Voiceover on, settings,
accessibility, back button.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.580
&gt;&gt; And I can swipe.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.680
&gt;&gt; Voiceover heading.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.370
Voiceover, on.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.770
&gt;&gt; And that'll advance voiceover.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.790
&gt;&gt; Double tap to toggle setting.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.090
&gt;&gt; Double tapping on the home button,
I can switch to the accessibility blog.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.360
&gt;&gt; Active Chrome, active.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.270
And from here I can swipe
to select different items.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.360
&gt;&gt; New features.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.301
Press link the accessibility blog.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.832

accessibility topics.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.640
A sample blog post, heavy level too.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.910
&gt;&gt; And when I find something I want
to click on I can just double tap.
