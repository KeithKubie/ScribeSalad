00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100
Now Brady, here comes the bit that really gives you a headache...

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.700
I'm going to show you how light can be polarized by sheets of Polaroid.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.200
This is a sheet of , it's polyvinyl-alcohol with iodine in it.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.200
In here are long molecules which are stretched out

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.700
and conduct along this direction but they don't conduct that way.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.300
That's what your Polaroid sunglasses are made of.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.500
It reduces the glare of the road.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.600
I put this sheet on top of this overhead projector

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.100
and I put another sheet on top polarized the same way

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.000
and they absorb a bit of light.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
But if I turn this top one round, so that it is perpendicular,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.500
you can see you can kill off most of the light.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.000
So there is some turning backwards, all the way round,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.600
and now I'm going back again and you see it disappears.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.100
This is an off-cut, a bit chopped off from the bottom of this,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.800
and I can put it on top of these two, and you can't see it at all.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.800
I can put it underneath these two and you still can't see it.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.400
But if I now slide it in between... sliding it in between,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.600
you see you can see it!

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.400
If I turn it around, it disappears,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.600
if I turn it around 45 degrees you can see something quite strong, 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.800
then turn it around a bit more and it disappears.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.900
It's magic, now you see it... now you don't.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Now you see it... now you don't.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.200
- Amazing, what's going on?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.500
- Well, I find this absolutely fascinating, I didn't believe this was going to work(!)

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
But I'll show you set of equipment over here,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.400
which is some microwaves.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.600
This is a microwave generator and it generates waves in one direction.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
And this is a receiver which will receive them.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.300
This wave has a wavelength of three centimeters.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.200
Now, three centimeters is about this long.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.800
The light wave is 60,000 times smaller.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.900
If I set up traveling waves, coming out of here and ending up here,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.900
then it would be a bit simpler.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.600
So I'll detect this by turning this on, getting a very nice signal.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.000
Now this is my sheet of "Polaroid"

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.100
it's just long conducting wires.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.700
The same as in the sheets of Polaroid, but you couldn't see them.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400
Now I put it in this way round,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.900
and you don't get a signal,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and I turn it round, and get a huge signal.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.200
So, there it is, nothing gets through

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.200
and I turn it around slowly, and you see it reappear.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.100
And when it's perpendicular, I hit a really big signal.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.700
What's happening here, is that this sends out waves oscillating in this direction.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500
and as the electric field hits this conduction wires

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600
it induces a current in here, and because of the resistance

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.500
of the wire the electromagnetic wave gets to be absorbed and heat the wire.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600
So it gets totally absorbed by the wire.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.900
If I turn it around this way,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.100
now the electric field causes a little bit of current,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.100
but then it hits the other side of the wire, and it doesn't dissipate,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.900
it gets stored as a capacitant.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So this does not absorb nearly as much energy,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.000
so I get a large signal. And then I turn it around, there I get virtually nothing.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.300
Now I want to turn this around, to show you they're polarized oppositely.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.200
So if I have that vertically, this is giving off waves oscillating vertically,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.100
this is detecting only waves which are going horizontally.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.500
Just like those sheets of Polaroid there.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.000
So I have a wave that is oscillating this way,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.200
and this one is not tuned to detect it at all, so I get no signal.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.000
Now I put the sheet of Polaroid in, and nothings there,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.600
if I turn it 45 degrees, I get a huge signal going through.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.400
If I turn it perpendicular I get nothing.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.100
So I start off vertical, there's nothing,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.300
I turn it round, get a lovely big signal at about 45 degrees.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.500
And when I turn further round, it decays away to zero.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.500
So something is happening if I put this in at 45 degrees.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.400
I'm able to get waves oscillating this way,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.500
to go through here, and be detected by something

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.700
which is detecting waves that way.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800
I'm changing this signal which is oscillating this way

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.200
to one that's oscillating that way, otherwise nothing would go through.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.100
- How have you done that?
- Well I haven't done it, it's this sheet of Polaroid.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.000
If I imagine this is a wave with a vertical polarization,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.100
I can think of it as partly this side of the triangle and part that one.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.600
So as I put it in at this angle, if I think of it as vertically polarized,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.100
it's partly this and partly that, so as I put in this in there,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.600
the bit which is running this way is killed off,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.000
and the bit which is running that way is allowed to continue.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.900
So I have a state which is oscillating this way now,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
this thing has managed to turn the plane of polarization of the wave,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.800
from vertical to this direction.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.400
Now that this waves travels along this way,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.100
part of it is horizontal and the horizontal part goes in.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200
I have a wave, I measure it, it changes the state

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:15.000
from being vertically polarized to one polarized in this direction.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.600
Once I've done that I can detect it here.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.000
That's the interpretation of this whole experiment.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.400
And that's the classical interpretation in terms of electromagnetic waves.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.500
Now Brady, this is the bit that really is going to do your head ache,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.000
which I'm going to enjoy!

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.400
Out of this apparatus comes one photon,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.800
it is a photon oscillating this way.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.600
The chances of this photon going through here, are 50:50.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.350
It can either be this way or this way and

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.500
if I do it at 45 degrees, they're equally probable.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Then you get to this detector,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.700
and now it's coming out with this polarization,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200
the chances of it going this way are 50:50.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.200
So I get only a quarter of the signal going through

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.100
and that's why the signal has gone down.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200
Notice now, as this photons comes through,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.900
I have to talk about probabilities. It is not deterministic.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.500
And if you go through the mathematics,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.500
you'll find that these states,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.700
which I would like to represent using a triangle like this,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.800
and you put the symbol in, that's a triangle,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.300
that state changes from one to the other.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.700
In here, in between, I have a mixture of two different states,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.700
and it is the mixture of two states that allows me to interpret this experiment.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.900
So it's much harder for poor old Brady to understand,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.300
because somehow quantum mechanics is biting him on the backside

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.400
and he really doesn't like me to talk about mathematics.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.600
But without it, without splitting this into two different states

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.100
added together I have no explanation for what's going on.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.900
Get your head around that Brady!
- I'll just edit that out. How do sunglasses work then?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.700
- Sunglasses work, well I haven't got them,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.200
but I used to have clip-on Polaroids,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.100
somehow if you're looking at light which is reflected off the road,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.600
the light that's polarized in this direction is taken away,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.900
so you find that you have transverse polarization only,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.900
if you get rid of that, you reduce the glare of the road.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.600
You don't get a nasty reflection on the road.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.500
Also if you look at the surface of a river of pond,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.200
it'll get rid of the glare and you can see into the pond.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.300
The other reason they work is that they seem to attract the girls,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.400
if you're cool, unlike me.
