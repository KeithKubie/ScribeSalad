00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.379
What is MERS and is it going to kill me?

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.740
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS,
is a viral respiratory illness that is relatively

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.740
new to humans.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.080
It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012
and is commonly localized to the Arabian Peninsula,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.640
however it has since spread to several other
countries, including the United States, France,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.510
and most recently South Korea.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.530
MERS like SARS, is a coronavirus that typically
presents as a cold and upper respiratory infection

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.090
including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.630
MERS is dangerous because it is more severe
than a common cold, and can lead to gastrointestinal

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.740
symptoms and kidney failure.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.170
As with all infections, children, seniors,
and people with compromised immune systems

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.739
or pre-existing medical conditions are more
likely to contract MERS.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.809
Unfortunately, this list includes mostly the
type of people found in hospitals, making

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.560
hospitalization in an area experiencing an
outbreak of MERS a huge risk-factor for infection.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.780
Other risk factors include direct interaction
with an infected person, travel to the Arabian

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.530
peninsula or interaction with a camel.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.720
Yep, camel.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.570
Based on information from the US Center for
Disease Control, the incubation period, or

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
time between exposure to MERS and the appearance
of symptoms, is usually about 5 or 6 days,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.299
but can be anywhere from 2-14 days.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.140
Patient zero in the recent South Korea outbreak
was a man who traveled to countries in the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.850
Middle East and did not exhibit any symptoms
on his return flight to Korea.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.450
He became sick a week later.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.020
MERS is not thought to be easily transmitted
between humans, that is why the extent of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.760
the South Korean outbreak, with three deaths
and the number of people in quarantine at

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.470
1600 and climbing, is confusing to scientists.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.210
Actually, scientists are confused by a lot
more than that, because we don’t actually

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910
know how the disease spreads.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.330
SARS, its sister disease, is communicated
via virus laden droplets from a cough or sneeze

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.810
but it is possible that MERS is airborne like
measles which can linger in a room for hours.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.040
To date, there have only been three reported
cases of MERS in the US, but worldwide MERS

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.070
has a mortality rate of 30% which is pretty
scary!

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.170
But if you’re a healthy adult who washes
their hands frequently, and actively avoids

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.360
contact with sick people and camels, you’ll
probably be okay.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.230
And just be safe if you’re planning any
trips to South Korea or the Arabian peninsula

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.570
in the near future.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.950
What scary disease are you most concerned
about?
