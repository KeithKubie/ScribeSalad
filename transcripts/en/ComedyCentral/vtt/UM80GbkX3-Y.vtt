00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:07.570
(electronic music)

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:13.607
- So we live in Brooklyn, our
show takes place in Brooklyn,

00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:15.418
- So we figured what
better way than to invite

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:17.583
the newest members of the Brooklyn Nets

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.104
to a two on two game.

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:21.252
- Andray Blatche, Reggie Evans.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:23.680
Thanks for coming on our
show, we appreciate it.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.265
We're gonna play this
game that we came up with

00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:28.265
called the backpack of disabilities.

00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:30.704
- So here are the rules of the game:

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:32.126
it's just like two-on-two,

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.082
but you just gotta pull a disability

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.909
out of this backpack. This
new Brooklyn Nets backpack

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.040
that we made.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.893
- Oh, this is a good one. Prescription.

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:42.959
He's gotta wear some prescription glasses.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:45.376
(funk music)

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:51.677
- Substitute white guy. You gotta sit out.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.911
- This is gonna be great to
play basketball with you.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:56.472
(Andray laughs)

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.389
(electronic music)

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:09.673
- Side chicks here,
they're just gonna come

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:12.626
yell at y'all while we play basketball.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:13.719
- What are you doing? You suck.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.465
- Get off the court!

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:16.298
- Go home.

00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:17.446
- No, you go home!

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:19.613
(yelling)

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:26.622
- [Keith] Side chicks.

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:29.724
We got tiny lawyer. So
you've got a tiny lawyer.

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:30.859
- How you doing? Jack Rabinowitz.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.368
- Hi, Reggie Evans man,
nice to meet you too.

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:35.285
I don't need no lawyer.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.967
- That's tight turtleneck.

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:46.783
You just gotta wear a tight turtleneck.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:48.687
- I keep getting the worst ones, man.

00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:51.104
(drum music)

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:55.775
- You can't dunk with a tight turtleneck.

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:56.695
- [Reggie] Pregnant?

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:00.952
- [Lucas Brother] Oh no, you
got the four months pregnant.

00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:02.786
- Oh, oh, my water just broke.

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:04.453
- Y'all have asthma.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.927
(mumbles)

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:16.915
- [Andray] I've gotta put an old sandwich

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:18.582
in my shooting hand.

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:22.467
- [Reggie] Tickle monster.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:26.384
- He's a monster he just
likes tickling people.

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:31.880
(laughs)

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.227
- I wanna thank y'all for coming out,

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:35.838
Reggie Evans, Andray Blatche,

00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:36.690
thanks for coming and playing.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.393
I'm sorry we had to win like that,

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.314
it's embarrassing for
y'all, but it's our game.

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:43.013
It's backpack of disabilities.

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.430
