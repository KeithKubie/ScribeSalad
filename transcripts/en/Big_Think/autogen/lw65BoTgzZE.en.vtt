00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.459
that's a very big question I think we're

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
that's a very big question I think we're
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.419
that's a very big question I think we're
going to lose a lot almost whatever we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
going to lose a lot almost whatever we
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.820
going to lose a lot almost whatever we
do because there's so many species right

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
do because there's so many species right
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920
do because there's so many species right
now that are on the brink of extinction

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
now that are on the brink of extinction
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.880
now that are on the brink of extinction
I mean the brink there are a number of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
I mean the brink there are a number of
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.730
I mean the brink there are a number of
tree species and flowering plant species

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
tree species and flowering plant species
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.290
tree species and flowering plant species
which are known from one individual and

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300
which are known from one individual and
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.650
which are known from one individual and
there are bird species for example that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
there are bird species for example that
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290
there are bird species for example that
are down to a few dozen individuals we

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
are down to a few dozen individuals we
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440
are down to a few dozen individuals we
have two rhinoceros species two out of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
have two rhinoceros species two out of
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200
have two rhinoceros species two out of
the five that existed on the planet that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
the five that existed on the planet that
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.209
the five that existed on the planet that
are 300 individual or fewer left so a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
are 300 individual or fewer left so a
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.450
are 300 individual or fewer left so a
lot of those were going to lose probably

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
lot of those were going to lose probably
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700
lot of those were going to lose probably
no matter what we do especially those

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
no matter what we do especially those
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.450
no matter what we do especially those
which we don't even know yet exist and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
which we don't even know yet exist and
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549
which we don't even know yet exist and
we may never know they ever existed if

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
we may never know they ever existed if
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.040
we may never know they ever existed if
they go extinct before we can learn

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
they go extinct before we can learn
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.979
they go extinct before we can learn
enough about the world's biodiversity

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989
enough about the world's biodiversity
 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.719
enough about the world's biodiversity
but if we plan our use of the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
but if we plan our use of the
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969
but if we plan our use of the
environment in the future intelligently

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
environment in the future intelligently
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.320
environment in the future intelligently
and drive toward the goal of sustainable

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
and drive toward the goal of sustainable
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.300
and drive toward the goal of sustainable
development that is development in that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
development that is development in that
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.240
development that is development in that
produces increasing quality of life and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
produces increasing quality of life and
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.320
produces increasing quality of life and
security for people but reduces the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
security for people but reduces the
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.990
security for people but reduces the
amount of materials and energy that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
amount of materials and energy that
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140
amount of materials and energy that
we're using up and if we intelligently

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
we're using up and if we intelligently
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.830
we're using up and if we intelligently
plan the establishment of reserves where

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
plan the establishment of reserves where
 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.789
plan the establishment of reserves where
we get the maximum protection for the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
we get the maximum protection for the
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.100
we get the maximum protection for the
largest number of species and that's one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
largest number of species and that's one
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749
largest number of species and that's one
thing the conservation organizations

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
thing the conservation organizations
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420
thing the conservation organizations
like Conservation International which we

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
like Conservation International which we
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.039
like Conservation International which we
have served on the board are devoted

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049
have served on the board are devoted
 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.670
have served on the board are devoted
then I think we'll save a majority of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
then I think we'll save a majority of
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.680
then I think we'll save a majority of
the remaining species

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690
the remaining species
 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.750
the remaining species
