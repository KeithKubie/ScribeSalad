evolution I'm interested in the analogy
but I think it only is an analogy and it

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829
but I think it only is an analogy and it
 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.260
but I think it only is an analogy and it
doesn't go too far

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270
doesn't go too far
 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.520
doesn't go too far
