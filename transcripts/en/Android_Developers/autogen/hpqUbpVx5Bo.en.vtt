00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.870
developers have just put out a redesign
and I hear it's a great improvement on

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880
and I hear it's a great improvement on
 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.440
and I hear it's a great improvement on
and on the on the previous look and feel

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450
and on the on the previous look and feel
 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.670
and on the on the previous look and feel
of the application and I think they've

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680
of the application and I think they've
 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920
of the application and I think they've
done a pretty decent job but we've kind

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930
done a pretty decent job but we've kind
 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.979
done a pretty decent job but we've kind
of deep done little deep dive on some of

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989
of deep done little deep dive on some of
 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.180
of deep done little deep dive on some of
the kind of fit and finish and polish

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
the kind of fit and finish and polish
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.680
the kind of fit and finish and polish
aspects of the application to really

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
aspects of the application to really
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.900
aspects of the application to really
make it shine we do yeah and just to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910
make it shine we do yeah and just to
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.660
make it shine we do yeah and just to
reiterate you know anytime we look at an

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670
reiterate you know anytime we look at an
 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.600
reiterate you know anytime we look at an
app and we provide redesigns it's really

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610
app and we provide redesigns it's really
 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.479
app and we provide redesigns it's really
not we're not saying that the the app is

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
not we're not saying that the the app is
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.430
not we're not saying that the the app is
currently designed poorly or anything

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
currently designed poorly or anything
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.380
currently designed poorly or anything
like that we're just exploring other

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
like that we're just exploring other
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.090
like that we're just exploring other
ways in which to present that kind of

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
ways in which to present that kind of
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.220
ways in which to present that kind of
that information we do sometimes look at

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
that information we do sometimes look at
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.650
that information we do sometimes look at
apps that you know are are worse I guess

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
apps that you know are are worse I guess
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.449
apps that you know are are worse I guess
generally worse from an aesthetic and in

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
generally worse from an aesthetic and in
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.870
generally worse from an aesthetic and in
a you know UI standpoint but we

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880
a you know UI standpoint but we
 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.670
a you know UI standpoint but we
definitely don't don't mean to say you

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
definitely don't don't mean to say you
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.740
definitely don't don't mean to say you
know your app sucks here's a better

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
know your app sucks here's a better
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.870
know your app sucks here's a better
version it's purely just you know here's

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880
version it's purely just you know here's
 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.030
version it's purely just you know here's
some thoughts in which that you can use

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
some thoughts in which that you can use
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.030
some thoughts in which that you can use
to improve the app so with that so this

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
to improve the app so with that so this
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.289
to improve the app so with that so this
screen this is the first screen we're

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299
screen this is the first screen we're
 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.490
screen this is the first screen we're
going to take a look at we're take a

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500
going to take a look at we're take a
 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.590
going to take a look at we're take a
look at about three or four screens this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600
look at about three or four screens this
 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.690
look at about three or four screens this
is basically the onboarding process and

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
is basically the onboarding process and
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.550
is basically the onboarding process and
it's kind of a wizard where you know it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
it's kind of a wizard where you know it
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.830
it's kind of a wizard where you know it
takes you through the different

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840
takes you through the different
 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.909
takes you through the different
different leagues and lets you kind of

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
different leagues and lets you kind of
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.039
different leagues and lets you kind of
customize what are the things you want

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
customize what are the things you want
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.000
customize what are the things you want
to see in the app what are you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010
to see in the app what are you
 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.770
to see in the app what are you
interested in I mean I'm guessing as if

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
interested in I mean I'm guessing as if
 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.159
interested in I mean I'm guessing as if
you're a football fan you're not

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169
you're a football fan you're not
 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.869
you're a football fan you're not
than every single league out there

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:24.879
than every single league out there
 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.399
than every single league out there
because there are millions you know even

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409
because there are millions you know even
 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.529
because there are millions you know even
just within the UK there you know

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539
just within the UK there you know
 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.059
just within the UK there you know
probably hundreds or thousands or

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069
probably hundreds or thousands or
 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.469
probably hundreds or thousands or
something so you can really customize

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479
something so you can really customize
 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.689
something so you can really customize
what specifically you're interested in

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699
what specifically you're interested in
 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.089
what specifically you're interested in
and then in the later steps you actually

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099
and then in the later steps you actually
 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.369
and then in the later steps you actually
gets a customized notifications which

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379
gets a customized notifications which
 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.439
gets a customized notifications which
things you want to be notified of you

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449
things you want to be notified of you
 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.059
things you want to be notified of you
know in the notification in the status

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069
know in the notification in the status
 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.959
know in the notification in the status
bar so we took a look at this screen and

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969
bar so we took a look at this screen and
 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.480
bar so we took a look at this screen and
you know we thought how can we make it

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490
you know we thought how can we make it
 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.510
you know we thought how can we make it
feel a little more Android II and so we

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520
feel a little more Android II and so we
 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.899
feel a little more Android II and so we
came up with a version that's using a

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909
came up with a version that's using a
 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.469
came up with a version that's using a
more common wizard like UI and this is

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479
more common wizard like UI and this is
 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.480
more common wizard like UI and this is
actually I posted some sample code for

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490
actually I posted some sample code for
 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.029
actually I posted some sample code for
this a few months ago is called wizard

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039
this a few months ago is called wizard
 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.850
this a few months ago is called wizard
pager so this is using some hints from

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860
pager so this is using some hints from
 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.189
pager so this is using some hints from
that wizard pager including things like

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199
that wizard pager including things like
 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.559
that wizard pager including things like
having a bottom bar for next in previous

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569
having a bottom bar for next in previous
 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.969
having a bottom bar for next in previous
it's worth noting here that you know

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979
it's worth noting here that you know
 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.499
it's worth noting here that you know
some folks think oh there's there's

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509
some folks think oh there's there's
 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.089
some folks think oh there's there's
already a back button on the device why

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099
already a back button on the device why
 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.260
already a back button on the device why
wouldn't you just use that

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270
wouldn't you just use that
 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.240
wouldn't you just use that
well actually had a talk with our design

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250
well actually had a talk with our design
 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.920
well actually had a talk with our design
team our Android user experience team

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930
team our Android user experience team
 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.230
team our Android user experience team
and they felt that in this case this is

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240
and they felt that in this case this is
 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.059
and they felt that in this case this is
actually one of those really weird edge

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069
actually one of those really weird edge
 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.739
actually one of those really weird edge
cases where you don't actually want to

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749
cases where you don't actually want to
 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.589
cases where you don't actually want to
overload the back button to go back in

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599
overload the back button to go back in
 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.529
overload the back button to go back in
the wizard since you have a very very

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539
the wizard since you have a very very
 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.070
the wizard since you have a very very
apparent on-screen next affordance so so

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080
apparent on-screen next affordance so so
 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.079
apparent on-screen next affordance so so
previous and next and at the bottom very

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089
previous and next and at the bottom very
 

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.019
previous and next and at the bottom very
similar to like an okay cancel

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029
similar to like an okay cancel
 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.089
similar to like an okay cancel
presentation in dialogues and then for

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099
presentation in dialogues and then for
 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:43.649
presentation in dialogues and then for
indicating which step you're looking at

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659
indicating which step you're looking at
 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.689
indicating which step you're looking at
there's this little kind of strip at the

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699
there's this little kind of strip at the
 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.629
there's this little kind of strip at the
top that indicates your past step one

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639
top that indicates your past step one
 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.149
top that indicates your past step one
and now you're looking at step two and

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159
and now you're looking at step two and
 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.040
and now you're looking at step two and
step two is highlighted in green which

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050
step two is highlighted in green which
 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.040
step two is highlighted in green which
is your current step additionally we we

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050
is your current step additionally we we
 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.990
is your current step additionally we we
kind of bumped up the size of the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
kind of bumped up the size of the
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.540
kind of bumped up the size of the
imagery and again in general we love to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550
imagery and again in general we love to
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.600
imagery and again in general we love to
to make images larger or image content

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610
to make images larger or image content
 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.249
to make images larger or image content
larger because it's a little more you

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259
larger because it's a little more you
 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.679
larger because it's a little more you
know engaging and so we made you know

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689
know engaging and so we made you know
 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.469
know engaging and so we made you know
the the country logo a little larger we

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479
the the country logo a little larger we
 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.079
the the country logo a little larger we
made the text a little larger and then

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089
made the text a little larger and then
 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.959
made the text a little larger and then
we also use more holo style elements for

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969
we also use more holo style elements for
 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.579
we also use more holo style elements for
the check boxes and things like that so

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:17.589
the check boxes and things like that so
 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.679
the check boxes and things like that so
some very basic stuff but overall we

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689
some very basic stuff but overall we
 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.230
some very basic stuff but overall we
kind of tweaked the screen to to more

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240
kind of tweaked the screen to to more
 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.019
kind of tweaked the screen to to more
prominently highlight the content we

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029
prominently highlight the content we
 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.459
prominently highlight the content we
actually haven't we had added an action

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469
actually haven't we had added an action
 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.529
actually haven't we had added an action
bar at the top that's using a different

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539
bar at the top that's using a different
 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.389
bar at the top that's using a different
palette an inverted palette so that it

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399
palette an inverted palette so that it

this case in a couple of things like
 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.120
this case in a couple of things like
that

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130

anything you wanted to add to our

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350
anything you wanted to add to our
 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.450
anything you wanted to add to our
wizards or just think what it might seem

like there's very small changes in the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720
like there's very small changes in the
 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.390
like there's very small changes in the
screen for me it really works because

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400
screen for me it really works because
 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.090
screen for me it really works because
the use of more standard controls is

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100
the use of more standard controls is
 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.710
the use of more standard controls is
really kind of makes it a lot easier to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720
really kind of makes it a lot easier to
 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.240
really kind of makes it a lot easier to
appreciate what's going on on this page

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250
appreciate what's going on on this page
 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.100
appreciate what's going on on this page
and that's very important when you're

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110
and that's very important when you're
 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.750
and that's very important when you're
talking about the very first thing the

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760
talking about the very first thing the
 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.370
talking about the very first thing the
users going to see when they first run

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380
users going to see when they first run
 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.630
users going to see when they first run
this application you've got this small

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640
this application you've got this small
 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.310
this application you've got this small
window of time to convince the user that

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320
window of time to convince the user that
 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.020
window of time to convince the user that
your application is easy to use and they

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030
your application is easy to use and they
 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.190
your application is easy to use and they
want to keep it and it's gonna be useful

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200
want to keep it and it's gonna be useful
 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.710
want to keep it and it's gonna be useful
so I think little bits like that you

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720
so I think little bits like that you
 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.360
so I think little bits like that you
know using the standard down controls

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370
know using the standard down controls
 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.190
know using the standard down controls
and making it immediately obvious and

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200
and making it immediately obvious and
 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.070
and making it immediately obvious and
easy to kind of like to pass the screen

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080
easy to kind of like to pass the screen
 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.180
easy to kind of like to pass the screen
is where and understand what it's

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190
is where and understand what it's
 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.560
is where and understand what it's
offering you it really really helped

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570
offering you it really really helped
 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.510
offering you it really really helped
here I mean better and better than this

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520
here I mean better and better than this
 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.300
here I mean better and better than this
might all even be to off you know some

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310
might all even be to off you know some
 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.980
might all even be to off you know some
kind of sensible defaults you might auto

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990
kind of sensible defaults you might auto
 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.630
kind of sensible defaults you might auto
detect which country they're in and home

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640
detect which country they're in and home
 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.310
detect which country they're in and home
them into some sensible defaults and

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320
them into some sensible defaults and
 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.960
them into some sensible defaults and
then allow the user to kind of go

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970
then allow the user to kind of go
 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.310
then allow the user to kind of go
through this customization flow at a

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320
through this customization flow at a
 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.560
through this customization flow at a
later point because it's it really is

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:33.570
later point because it's it really is
 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.270
later point because it's it really is
this very very crucial time the first

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280
this very very crucial time the first
 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.250
this very very crucial time the first
time I used to runs an app so yeah the

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260
time I used to runs an app so yeah the
 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.050
time I used to runs an app so yeah the
visual changes here for me we're really

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060
visual changes here for me we're really
 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.150
visual changes here for me we're really
great I mean the bar at the top on the

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160
great I mean the bar at the top on the
 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.470
great I mean the bar at the top on the
original showing which step you're

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480
original showing which step you're
 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.330
original showing which step you're
currently on it didn't really speak to

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340
currently on it didn't really speak to
 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.890
currently on it didn't really speak to
me it's quite low contrast showing the

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900
me it's quite low contrast showing the
 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.510
me it's quite low contrast showing the
current step and there's repeated icons

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
current step and there's repeated icons
 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.880
current step and there's repeated icons
right list there's the what little white

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:49.890
right list there's the what little white
 

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.920
right list there's the what little white
sliver and it's white on like a tan

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930
sliver and it's white on like a tan
 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.750
sliver and it's white on like a tan
background for the contrast is very poor

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:53.760
background for the contrast is very poor
 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.090
background for the contrast is very poor
there yeah I'm having to move your thumb

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.100
there yeah I'm having to move your thumb
 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.590
there yeah I'm having to move your thumb
like all the way to top corner to hit

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:57.600
like all the way to top corner to hit
 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.990
like all the way to top corner to hit
next and so on and though I think that

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000
next and so on and though I think that
 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.520
next and so on and though I think that
you know the small changes that we may

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
you know the small changes that we may
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.530
you know the small changes that we may
really really make this screen much

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540
really really make this screen much
 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.130
really really make this screen much
easier to kind of understand and use

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:06.140
easier to kind of understand and use
 

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.510
easier to kind of understand and use
okay and one other thing I wanted to

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520
okay and one other thing I wanted to
 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.270
okay and one other thing I wanted to
mention is in general we actually have a

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280
mention is in general we actually have a
 

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.630
mention is in general we actually have a
very good document in a design guide

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:13.640
very good document in a design guide
 

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.160
very good document in a design guide
that talks about health and as well as

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.170
that talks about health and as well as
 

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.960
that talks about health and as well as
like tutorials so in general the

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:17.970
like tutorials so in general the
 

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.790
like tutorials so in general the
guidance there is actually if you don't

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800
guidance there is actually if you don't
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.050
guidance there is actually if you don't
if the user doesn't need to make a

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060
if the user doesn't need to make a
 

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.940
if the user doesn't need to make a
decision immediately if you can just

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:22.950
decision immediately if you can just
 

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.410
decision immediately if you can just
stick with a default and that's okay for

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:24.420
stick with a default and that's okay for
 

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.230
stick with a default and that's okay for
like 60 70 % of people let them skip the

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
like 60 70 % of people let them skip the
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.060
like 60 70 % of people let them skip the
tutorial you don't want to force them to

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.070
tutorial you don't want to force them to
 

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.910
tutorial you don't want to force them to
go through something in this case you

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:31.920
go through something in this case you
 

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.070
go through something in this case you
know you could argue that the user has

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080
know you could argue that the user has
 

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.630
know you could argue that the user has
to choose you know what they're

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640
to choose you know what they're
 

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.430
to choose you know what they're
interested in because otherwise you know

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440
interested in because otherwise you know
 

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.510
interested in because otherwise you know
you won't be able to present them any

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520
you won't be able to present them any
 

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.870
you won't be able to present them any
sort of useful data but as soon as

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880
sort of useful data but as soon as
 

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.670
sort of useful data but as soon as
you're done as soon as you know you're

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680
you're done as soon as you know you're
 

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.200
you're done as soon as you know you're
done specifying the one thing you're

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.210
done specifying the one thing you're
 

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.720
done specifying the one thing you're
interested in let the users skip so find

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
interested in let the users skip so find
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.780
interested in let the users skip so find
some way to provide like a skip or just

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:49.790
some way to provide like a skip or just
 

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.260
some way to provide like a skip or just
started now function so let's let's move

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.270
started now function so let's let's move
 

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.110
started now function so let's let's move
on to the next screen which we looked at

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120
on to the next screen which we looked at
 

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.010
on to the next screen which we looked at
which was the list of matches and so on

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:00.020
which was the list of matches and so on
 

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.900
which was the list of matches and so on
the on the left here you see the list of

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:01.910
the on the left here you see the list of
 

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.210
the on the left here you see the list of
matches and you'll notice that you know

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220
matches and you'll notice that you know
 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.290
matches and you'll notice that you know
this there's actually a number of

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.300
this there's actually a number of
 

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.730
this there's actually a number of
different ways you can sort this you can

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:06.740
different ways you can sort this you can
 

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.680
different ways you can sort this you can
sort this by the league you can sort

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:08.690
sort this by the league you can sort
 

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.140
sort this by the league you can sort
this by time a number of different

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:11.150
this by time a number of different
 

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.830
this by time a number of different
things

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:11.840
things
 

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.390
things
there's also we'll show this in the next

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:13.400

is also this button here that filters by

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800
is also this button here that filters by
 

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.700
is also this button here that filters by
only live now matches so only matches

swipe left and right between yesterday
 

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.090
swipe left and right between yesterday
and tomorrow as well as today the issue

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.100
and tomorrow as well as today the issue

I found with this was that there's not

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.050
I found with this was that there's not
 

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.200
I found with this was that there's not
actually a yesterday - one in the

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.210
actually a yesterday - one in the
 

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.510
actually a yesterday - one in the
yesterday - two and so on you can only

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:37.520
yesterday - two and so on you can only
 

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.160
yesterday - two and so on you can only
see those three dates and it may be

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.170
see those three dates and it may be
 

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.260
see those three dates and it may be
because of some sort of you know policy

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.270
because of some sort of you know policy
 

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.290
because of some sort of you know policy
thing or maybe they don't have the data

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.300
thing or maybe they don't have the data
 

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.180
thing or maybe they don't have the data
but in that case you know do you really

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.190
but in that case you know do you really
 

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.430
but in that case you know do you really
need a scrollable a set of scrollable

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
need a scrollable a set of scrollable
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.820
need a scrollable a set of scrollable
tabs so what we decided to do here was

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:51.830
tabs so what we decided to do here was
 

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.830
tabs so what we decided to do here was
we kind of reimagined what it would look

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:53.840
we kind of reimagined what it would look
 

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.560
we kind of reimagined what it would look
like with just tabs and in a slightly

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.570
like with just tabs and in a slightly
 

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.290
like with just tabs and in a slightly
different color scheme we actually

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.300
different color scheme we actually
 

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.610
different color scheme we actually
tweaked the color scheme from like a a

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.620
tweaked the color scheme from like a a
 

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.420
tweaked the color scheme from like a a
very like a deep orangey brown to a

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.430
very like a deep orangey brown to a
 

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.580
very like a deep orangey brown to a
slightly more subdued brown and then we

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:06.590
slightly more subdued brown and then we
 

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.950
slightly more subdued brown and then we
used a kind of like a turf I call it a

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:08.960
used a kind of like a turf I call it a
 

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.440
used a kind of like a turf I call it a
turf green as the highlight as the

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.450
turf green as the highlight as the
 

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.750
turf green as the highlight as the
single accent that's used throughout so

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760
single accent that's used throughout so
 

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.040
single accent that's used throughout so
this kind of this a dark ish desaturated

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.050
this kind of this a dark ish desaturated
 

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.960
this kind of this a dark ish desaturated
brown combined with the green kind of

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:19.970
brown combined with the green kind of
 

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.080
brown combined with the green kind of
gives it a more earthy a little more you

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.090
gives it a more earthy a little more you
 

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.920
gives it a more earthy a little more you
know simpler feel I'd say and then we

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:26.930
know simpler feel I'd say and then we
 

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.170
know simpler feel I'd say and then we
also you know switched over to the fixed

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:29.180
also you know switched over to the fixed
 

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.310
also you know switched over to the fixed
tabs to show yesterday today and

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320
tabs to show yesterday today and
 

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.930
tabs to show yesterday today and
tomorrow and again you should still be

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:31.940
tomorrow and again you should still be
 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.390
tomorrow and again you should still be
able to swipe between the three we also

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:34.400
able to swipe between the three we also
 

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.730
able to swipe between the three we also
removed the navigation drawer and switch

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:36.740
removed the navigation drawer and switch
 

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.250
removed the navigation drawer and switch
to an action bar spinner and I'll talk

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:39.260
to an action bar spinner and I'll talk
 

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.110
to an action bar spinner and I'll talk
about that on the next the next slide

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120
about that on the next the next slide
 

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.150
about that on the next the next slide
and then we used a slightly different

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160
and then we used a slightly different
 

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.070
and then we used a slightly different
presentation for the actual content the

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.080
presentation for the actual content the
 

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.070
presentation for the actual content the
actual matches themselves we made we

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:48.080
actual matches themselves we made we
 

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.890
actual matches themselves we made we
slightly made the live matches a little

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:50.900
slightly made the live matches a little
 

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.770
slightly made the live matches a little
more prominent in that left column here

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:53.780
more prominent in that left column here
 

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.900
more prominent in that left column here
you'll see that live matches are kind of

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
you'll see that live matches are kind of
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.330
you'll see that live matches are kind of
highlighted in green and then anytime

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:58.340
highlighted in green and then anytime
 

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.280
highlighted in green and then anytime
you have set up notifications for

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:00.290
you have set up notifications for
 

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.379
you have set up notifications for
individual

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:01.389
individual
 

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:02.759
individual
if you decided that you know I really

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:02.769
if you decided that you know I really
 

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:04.079
if you decided that you know I really
want to follow what happens in this

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:04.089
want to follow what happens in this
 

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:06.329
want to follow what happens in this
match you should you see a little kind

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:06.339
match you should you see a little kind
 

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:08.039
match you should you see a little kind
of green tick at the very top right and

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:08.049
of green tick at the very top right and
 

00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:10.409
of green tick at the very top right and
it's not interactive it's probably worth

00:11:10.409 --> 00:11:10.419
it's not interactive it's probably worth
 

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:11.849
it's not interactive it's probably worth
mentioning that if you wanted to make

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:11.859
mentioning that if you wanted to make
 

00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:13.769
mentioning that if you wanted to make
this interactive have like a

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:13.779
this interactive have like a
 

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:16.169
this interactive have like a
notification button right in line with

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:16.179
notification button right in line with
 

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.519
notification button right in line with
the list item this should look very

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:17.529
the list item this should look very
 

00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:19.739
the list item this should look very
different but this very is a very clear

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:19.749
different but this very is a very clear
 

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:21.449
different but this very is a very clear
signal that it's not interactive it's

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:21.459
signal that it's not interactive it's
 

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:24.749
signal that it's not interactive it's
purely an indicator we also bumped up

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:24.759
purely an indicator we also bumped up
 

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.329
purely an indicator we also bumped up
the again we bumped up the country flags

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:27.339
the again we bumped up the country flags
 

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:29.789
the again we bumped up the country flags
a little bit just to to make that pop a

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:29.799
a little bit just to to make that pop a
 

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:31.169
a little bit just to to make that pop a
little more since that's probably

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:31.179
little more since that's probably
 

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:32.339
little more since that's probably
something that's gonna get your

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:32.349
something that's gonna get your
 

00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:35.369
something that's gonna get your
attention fairly quickly and we used

00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:35.379
attention fairly quickly and we used
 

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:38.459
attention fairly quickly and we used
Roboto thin actually Roboto light here

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:38.469
Roboto thin actually Roboto light here
 

00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:41.399
Roboto thin actually Roboto light here
as well as Roboto bold condensed to show

as well as Roboto bold condensed to show
 

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:44.789
as well as Roboto bold condensed to show
the actual current scores so now there

00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:44.799
the actual current scores so now there
 

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:47.249
the actual current scores so now there
was a those whammy is there anything

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:47.259
was a those whammy is there anything
 

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:48.659
was a those whammy is there anything
else you wanted to mention Nick on the

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:48.669
else you wanted to mention Nick on the

screen just I'm it's got some room to

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:52.179
screen just I'm it's got some room to
 

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:53.969
screen just I'm it's got some room to
breathe now I think that the last screen

00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:53.979
breathe now I think that the last screen
 

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:56.239
breathe now I think that the last screen
there before version as it were and

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:56.249
there before version as it were and
 

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:59.249
there before version as it were and
tried to stuff a lot of content into the

00:11:59.249 --> 00:11:59.259
tried to stuff a lot of content into the
 

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:01.469
tried to stuff a lot of content into the
screen and in doing so made it less

00:12:01.469 --> 00:12:01.479
screen and in doing so made it less
 

00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:03.509
screen and in doing so made it less
possible like you I find it quite hard

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519
possible like you I find it quite hard
 

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.919
possible like you I find it quite hard
to kind of like find the individual

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:04.929
to kind of like find the individual
 

00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:07.109
to kind of like find the individual
event I'm looking for so in the

00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:07.119
event I'm looking for so in the
 

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:09.209
event I'm looking for so in the
reimagining I really like the way that

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:09.219
reimagining I really like the way that
 

00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:11.489
reimagining I really like the way that
you use them space and color and

00:12:11.489 --> 00:12:11.499
you use them space and color and
 

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:14.069
you use them space and color and
contrast to you and to really kind of

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079
contrast to you and to really kind of
 

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.899
contrast to you and to really kind of
give a hierarchy to the information so

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:15.909
give a hierarchy to the information so
 

00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:17.309
give a hierarchy to the information so
it's really easy to find you know the

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:17.319
it's really easy to find you know the
 

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:18.689
it's really easy to find you know the
section you're looking for than the game

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:18.699
section you're looking for than the game
 

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:20.969
section you're looking for than the game
you're looking for or things like that

00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:20.979
you're looking for or things like that
 

00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:22.409
you're looking for or things like that
are important like a goal that's just

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:22.419
are important like a goal that's just
 

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:24.809
are important like a goal that's just
scored or game is on now really jump out

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:24.819
scored or game is on now really jump out
 

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:26.819
scored or game is on now really jump out
so I think the information hierarchy is

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:26.829
so I think the information hierarchy is
 

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.949
so I think the information hierarchy is
really what's things here for me I think

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959
really what's things here for me I think
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.959
really what's things here for me I think
one of the biggest contrasts here is the

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:30.969
one of the biggest contrasts here is the
 

00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:32.489
one of the biggest contrasts here is the
information density you'll see on the

00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:32.499
information density you'll see on the
 

00:12:32.499 --> 00:12:34.529
information density you'll see on the
left and in the current screen the

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:34.539
left and in the current screen the
 

00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:36.029
left and in the current screen the
information density is very high so

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:36.039
information density is very high so
 

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:38.069
information density is very high so
there's you can see a lot of matches all

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079
there's you can see a lot of matches all
 

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:40.769
there's you can see a lot of matches all
at once but I mean my guess is in

00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:40.779
at once but I mean my guess is in
 

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:42.149
at once but I mean my guess is in
general if you're you know if you're a

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:42.159
general if you're you know if you're a
 

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:45.119
general if you're you know if you're a
fan following you know just a few games

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:45.129
fan following you know just a few games
 

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:46.469
fan following you know just a few games
that are happening now you probably

00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:46.479
that are happening now you probably
 

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:48.179
that are happening now you probably
don't really care about all that

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:48.189
don't really care about all that
 

00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:49.559
don't really care about all that
information you probably do care about

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:49.569
information you probably do care about
 

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:52.129
information you probably do care about
you know the two or three current games

00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139
you know the two or three current games
 

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.839
you know the two or three current games
as well as maybe you know a specific

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:54.849
as well as maybe you know a specific
 

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:57.349
as well as maybe you know a specific
league that has games today

00:12:57.349 --> 00:12:57.359
league that has games today
 

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:01.169
league that has games today
so it's don't don't be afraid of letting

00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:01.179
so it's don't don't be afraid of letting

and lowering slightly lowering
 

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:08.699
and lowering slightly lowering
information density it'll make things a

00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:08.709
information density it'll make things a
 

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:10.139
information density it'll make things a
little more readable as well as you know

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:10.149
little more readable as well as you know

wanted to talk about and this is the
 

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.150
wanted to talk about and this is the
navigation jar versus the action bar

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160
navigation jar versus the action bar
 

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.190
navigation jar versus the action bar

things like matches competitions and
teams which are kind of like the top

and more and this is this is something
 

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.650
and more and this is this is something
that we should we pointed out on the

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:40.660
that we should we pointed out on the
 

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.230

things like settings or help or about or
 

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.840
things like settings or help or about or
even just more stuff they generally

even just more stuff they generally
 

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.280
even just more stuff they generally
don't belong you know immediately

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.290
don't belong you know immediately
 

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.410
don't belong you know immediately
on-screen or hmm

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:52.420
on-screen or hmm
 

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.880
on-screen or hmm
in the primary navigation area and we

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:56.890
in the primary navigation area and we
 

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.920
in the primary navigation area and we
we've specifically kind of outlined that

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:58.930
we've specifically kind of outlined that
 

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.840
we've specifically kind of outlined that
things like settings help about Terms of

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
things like settings help about Terms of
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.550
things like settings help about Terms of
Service privacy policy those should

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560
Service privacy policy those should
 

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.170
Service privacy policy those should
really belong in the action bar overflow

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.180
really belong in the action bar overflow
 

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.000
really belong in the action bar overflow
so when you press this action bar

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.010
so when you press this action bar
 

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.769
so when you press this action bar
overflow here in the action bar you

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:07.779
overflow here in the action bar you
 

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.300
overflow here in the action bar you
should see things like settings and help

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:09.310
should see things like settings and help
 

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.730
should see things like settings and help
and about so we would probably move

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:11.740
and about so we would probably move
 

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.829
and about so we would probably move
things like that to there so if you

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839
things like that to there so if you
 

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:14.880
things like that to there so if you
remove settings and more you're just

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:14.890
remove settings and more you're just
 

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.820
remove settings and more you're just
left with three items and with you know

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:17.830
left with three items and with you know
 

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.040
left with three items and with you know
only three items to choose from three

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.050
only three items to choose from three
 

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.800
only three items to choose from three
navigational components the the

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:22.810
navigational components the the
 

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.360
navigational components the the
navigation drawer becomes a little bear

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.370
navigation drawer becomes a little bear
 

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.490
navigation drawer becomes a little bear
and so what you could do instead is you

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:26.500
and so what you could do instead is you
 

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.699
and so what you could do instead is you
could either use tabs or an action bar

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:29.709
could either use tabs or an action bar
 

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:32.490
could either use tabs or an action bar
spinner now in this case we were already

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:32.500
spinner now in this case we were already
 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.040
spinner now in this case we were already
using tabs to switch between yesterday

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.050
using tabs to switch between yesterday
 

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.930
using tabs to switch between yesterday
today and tomorrow and so we decided to

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:36.940
today and tomorrow and so we decided to
 

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.670
today and tomorrow and so we decided to
switch to the action bar spinner is the

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680
switch to the action bar spinner is the
 

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.690
switch to the action bar spinner is the
top-level core kind of structural

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:41.700
top-level core kind of structural
 

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.610
top-level core kind of structural
navigational component and so there you

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:44.620
navigational component and so there you
 

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.290
navigational component and so there you
can switch between matches competitive

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:46.300
can switch between matches competitive
 

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.060
can switch between matches competitive
competitions and teams and it very

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.070
competitions and teams and it very
 

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.389
competitions and teams and it very
clearly it makes clear the three main

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399
clearly it makes clear the three main
 

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:57.240
clearly it makes clear the three main
sections of the app so let's move on to

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.250
sections of the app so let's move on to
 

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.460
sections of the app so let's move on to
the next component or the next screen

00:14:59.460 --> 00:14:59.470
the next component or the next screen
 

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.139
the next component or the next screen
that we've looked at which was the match

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:01.149
that we've looked at which was the match
 

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:03.510
that we've looked at which was the match
detail screen and in the match details

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:03.520
detail screen and in the match details
 

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.690
detail screen and in the match details
screen we looked at a couple things

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:05.700
screen we looked at a couple things
 

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.860
screen we looked at a couple things
specifically we looked at the statistics

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
specifically we looked at the statistics
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.019
specifically we looked at the statistics
tab we also looked at just the

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:10.029
tab we also looked at just the
 

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:12.569
tab we also looked at just the
presentation of the current game state

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:12.579
presentation of the current game state
 

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.269
presentation of the current game state
so on the left you'll notice that you

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279
so on the left you'll notice that you
 

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:19.230
so on the left you'll notice that you
know you have this the position title

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240
know you have this the position title
 

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.819
know you have this the position title
strip or the scrollable tabs at the top

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:20.829
strip or the scrollable tabs at the top
 

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:22.890
strip or the scrollable tabs at the top
and then the content at the bottom and

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:22.900
and then the content at the bottom and
 

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.480
and then the content at the bottom and
then somewhere in the middle is actually

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:24.490
then somewhere in the middle is actually
 

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.530
then somewhere in the middle is actually
a fixed pane or a fixed

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540
a fixed pane or a fixed
 

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.569
a fixed pane or a fixed
I guess a fixed UI element that

00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579
I guess a fixed UI element that
 

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:31.039
I guess a fixed UI element that
indicates the current state of the game

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:31.049
indicates the current state of the game
 

00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:33.289
indicates the current state of the game
and so as you're swiping left and right

00:15:33.289 --> 00:15:33.299
and so as you're swiping left and right
 

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.960
and so as you're swiping left and right
on the content or on the top of

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:35.970
on the content or on the top of
 

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.809
on the content or on the top of
scrollable tabs the middle part stays

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:38.819
scrollable tabs the middle part stays
 

00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:40.579
scrollable tabs the middle part stays
fixed by the top and bottom actually

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:40.589
fixed by the top and bottom actually
 

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:42.889
fixed by the top and bottom actually
slide together and so it kind of loses

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899
slide together and so it kind of loses
 

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:45.650
slide together and so it kind of loses
that feeling of of connectivity that in

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660
that feeling of of connectivity that in
 

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.869
that feeling of of connectivity that in
or like almost like this tactile feeling

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:47.879
or like almost like this tactile feeling
 

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:49.429
or like almost like this tactile feeling
that you're actually moving a single

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:49.439
that you're actually moving a single
 

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:52.069
that you're actually moving a single
surface and so what we decided to do is

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079
surface and so what we decided to do is
 

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:54.169
surface and so what we decided to do is
actually flip the two and we move the

00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:54.179
actually flip the two and we move the
 

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:58.249
actually flip the two and we move the
the scrollable tabs below the data fixed

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:58.259
the scrollable tabs below the data fixed
 

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:00.619
the scrollable tabs below the data fixed
pain at the top we also tweaked the

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:00.629
pain at the top we also tweaked the
 

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:03.829
pain at the top we also tweaked the
presentation to to again kind of fall in

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839
presentation to to again kind of fall in
 

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.780
presentation to to again kind of fall in
with our with our color scheme of that

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:05.790
with our with our color scheme of that
 

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.739
with our with our color scheme of that
brown and green and we also used basic

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:09.749
brown and green and we also used basic
 

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:12.499
brown and green and we also used basic
text contrast like like dark on on

00:16:12.499 --> 00:16:12.509
text contrast like like dark on on
 

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:16.849
text contrast like like dark on on
accent or white on accent to again show

00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:16.859
accent or white on accent to again show
 

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:18.590
accent or white on accent to again show
or guess more prominently show the

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600
or guess more prominently show the
 

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.179
or guess more prominently show the
visual hierarchy of the information you

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:20.189
visual hierarchy of the information you
 

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:21.169
visual hierarchy of the information you
know the most important thing on the

00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:21.179
know the most important thing on the
 

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:22.639
know the most important thing on the
screen right now is the current score to

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:22.649
screen right now is the current score to
 

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.970
screen right now is the current score to
the one as well as you know alternate or

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:24.980
the one as well as you know alternate or
 

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.769
the one as well as you know alternate or
alter your elements such as the the

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779
alter your elements such as the the
 

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.479
alter your elements such as the the
names of the teams as well as the the

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:29.489
names of the teams as well as the the
 

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:33.229
names of the teams as well as the the
current time and then we we took a look

00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:33.239
current time and then we we took a look
 

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:34.879
current time and then we we took a look
at statistics how can we make statistics

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:34.889
at statistics how can we make statistics
 

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:36.979
at statistics how can we make statistics
look better in general not much to say

00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:36.989
look better in general not much to say
 

00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:38.449
look better in general not much to say
here we just again use the same color

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459
here we just again use the same color
 

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:41.509
here we just again use the same color
scheme we simplified everything into a

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519
scheme we simplified everything into a
 

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:43.519
scheme we simplified everything into a
single row of information you notice

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:43.529
single row of information you notice
 

00:16:43.529 --> 00:16:44.840
single row of information you notice
that on the left you have a row

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:44.850
that on the left you have a row
 

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.139
that on the left you have a row
indicating the details and then a row

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:48.149
indicating the details and then a row
 

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:50.539
indicating the details and then a row
for the progress bar we sent or not only

00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:50.549
for the progress bar we sent or not only
 

00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:51.949
for the progress bar we sent or not only
the progress bar I guess the the stats

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959
the progress bar I guess the the stats
 

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:54.229
the progress bar I guess the the stats
bar we simply integrated the two into a

00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:54.239
bar we simply integrated the two into a
 

00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.909
bar we simply integrated the two into a
single row so that it's much easier to

00:16:55.909 --> 00:16:55.919
single row so that it's much easier to
 

00:16:55.919 --> 00:17:00.470
single row so that it's much easier to
scan alright so that was I was a doozy

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480
scan alright so that was I was a doozy
 

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.679
scan alright so that was I was a doozy
Nick anything you want to add here

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:02.689
Nick anything you want to add here
 

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.419
Nick anything you want to add here
pretty nicely like yeah I think the

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:05.429
pretty nicely like yeah I think the
 

00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:07.100
pretty nicely like yeah I think the
presentation really works much better

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.110
presentation really works much better
 

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.049
presentation really works much better
it's a lot more plausible you can just

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059
it's a lot more plausible you can just
 

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:10.730
it's a lot more plausible you can just
kind of have a glance and see which way

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740
kind of have a glance and see which way
 

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.669
kind of have a glance and see which way
the game is going by the stats and as

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679
the game is going by the stats and as
 

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:15.110
the game is going by the stats and as
well yeah I completely agree about

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120
well yeah I completely agree about
 

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.169
well yeah I completely agree about
connecting that page a title strip to

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179
connecting that page a title strip to
 

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:20.539
connecting that page a title strip to
the actual view pager it felt quite

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:20.549
the actual view pager it felt quite
 

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:22.819
the actual view pager it felt quite
disconnected before before version when

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:22.829
disconnected before before version when
 

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.230
disconnected before before version when
you're moving the body of the content

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240
you're moving the body of the content
 

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.699
you're moving the body of the content
and there's a stationary pair between

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:25.709
and there's a stationary pair between
 

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:27.439
and there's a stationary pair between
you and the tab strip moving it felt

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:27.449
you and the tab strip moving it felt
 

00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:29.389
you and the tab strip moving it felt
very disconnected so that's good change

00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:29.399
very disconnected so that's good change
 

00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:31.730
very disconnected so that's good change
there another thing I'll mention is that

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740
there another thing I'll mention is that
 

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.049
there another thing I'll mention is that
in the previous sorry in the previous or

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059
in the previous sorry in the previous or
 

00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:39.080
in the previous sorry in the previous or
in the current details for the game

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.090
in the current details for the game
 

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.159
in the current details for the game
what it was the current game state

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:40.169
what it was the current game state
 

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:42.260
what it was the current game state
you'll see that there's a little

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.270
you'll see that there's a little
 

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.149
you'll see that there's a little
notification icon it's not interactive

00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:44.159
notification icon it's not interactive
 

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:45.919
notification icon it's not interactive
and it's so it's not really useful it's

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:45.929
and it's so it's not really useful it's
 

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:47.480
and it's so it's not really useful it's
just an indicator saying that yes you

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:47.490
just an indicator saying that yes you
 

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.919
just an indicator saying that yes you
have notifications turn on for this game

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:48.929
have notifications turn on for this game
 

00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:51.529
have notifications turn on for this game
or not so we actually made that an

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539
or not so we actually made that an
 

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.360
or not so we actually made that an
action bar icon so that when you touch

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:53.370
action bar icon so that when you touch
 

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.399
action bar icon so that when you touch
that it toggles the state of whether or

00:17:55.399 --> 00:17:55.409
that it toggles the state of whether or
 

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:58.090
that it toggles the state of whether or
not you want notifications for the game

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.100
not you want notifications for the game
 

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.350
not you want notifications for the game
all right so let's let's move to the

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360
all right so let's let's move to the
 

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.210
all right so let's let's move to the
next screen which is the tablet mark up

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220
next screen which is the tablet mark up
 

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.390
next screen which is the tablet mark up
and Nikki want to talk about this one

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400
and Nikki want to talk about this one
 

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.090
and Nikki want to talk about this one
yeah so here we've refocused on the

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100
yeah so here we've refocused on the
 

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.399
yeah so here we've refocused on the
in-game experience we figured that

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:10.409
in-game experience we figured that
 

00:18:10.409 --> 00:18:12.560
in-game experience we figured that
tablet is mostly going to be used can I

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:12.570
tablet is mostly going to be used can I
 

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.880
tablet is mostly going to be used can I
guess at at home you were watching the

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:13.890
guess at at home you were watching the
 

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.049
guess at at home you were watching the
game already and you're kind of wanting

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059
game already and you're kind of wanting
 

00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.399
game already and you're kind of wanting
to kind of have a second screen

00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:16.409
to kind of have a second screen
 

00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:18.620
to kind of have a second screen
experience so what we try to do here is

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:18.630
experience so what we try to do here is
 

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.539
experience so what we try to do here is
float up all the different sections that

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:20.549
float up all the different sections that
 

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:22.639
float up all the different sections that
on the phone version the owner and the

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:22.649
on the phone version the owner and the
 

00:18:22.649 --> 00:18:25.010
on the phone version the owner and the
kind of view pager type set up onto a

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020
kind of view pager type set up onto a
 

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.710
kind of view pager type set up onto a
single kind of hire a single dashboard

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720
single kind of hire a single dashboard
 

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.210
single kind of hire a single dashboard
so as Roman pointed out the most

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220
so as Roman pointed out the most
 

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.370
so as Roman pointed out the most
important thing on the screen and is you

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380
important thing on the screen and is you

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:35.850
so we've made that kind of very very big
 

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.639
so we've made that kind of very very big
emboldened very clear exactly what's

00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:37.649

who's playing in the roster so we've

00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:02.909
who's playing in the roster so we've
 

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:05.240
who's playing in the roster so we've
really tried to use the extra real

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.250
really tried to use the extra real
 

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.860
really tried to use the extra real
estate to kind of make information

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:06.870
estate to kind of make information
 

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.389
estate to kind of make information
easier to get out and it kind of a bit

00:19:08.389 --> 00:19:08.399
easier to get out and it kind of a bit
 

00:19:08.399 --> 00:19:11.120
easier to get out and it kind of a bit
more playful and visual and then the

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.130
more playful and visual and then the
 

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.310
more playful and visual and then the
phone kind of view page is set up but

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320
phone kind of view page is set up but
 

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.600
phone kind of view page is set up but
while retaining the most important

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.610
while retaining the most important
 

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.149
while retaining the most important
information on the screen the whole time

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:16.159
information on the screen the whole time
 

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:17.990
information on the screen the whole time
yeah and I think that you know the

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000
yeah and I think that you know the
 

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.630
yeah and I think that you know the
addition of the logos for the teams is

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640
addition of the logos for the teams is
 

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.549
addition of the logos for the teams is
also another way to to use visual

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559
also another way to to use visual
 

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.080
also another way to to use visual
elements to better kind of hint at

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.090
elements to better kind of hint at
 

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.860
elements to better kind of hint at
what's going on

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:24.870
what's going on
 

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.080
what's going on
so you could do even more here you could

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.090
so you could do even more here you could
 

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.690
so you could do even more here you could
do like things like you could have the

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700
do like things like you could have the
 

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.330
do like things like you could have the
the background use the or or take the

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340
the background use the or or take the
 

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.500
the background use the or or take the
team logos and use them in the

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.510
team logos and use them in the
 

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.870
team logos and use them in the
background look up in a blurry state you

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880
background look up in a blurry state you
 

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.010
background look up in a blurry state you
can really make this like really

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.020
can really make this like really
 

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.330
can really make this like really

that space try as best as possible to
 

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.440
that space try as best as possible to
represent what the user will benefit

example is there's a little side project

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:45.650
example is there's a little side project
 

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.680
example is there's a little side project
that I worked on that was just basically

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:47.690
that I worked on that was just basically
 

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.490
that I worked on that was just basically
a single text box notepad and the icon

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:51.500
a single text box notepad and the icon
 

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.770
a single text box notepad and the icon
was literally just a text box it was it

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:53.780
was literally just a text box it was it
 

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.630
was literally just a text box it was it
showed a little cursor and you know it

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640
showed a little cursor and you know it
 

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.460
showed a little cursor and you know it
showed the text box so you can do things

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:57.470
showed the text box so you can do things
 

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.960
showed the text box so you can do things
like that you don't necessarily have to

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:58.970
like that you don't necessarily have to
 

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.880
like that you don't necessarily have to

use this this selected e synecdoche - to
 

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.280

take like this very abstract idea and

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.290
take like this very abstract idea and
 

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:07.840
take like this very abstract idea and
and compress it down into a single

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:07.850
and compress it down into a single
 

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.240
and compress it down into a single
little object but certainly that's one

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.250
little object but certainly that's one
 

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.150
little object but certainly that's one
possible way so let's look at some

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:13.160
possible way so let's look at some
 

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.850
possible way so let's look at some
guidelines on Launcher icons again the

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:15.860
guidelines on Launcher icons again the
 

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.550
guidelines on Launcher icons again the

tablets for Nexus 10 specifically you
 

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.410
tablets for Nexus 10 specifically you
should provide an xxhdpi icon and that's

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.420
should provide an xxhdpi icon and that's
 

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.180
should provide an xxhdpi icon and that's
144 by 144 pixels also when you upload

generally you know what we found is you
 

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.160

can probably start by you know designing

can probably start by you know designing
 

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.370

a 512 by 512 maybe actually use 576 by

a 512 by 512 maybe actually use 576 by
 

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.980
a 512 by 512 maybe actually use 576 by
576 for some reason now you can start

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:56.990
576 for some reason now you can start
 

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.600
576 for some reason now you can start
with that and then slowly scale down

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:58.610
with that and then slowly scale down
 

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.310
with that and then slowly scale down
it's generally a good idea to start

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320
it's generally a good idea to start
 

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.020
it's generally a good idea to start
large and scale down rather than vice

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.030
large and scale down rather than vice
 

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.960
large and scale down rather than vice

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:04.970
versa and then in terms of padding this
 

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.130

is something that that's definitely

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.140
is something that that's definitely

changed over the years for Android we

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.050
changed over the years for Android we
 

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.020
changed over the years for Android we
used to request a fairly large padding

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.030
used to request a fairly large padding
 

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.640
used to request a fairly large padding
region but these days you should really

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:12.650
region but these days you should really
 

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.039
region but these days you should really
just

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:13.049
just
 

00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:15.440
just
use either the full image size meaning

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:15.450
use either the full image size meaning
 

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.779
use either the full image size meaning
no padding or if you have a very very

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:17.789
no padding or if you have a very very
 

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:21.440
no padding or if you have a very very
square icon then try to use about three

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:21.450
square icon then try to use about three
 

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.869

dips of pad and give or take it's really

dips of pad and give or take it's really
 

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.220
dips of pad and give or take it's really
up to you but in general you know try to

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.230
up to you but in general you know try to
 

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.769
up to you but in general you know try to
make it fit in nicely with the rest of

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:27.779
make it fit in nicely with the rest of
 

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.299
make it fit in nicely with the rest of
the system icons as well as third-party

the system icons as well as third-party
 

00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:31.369
the system icons as well as third-party
icons and those are generally going to

icons and those are generally going to
 

00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:33.590
icons and those are generally going to
take up the full image size or have

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600
take up the full image size or have
 

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.639
take up the full image size or have
about one to three dips of padding

now you're nailing it all right let's do

00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059
now you're nailing it all right let's do
 

00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:45.799
now you're nailing it all right let's do

so a couple more guidelines try to use a

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.210
so a couple more guidelines try to use a
 

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.940
so a couple more guidelines try to use a
distinct silhouette so don't just you

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:49.950
distinct silhouette so don't just you
 

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.580
distinct silhouette so don't just you
know stick some some graphic inside of a

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:52.590
know stick some some graphic inside of a
 

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.129
know stick some some graphic inside of a
square or a circle that can work for for

00:24:55.129 --> 00:24:55.139
square or a circle that can work for for
 

00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:57.080
square or a circle that can work for for
now at work as a default but try to

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.090
now at work as a default but try to
 

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.519
now at work as a default but try to
really use a distinct silhouette and

00:24:58.519 --> 00:24:58.529
really use a distinct silhouette and
 

00:24:58.529 --> 00:24:59.840
really use a distinct silhouette and
we'll show good examples of that in a

00:24:59.840 --> 00:24:59.850
we'll show good examples of that in a
 

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.989
we'll show good examples of that in a
bit also you know keep it simple at the

00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:02.999
bit also you know keep it simple at the
 

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:05.629
bit also you know keep it simple at the
top make sure that your icon you know

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:05.639
top make sure that your icon you know
 

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:07.129
top make sure that your icon you know
when it's good when it's scaled down it

00:25:07.129 --> 00:25:07.139
when it's good when it's scaled down it
 

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.810
when it's good when it's scaled down it
still means something it still makes

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.820
still means something it still makes
 

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.539
still means something it still makes
sense but at the very micro level feel

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:11.549

don't try to mimic other platforms so

00:25:20.599 --> 00:25:20.609
don't try to mimic other platforms so
 

00:25:20.609 --> 00:25:22.190
don't try to mimic other platforms so
you know if you have an existing app on

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200
you know if you have an existing app on
 

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.619
you know if you have an existing app on

don't just simply copy over your icon

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:27.029
don't just simply copy over your icon
 

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:28.999
don't just simply copy over your icon
it's okay to copy over the general idea

00:25:28.999 --> 00:25:29.009
it's okay to copy over the general idea
 

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:30.799
it's okay to copy over the general idea
for the icon but make sure that it fits

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:30.809
for the icon but make sure that it fits
 

00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:32.060
for the icon but make sure that it fits
well with the rest of the system and

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:32.070
well with the rest of the system and
 

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.190
well with the rest of the system and
fits in with the guidelines so let's

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200
fits in with the guidelines so let's
 

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.659
fits in with the guidelines so let's
look at actually before we look at some

00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:35.669
look at actually before we look at some
 

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:38.239
look at actually before we look at some
examples we recently made changes to the

00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:38.249
examples we recently made changes to the
 

00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:39.979
examples we recently made changes to the
guidelines in the sense that it used to

00:25:39.979 --> 00:25:39.989
guidelines in the sense that it used to
 

00:25:39.989 --> 00:25:41.539
guidelines in the sense that it used to
be just you know facing forward you

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:41.549
be just you know facing forward you
 

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:43.220
be just you know facing forward you
should make your icon facing forward but

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:43.230
should make your icon facing forward but
 

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.320
should make your icon facing forward but
now there's a slight 3d perspective and

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:45.330
now there's a slight 3d perspective and
 

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.729
now there's a slight 3d perspective and
you'll see some examples here there's

00:25:46.729 --> 00:25:46.739
you'll see some examples here there's
 

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:49.580
you'll see some examples here there's
you know just a few dips of perspective

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:49.590
you know just a few dips of perspective
 

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.289
you know just a few dips of perspective
that you see at the very top and here's

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299
that you see at the very top and here's
 

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.909
that you see at the very top and here's
the rough kind of camera angle that you

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919
the rough kind of camera angle that you
 

00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:54.409
the rough kind of camera angle that you
could use to achieve that we don't have

00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419
could use to achieve that we don't have
 

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.849
could use to achieve that we don't have
any numbers or dimensions or anything

00:25:55.849 --> 00:25:55.859
any numbers or dimensions or anything
 

00:25:55.859 --> 00:25:57.979

design news and again we're way over

00:28:56.419 --> 00:28:56.429
design news and again we're way over
 

00:28:56.429 --> 00:28:58.759
design news and again we're way over
time but I think this is actually pretty

00:28:58.759 --> 00:28:58.769
time but I think this is actually pretty
 

00:28:58.769 --> 00:29:00.799

good for a scheduling kerfuffle not a
 

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:02.359
good for a scheduling kerfuffle not a
scheduling problem but the kerfuffle

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:02.369
scheduling problem but the kerfuffle
 

00:29:02.369 --> 00:29:03.619
scheduling problem but the kerfuffle
that happened with our technology in the

00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:03.629
that happened with our technology in the
 

00:29:03.629 --> 00:29:06.859
that happened with our technology in the
beginning so for design news we have

00:29:06.859 --> 00:29:06.869
beginning so for design news we have
 

00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:08.419

cook has actually provided some PS DS of
 

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:17.329
cook has actually provided some PS DS of
a couple example icons and it's very

00:29:17.329 --> 00:29:17.339
a couple example icons and it's very
 

00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:18.499
a couple example icons and it's very
similar to the boiler plates and

00:29:18.499 --> 00:29:18.509
similar to the boiler plates and
 

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:19.549
similar to the boiler plates and
essentially you can you know drop in

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559
essentially you can you know drop in
 

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.739
essentially you can you know drop in
your stuff and and tweak it in Photoshop

00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:21.749

actually has been posting a whole bunch
 

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.829
actually has been posting a whole bunch
of different examples design concepts to

00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:48.839
of different examples design concepts to
 

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:50.119
of different examples design concepts to
the google+ community and i think some

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:50.129
the google+ community and i think some
 

00:29:50.129 --> 00:29:51.229
the google+ community and i think some
of them are really wonderful this

00:29:51.229 --> 00:29:51.239
of them are really wonderful this
 

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:53.509

specific one has a really unique color

00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519
specific one has a really unique color
 

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.950
specific one has a really unique color
palette and it's I think it's just

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960
palette and it's I think it's just
 

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.899
palette and it's I think it's just
really well done the you know the

00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:56.909
really well done the you know the
 

00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:58.129
really well done the you know the
information that you're currently

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:58.139
information that you're currently
 

00:29:58.139 --> 00:29:59.509
information that you're currently
looking at the most important

00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519
looking at the most important
 

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:01.519
looking at the most important
information the the unit conversion

00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:01.529
information the the unit conversion
 

00:30:01.529 --> 00:30:03.499
information the the unit conversion
right converting between kilometers and

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:03.509
right converting between kilometers and
 

00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:05.869
right converting between kilometers and
meters for example that pops immediately

00:30:05.869 --> 00:30:05.879
meters for example that pops immediately
 

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:08.329
meters for example that pops immediately
nothing else has as much contrast as

00:30:08.329 --> 00:30:08.339
nothing else has as much contrast as
 

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:10.070
nothing else has as much contrast as
that I think that that's just like one

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080
that I think that that's just like one
 

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.529
that I think that that's just like one
of the one of the better designs we've

00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539
of the one of the better designs we've
 

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:13.969
of the one of the better designs we've
seen from the community and also you

00:30:13.969 --> 00:30:13.979
seen from the community and also you
 

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:15.739
seen from the community and also you
could there's a little drag candles on

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:15.749
could there's a little drag candles on
 

00:30:15.749 --> 00:30:17.469
could there's a little drag candles on
the lefts that you could switch between

00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:17.479
the lefts that you could switch between
 

00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:19.310
the lefts that you could switch between
converting from kilometers to meters

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320
converting from kilometers to meters
 

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:24.259
converting from kilometers to meters
right usually all right and the last I

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:24.269
right usually all right and the last I
 

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:26.680
right usually all right and the last I
think the last piece of design news is

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:26.690
think the last piece of design news is
 

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.299
think the last piece of design news is
so we talked a lot about apps on the

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:29.309
so we talked a lot about apps on the
 

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:30.440
so we talked a lot about apps on the
show but we don't really talk about

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:30.450
show but we don't really talk about
 

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.200
show but we don't really talk about
games and that's because mostly you know

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.210
games and that's because mostly you know
 

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.659
games and that's because mostly you know
usually games have their own very very

00:30:35.659 --> 00:30:35.669
usually games have their own very very
 

00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:39.049
usually games have their own very very
custom bespoke UI and this is an example

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059
custom bespoke UI and this is an example
 

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:41.180
custom bespoke UI and this is an example
of a puzzle game that uses lots and lots

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:41.190
of a puzzle game that uses lots and lots
 

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.159
of a puzzle game that uses lots and lots
of holo elements and even uses the holo

00:30:43.159 --> 00:30:43.169
of holo elements and even uses the holo
 

00:30:43.169 --> 00:30:46.430
of holo elements and even uses the holo
color palette in a really successful way

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440
color palette in a really successful way
 

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.229
color palette in a really successful way

a puzzle game or like a brainteaser
things like that you don't have to have

00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059
things like that you don't have to have
 

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:56.299
things like that you don't have to have
your own custom UI you can definitely

00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:56.309
your own custom UI you can definitely
 

00:30:56.309 --> 00:30:57.740
your own custom UI you can definitely
succeed it still with holo

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:57.750
succeed it still with holo
 

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.240
