you enjoy being Werner Heisenberg there

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
you enjoy being Werner Heisenberg there

was a moment in the play where we accuse

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
was a moment in the play where we accuse
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.609
was a moment in the play where we accuse
him of not making the bomb because he

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
him of not making the bomb because he
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.950
him of not making the bomb because he
did not understand the physics and of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
did not understand the physics and of
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410
did not understand the physics and of
course he denies this the character

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
course he denies this the character
 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660
course he denies this the character
Heisenberg of course I understood the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
Heisenberg of course I understood the
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.920
Heisenberg of course I understood the
physics and I had this moment where I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
physics and I had this moment where I
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.760
physics and I had this moment where I
say the critical mass did you tell him

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
say the critical mass did you tell him
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.479
say the critical mass did you tell him
the critical mass and evident and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
the critical mass and evident and
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.770
the critical mass and evident and
Heisenberg says yes I gave a number and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
Heisenberg says yes I gave a number and
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.000
Heisenberg says yes I gave a number and
I say yeah what was the number and he's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
I say yeah what was the number and he's
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.009
I say yeah what was the number and he's
all about a tongue and I say Heisenberg

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019
all about a tongue and I say Heisenberg
 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.250
all about a tongue and I say Heisenberg
you're over by a factor of 20 you never

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
you're over by a factor of 20 you never
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219
you're over by a factor of 20 you never
get anything wrong how could you be over

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
get anything wrong how could you be over
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440
get anything wrong how could you be over
by a factor of 20 s so that's the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
by a factor of 20 s so that's the
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.510
by a factor of 20 s so that's the
question how could he be over by a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
question how could he be over by a
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.530
question how could he be over by a
factor of 20 hi Alan yes I definitely

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
factor of 20 hi Alan yes I definitely
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.850

enjoyed playing Heisenberg to your bore

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
enjoyed playing Heisenberg to your bore
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609

and the theater I think we both did it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
and the theater I think we both did it
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.749
and the theater I think we both did it
was a wonderful play and we worked

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
was a wonderful play and we worked
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.789
was a wonderful play and we worked
pretty hard on learning the play and it

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799
pretty hard on learning the play and it
 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.350
pretty hard on learning the play and it
taught me a lot about Eisenberg and I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
taught me a lot about Eisenberg and I
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.020
taught me a lot about Eisenberg and I
actually began to identify more and more

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
actually began to identify more and more
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.780
actually began to identify more and more
with Eisenberg as the play went on why

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
with Eisenberg as the play went on why
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670
with Eisenberg as the play went on why
did he make a mistake you ask why did

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
did he make a mistake you ask why did
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.149
did he make a mistake you ask why did
Heisenberg mistakenly calculate the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
Heisenberg mistakenly calculate the
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550
Heisenberg mistakenly calculate the
amount of uranium necessary to make an

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
amount of uranium necessary to make an
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399
amount of uranium necessary to make an
atomic bomb which was a very lucky

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
atomic bomb which was a very lucky
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.930
atomic bomb which was a very lucky
mistake as the Blake's

planes because it was one of the reasons

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010
planes because it was one of the reasons
 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.640
planes because it was one of the reasons
the Germans never developed the atomic

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650
the Germans never developed the atomic
 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.010
the Germans never developed the atomic
bomb I have no idea the play suggesting

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
bomb I have no idea the play suggesting
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.300
bomb I have no idea the play suggesting
Heisenberg sometimes does that he didn't

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
Heisenberg sometimes does that he didn't
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.700
Heisenberg sometimes does that he didn't
want to build a bomb so but I think that

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710
want to build a bomb so but I think that
 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.870
want to build a bomb so but I think that
he made a mistake and some of us still

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
he made a mistake and some of us still
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.590
he made a mistake and some of us still
are and his Bobby is bigger mistake was

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600
are and his Bobby is bigger mistake was
 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170
are and his Bobby is bigger mistake was
not the redo the calculation and maybe

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
not the redo the calculation and maybe
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.930
not the redo the calculation and maybe
that was because he wasn't truly that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940
that was because he wasn't truly that
 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.950
that was because he wasn't truly that
interested in building a bomb who knows

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960
interested in building a bomb who knows
 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.750
interested in building a bomb who knows
since I did identify more and more with

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
since I did identify more and more with
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.330
since I did identify more and more with
Heisenberg I'm willing to believe that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340
Heisenberg I'm willing to believe that
 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.060
Heisenberg I'm willing to believe that
that was the case
