Here's my five character solution. First, we're going to use the square

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.980
brackets. Well, what this does is creates an empty list object. So then, when we

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.270
index it looking for element 0, that's going to raise an IndexError exception.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.628
Indexerror is an instance of look up error. So, that will be handled by this

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:21.618
handler, which prints out the nice quote from Einstein. And you have to

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:24.950
remember, Einstein lived back in the days before smartphones and Kindles and all

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.534
those good things. So, carrying around a lot of books must have been pretty hard

00:00:28.534 --> 00:00:29.074
back then.
