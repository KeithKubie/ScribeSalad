00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, that's the input.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, let's think about the output.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Again, we're looking at the same segment of code

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we're trying to replace with a procedure.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What do we think the output should be?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is going to be trickier.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We need to think about what we need to know

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
after the code runs.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We don't have access to these variables if we're making this a procedure.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We need to get--as outputs--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
everything that we want to use after the procedure.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, the question is, what should be the outputs

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of "get-next-target,"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the procedure that we're going to define to replace this code.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The first choice is the output should be a string

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
giving the value of the next target URL found in the page.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And that's what the variable "url" holds here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The second choice is we should output both the URL and the page.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The third choice is that we should output both the URL and the value of "end_quote,"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the position where the end of the quote is.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And the fourth choice is to output the value of "url,"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as well as the value of "start_link."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's the position

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
where we find the beginning of the link.
