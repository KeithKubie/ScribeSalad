[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.370
SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.850
Today at Google, we are
delighted to have Mr. Keith

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.780
Law.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.520
Mr. Law is a senior
baseball writer

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.470
for ESPN, where
he writes a column

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.660
and appears frequently on
television and other media

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.240
outlets to offer his analysis.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.490
He was formerly a writer
for "Baseball Prospectus"

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.637
and worked in the front office
for the Toronto Blue Jays.

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.470
He is also a member of
the Baseball Writers'

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.690
Association of America.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.069
Outside of baseball, Mr.
Law reads very widely

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.860
and, on his blog, writes
about many topics,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.400
including literature,
music, film, TV, and food.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.040
Joining him on stage is
Google's very own Matt Teper.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.290
Matt is Google's head of
editorial and, prior to that,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.600
was chief speechwriter for
former Vice President Joe

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.771
Biden.

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.020
The two of them will be
discussing Mr. Law's new book,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.100
"Smart Baseball--

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.220
The Old Stats That Are
Ruining the Game, the New

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.636
Ones That Are Running It, and
the Right Way To Think About

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:53.470
Baseball."

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.208
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Mr. Keith Law.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.600
MATT TEPER: Welcome.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.475
KEITH LAW: Thank you.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:01.962
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.670
Before we really get
started, let me just

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.430
ask how many of you have
read the book so I know how

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.680
many in the room have read it.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.370
OK, that's good.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.357
That's good because we're
going to read a little here.

00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:13.440
You can see I'm wearing a
Milwaukee Brewers shirt.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.690
So I figured we'd spend the
first 45 minutes talking

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.957
about the Brewers, which
I think is probably

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:19.620
really interesting to you guys
and just figuring out what

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.260
they should do at the deadline.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.840
KEITH LAW: But I
hate the Brewers.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.100
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.516
He hates the Brewers, and he
hates all of your teams, too.

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:27.300
So what I thought we'd do is,
Keith would read a little bit

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.235
from the book so you guys got
a picture of what it's about.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:31.860
Most of you, I'm
assuming, are a little

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.609
familiar with his
writing and his approach

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.110
to everything,
not just baseball.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.400
We'll talk a little baseball.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.270
I'll ask Keith a
couple of questions.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.340
Then we'll open it up and
get a bunch of questions

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.790
from you guys.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.873
And I know there's some
people on the live stream.

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:45.590
So hello to you.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.100
And we'll get going.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.490
KEITH LAW: OK.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.340
So Matt asked me to read.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.415
This is from the
seventh chapter.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:53.040
Clutch hitters.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.789
Lineup protection.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.530
Other things that don't exist.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.070
So this chapter, unlike a lot
of the others in the book,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450
is kind of a collection of many
essays that, as I was writing,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.770
I would sort of get
the urge to say,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.290
I want to say that
this is stupid.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.600
Like, say, lineup
protection isn't real.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.860
Clutch hitters aren't real.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.037
And kind of wrote a few
of these on the side

00:02:14.037 --> 00:02:15.870
and went to my editor
and said, I want these

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.800
in the book somewhere.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.587
And we chose to collect them
into this one omnibus chapter.

00:02:20.587 --> 00:02:22.170
And the section I'm
going to read here

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.367
is about the myth of the hot
hand, which still persists

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:27.450
within baseball circles,
within the baseball media

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.610
too, despite the fact that
there's actually, again,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.177
no real evidence that it exists.

00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:34.260
"The hardest myth for fans
and even baseball folks

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.634
to give up, in my
own experience,

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.960
is the myth of the hot hand.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.460
The term itself derives
from basketball.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.200
But there are many equivalents
you'll hear in baseball,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.140
from 'in the zone' to 'locked
in'-- an unfortunate term given

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.742
its second meaning in
medicine-- to 'feeling it.'

00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:47.950
The story goes that a player,
nearly always a hitter,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.492
has somehow captured
some extra magic

00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:51.700
and is on a run at the plate
in which his results are

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.740
consistently better.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.475
"He's hitting the ball harder
or balls are falling into play.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.600
You'll hear announcers say
a pitch must have looked

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.683
like a beach ball to him
or that his confidence is

00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:00.570
through the roof.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.280
The problem with this
myth, as with the others,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.655
is that the evidence
from reality

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:06.060
shows that this effect either
barely exists or doesn't

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.867
exist at all.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:09.450
It's merely our brains' attempts
to find patterns in data that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.024
are pretty close to random.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.690
"Hitter performances
throughout a season

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.857
include a lot of randomness.

00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:15.523
There certainly isn't
any predictability

00:03:15.523 --> 00:03:17.700
in when a hitter will be
more or less productive.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.820
Like, say, Joey Bag of Donuts
is a really great July hitter.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.122
Or Twerpy McFlaperson is much
better on Tuesday afternoons.

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:26.580
You expect that a hitter's line
at the end of a full season

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.350
will probably look
a lot like his lines

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.910
from the season or
two before that.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.684
"The more at-bats
a guy has, the more

00:03:31.684 --> 00:03:33.600
we expect his production
to look like whatever

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.420
his underlying true
talent level might be.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.520
A hitter who's true
on-base percentage, meaning

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.126
his natural ability to get
on base, is around .400.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:42.750
Could easily have a
month where he only

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.852
gets on base at a .300 clip.

00:03:44.852 --> 00:03:46.810
"You might think he's
slumping but, in reality,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.930
it's just a normal turn
of the baseball screw.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.870
Every hitter has periods
of highs and lows.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.220
But barring some other
explanation like an injury,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.572
players will eventually
return to form, the baseball

00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:57.030
version of what
statisticians refer

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.160
to as regression to the mean.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.600
"However, our
brains are not well

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.121
wired to handle randomness.

00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:03.870
We tend to think random
distributions look

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.477
more like uniform distributions
when random series tend

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:09.060
to be clumpy and uneven, given
the impression of pattern where

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.115
there is none.

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:12.240
"Alex Bellos, who's written
several wonderful books

Mail' in December 2010,

'As humans, when we come
across random clusters,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.860
we naturally
superimpose a pattern.

like clusters of songs by
the same artist, which,

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:32.700
of course, confused
listeners who

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.460
thought that the system
was, therefore, not random.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.190
Apple had to make its randomizer
less random to convince

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.746
people it was random enough.

"This is what happens in
baseball and other sports,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.411
as far as I can tell-- although
it's heretical for me to even

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.019
admit the existence
of other sports--

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.560
when a hitter has some sort of
hot streak, slump, or anything

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.410
that doesn't seem random to
our pattern-seeking minds.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.080
In fact, you hear a lot that
a certain hitter is streaky.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.930
All hitters are streaky because
random distributions are not

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.800
uniform.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.330
If a hitter never
had a streak, I'd

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.320
suggest we all bow to our
new robot player overlords.

"A landmark 1985 study of
streakiness in basketball

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.680
by Cornell psychology professor
Thomas Gilovich and Stanford

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.717
professors Robert
Valone and Amos Tversky

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:16.050
looked at data from several
players and teams in the NBA

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.860
and found no evidence of the
so-called hot hand effect.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.610
A player who has made
several recent shots

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.164
is, in fact, no more likely
to make his next shot.

00:05:23.164 --> 00:05:25.830
"If you like semantic games, you
would say that he has been hot,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.690
but he is not hot.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.460
That is, he's made a
few shots in a row,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.043
but he's still the
same shooter he was

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:32.826
before that streak of success.

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:34.200
Indeed, many
researchers continue

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.824
to try to find evidence
of the hot hand

00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:37.920
effect in various
endeavors as if we just

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.352
don't want to accept that our
sports narratives are untrue.

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.810
"Many attempts to identify and
quantify the hot hand effect

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.184
have appeared with
a recent paper

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:47.525
from two economists, Jeffrey
Zwiebel and Brett Green,

00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:49.650
claiming to have found
evidence of this streakiness

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.780
in baseball at a
magnitude previously

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.400
unheard of in the field.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.810
It didn't hold up
under scrutiny.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.060
They used small samples to
establish the players' base

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.210
ability levels and,
thus, tended to confuse

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.184
changes in true talent
levels with streakiness.

00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:04.100
"The resulting consensus
among sabermetricians

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.641
who examined this study was that
there might be some hot hand

00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:08.360
effect in baseball, maybe.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.520
But if it's there, it's
minuscule to the point

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.827
where managers could
safely ignore it.

00:06:12.827 --> 00:06:14.660
There are real changes
in player performance

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.060
that teams need to monitor.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.810
Players get hurt and
see temporary changes

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.670
in skill levels.

"Hitters who suffer
hand or wrist injuries

lose some of their grip strength

in power or in the
quality of contact,

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.050
while pitchers fighting just
about any kind of malady

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.508
can see a change
in their mechanics

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:31.710
and lose velocity, the ability
to locate pitches, or both.

Mechanics can change
for the better,

typically between seasons,
but sometimes during the year.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.934

often reviewing video
after each game,

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.170
and sometimes between
at-bats or innings

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.614
to identify tiny yet
tangible differences that

00:06:47.614 --> 00:06:49.280
might prevent the
player from performing

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.702
at his optimal level.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.160
I was in the
clubhouse occasionally

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.420
for some of these
conversations while I

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.800
was working for the Blue Jays.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.508
Some were beneficial,
but others involved

00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:58.790
a lot of complaining
about the umpires, too.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.016
"This is why teams long
employed advance scouts,

00:07:01.016 --> 00:07:02.390
watching the next
series opponent

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.190
to see who might be
healthy, who didn't seem

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.080
to have a good grip on
his breaking ball, who

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.900
wasn't running as well as
he normally did, and so on.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.270
Today, some teams have
dispensed with advance scouts

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.050
in favor of sophisticated
video and computer systems

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.420
that can track players
and plays more thoroughly,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.030
often with young front office
employees reviewing the results

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.321
to provide detailed notes
for the Major League coaching

00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:22.850
staff.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.220
"But none of this is
hot hand nonsense.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.410
It's looking for physical,
verifiable changes,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.870
not arguing that some player
has been temporarily possessed

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.724
by the spirit of Honus
Wagner at the plate.

00:07:31.724 --> 00:07:33.890
So the next time you hear
that a hitter is locked in

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.514
or that a starting
pitcher is cruising,

00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.210
just remember, it's probably
a narrative sitting awkwardly

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.836
on a pile of random data.

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:41.210
This appeal of
the narrative says

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.860
a lot about why all
of the myths here

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.080
are able to persist in
the absence of data.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.330
"We want baseball to be
the sepia-toned sport

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.920
of our constructed memories.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.900
In a game that goes
back at least 150 years,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.180
there is no shortage of
stories for the sharpshooter

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.610
to pick to try to support
his preconceived notions

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.000
about the game or his desire to
find a narrative in the noise.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.500
We romanticize the past.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.810
We canonize the players we
like, while demonizing those

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.430
we don't, and we
pick and choose what

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.230
stories to remember to believe.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.760
"This irrationality
drives so much

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.343
of baseball coverage
in the discussion

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:12.230
because of what we want baseball
to be when the game provides

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.760
plenty of real
fact-based stories

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.149
that are rooted in
truth, not mythos.

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:18.440
For a long time, we lacked
the information or the tools

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.690
to adequately dispel these
ideas about baseball,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.730
and other sports as
well, to the point where

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.220
we might see behavior change.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.150
"But the last 15 years
have seen a revolution

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.770
in baseball thinking.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.270
This upheaval in
baseball thinking

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.850
from using better metrics,
based on the traditional stats,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.640
to the incoming wave of new data
that's changing the way front

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.497
offices build their teams
won't get rid of great stories.

00:08:37.497 --> 00:08:39.830
We'll get new great stories
now, stories about underdogs

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.579
who were overlooked
by traditional methods

00:08:41.579 --> 00:08:43.789
of evaluation, but whose
hidden talents came out

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.247
because of the new data.

00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:47.330
Most important though, our
stories about the stars

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.940
will be driven by fact,
not wishful thinking, which

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.320
makes the stories
more compelling

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.153
and the greatness of
the game's best players

00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:56.105
that much easier to appreciate."

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:57.950
MATT TEPER: That's great.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.500
I asked Keith to read
that because I think

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.690
the idea of books like
this, and the people that

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.430
do a lot of the writing and
the work, the analytical work

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.190
in baseball front offices,
like, their job is breaking

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.460
through this narrative.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.270
And the narrative that's
built up around baseball

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.600
is you mentioned like this
sepia-toned romanticism.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.270
I mean, that hits baseball
more than anything else.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.030
Baseball has been around like--

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.880
Genghis Khan was playing
baseball 1,000 years ago.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.860
KEITH LAW: It's mentioned
in page one of Jane Austen's

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.870
"Northanger Abbey."

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.210
MATT TEPER: Yes.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.220
KEITH LAW: Which was
written around 1805 or so.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.560
And it mentions base
ball, two words.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.400
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.050
And she probably
loved the RBI, right?

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.675
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:09:36.675 --> 00:09:37.330
100%.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.038
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:09:38.038 --> 00:09:40.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.770
So basically, I grew
up before Bill James,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.170
before you, before Theo Epstein,
before Michael Lewis, so I

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.530
believed in all of that stuff.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.790
And then, you read
some Bill James.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.780
You read this book, and
it all seems so obvious.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.490
And just like, yeah,
these are the facts.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.940
This is the way it works.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.616
So then the trick
is, I guess, busting

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:06.740
through all that narrative.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.550
So tell me where you think
we are in that process.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.390
And I guess a little
bit of history, too.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.610
Like, where do you
think it really started?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.318
Is it Bill James?

00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:17.450
Is it because Michael Lewis
decided to write a business

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.660
book about baseball?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.315
Like, where do you
think it all began?

00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:22.190
And where are we now?

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.270
KEITH LAW: I think there have
been several inflection points.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.580
Bill James was writing
in the late '70s and all

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.040
through the '80s and
really found no audience

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.330
within the industry.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.284
He found a popular audience,
a niche, but still enough,

00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:36.950
obviously, to keep
publishing the books,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.037
to have a major publisher.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.120
But within the industry,
it was kind of dismissed.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.050
This is an outsider,
a non-baseball guy,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.330
daring to tell us about
baseball and, therefore, he

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.660
has nothing interesting to say.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.850
"Moneyball" was the
first inflection point

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.350
within the industry.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.032
The publication of the book,
not the movie, which many of you

00:10:54.032 --> 00:10:55.490
know I think the
movie is terrible.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.650
But the book was
actually important.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.190
And the book had some details
wrong, some facts wrong,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.440
but it tells the right story.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.500
And that got the attention of a
lot of people within baseball.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.190
I heard stories of other team
owners were getting that book

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.980
and saying--

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.930
going to their GMs--
why don't we do this?

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.230
Why is Oakland, with no
money in a garbage state,

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.380
why are they doing this
and we're not doing this?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.970
And then the following year, the
Red Sox win the World Series.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.020
And so Theo gets hired in '03.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.070
Obviously, they have the
close call in '03 and then win

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.532
in '04 and then
win again in '07.

00:11:34.532 --> 00:11:36.740
So you might even argue it's
not an inflection point.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.230
It's sort of this whole period
where other teams would then

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.656
look and say,
well, the Red Sox--

00:11:40.656 --> 00:11:41.780
I mean, I could understand.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.380
The A's are doing that because
they're desperate, right.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.130
They don't have anything
else they can do.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.070
They can't outbid us.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.301
So they're going to try
some tricks, some novelty,

00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:49.050
to try to compete.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.922
But the Red Sox, they
don't need to do that.

00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:52.880
But they're doing this,
and they're beating us.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.690
And they won two World Series.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.898
They didn't win for 86 years.

00:11:54.898 --> 00:11:56.900
Now they win two in four years.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.230
I think that got the attention
of the sport, as a whole,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.890
more than anything
that came before.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.181
But you could argue it doesn't
get to that point if you

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.700
don't have Bill James and if
you don't have "Moneyball"

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.330
coming out in '03.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.110
But after '07, then you can
start to see the acceleration

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.380
in adoption of analytics
by other front offices

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.400
to the point where--

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.560
as I was writing this book--
the last two holdouts,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.950
the Diamondbacks and the
Twins, changed their GMs

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.860
and added actual
analytics departments.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.750
I always tell the
story that Diamondbacks

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.864
had two people, kids, who
were basically analysts.

00:12:29.864 --> 00:12:32.030
And Dave Stewart would
sometimes come in and say hi,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.020
and that would be the
end of the conversation.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.730
So they were there.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.104
I think he just
sort of kept them

00:12:36.104 --> 00:12:38.720
in a cupboard under the stairs
and never actually used them

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.030
for anything.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.110
And because there
was not a department

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.515
with an actual head, somebody
with a seat at the baseball

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:49.700
table, whatever input they had
never got into the decision

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.000
making process.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.210
Now they went and hired
somebody from Pittsburgh

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.440
to come run their department.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.480
The Twins set up
department there.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.320
Not only did they
set up a department,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.736
they were actually knocking
down-- literally knocking down

00:12:59.736 --> 00:13:02.960
walls and metaphorically, in
the front office because there

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.790
was nowhere for
those people to sit

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.800
by what was Terry
Ryan's old office, which

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.360
is now Derek Falvey's office.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.740
So now we're at the point
where everyone's on board.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.120
And I kind of used the
phrase a few times,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.500
the revolution is over.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.450
What's next is
evolutionary because we're

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.629
seeing lots of new data.

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:20.420
And teams are differing
in how much they're

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.044
using the data, what conclusions
they're drawing from the data,

00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:24.800
but everyone's decided--

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.280
data, analytics-- that's
part of our decision making

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.135
process every bit as much
as traditional scouting is.

00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:32.100
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.040
And you mentioned
in the book that--

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.680
I mean, it kind of culminated
in last year's World Series

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.820
where you had Theo again.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.070
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.870
He just keeps coming
up in the story.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.170
MATT TEPER: I know.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.640
It's like we're talking about
busting through myth with fact.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.470
And like, Theo has
busted the biggest myths

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.215
in baseball history, basically,
with an analytical approach.

00:13:48.215 --> 00:13:49.590
KEITH LAW: Despite
being a Yalie.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.510
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.010
I know that's hard
for you to admit.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.500
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.924
MATT TEPER: So you've
got analytically inclined

00:13:55.924 --> 00:13:57.590
front offices going
to the World Series.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.600
You've got managers
who are running

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.710
their teams in those
dugouts really analytically.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.684
So I think it's like the
teams, as you mentioned,

00:14:07.684 --> 00:14:08.600
have gotten it, right?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.225
KEITH LAW: Yep.

00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:11.800
MATT TEPER: Do the fans have it?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.740
Is that next?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.060
What's more important?

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.550
KEITH LAW: Last is clearly
going to be the media.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.720
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:16.795
Right.

00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:17.295
Right.

00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:19.730
KEITH LAW: I think that's
become unfortunately clear.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.650
In fact, my book has
now been criticized

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:26.360
by, as far as I can
tell, Dan Shaughnessy--

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.770
I don't even remember his name--

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:32.420
Doc Daugherty in Cincinnati, and
Mark Whicker, the SoCal writer

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.730
who decided to make
light of Jaycee Dugard's

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.552
being kidnapped.

00:14:35.552 --> 00:14:36.260
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.655
You hit for the cycle, I think.

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.779
KEITH LAW: None of them
has actually read the book,

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:41.997
but they all hate it, which,
to me, is a little bit

00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:42.830
of a badge of honor.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.360
You're not going to like it.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.610
And I'm very specifically
saying your style of writing

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.235
and your way of
thinking about the game

00:14:48.235 --> 00:14:50.990
is just wrong, and totally
out of date, and out of sync

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.760
with the way the
industry is thinking.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.660
If all 30 GMs look at you and
say, that's not how this works,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.110
then you're not doing your
job as a member of the media.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.790
Look, I may introduce ideas.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.910
I may talk about players
and differ on details

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.110
from the way front offices
think about these things.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.500
But ultimately, my job as an
analyst of the industries,

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.290
I have to know and understand
what all 30 teams are

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.640
thinking philosophically.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.550
Even if I don't agree
with a specific move--

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.120
like the JD Martinez trade--

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.260
I can at least understand what
their overall direction is.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.900
So for all 30 teams to
have adopted analytics,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.170
and for various writers and a
lot of writers in the media--

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.760
beat writers and
national writers--

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.310
to still say, no, it's wrong.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.020
It's not going to
work, dude, you lost.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.370
It's over.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.620
So either adapt and
accept that this

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.050
is the way of the industry,
whether or not you like it,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.090
or go write about
something else.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.850
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.433
I mean, if you think about it,
you worked in the front office.

00:15:44.433 --> 00:15:46.940
And you were doing analytics
in the front office.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.940
And your impact has
been larger since you

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.605
entered the media, right?

00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:52.230
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.271
MATT TEPER: It's a tougher
one to topple, almost.

00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:57.590
KEITH LAW: And I got in early
enough on the media side too

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.620
that I was, at the time,
one of the few voices

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.799
in the mainstream media who
was talking about this stuff.

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:05.840
Who would talk analytics,
and then who could also

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.310
talk about the
scouting side too,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.120
which is very close
to my heart, just

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.320
going out and seeing players.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.720
Now there are a lot
more voices doing

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.290
that, which is great because
it will be lonely being

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.720
the only one saying, I'm right.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.416
Everyone else is
wrong, and I'm right.

00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:24.290
It's not really the most
comfortable position

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.290
in the world, certainly.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.680
And you take a lot of heat
and a lot of abuse for it.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.811
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:31.920
KEITH LAW: Now,
not only are there

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.170
more voices in the media--
so the balance has shifted.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.990
There are certainly still
people who are holdouts.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.573
But there are more
people in the media

00:16:37.573 --> 00:16:40.700
and there are more media
outlets talking in these terms.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.470
But also, who are
the front office guys

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:43.490
going to gravitate to?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.510
They're going to talk
to the people who

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.630
speak their language.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.130
So that's why you
can read my stuff.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.119
It's why you can go read Eric
Longenhagen on FanGraphs.

00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:54.410
And we've got good info
because they want to talk to us

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.241
because we speak their language
now and the old guard, maybe,

00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:57.740
doesn't.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.700
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.620
And then, as far as the
fans, I guess the storyline

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.944
about just a bunch of nerds
with pocket protectors

00:17:05.944 --> 00:17:07.819
who never played the
game, that seems to be--

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.150
KEITH LAW: I don't
even have a pocket.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.329
MATT TEPER: You
don't have a pocket.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.369
But you would have a
protector in there.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:11.510
KEITH LAW: Yes, of course.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.040
My dad was an electrical
engineer his whole career,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.920
by the way, too, and owned
pocket protectors and a slide

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.420
rule.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:17.910
MATT TEPER: And a slide--
oh, a slide rule, yeah.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.076
KEITH LAW: And a slide rule.

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:22.100
I only know what a slide
rule is because he had one.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.400
MATT TEPER: There are plenty
of slide rules at Google.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:24.690
KEITH LAW: Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:24.780
I figured.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.599
MATT TEPER: That's how we do
most of the engineering we do.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.889
KEITH LAW: Yes exactly.

00:17:26.889 --> 00:17:28.972
That's the algorithm, the
search algorithm, right?

00:17:28.972 --> 00:17:29.530
MATT TEPER: Yeah, it's
all by slide rule, yeah.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.655
KEITH LAW: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:34.320
MATT TEPER: Very
well-protected pockets here.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.440
KEITH LAW: And my
mother's name is Lynn too,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.390
which I always thought,
oh, so you married

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.165
the natural logarithm, right?

00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:41.135
That's the joke.

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:41.620
MATT TEPER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.203
KEITH LAW: She didn't
see it that way.

00:17:43.203 --> 00:17:46.250
MATT TEPER: [LAUGHING]
The fans, though.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.200
So there's an argument
out there that,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.575
like, this sucks the
fun out of baseball.

00:17:50.575 --> 00:17:51.740
KEITH LAW: Yeah.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.630
MATT TEPER: And I
don't think the people

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.650
in this room believe it.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.780
But it's basically
like it's all numbers.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.850
What happens on the
field and all this stuff

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.840
we grew up loving, like the
storytelling and all of that,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.882
it gets sucked out of it.

00:18:06.882 --> 00:18:08.839
You do a good job in that
chapter of explaining

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:09.927
how new stories get told.

00:18:09.927 --> 00:18:12.260
But what is your ultimate
argument to the fact that, no,

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.630
this actually makes it more fun?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.590
KEITH LAW: There's two
responses I have to that.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.870
One is just that I
consider myself a learner.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:22.820
I enjoy knowledge.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.530
Knowing more about
whatever it is I'm

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.430
interested in, whether it's
baseball, or literature,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.180
cooking, whatever.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.070
I want to know more.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.100
I'm always looking to learn
more as much as I can.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.830
So anything that lets me
learn more to understand more

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.800
about baseball is going
to make the sport,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.930
and consuming the sport,
more enjoyable for me.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.000
Understanding why that happened.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.770
I mean, even the basic
thing of, OK, so that ball

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.157
that was just hit to the
gap for a two-run double.

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:50.740
Well, did the hitter
hit a good pitch?

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.280
Did the pitcher
execute his pitch?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.642
Did he miss his location?

00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:56.850
Did the breaking ball come
out of his hand too early?

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.120
They're always looking
for an explanation.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.415
Even the play-by-play
guys and the color guys,

00:19:02.415 --> 00:19:04.040
as they're describing
the game, they're

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.160
trying to explain
what you just saw.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.620
Now we actually have data to
answer some of those questions

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.910
and maybe get correct answers.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.120
Whereas, previously, it
was a lot of guesswork.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.860
To me, that doesn't
make it less fun.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.065
We're not saying stupid
stuff as much as we used to.

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:19.940
And we're not guessing
as much as we used to,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.370
which makes it much
more enjoyable for me.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.406
I can also look--

00:19:23.406 --> 00:19:26.030
you know, Aaron Judge is one of
the biggest stories in baseball

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.530
this year.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.010
Is he less fun because we
know the exit velocity--

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.275
because he's actually setting
exit velocity records?

00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:33.650
I don't hear
anybody complaining,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.316
I wish he didn't hit
the ball that hard.

00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:38.120
Or I wish I didn't know how
hard he was hitting the ball.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.770
People want to know
that information.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.645
They want to know how
fast Byron Buxton runs.

00:19:41.645 --> 00:19:45.500
I'm still kind of flummoxed
that Byron Buxton's sprint speed

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.844
numbers are better than Billy
Hamilton's because I would

00:19:47.844 --> 00:19:49.510
swear to you Hamilton
is the fastest guy

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.370
I've ever seen on a field.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.870
I might have said
Buxton was second.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.940
But it turns out
I had them wrong.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.090
And my eyes are telling
me something different,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.210
but the data doesn't
lie-- don't lie--

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.020
that, OK, Buxton's faster.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.200
And to me, that's much more
interesting to know the truth.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.930
And to then be able to say, all
right, well, what did I see?

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.710
Why did I think the other thing?

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.050
Why is it the belief
that I had previously

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.740
turned out to be incorrect?

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.010
So I don't think we're
lacking for great stories.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.914
I don't think we're lacking
for interesting players.

00:20:18.914 --> 00:20:20.330
And we're still
going to have guys

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.980
who pop up out of the 18th round
or the 25th round who defeat

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.840
the odds, or make some
change, and end up

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.673
having significant roles
in the big leagues.

00:20:28.673 --> 00:20:30.950
I had a blog post this morning
about a 31st-round pick

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.440
for the Red Sox.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.090
He was picked in 14.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.240
He missed all of last
season with some injury

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.850
and showed up this winter with
a couple of more miles an hour

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:41.516
on his fastball.

00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:42.720
And I saw him use 92, 97.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.820
His last name's Duron.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.019
Now he's in Lowell.

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:46.560
I don't know if
he'll ever get there.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.101
But if he does,
that's a great story.

00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:50.760
That's a 31st-rounder
who some scout--

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.240
that's probably one
scout-- identified this guy

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.630
as having the ability,
athleticism, maybe the makeup.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.099
If there was any analytics,
any data on him at all,

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:00.390
it was probably pretty minimal.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.130
Those stories aren't
going to go away.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.160
And I think having
more open-minded people

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.100
in front offices mean we may
get more of those stories.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.150
We're less likely to just
dismiss a player because he

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.202
was a low draft pick, or
he got a tiny bonus out

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:14.910
of the Dominican.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.662
We're more willing
to just say, where

00:21:16.662 --> 00:21:17.870
you came from doesn't matter.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.411
It's what you're
actually doing today

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.292
that's going to determine your
progress through the system.

00:21:22.292 --> 00:21:24.750
MATT TEPER: Yeah, I mean, you're
talking to a company built

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.267
on the flow of information.

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:27.600
And we believe in that entirely.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.230
KEITH LAW: These are my people.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.938
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:21:28.938 --> 00:21:30.750
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.320
MATT TEPER: So OK, we've
conquered front offices.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.300
We're working on fans.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.190
I have a question about players.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:43.440
So it seems like I
hear a lot of players,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.870
either in post-game interviews
or former players who

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.155
are in the box now or in the
media who talk about this stuff

00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:51.030
like they believe it.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.259
Talk about the narrative myth
stuff like they believe it.

00:21:54.259 --> 00:21:55.050
KEITH LAW: Oh, yes.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.710
MATT TEPER: They talk about RBIs
and about how important they

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:57.210
are.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.462
They talk about chemistry.

00:21:58.462 --> 00:21:59.670
They talk about the hot hand.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.086
They talk about
all the things you

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.970
kind of debunk in that chapter.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.440
And then, you're like, well,
they did play the game.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.090
They should know
better that chemistry

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.450
does or doesn't exist.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.430
So have you tried to
convince players of this?

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.775
I mean, what does
it take to make--

00:22:16.775 --> 00:22:18.900
there have to be more
analytically inclined players

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.280
out there who
understand this stuff.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.446
Like, we know a few of them.

00:22:21.446 --> 00:22:23.954
They pop up on Twitter a lot.

00:22:23.954 --> 00:22:25.620
But there are still,
when you're talking

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.210
about getting the
media, there are a lot

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.501
of former players in the media.

00:22:28.501 --> 00:22:31.200
And they're kind of
spouting this stuff.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.987
And I mean, it probably doesn't
make you question it at all.

00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:36.320
But if I'm hearing David Ortiz--

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.290
KEITH LAW: It makes me
hit the mute button.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:37.580
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:37.890
KEITH LAW: Yeah.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.639
MATT TEPER: But if I'm
hearing David Ortiz

00:22:39.639 --> 00:22:41.610
talk about the chemistry
of the 2004 team.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.524
I mean, you just
disregard it right.

00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:44.190
KEITH LAW: Sure.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.106
It's kind of in one ear
and out the other too.

00:22:46.106 --> 00:22:48.780
And a lot of people
within baseball

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.161
will tell you it's not that
chemistry breeds winning,

00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.410
it's winning breeds chemistry.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.480
And losing breeds
bad chemistry, too.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.180
I mean, the Orioles,
you would hear for years

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.040
that Buck runs a
great clubhouse there

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.377
and everyone's on the same page.

00:23:00.377 --> 00:23:01.210
It's good chemistry.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.040
Well, now they're losing.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.650
And suddenly, you hear a little
sniping about Showalter too.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.040
That's not a coincidence.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.260
And I don't think Buck has--

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.420
at his age, I doubt he's
changed his style much at all.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.336
And certainly not from
last year to this year.

00:23:11.336 --> 00:23:12.940
It's that the
results are changing.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.480
And then, that's changing
the attitudes or the feelings

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.250
in the clubhouse at this point.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:21.120
I also will say too-- having
done a handful of games where

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.510
I've been in the booth trying to
do color or doing when we still

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.820
had "Baseball Tonight"--

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.670
there is a constant
temptation when

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.430
you're doing live TV or radio,
too, to answer every question.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.570
To do this job, at
least to do my job,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.319
you have to be willing
to say, I don't know.

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:42.360
And I don't think anyone
really wants to do that.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.530
You're worried you're
going to sound stupid.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.490
I think you actually
sound better

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.380
if you admit you don't know
the answer to something either

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.930
because I don't have the
information at my fingertips

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.690
or because we just don't know.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.390
But to say I don't
know why that happened.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.510
Why is this player better
than he was last year?

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.926
Or why is he worse
than last year?

00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.660
You know, I don't actually know.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.130
Someone's asked me Luis
Severino has been--

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.630
he's been different
in a lot of ways

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:04.700
this year versus last year.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.360
He's got a better slider
than he's ever had.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.340
And he's throwing at a
tremendous amount more.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.860
That's part of the difference.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.610
But I criticized his
delivery in the past.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.780
Well, does it look
better this year?

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.363
You know, I have not
physically gotten

00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:18.727
to see him live from the side
to say if it's any different.

00:24:18.727 --> 00:24:20.310
If I didn't see that
angle, I probably

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.518
couldn't answer the question.

00:24:21.518 --> 00:24:23.680
So the answer is, I don't know.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.520
Yeah, it bothers me not
to have the information.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.520
But I have had to
teach myself to say

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.650
I don't know to questions--

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.669
TV, radio, wherever-- rather
than to just make up an answer.

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:36.960
And if you want to make up
an answer, those narratives,

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.790
those myths, they're
really good for that.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.590
They fill the air quite well.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.550
They sort of expand to fill
all of the dead time allotted

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.050
to them.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.220
And then you don't have the
dead air on a TV broadcast

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.206
that I think a lot of
people in the business fear

00:24:50.206 --> 00:24:51.330
or are just taught to fear.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.590
You got to say something, right?

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.250
I'm coming to you.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.541
You got to answer the question.

00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:57.180
And we're almost taught
that "I don't know"

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.910
is not really an acceptable
answer, even though I would say

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.070
it's often the best answer,
if it's the right one.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.487
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:25:03.487 --> 00:25:05.070
I want to ask a
couple more questions,

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.860
then we'll open
it up to you guys.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.410
And shifting gears a
little bit to the one place

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.582
where mythmaking and narrative
probably owns everything

00:25:13.582 --> 00:25:15.540
and you write about,
which is the Hall of Fame.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.039
Right?

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:16.770
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.589
MATT TEPER: So I mean,
that is a museum.

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:20.880
It exists to tell the story
in the history of baseball.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.680
But as we know, who gets in
and out, that's big business.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.650
There's a lot that
goes into that.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.581
And it seems to be
changing for the better.

00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:29.205
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:33.960
MATT TEPER: And will continue
as the voting pool gets more

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.560
diverse, both,
demographically and in people

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.210
who view the game like you do.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:42.750
We're assuming that things
will get a little better.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.705
And the Lou Whitaker
situation won't repeat itself.

00:25:45.705 --> 00:25:46.560
KEITH LAW: Right.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.930
And that's why I told the
story of why Whitaker--

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.180
for those of you who don't
know just real quick--

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.520
he got one year on
the writers' ballot.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.560
He did not get the 5%
required to even stay

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.550
on the ballot for a second year.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.674
He fell off, and that's it.

00:25:57.674 --> 00:26:01.250
He can't be considered again for
it's either 15 or 20 years now.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.049
His original eligibility
had to expire.

00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:04.590
And then he would
come up on whatever

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.350
they're calling the Veterans
Committee these days.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.520
Maybe he eventually gets in.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.540
It's not that likely.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.060
But by raising the point
saying, not only should he

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.480
have gotten more consideration,
he should have gotten in.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.820
The next time there's a Lou
Whitaker type of candidate,

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.130
maybe he'll just get a
more thorough hearing

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.912
from the writers rather
than simply be one and done.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:23.620
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.020
And the Lou Whitaker
thing, I mean,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.370
he does a very good
job in the book--

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.480
you should read the
chapter on the Hall of Fame

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.063
explaining the Lou
Whitaker situation.

00:26:29.063 --> 00:26:30.970
And I grew up in the '80s.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:31.980
And I'm a Brewers fan.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.390
So at that time they
were in the AL Central.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.220
And so I saw a lot of Lou
Whitaker and Alan Trammell.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.870
Those guys were Hall
of Famers to me.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:39.411
KEITH LAW: And they were spoken
in contemporary news accounts

00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:41.187
too, they were spoken
of as these guys are

00:26:41.187 --> 00:26:42.270
going to the Hall of Fame.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.695
Wouldn't it be great if
they went in together?

00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:44.370
MATT TEPER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.270
KEITH LAW: Not neither of
them is ever going to get in.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:46.500
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.220
KEITH LAW: Which
is what turned out.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.653
Which, at least, to this
point, is what has happened.

00:26:49.653 --> 00:26:50.940
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.740
And you nod in the
book that there

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.550
might have been some racial
undertones to his not

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:56.050
getting in.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.675
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:26:56.675 --> 00:26:59.160
MATT TEPER: And that's
messy in its own way.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.980
Now that was,
what, 10 years ago?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.090
How many years ago
would it have it been?

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.670
It was a while ago.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.145
KEITH LAW: Whitaker's one year
on the ballot was around 2000.

00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:05.895
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:06.960
So a long time ago.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.585
KEITH LAW: Yep.

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:10.449
MATT TEPER: So as we mentioned,
the demographics have changed.

00:27:10.449 --> 00:27:12.240
It's still a lot of
crusty, old, white men.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.740
But for the most
part, it's changed.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.300
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.880
MATT TEPER: Would Lou Whitaker
get into the Hall of Fame

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.690
today?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.650
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.600
It might take the full 10 years.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.936
We just saw that
with Tim Raines.

00:27:23.936 --> 00:27:25.938
But he certainly
wouldn't be one and done.

00:27:25.938 --> 00:27:28.146
There would be enough of a
court-- well first of all,

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.312
there would be enough writers
right out of the chute

00:27:30.312 --> 00:27:32.910
who would look and recognize
using Wins Above Replacement

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.420
or other total value stats who
would vote for him immediately.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.547
MATT TEPER: He's the
highest WAR offensive player

00:27:38.547 --> 00:27:39.630
not in the Hall right now?

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.213
Is that right?

00:27:40.213 --> 00:27:42.510
KEITH LAW: Is it him or Grich.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.132
I think he's a little
bit ahead of Grich.

00:27:45.132 --> 00:27:47.340
And I just read Jay Jaffe's
book on the Hall of Fame,

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.460
too, where he actually ends
up making the case for Grich.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.430
And it's sort of just
like, that's perfect.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.630
You just put our
two books together

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.630
and you got second base.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:53.580
We're covered there.

00:27:56.264 --> 00:27:58.180
If Whitaker isn't at the
top, he's very close.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.360
He's one of the more
egregious omissions

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.730
outside of, like, Bonds, who's
that's a whole separate--

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.480
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.350
KEITH LAW: I mean, I
would vote for Bonds.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.920
MATT TEPER: Well, I
did want to get there.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.919
KEITH LAW: OK, well we'll
get there in a second.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:10.246
But there would be such a chorus
for the next Lou Whitaker.

00:28:10.246 --> 00:28:12.120
And part of why I
discussed Mike Mussina then

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.185
in that same chapter too was,
as I was finishing the book too,

00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:18.060
I kind of thought Raines
was going to get in.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.630
Then he did.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.954
I had already sort of wrapped.

00:28:19.954 --> 00:28:21.870
But I wrote this thinking
Raines will probably

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.950
get in on this last ballot.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.783
I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on him.

00:28:24.783 --> 00:28:27.440
He'll be in, which it took
forever, but at least he's in.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.470
Who might be the next cause
for those of us in the media

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.680
or the fan base who are
more statistically inclined?

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.450
And I thought Mike
Mussina, who is, I think,

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.170
of the non-PED-suspected
pitchers--

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.640
I think he's the
highest WAR guy not in.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.974
And his case is particularly
good for a lot of the arguments

00:28:49.974 --> 00:28:51.390
I'm trying to make
in the book too

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.520
because he does so much
better on advanced stats

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.750
than some of the traditional
benchmarks we use.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.151
Also, I was thinking let's
light that next fire.

00:28:58.151 --> 00:28:58.650
Right?

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.480
Let's just get started
on the next guy.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.090
And I Mussina is
going to get in.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.746
But to say we--

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:08.037
"we" helped get Raines in,
we helped get Blyleven in,

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:10.620
and I'm not saying I personally
had anything to do with those.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.150
But those of us who are
analytically inclined

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.400
pushed for certain candidates.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.500
Who might be the next
guy we should push for?

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.371
And Mussina, to me,
was the most deserving

00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:19.870
of guys who are
still on the ballot.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:20.690
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.110
Yeah, and he seemed, like
you said, a good case for you

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.870
because he never
won 20 games, right?

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.550
KEITH LAW: His last season,
he sort of limped to the 20--

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.966
I shouldn't even
say it like that.

00:29:28.966 --> 00:29:30.390
But he got the 20--

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.632
one 20-win season.

00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:33.090
And it almost seemed
like he got it

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.320
because he knew he
needed to check it off,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.960
which is-- you
know, that's silly.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.847
MATT TEPER: Right.

00:29:37.847 --> 00:29:38.370
Right.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.180
Never won a Cy Young.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.660
Never finished in
the top whatever.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.368
KEITH LAW: Right.

00:29:41.368 --> 00:29:43.350
MATT TEPER: Yeah, all of
the traditional stuff.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.680
So quickly, you mentioned Bonds.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.900
The voting pool is changing.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.380
Barry Bonds is the best player
of the lifetime of everybody

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.700
in this room, I believe.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.200
Will he?

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.160
Will Alex Rodriguez?

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.756
Will Roger Clemens?

00:29:57.756 --> 00:29:58.380
KEITH LAW: Yep.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.267
MATT TEPER: Will
they end up there?

00:30:00.267 --> 00:30:02.100
KEITH LAW: I think Bonds
is going to get in.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.770
I think that's almost
inevitable, at this point.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.790
And I know a lot of writers
who said that Bud Selig getting

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:12.750
hand-waved into the Hall in his
first time under consideration

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.930
was, essentially, the signal
from the Hall to the voters,

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.910
we don't care about
the steroid stuff.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.580
And that's part of why you
saw both Bonds and Clemens see

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.529
big jumps in their voting
totals last time around.

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:26.820
I feel better about Bonds'
chance than Clemens' chance.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.450
I think Clemens is
just more disliked.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.300
I, personally, would
vote for both guys.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.260
I don't have a vote.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.250
Not this off-season.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.750
The following
off-season I will get

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.004
my first Hall of Fame ballot.

00:30:35.004 --> 00:30:36.420
I expect they'll
both be on there.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.160
And I will vote
for both of them.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.118
MATT TEPER: It's saying
a lot if someone's less

00:30:39.118 --> 00:30:40.102
liked than Barry Bonds.

00:30:40.102 --> 00:30:40.810
KEITH LAW: Right.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.685
MATT TEPER: You know.

00:30:41.685 --> 00:30:42.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.260
KEITH LAW: Yeah.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:43.460
Yes.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:43.970
MATT TEPER: It's an
impressive hurdle.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:44.260
KEITH LAW: Right.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.718
It's the race to
the bottom, right?

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.070
We just keep lowering it.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.190
A-Rod's going to be tough
because the one argument

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:54.502
that I've always been able
to make, even to these PED

00:30:54.502 --> 00:30:56.460
moralists or purists,
was neither of these guys

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.790
was ever actually suspended.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.660
Neither failed a test.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.220
A-Rod, like Manny
Ramirez, was suspended.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.140
Did fail tests.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:08.100
Like, there's actual--
there was in baseball--

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.610
there were consequences
that Bonds and Clemens never

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.810
had to face.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.871
So I would vote for A-Rod, too.

00:31:14.871 --> 00:31:17.120
But there, I think, is a
better argument against that.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.571
And he may not get in.

00:31:18.571 --> 00:31:20.070
And the one I'll
throw in there too,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.832
as much as I despise Pete
Rose for what he did,

00:31:22.832 --> 00:31:24.540
you sort of end up in
the same situation.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.300
Is it really a Hall of Fame
without an acknowledgment that

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.060
Pete Rose-- who would have been
a Hall of Famer on the merits--

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.520
he's just not really there?

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.570
That's problematic to me.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.610
Even though, personally, I would
have a very hard time actually

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.470
checking the box
next to his name

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.654
because I think what
he did is way worse

00:31:39.654 --> 00:31:42.070
than what any of these guys
is accused of doing with PEDs.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.630
MATT TEPER: Yeah, I would agree.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.230
Just quickly going
to the future now.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.640
So you write a
lot about Statcast

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.740
and the reams and reams of data
that Major League Baseball now

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.000
has at its disposal.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.670
So explain a little
bit about what it is.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.310
Tell us what you really think
the next frontier of this stuff

00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.400
is.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.275
You're-- probably some
engineers in the room.

00:32:01.275 --> 00:32:03.390
They can build
something that'll really

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.500
change the face of baseball.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.960
Where do you see
technology taking the game?

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.560
KEITH LAW: That's the next
step in the data evolution

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.600
that I hinted at earlier.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.420
The start of 2015, Major League
Baseball developed this--

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.010
sorry, introduced this system
in all 30 Major League parks.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.280
It's got two technologies--
one is radar based,

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.600
one is optical based--

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.440
that provides data
on every pitch.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.324
Not just characteristics of
the pitch itself, its velocity.

00:32:34.324 --> 00:32:36.240
It's where it's released,
where the pitcher is

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.640
releasing it relative to--

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.150
between the rubber
and home plate.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:44.550
The spin rate on the pitch.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.800
If the hitter makes
contact, its exit velocity,

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.790
its launch angle.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.220
But also the locations of
everybody on the field.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.900
Every fielder at the
start of the play.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.770
Every base runner.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:53.550
Every umpire.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:58.050
The coaches in the boxes in foul
territory, that's all recorded.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.890
And so every pitch
now has its own record

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:06.330
with all of these different
fields for every season, 2015,

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.300
'16, obviously part
way through '17.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.640
I was told that
the 2016 data set

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.480
was about a terabyte and
a half of data, which is

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.130
several hundred times larger.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.004
I'm sure in this room,
that's not impressive.

00:33:19.004 --> 00:33:19.992
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:19.992 --> 00:33:21.450
But in Major League
Baseball, it is

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.640
because the PITCHf/x data was--

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.489
this is several hundred
times more data per year,

00:33:27.489 --> 00:33:29.280
several hundred times
larger than what they

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.600
were getting from PITCHf/x.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.730
And I compare it to the stuff
I was doing in Toronto where

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.240
I could--

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.864
I mean, I was the
analytics department.

00:33:34.864 --> 00:33:36.292
And it all lived on my laptop.

00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:37.500
Can't really do that anymore.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.530
And now you have to
have an army of people.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.035
The Phillies hired someone
from here, actually.

00:33:43.035 --> 00:33:43.910
AUDIENCE: Andy Galdi.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.570
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.150
And I don't think he had much,
if any, baseball background.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.270
But they needed somebody
to build the architecture,

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.310
hardware and software,
to handle this data.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.480
And then, set up
the middleware to be

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.021
able to communicate
with the existing

00:33:56.021 --> 00:33:58.560
systems for PITCHf/x data
for old scouting reports,

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.300
pro and amateur.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.940
I mean, they walked in, and
it was terribly shocking

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.650
that Ruben Amaro left nothing.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.150
But there was absolutely
nothing in place.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.810
There were no systems
whatsoever to handle

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.719
Statcast, which was introduced
in Ruben's last year as GM.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:15.900
But not really much for
handling any of the data that

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.739
was there before.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.929
So they said I was
actually probably better

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.640
than having to come in and just
junk systems that were already

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.139
in place.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.530
But still, there was a huge--

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.500
it took almost a whole year
for them to get enough in place

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.190
that they felt like they could
really regularly run queries

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.260
against the Statcast data.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.120
With only 2 and 1/2
years of data so far,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.830
though, I tried to
make the argument

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.490
that I do believe this
is changing the game.

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.239
Teams have certainly
found certain things.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.655
Launch angle, I
think, is probably

00:34:43.655 --> 00:34:45.659
the one that's gotten the
most public attention.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.510
Teams are learning new things.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.909
We still don't know as
much as we'd like to know.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.442
It's a lot of data in
terms of the storage size.

00:34:55.442 --> 00:34:57.150
But that's not a lot
of years, certainly,

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.441
if you want to be able to
look at players' changes year

00:34:59.441 --> 00:35:01.152
over year.

00:35:01.152 --> 00:35:02.610
Do you want just
one year baseline?

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.450
Two years baseline?

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.970
Well sorry, that's all we
have is 2 and 1/2 so far.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.870
I would say we probably need
four or five years of data

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.620
to be able to draw some more
serious conclusions about what

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.650
does spin rate mean on a--
especially-- the example I love

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.930
to give is spin
rate on a fastball.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.310
When I learned to scout, if
I was talking about spin,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:24.900
that was a breaking ball.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.537
No one ever talked
about whether a fastball

00:35:27.537 --> 00:35:28.620
could have different spin.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.561
It was its velocity.

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:31.560
We talk about its movement,
its visual movement.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.650
But the idea of talking about
its spin rate was just--

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.460
it wasn't an idea.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.840
Nobody discussed it.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.640
Now we have data on that.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.720
And the guys at Major
League Baseball--

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.665
Corey Schwartz, Tom
Tango, that whole team.

00:35:43.665 --> 00:35:44.790
I sat down with those guys.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.300
And they showed me a chart just
from last year that graphed

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.760
velocity against spin rate.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.630
And it turned out that high spin
rate, high velocity, obviously,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.580
is great if you can do that.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.120
Average velocity high
spin rate was pretty good.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.100
High velocity average spin rate
was actually not very good.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.280
It was the [INAUDIBLE]
problem, where he threw 100,

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.730
and he'd get his ass handed
to him because hitters

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.770
were constantly squaring it up.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.840
But it turned out low
spin rate was much better

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.395
than average spin rate.

00:36:13.395 --> 00:36:14.770
Now that was
something that, one,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.730
I think you might say
it was counterintuitive,

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.545
or simply just nobody
considered it before.

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:21.920
But I looked at that and said,
that's really interesting.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.170
It could certainly change the
way that we scout and evaluate

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.530
players.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.020
But I'd want to see more than
one year of data on that too.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.180
And I'd want to
see how repeatable

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.280
that is for certain pitchers.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.480
So things we think are true
now may turn out to be not true

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.604
or to need more detail as we
get more data from Statcast.

00:36:39.604 --> 00:36:40.520
And I'll also say too.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.853
This is probably something
very familiar to those of you

00:36:42.853 --> 00:36:44.861
in the room who work
with this kind of data.

00:36:44.861 --> 00:36:46.610
Everyone, including
Major League Baseball,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:50.090
said 2015 being year
one of the system,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.870
there were a lot of
errors in the system.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.740
And so Major League
Baseball themselves

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.830
had to spend a lot of time
looking for systemic errors.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.300
And then, a couple
of teams told me

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.090
they've specifically hired
folks with computer science

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.130
backgrounds whose primary
responsibility now

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.280
is just cleaning Statcast
data, looking for errors that

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.700
can be solved algorithmically as
opposed to individually looking

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.170
for mistakes.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.810
One, that job just didn't
exist three years ago.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.030
And two, also says
to me we probably

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.082
still need more years of data
to work enough of those out.

00:37:20.082 --> 00:37:22.040
Like, you wouldn't want
to run a lot of queries

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.190
against 2015 only to find
out 30% of the data was off.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.320
That seems like a
recipe for disaster.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.934
But hopefully, the more
years that we run the system,

00:37:29.934 --> 00:37:31.850
the more that those will
get worked out of it,

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.340
and teams will be able to
do more work with it going

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:38.630
forward, and find more
unconventional uses

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.030
for the data like the one I
mentioned in the last chapter

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.260
about identifying pitchers
who are fatigued by changes

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.079
in their velocity or spin rate.

00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:49.370
I give the example of the
Padres sending down a pitcher

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.995
last year because
they noticed his spin

00:37:50.995 --> 00:37:52.850
rate was dropping in August.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.620
They sent him down,
but it was effectively

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.040
like a forced rest thing where
we think you're fatigued.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.000
You're not hurt yet,
but you might get hurt.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.250
So we can't put you on the DL.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.830
But we can, at least, make
you not pitch for a week or so

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.984
by sending you down
rather than have

00:38:05.984 --> 00:38:07.400
you continue to
pitch through this

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.970
and, potentially,
cause real damage.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:13.170
If you're a Major
League GM and I told you

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.170
you can get rid of one
pitcher DL stint per year,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.024
how much is that worth,
especially if it's

00:38:18.024 --> 00:38:19.190
one of your better pitchers?

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.279
What is that worth
in saved value?

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:24.320
Probably enough to fund
your analytics department

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.050
for a year.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.520
So the bar is pretty low.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.790
And that's why teams
are willing to, even

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.430
with the limited years of
data that we have so far are

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.390
willing to take chances
like that and say,

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.254
well, we think this is right.

00:38:35.254 --> 00:38:37.670
We think this is telling us
that this pitcher is fatigued.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.770
This pitcher might be on
a road towards injury.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.302
Let's, at least,
work with it now.

00:38:41.302 --> 00:38:43.010
Even if we might need
more years to prove

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.010
that that hypothesis is
true, it's worth it to us

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.980
now to just use it
as if it were true

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.426
and maybe prevent a disaster.

00:38:51.426 --> 00:38:53.204
MATT TEPER: Cool.

00:38:53.204 --> 00:38:55.620
So I want to give you guys a
chance to ask some questions.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.580
And if you guys are familiar
with Keith's live chats he does

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.132
on his website or the ones
he used to do on ESPN,

00:39:01.132 --> 00:39:02.840
he answers a lot of
questions about a lot

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.090
of different things.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.424
And he's gracious enough to
answer pretty much anything.

00:39:06.424 --> 00:39:07.965
KEITH LAW: Anything's
fair game, yes.

00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:10.322
MATT TEPER: So we'll
walk around with the mic.

00:39:10.322 --> 00:39:12.160
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:12.915
First a comment.

00:39:12.915 --> 00:39:15.290
Yeah, Andy is still surprised
that the Phillies hired him

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.951
from Google because Google
has no World Series ever.

00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:19.450
Google has never
won a World Series.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.030
KEITH LAW: No, no.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.720
AUDIENCE: It's amazing.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.830
KEITH LAW: Neither
has Houston, though.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.015
So you're equal, right?

00:39:23.015 --> 00:39:23.681
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:39:23.681 --> 00:39:24.250
Right.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.460
And by the way, you're
absolutely right.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.918
Like, a lot of his
first hires have

00:39:26.918 --> 00:39:29.000
been software engineers
to just process the data,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.440
as well as QAs.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.990
So in the spirit
of the Statcast,

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:35.210
we were just talking
about, my question,

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.760
which is somewhat like interview
questions we ask here is,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.680
suppose you could have
any data collected

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.730
to answer any question.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.579
So after Statcast,
what data do you

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:44.870
want to start seeing collected?

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:48.670
Is it off the field health data?

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.330
Suppose we mine Statcast
in the next five, 10 years,

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.330
and learn defense, and
learn all this stuff

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:54.320
you just talked about.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.870
What data do you
want to collect next?

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.820
KEITH LAW: There's two answers.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.280
And we're starting to do the
TrackMan portion of Statcast

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.212
data.

00:40:02.212 --> 00:40:04.670
We're starting to get some more
of that on amateur players.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:08.214
Certainly, so in 10 days from
now, I'll be at Wrigley Field

00:40:08.214 --> 00:40:10.130
for the Under Armour
All-American Class, which

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:13.730
is kind of an all-star game
of high school rising seniors

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.837
for next year's draft.

00:40:14.837 --> 00:40:16.670
The Cubs just turned
the TrackMan system on,

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.830
and they can collect
data from that game

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.510
on all of those players.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.870
And evaluating
high school players

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.490
has always been
entirely subjective.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.110
There has just been no data
because high school stats

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:27.450
great.

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.070
You hit .600.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.040
That's really not
useful to me at all.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.290
AUDIENCE: I hit
.600 in high school.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.810
KEITH LAW: Or yes, he struck
out two guys an inning.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.810
He throws 95.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.240
And no one else in the
county throws more than 70.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.010
So again, not very useful.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.500
But having TrackMan
data at least help us,

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.400
even if it's just putting those
amateur players into buckets

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.570
to help us give another
objective component,

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.320
or to help us compare
high school players

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.450
to college players,
which was a problem when

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.080
I was with the Blue Jays.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.788
I think it's still a
problem figuring out

00:40:55.788 --> 00:40:56.950
how to value those guys.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.180
So we're heading in that
direction, certainly.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.641
The cost of the system
is a little prohibitive.

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:03.140
But they're putting
TrackMan systems

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.540
in a lot of minor
league parks to which,

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.670
if you're running a
minor league park, hey,

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.160
let's do a local
high school event.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.618
Just flick the
system, and then you

00:41:11.618 --> 00:41:14.120
can turn around and sell
the data to the teams too.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.340
The other thing,
and I think it's

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.860
coming but it might be a
few years down the road,

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.887
is more biometric data.

00:41:19.887 --> 00:41:21.470
And there are people
trying to invent,

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.910
like, the Motus sleeve is one.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.460
I don't know if it actually
does what it's claiming to do,

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.667
but I love the idea.

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:29.000
It's a sleeve that pitchers
would wear and then actually

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.510
pitch--

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.270
whether it's in games or merely
just doing side sessions--

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.820
that would track
things like stress

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.380
on certain parts of the joint.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.260
Like the valgus force on the
elbow, which is possibly,

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.620
probably, one of the
potential causes of UCL tears.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.170
Even more so on the shoulder,
which, once the shoulder goes,

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.660
it's a lot harder to
fix than a torn elbow

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.600
ligament, which Tommy John,
80%, 85% success rate.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.730
Shoulder surgery success
rate's a lot lower.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.025
If we could identify things in
the shoulder, signs of fatigue.

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:58.400
You know, what I
talked about was

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.524
second order, this idea
that spin rate is dropping.

00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:04.430
What if we could see changes
in the shoulder sooner,

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.680
or knees, lower back?

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.600
I mean, baseball
players get hurt

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.470
a lot for a non-contact sport.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.670
AUDIENCE: A lot of these
are cascades, right?

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:12.325
KEITH LAW: Yes.

00:42:12.325 --> 00:42:13.880
AUDIENCE: It starts in a leg,
and it turns into a shoulder.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.296
KEITH LAW: This
is always my fear,

00:42:15.296 --> 00:42:18.226
and I feel pretty
confident I've seen

00:42:18.226 --> 00:42:19.850
it happen with pitchers
over the years,

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:20.900
too, that something goes wrong.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.816
A little ankle injury.

00:42:21.816 --> 00:42:23.533
Well I want to pitch through it.

00:42:23.533 --> 00:42:24.740
I'm gonna change the
delivery slightly.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.740
Next thing you know,
it's the elbow.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.780
It's the shoulder.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.734
Anything we can do to just
spot it before it happens.

00:42:29.734 --> 00:42:32.150
Players are always going to
get hurt, especially pitchers.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.930
But if we can stop it before it
gets too far, like I was just

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.090
saying earlier, that's a
huge financial savings.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.310
And I think it makes
it a better product.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.070
We want the better
players on the field.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.900
And I hate everything-- sort
of a running gag on Twitter--

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.470
every time a pitcher blows out,
it's also an acknowledgement

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.150
that this is just
part of the sport.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.327
If we could reduce that
sooner using data--

00:42:53.327 --> 00:42:55.160
it's not like we found
another way to do it.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.146
Data is kind of like our last
best hope to try to do that.

00:42:58.146 --> 00:42:59.754
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:42:59.754 --> 00:43:01.670
The first one is, how
much [? stat ?] activity

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.540
do you still see in
the front office based

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.540
on, say, the race, or the
height, or the outfit,

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.100
or the background
for the players,

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.337
despite having the data
[INAUDIBLE] in the past decade?

00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:14.420
That's the first question.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:14.830
KEITH LAW: Go ahead.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.204
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:43:16.204 --> 00:43:20.600
is, how much data
do voters nowadays

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.390
use to vote for MVPs
or Hall of Famers?

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.910
Do they still use their
subjective observations?

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.520
KEITH LAW: So to the first
question, it's changed.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.100
I'm sure there's still
racism within baseball,

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.530
as there is everywhere in
the industry, everywhere

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.710
in society.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.710
I think it's gotten
a lot better.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.530
And I think that the
change in the composition

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.120
of the front
offices where you've

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.369
got more of a mix of people
from different backgrounds

00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:48.536
too means that that kind
of thinking, if it pops up,

00:43:48.536 --> 00:43:50.618
it's just going to kind
of be dismissed or swatted

00:43:50.618 --> 00:43:51.500
away a little sooner.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.000
You mentioned height.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.010
That, to me, is one that is
probably still overconsidered,

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.180
especially for hitters.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.540
Like, we've seen Andrew
Benintendi, Alex Bregman,

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.040
they're all listed
at, like, 6 foot.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.030
If they're 6 foot, I'm 5' 11".

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.011
I mean, I've met
Alex Bregman twice.

00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:11.260
And I can look him in the eye.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.509
It's like, dude, you're 5' 8".

00:44:12.509 --> 00:44:14.420
Marcus Stroman is
probably 5' 8".

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.730
He might be 5' 9".

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.300
But these guys are pretty good.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.450
But there's still a fairly
strong bias against players

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.870
who are undersized like that.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.891
To me, we're still working
to create some separation

00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:29.390
because I do think
there are aspects

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.050
where height, especially for a
pitcher, might really matter.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:38.305
You know, if you are a
pitcher, especially if you're

00:44:38.305 --> 00:44:40.680
throwing a four seamer, and
you're not particularly tall,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.500
and that fastball is
coming in fairly flat,

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.150
you're going to give up
a lot of air contact.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.340
You may just be giving
up harder contact period.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:46.970
That's real.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.880
That's a real effect that we
might be able to measure better

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.484
going forward, too.

00:44:51.484 --> 00:44:53.150
There's also this
longstanding mentality

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.400
that short pitchers
get hurt more often.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.765
I've never seen any
evidence to back that up,

00:44:57.765 --> 00:44:59.390
and it still kills
me when I hear that.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.870
We see tall pitchers
get hurt all the time.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.370
And then, there's a corollary
that really tall pitchers also

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.400
get hurt more often because
they can't coordinate.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.650
They can't all be 6' 2".

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:09.230
I'm sorry.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.420
Like, we're not putting
them out of a factory here.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.790
You're gonna have to
figure out what the--

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:14.480
first of all,
you're going to have

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.250
to prove either of those
assertions, which I don't think

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.750
are true.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.130
And second is figure out what's
your comfort level if you

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.921
really do think a
shorter or taller pitcher

00:45:20.921 --> 00:45:23.300
is going to get hurt.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.230
To your second question,
using more data,

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.860
better data has shown up
more in annual award voting

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.919
because that electorate
changes constantly.

00:45:32.919 --> 00:45:34.460
You have to be an
active writer to be

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.960
able to vote on those awards.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.760
The Hall of Fame, though,
they did change it.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.370
They got rid of some
of the dinosaurs

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.540
recently with a rule change.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.120
But still, there are people
who have not covered baseball

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.330
for eight or nine years who
still have Hall of Fame votes.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:48.950
You get a vote.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.090
It used to be lifetime.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.400
Once you spent 10
consecutive years

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.520
as an active badge holder, which
I am a member of the Baseball

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.430
Writers' Association.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.630
And then, once you got the vote,
it was yours till you died.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:02.690
Now you get it, and you hold
it as long as you're active,

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.480
plus 10 years when you
stop covering baseball,

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.152
10 years beyond.

00:46:06.152 --> 00:46:08.360
So we've still got a lot of
guys who have just missed

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.920
the analytics revolution.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.801
Don't care.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.050
I mentioned some names before.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.490
Guys who just don't
agree with it.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.840
They still have votes.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.540
Whereas they may not be voting
on annual awards anymore.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.040
And so it's going
to take more time.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.991
Sort of the Max Planck thing
on science, when science really

00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:22.490
changes.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.420
It's not that one side
convinces the other,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.000
it's that the other side dies.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.320
And that's when the new
idea manages to win.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.778
I mean, that's kind of what's
happening in the Hall of Fame

00:46:30.778 --> 00:46:32.900
voting too is the older
anti-analytics people

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.800
are just gradually going to
stop voting because they passed

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.250
away, or they just
get old enough

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.310
and they don't vote
anymore, or they age out.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:45.120
And 10 years from now, I think
it's going to be much more--

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.611
I don't want to say data driven.

00:46:46.611 --> 00:46:47.610
It's going to be better.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.410
We're going to get
better results.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.660
We're going to get more
fact-based voting, which

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.370
is all I ask for.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.120
We don't all have to
agree on the players,

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.980
but I would like it to be
more grounded in reality, not

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.630
on whether Jim Rice
was really feared.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.646
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about how

00:47:01.646 --> 00:47:03.770
some of these advanced
metrics and the availability

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.989
of information might
affect the umpiring.

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.530
So we talk a lot
about pitch framing.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.710
And you see catchers that are
really good at it or bad at it.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.376
Do you think that,
eventually, that this

00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:13.760
could lead to either front
offices or even people

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.130
in the media pushing for a
different type of umpire?

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.290
I mean, I read in Brian Kenny's
book that, back in the day,

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.720
the umpires had to
be big and strong

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.040
and potentially break up
actual physical altercations.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.535
And that clearly
has still bled over

00:47:24.535 --> 00:47:26.410
to the type of umpires
that are around today.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.250
You get a lot of them that
you talk about your ump shows

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:28.840
on Twitter.

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.710
And you see people that
love to insert themselves

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:31.793
in the middle of the game.

00:47:31.793 --> 00:47:34.450
Do you see the profile of
an umpire changing over time

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.200
as a result of this
available information?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.280
KEITH LAW: I haven't.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.980
I don't think so.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.200
My one hesitation is
Major League Baseball

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.730
does have more
umpire accountability

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.140
behind the scenes than we see.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.030
Umpires are evaluated
on things like

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.190
their ball-strike accuracy.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.350
They don't release any
of that to the public.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.516
I wish they were a little
more transparent about it,

00:47:53.516 --> 00:47:54.650
certainly.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:58.875
And I don't really understand
the idea why they're not.

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.250
I think-- and I've expressed
this to some people at Major

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.262
League Baseball too--

00:48:03.262 --> 00:48:05.720
these guys are more accurate
than the average fan, I think,

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.886
gives them credit for being.

00:48:06.886 --> 00:48:08.570
Rob Manfred even
said yesterday he

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.390
thought if we went to
automated ball-strike calling,

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.360
we'd have a larger margin
of error, I think he said,

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.790
with the technology
than we do with people.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:17.810
That may be true.

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.518
If you actually invest
in the technology,

00:48:19.518 --> 00:48:22.100
it's probably going
to shrink over time.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.530
I've also argued too, I think
you'll get more consistency.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.200
I think batters and
pitchers would say,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.497
we're fine if we don't actually
improve the accuracy right now.

00:48:31.497 --> 00:48:32.455
We want predictability.

00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:33.404
We want consistency.

00:48:33.404 --> 00:48:34.820
I want to know
that that ball that

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.540
is 2 inches from the
edge of the plate

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.540
is always going to
be called a strike.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:45.257
But I think Major League
Baseball would do pretty well

00:48:45.257 --> 00:48:46.715
to release more of
that information

00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:48.650
and show us that, hey,
some of these umpires

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.750
are actually more
accurate than you think.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.300
I don't get the sense
that they've necessarily

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.460
changed the type of people
they're looking for.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.470
And I know people at
Major League Baseball

00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:00.560
that have said they do still
value the big personality

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.700
umpire who can--

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.890
I mean, Joe West, and I
pick on him all the time.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.457
But if there's a real
scrum on the field,

00:49:07.457 --> 00:49:09.290
he's a good person to
have out there for it.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.000
If there's actual
conflict, that's

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.680
where I think he really excels.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.875
And that is something you want.

00:49:14.875 --> 00:49:16.000
We don't want to be hockey.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.170
We don't want fights to be
a huge part of the sport.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.870
Well, then, you probably do want
some umpires who can do that.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.305
I would argue that now
you've split the job, though.

00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:26.180
Somebody who's good at
that isn't necessarily

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.727
going to be good at
ball-strike accuracy.

00:49:28.727 --> 00:49:31.310
Maybe that means Joe West should
always be a first base umpire

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.840
and should never be
behind the plate.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:33.620
I'd be OK with that.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.880
I don't know if
the umpires would.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.505
But maybe that means
splitting the job.

00:49:36.505 --> 00:49:37.957
We want different
kinds of umpires

00:49:37.957 --> 00:49:40.040
so that we've got different
skill sets represented

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:42.623
in the four spots, four people,
or in the post-season, the six

00:49:42.623 --> 00:49:44.600
people on the field.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.060
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
watched a national broadcast

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.240
on ESPN or Fox?

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.300
They're so bad.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.215
Why can't they get this right?

00:49:52.215 --> 00:49:53.840
KEITH LAW: I use the
mute button a lot.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.880
And that's not specific to ESPN,
or to Fox, or to anyone else.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.100
One problem I have also
is I know these players.

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.670
I know a lot about the players.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.430
Often, you're not telling me
anything I don't already know.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:10.010
Or you're telling me
something I know isn't true.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.960
That drives me up the wall.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.160
And I don't want to start
talking back to the iPad

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.440
because now I've got a
wife and a daughter who

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.110
will both point out to me that
that's not really appropriate.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.790
I will say it's frickin
hard to do those things.

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.650
This came up at one
of the recent signings

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.600
I did around the book too.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.116
When you're trying to do color
commentary-- so I did a game--

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.490
they had me do a whole game
in spring training this year,

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:38.840
which is good.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.215
Much better than dropping in
for two, three innings where

00:50:41.215 --> 00:50:44.120
you barely have time to say hi.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.670
I got to give a lot of
content, but you can't educate.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:47.657
You get no opportunity.

00:50:47.657 --> 00:50:49.490
If I wanted to talk
weighted on-base average

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:54.270
in the middle of a game, you
have 10, 15 seconds, maybe,

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:55.190
to get something in.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.410
You can't explain concepts.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.750
You have to talk details.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.690
You have to talk about
what just happened,

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.190
and give something
very pithy, which

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.690
sometimes the pithy
explanation is not necessarily

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.130
the right explanation.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.610
And if you start
rambling, there's

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.112
a voice in your ear saying wrap.

00:51:12.112 --> 00:51:14.570
We got to go to commercial,
the next hitter's up, whatever.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.046
Or I'm very conscious of it.

00:51:16.046 --> 00:51:17.920
I see, all right, there's
a ball in play now.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.400
I have to stop talking.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.300
That's really hard.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.508
Whereas in a studio show,
you have a little more room

00:51:22.508 --> 00:51:23.930
to breathe.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.180
And then you can choreograph
everything from the start

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.730
too and say, the
B block tonight,

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.740
we're going to talk
about prospects.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.900
We're going to talk
about sabermetrics.

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.460
We're going to
introduce one concept

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.500
and spend a couple
of minutes on it.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.940
It's hard to figure
out how to do

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.742
that in a game when you know
your main job is to just talk

00:51:40.742 --> 00:51:42.200
about what's
happening on the field

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.366
and give people the basic
information that they need

00:51:44.366 --> 00:51:47.990
to understand what's in front
of them, which still doesn't

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:50.150
excuse hey, he's
a clutch hitter.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:51.690
Hey, it's a big RBI spot.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:54.120
He smells that RBI
on second base.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:59.056
It's like, you could probably
skip that and we'd all be OK.

00:51:59.056 --> 00:52:01.384
AUDIENCE: Keith, you have a
lot of eclectic interests.

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.800
And you mentioned that you
love learning about, basically,

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.250
everything getting more data.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.190
So other than baseball,
what's something

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:09.680
in either your personal
life or out in society where

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.650
you would just love more data?

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:16.610
KEITH LAW: Oh, that's
a really good question.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.200
Because when I
think of learning,

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:21.475
I decide when I started
learning to cook 20 years ago,

00:52:21.475 --> 00:52:22.490
it wasn't really data.

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:24.680
But I was looking
for people who took

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.820
a more scientific approach.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:31.070
So it was Alton Brown, now
Kenji Lopez-Alt where not just

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:33.440
their recipes but their
entire style of talking

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.540
about something
is driven by data.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.580
Driven by, in their
cases, experimentation

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.790
or understanding the
science behind cooking

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.990
so that it works every time.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.060
You get it right the first time.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.230
That's the kind of thing I
like, regardless of what it is.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.140
When I'm-- when it's--

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.360
even when I write
about books or movies,

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.850
I'm nobody's critic
or expert on this.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:56.960
I just read a lot.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.427
And so I write a lot.

00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:01.010
But you'll notice a
lot of my reviews,

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:02.600
they sort of follow
certain patterns.

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.380
There's certain things that
I'm specifically looking for.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.997
I kind of think more
methodically about anything

00:53:09.997 --> 00:53:12.080
that I'm doing when I'm
talking about board games,

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.560
or talking about art and
anything in the arts,

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.330
or I'm talking about cooking.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:21.460
I'm always trying to break down
what are the criteria here.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.970
Maybe what are the criteria--

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:24.490
hey, I liked playing that game.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:25.990
Well, what are the
specific criteria

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.260
that made me like that game,
to get behind my own thinking?

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.010
So that's probably
not an exact answer

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.889
to your question because I'm not
thinking of an interest of mine

00:53:33.889 --> 00:53:36.180
where I could necessarily
say I want more data on that.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.280
But it's the whole sort of
more rational, analytical way

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.056
of breaking down my
thinking on everything.

00:53:43.056 --> 00:53:44.930
Because then I can also
say, well, all right,

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.820
now I know what I like,
or now I know what worked.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.230
Hey, I can go make
my own recipe.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:50.300
Hey, I can go figure out
what board game to play

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.640
next, what book to read next.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.584
Well, I know these are
three or four things

00:53:53.584 --> 00:53:55.250
that I've specifically
liked in the past

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.970
and then target what I'm
looking for next to meet

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:02.546
those criteria that I've
identified for myself.

00:54:02.546 --> 00:54:05.540
MATT TEPER: On combining
the love of cooking

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.920
and the love of baseball,
I put out a call

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.705
to some folks, baseball
fans at Google.

00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:11.330
And one of the
questions that came back

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.700
was, with your love
of both things,

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.030
what stadium has the best food?

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:21.165
KEITH LAW: Citi
Field has great food.

00:54:21.165 --> 00:54:22.790
They're mostly Danny
Meyer restaurants.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.577
So it's like a Shake
Shack, Blue Smoke.

00:54:25.577 --> 00:54:27.410
I'm trying to think of
where else I've been.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.910
I've not been to the new Atlanta
stadium, but Hugh Acheson--

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.520
who I think did one
of these talks--

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.020
has a sausage stand there, which
will be the place I go eat.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:36.860
Target Field.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.200
Actually, Target Field,
that's the first one I've

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.190
been to where they seem to get a
diverse selection of local food

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.840
vendors because--

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.466
the problem with
stadium food and why

00:54:46.466 --> 00:54:47.840
I don't eat a lot
of stadium food

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.190
is it's either the Aramark
type garbage stadium food,

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.630
or it's national chains.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:56.150
Like, I don't need Panda
Express at a stadium.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.910
If I wanted to eat bad,
imitation Chinese food,

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.820
I can get that on
any corner, right?

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:02.942
Like, I'll pay more.

00:55:02.942 --> 00:55:03.650
I'm at a stadium.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:05.369
I'm expecting I'm
going to pay more.

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:06.410
Give me a better product.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.710
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:08.210
KEITH LAW: And when
the Futures Game

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.110
was at Target Field a
couple of years ago,

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.025
I was floored by how many
different local restaurants.

00:55:13.025 --> 00:55:16.450
Andrew Zimmern's got a--
the "Bizarre Foods" guy--

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.200
he's got at least one
food stand in there.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.939
The Butcher and Boar, which is
a high-end restaurant there,

00:55:20.939 --> 00:55:22.730
has a food stand where
it's just two items,

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.360
but it's this incredibly
high-quality food

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.810
to be getting at a stadium.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.309
And especially now with the
high price point of Major League

00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:32.300
tickets, it just makes
sense that if you're

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.980
going to ask them to
pay $14 for a beer,

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.780
you might as well
actually provide them

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.320
with better food at
that same price point.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.327
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:55:39.327 --> 00:55:40.410
One last question from me.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:40.960
KEITH LAW: Yeah.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.230
MATT TEPER: I have
two little girls.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.105
We've discussed that.

00:55:43.105 --> 00:55:45.010
You have a little girl.

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.396
Will a woman ever play
Major League Baseball?

00:55:47.396 --> 00:55:48.560
KEITH LAW: Ever?

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.520
Yeah, probably.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:50.801
It'll be a long time.

00:55:50.801 --> 00:55:51.800
It would be a long time.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.872
I mean, there are
cultural factors.

00:55:55.872 --> 00:55:57.830
They're just discouraged
from playing baseball.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.000
Girls play softball, right?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.260
So even if someone shows
the ability, most of them

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.950
are going to get steered
off into the wrong sport.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:10.820
And you asked earlier
about biases around size.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.674
I mean, that's
always going to hurt.

00:56:12.674 --> 00:56:14.840
It's going to have to be a
woman who's exceptionally

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.450
tall, exceptionally strong.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.069
She's going to have to be more.

00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:21.110
The standards that we
would hold male players to,

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.870
the woman is going to have to
exceed all of those standards

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.810
by a fairly large margin
before she's taken seriously

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:29.300
enough by the industry.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.060
And that's not even
just gender bias.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.590
It's just the way baseball's
always treated its outliers.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:39.710
It was the reluctance to let--

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:42.010
not to let but to pay.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.560
Like, when Hideo Nomo came over,
it's like, that'll never work.

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.980
Japanese got a weird delivery.

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:50.420
That's never gonna-- I mean,
Japanese pitchers have been OK,

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:50.920
right?

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.230
We've had a few
pretty good ones.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.271
But there was a huge bias
because that was other.

00:56:54.271 --> 00:56:57.410
That's just not how we do
things because we've always

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:59.870
had a hard time
fitting players who

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.620
don't fit our archetypes
into traditional evaluation.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.402
Data is blind.

00:57:04.402 --> 00:57:06.110
So we don't know what
the guy looks like.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.070
We don't know what
the delivery is like.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:08.180
We don't know how
hard he's throwing.

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:09.846
We just know he's
missing a lot of bats.

00:57:09.846 --> 00:57:10.625
MATT TEPER: Yeah.

00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:12.500
KEITH LAW: Yeah, thank you guys.

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.950
[APPLAUSE]
