[MUSIC]

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.130
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.230
So hello once again.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.310
Welcome to Android
Design in Action.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.310
For those of you who aren't
watching live and who were

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.890
watching the YouTube
pre-roll--

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.900
or YouTube recording, we had
some interesting technical

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900
difficulties.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.780
So we're just going
to start over.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.980
And this will, hopefully,
be the better

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.100
version of the show episode.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.430
My name is Roman Nurik.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.720
ADAM KOCH: Hey guys.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.080
My name is Adam Koch.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.700
ROMAN NURIK: And today we're
going to actually show a demo

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
of the I/O app.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.130
We'll talk a little bit about
what that is in a second.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
We'll also do a deep dive-- a
narrow dive, as you pointed

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.980
out before--

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.340
into sharing, as well
as fullscreen UIs.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.690
So we have a lot of
content to cover.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.130
This may run the longer
than 30 minutes.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.130
If it does, then really
sorry about that.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.080
But too bad.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.270
So let's jump into the
I/O app real quick.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.520
So the I/O app is an app that
our team developed that helped

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.269
Google I/O 2013 attendees find
their way around the

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.980
conference, take a look at what
interesting sessions were

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.040
playing, as well as
interact with

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.180
folks socially on Google+.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310
Obviously, this is a
responsively-designed app.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.020
There's a phone and
tablet version.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.780
It supports 7-inch, 10-inch.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.740
Things scale up progressively.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.780
So it's an overall
a quite nice app.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.060
And we're to do a deep dive
on some of the details.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.020
Anything you want to add
before we jump in?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.450
ADAM KOCH: I think we mentioned
on the previous run

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.710
that it's an open-source app.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.770
So right now, the source
code that's out

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.740
there is the 2012 version.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.620
So, last year's version.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.140
But later this year, or
hopefully in the coming

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.940
months, we will be
open-sourcing the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.280
2013 version as well.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.400
ROMAN NURIK: Yes.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.760
OK.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.600
So let's jump into the demo.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.530
And let's hope it
works this time.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.705
So here's the app running on
10-inch and 7-inch devices.

00:01:57.705 --> 00:01:59.670
ADAM KOCH: 4-inch.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090
ROMAN NURIK: I said that wrong
the first time, too.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.570
So 4-inch and 10-inch devices.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.330
And you'll notice that there are
a lot of similarities in

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.290
the visual language.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.910
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.450
But also, just in terms of
navigation, on the phone you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.160
have tabs representing your
three top-level sections.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.030
You have your schedule,
which is personalized.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.110
Your Explore as well
as your stream.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.690
Explore contains things like
map, and list of tracks, and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.020
things like that.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.050
And then on a tablet, we blow
it up into a dashboard UI.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.120
Not actually the dashboard
pattern, with the four

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720
six-pack of icons, but it's
really kind of like a what

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.940
happening now type of screen,
where you see your current

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.800
schedule, upcoming sessions, as
well as the stream of, what

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.820
are people buzzing about?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.850
What are people talking about
on Google+ about the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.960
conference?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.710
So it's kind of interesting.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.060
There are a lot of touches that
we added to this app over

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.050
previous years.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.790
And we'll do a deep
dive on that now.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.230
So the first thin I wanted to
call out was just the diagonal

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.740
patterns that we
use throughout.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.970
And this is something that
has been around in

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.620
Android for a while.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.730
More recently with the Google
Play Store, as well as Google

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.380
Play apps redesigns, we've kind
of moved away from that.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.140
But we held on to this
pattern in our app.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.620
So what I'm really talking about
here is this kind of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.510
diagonal-line pattern that you
can see here in the tabs--

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.510
it may not come out well
in the video feed--

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.840
as well as over here in the
Schedule Time heading.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.860
And the same goes
for the tablet.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.180
The background, actually, of
this area is that diagonal

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.100
line pattern.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.020
So it's just part of the visual
language of the app.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.610
And we use it throughout as a
way to partly communicate, or

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.510
partly introduce contrast rather
than using different

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.570
colors, but also just as a
visual stylistic choice.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.300
So the next thing I wanted
to talk about was, in the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.000
schedule, we actually have
these borderless buttons,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.450
these secondary touch targets.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.490
And this is something that is
kind of cool if you have a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.370
common other action
for a line item.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.600
So here, rather than just
choosing this session that's

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.023
in my schedule, I can just
choose to see all items that

00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:13.200
are in my schedule
for that time.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.170
Or all available sessions
in that time.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.380
Another one of my favorites is
the Contextual Action bar.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.390
So let's say you wanted to share
something immediately,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.360
rather than jumping
into the session.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.750
You could long press.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.380
And you actually get the
contextual actions that you

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.470
can take on there.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.890
You can also switch
to other sessions.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.300
And you can't actually select
anything else, since you can't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.530
really do actions on them.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.600
Let's see.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600
So moving on to the
Explore tab.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.890
This is actually something
that's fairly subtle, and a

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.580
lot of you that have used this
app may not have noticed this.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.800
So we have this map
area at the top.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.140
And something that we do is,
on press, we actually

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.780
desaturate the background.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.930
So you can see that the yellow
these yellow road lines, they

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.140
actually become gray.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.950
Another app that does this, I
believe, is Google Currents.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.600
One of the reasons we decided to
do it-- and this is just a

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.200
neat trick.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.140
It doesn't really add
too much here.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.350
But it's something that helps
prevent color collisions

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.740
between your touch highlight,
your semi-transparent blue

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.110
touch highlight, and the
background content.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.200
We also do this in other areas,
I think, for Avatar

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.060
icons, which we can
show later.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.600
And then, obviously,
we're using

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.590
different weights of Roboto.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.630
Here in the tracks list
we use Roboto Light.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.370
And actually, for sessions that
have passed-- you can't

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.445
really see this here, because
it's after the conference.

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:46.410
But during the conference, past
sessions were actually

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.210
typeset in Roboto Light to give
them a little less visual

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.280
weight, so that your eye can
naturally focus on things that

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.530
are yet to come.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.810
Another item in the visual
language is, we use these

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.180
circle masks.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.920
And we do this throughout.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.560
We use these in the
stream here.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.870
So you'll notice that here in
the stream, each poster, each

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.020
Google+ person that's posted
something, is in a circle.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.120
And this actually is shown as
well on a phone if you jump

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.780
into, say the Track Details.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.040
So you'll see that at the top
left, we use this track icon

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.330
that's inside of a circle.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.430
And the reason for using
circles, just as a general

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.490
stylistic choice, is it's
a cleaner visual.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.530
It's a little more light.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.300
Having a lot of boxes and
squares can instantly make

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.480
something feel a little rigid,
make your app feel

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.490
a little too rigid.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.450
So just introducing circles
where appropriate--

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.580
it's not a universal thing, just
throw circles at stuff

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.700
and see what happens--

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.290
It may help introduce a little
bit of softness or warmth.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.870
ADAM KOCH: Kind of makes sense
for the Google+ stream as

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.040
well, because the Google+
app also uses the

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.680
circles for the avatars.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.830
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.740
Another one of my favorites is
some tweaks we did to Search.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.060
So if we press the Search button
here, you'll notice

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.540
that you have common keywords.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.390
And this is something that, in
the future, we may want to

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.210
tweak to Recent Searches.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.040
But here are common keywords
that you can search across the

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.220
session corpus on.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.280
And we added this Query
Refinement, which is actually

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.370
really easy for developers.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.620
You simply add a single flag,
and pressing this button

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.490
basically populates the search
field with that.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.220
So you can start with that
Search and then edit

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.970
it as you see fit.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.940
And then the last thing I wanted
to mention on the home

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.220
screen personally was the
View Pager margins.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.080
So as we switch between
different tabs, you'll notice

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.900
that the margins, there's about
a 16-dip margin there.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.090
And they actually use a somewhat
beveling effect.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.820
Very, very subtle.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.890
It's not a very heavy
drop shadow.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.980
But this beveling effect, first
of all, it introduces

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.250
more consistency when you
look at the tablet app.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.900
Each of these, I don't want to
call them cards, but each of

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.090
these panes of content
is actually slightly

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.790
raised on it bevel.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.940
It helps communicate that these
are the same thing if

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.490
you have a phone and a tablet.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.300
Just on a phone, it's helping to
further add a little bit of

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.342
dimensionality without going too
deep into [INAUDIBLE], or

00:08:15.342 --> 00:08:17.030
anything like that.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.715
ADAM KOCH: I think by
default, there's no

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:20.720
margin between them.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.340
So adding something there
is something we

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.620
should think about.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:24.880
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.960
So, and actually, on a tablet--
we talked about that.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.180
Yeah.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.710
I think that was all that I
wanted to mention about the

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.250
Home screen.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.190
Anything else you wanted
to mention, Adam,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.000
before we move on?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.710
ADAM KOCH: Are we covering
this stream later?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.355
ROMAN NURIK: No.

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:36.750
Feel free to talk about
it if you want.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.320
ADAM KOCH: I mean, compared to
the 2012 app, Roman actually

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.320
re-designed the way that
the stream looks here.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.510
And so, avatars around, and
then there's this area for

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.810
content, if there's images
available for those posts or

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.100
repost, reshare.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.450
There this transparent overlay
that shows for certain types

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.240
of post content.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.630
So you can see here, there's
this little overlay image to

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.820
indicate that there's an image
being shared here.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.300
In this case, it's a
video, so there's a

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.730
little video overlay.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:09.610
ROMAN NURIK: And we actually
used a center

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:10.920
crop technique there.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.020
So whatever size, whatever
width the stream is--

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.440
I think we fixed the height.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.140
And generally, this is not
something you want to do on

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.960
tablets if you have really
wide stream items.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.750
But using the same sorts of
crop techniques makes sure

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.640
that each of these photos or
media items, media overlays,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.230
are a fixed size.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.280
But the content, which can be
in various aspect ratios,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.810
stays within that.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.500
And I think we talked about
that last time.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:38.720
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.090
And then two other
minor points.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.220
One, as the images load,
there's a very subtle

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.050
animation as they snap in.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.340
And the other thing I wanted to
mention is, this fragment

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.120
is very responsive.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.290
You'll see it used in many
locations in the app.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.000
And so in this case, it's
approximately the same width

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.400
on both tablet and phone.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.800
In other cases, it may
take up a bigger

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.370
portion of the screen.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.870
But it scales nicely depending
on the amount of width that's

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.040
available to it.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.490
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.260
Let's jump into a
track detail.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.510
So let's jump into the Android
track here on both screens.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.610
I really like this demo setup.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.530
ADAM KOCH: Once it's
finally working.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.836
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:10:15.836 --> 00:10:18.390
Hopefully next time, it'll be
less quirky in the beginning.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:18.780
OK.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.110
So a couple things for the
session, or tracking detail,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.400
as we call this.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.160
So the first is, you'll notice
that there are very similar

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.100
navigational elements.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.970
First, on a tablet, we do
have a two-pane UI.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.020
On a phone we have
a single-pane UI.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.270
On a phone, you actually have
tabs to let you switch between

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.620
the different parts,
or different

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.540
items within a track.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.330
On a phone you have that.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.695
On a tablet, you have a spinner
at the top that lets

00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:49.730
you switch between those.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.020
So if I go from Sessions to
Office Hours, it will just

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.660
switch between that and
Sandbox, for example.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.600
One of the nice things that we
wanted to mention is that you

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.730
do have contextual action
bar support here.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.330
So you can even select one item,
so view one session, and

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.840
then long press to select other
items, and then take

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.440
action on those.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.950
Actually, in this case, there's
no actions I could

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.400
take, because this one
is in my schedule.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.510
But if I only select things that
are not in my schedule, I

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.170
can instantly add those all to
my schedule all at once.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.620
So we also wanted to mention
that the track icons-- again,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.270
track icons is one of the things
we added this year.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.720
We made sure that every track
had some sort of visual

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.912
identifier to help
differentiate

00:11:36.912 --> 00:11:38.350
it from other tracks.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.230
So we use those track icons
in a lot of places.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.170
On a tablet, we use them
in the header here.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.620
So if I switch to, say, the
Google+ track, you notice that

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.645
the header actually changes
the icon to Google+.

00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:51.160
Let's see what else we have.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.660
So, another minor point is,
every UI element that is

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.580
interactive has touch
feedback.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.730
So if I put my finger on here,
I just press down on here,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.070
you'll notice that there's that
blue overlay that covers

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.860
it that indicates that something
is happening.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.010
Also, the same would work if
you used the keyboard or

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.540
something to focus that area.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.250
Another minor point is that on
a tablet, the track spinner,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.480
as well as the session
detail heading, they

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.280
have the same height.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.760
And there's no interactional
reason for it.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.280
It's just a visual way
to align things.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.890
I don't want to talk about
which principle that is,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.540
because I probably don't know.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.030
But definitely, it's one way to
ensure that there's visual

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.480
balance across your UI.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.310
It's to align things
where possible.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.950
If there's no natural point of
alignment, it doesn't make

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.900
sense to do that.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.820
But in this case we thought that
it would make sense to

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.390
align them.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.690
Let's see.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.660
So one thing we can't demo here
is the Portrait Mode.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.510
And we talked about this
very briefly last week.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.200
But in Portrait Mode, if you
were to hold this tablet in

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.270
portrait, you would actually
have a sliding pane layout.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:11.570
So this left pane would
initially be invisible.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.980
But if you were to slide the
Details section over to the

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.090
right, you would slide
out that left pane.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.050
And this is one way to reconcile
having the smaller

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.410
amount of width available
on a 10-inch or

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.260
7-inch device in portrait.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.040
But making sure that you still
have access to the same

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.160
content to maintain the
functional parity across

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.920
portrait and landscape.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.080
So again, a minor point.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.080
Not something we can
demo right now.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.530
And we already talked about
the track icons

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.590
in the action bar.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.140
So anything else we should
cover for just

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.080
this section here?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.500
ADAM KOCH: Um.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.300
ROMAN NURIK: Those are
some of my favorites.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.890
Oh.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.800
Actually, we'll cover
that in a bit.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.150
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.980
We can jump into
session detail.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.520
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.470
So for the session details,
this is one

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.870
of my favorite parts.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.990
So one of the things we did
was, we moved the Add To

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.790
Schedule button from
the Action Bar.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.070
So it used to be this button
over here that would add

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.860
whatever you're currently
looking at to the Action Bar.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.560
Rachel Garb from the Android
User Experience Team actually

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.800
said, it's not really a good
place for a key fundamental

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.930
action like that, something
that should really be

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.240
immediately visible
and immediately

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.150
gain the user's attention.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.790
Because most of the time they're
going to be looking at

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.600
sessions, and they're going to
be wanting to add them to

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.750
their schedule.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.570
Another thing is that, we
actually had a Help overlay.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.530
We had a dialogue pop-up that
said, hey, press this plus

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.770
button to add the session
to your schedule.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.120
And that was just
too indirect.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.520
So we wanted to make it
a little more direct.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.450
And we basically moved that item
from the Action Bar to an

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.520
inline button here, this
In Schedule button.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.940
So one cool thing about this
it sticks to the top.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.570
So while you're viewing session
details, you at any

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.740
point may want to actually
decide, hey, this is

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.500
interesting enough.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.700
I want to add this
to my schedule.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.730
So we decided to make it stick
to the top so that, as you

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.530
make the decision, it's
always there.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.840
And the same goes for
tablet, actually.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.480
It's a little less noticeable
for tablet.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.430
But it's the same behavior.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.620
Another thing is that there's
this subtle animation.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.930
And this is actually only for
Android 4.0 and higher.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.530
As soon as you add something
to your schedule, there's a

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.530
very subtle animation.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.980
The plus becomes a check
box, or a check mark.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.680
And it animates then to say,
hey, it has now been added.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.420
It's almost a subtle
reinforcement that the action

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.560
has really taken place,
and it's now

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.850
really in your schedule.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.920
Very, very subtle.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.060
On earlier versions of the
platform, we simply

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.910
just show and hide.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.000
There's some very basic
switching logic to do that.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.880
Let's see.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.170
So another thing was just
reinforcing that visual

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.670
language of using circles
throughout.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.830
Each of the avatars here, each
of the speakers, are circles.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.200
And if you notice, when you
press on them, they

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.970
desaturate.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.380
Again very, very subtle touch.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:03.060
If you generally have fairly
simple content, you don't

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.660
really need it.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.350
In this case, for avatars,
it's probably not really

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.380
adding that much.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.580
But if you have large photos
that may potentially clash

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.830
with the overlay, you
may want to do that.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:15.780
Let's see.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.680
What else?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.860
ADAM KOCH: I guess you'll see
the diagonal lines here in the

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.440
header again.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.030
And also, the section
headers are a

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.200
recommended pattern here.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.520
You've got the all caps
and the small

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.400
font with the underline.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.535
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:16:28.535 --> 00:16:29.640
We could have used tabs.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.010
We could definitely
have used tabs.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.740
And I think, in previous
versions of the

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.450
app, we did use tabs.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.460
But we've switched more to a
single scrolling experience.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.310
Where basically, rather than
doing a lot of navigation back

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.960
and forth between content, you
can slowly scroll down and

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.470
really peruse what's
available.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.910
So you go from Session Details
to Speakers, and then to more

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.820
stuff, like Submit Feedback.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.850
ADAM KOCH: And of course, each
of these sections is a dynamic

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.940
in its height.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.130
The description could vary.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.870
The number of speakers
could vary.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.310
And these more links at the
bottom also are dynamic.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.506
There could be many of them or
fewer, depending on what sort

00:17:03.506 --> 00:17:06.260
of session it is.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.290
ROMAN NURIK: So one thing I
wanted to mention on a tablet,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.650
I guess, is the consistent
iconography.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.280
And this is, again, introducing
some consistency

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.380
in the visuals that you use in
your app is just as important

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.359
as following the visual design
guidelines on Android, right?

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.109
So you want to make sure that
your app is internally

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:21.839
consistent.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.940
One of the other ways in which
we do that, outside of using

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.460
the diagonal line visual element
and the circles, is

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.840
this unification of presentation
of sessions that

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.070
are in your schedule.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.930
So first, you'll notice that
there are these little

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.440
ribbons, or bookmarks,
that have a little

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.840
check mark in them.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.160
And these are sessions that
are in my schedule.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.520
And the same is mirrored here,
on the right, in that Add to

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.750
Schedule button.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.900
If I look at a session that's
not added, you'll see the

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.560
inverse state of that.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.360
And pressing that immediately
shows the

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.230
little check mark there.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.910
So these subtle things help
create a unified visual

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.760
language across your app.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.850
So let's see.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.740
We talked about that.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:05.980
Oh.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.050
One other thing was, on Session
Details, you'll notice

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.300
that on tablets we use a larger
font, as well as Roboto

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.580
Light for the text here.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.090
And that's party because it's
generally a little easier.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.860
First of all, it helps mitigate
long line lengths,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.360
long line-measure disasters.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.530
But in this case, it really
helps make the content feel

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.040
more balanced, since there's
a lot of space here.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.090
And if this were any smaller if
this were Roboto regular,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.760
it may feel a little
too dense.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.620
So using that really
helped on tablets.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.610
ADAM KOCH: The line heights
are taller as well, right?

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.860
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.270
The line heights are ever
so slightly taller.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.550
And we use the Resources
Framework

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.980
slash Styles for this.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.630
Let's see.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.230
So, let's quickly look at Submit
Feedback on the phone.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.360
So Submit Feedback is, let's
say you've seen a session.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.570
And I can do that in
template as well.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.260
But let's say you've
seen a session.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.610
And now you want to
provide feedback.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.460
So this is actually a custom
control that we wrote.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.080
It's very simple.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.250
It's based on a seek bar.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.810
There are some crazy nine
patches in there.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.290
But it's really just
a fancy seek bar.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.470
The idea is that you
have this slider.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.480
It's a sliding scale
for ratings.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.730
And we use the standard
accent color.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.510
We call it I/O Blue.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.170
We use the standard accent color
rather than Holo Blue,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.190
in this case, because we wanted
to introduce a little

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.790
bit more color consistency
throughout.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.420
And then at the bottom, you'll
notice that we actually use

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.550
that same blue for the
radio buttons, as

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.630
well as the text fields.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.670
So the little underline
in the text field is

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.260
also the same color.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.540
And the way we did that is, we
actually used Android Holo

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.400
Colors from Jerome Van Der
Linden, I believe.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.630
And Android Holo Colors
basically lets you throw in

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.360
your accent color in order to
generate the assets for you so

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.380
your designers don't have to
sit and like draw out.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.870
So I think that was it
for session feedback.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.860
Let's jump into the map.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.310
And I think we're at about
20 minutes now.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.660
So we should probably
hurry up.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.590
But let's look at
the map here.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.320
So here's the map.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.050
And it's using the new
Android Maps API v2--

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.630
I forgot the name of that.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.490
But it's using the new
Android Maps API.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.450
And you'll notice some of the
interesting things here.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.170
First, each of these map
markers is customized.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:26.420
So it's using that standard
blue-purple-red gradient

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.290
inside there.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.020
Next is, when you open up, let's
say the Sandbox area,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.160
you'll notice that
we use that same

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.940
styling for showing icons.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.040
This is the same styling on a
tablet, where you'd see the

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.594
title at the top left, some sort
of subtitle below, and

00:20:45.594 --> 00:20:46.690
then the icon on
the top right.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.110
And we use, actually, a subtle
gradient as well, to hint that

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.000
this is part of the
visual language.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.250
There's no real meaning to it.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.390
Let's see.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.110
What else for this?

00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.190
Oh.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.530
So we actually used Bold
Condensed here for the text.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.910
So for very long--

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.620
that's a really long one.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.130
Yeah.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.900
So developed for good,
for example.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:13.060
For very long titles, Roboto
Condensed helps compress that

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.310
horizontally.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.840
So let's quickly look
at the pop-up.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.850
So let's say I actually
decide to look at

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.730
what's in this room.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.420
So if I touch here, on a tablet,
you see a separate

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.100
pane pop up.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.350
And it's kind of a
floating pane.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.000
Whereas on a phone,
you actually

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.600
get a separate activity.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.830
Now, if on a tablet, I decide
to jump into one of these, I

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.410
can touch in, and it will
load it right here.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:45.670
And again, you see all that
those same consistent buttons,

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.600
like the Add to Schedule
Button, and so on.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.800
But you also get this bread
crumb at the top.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.430
So if I really quickly want to
jump back to Room 8, I can

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.280
either press back, or I
can just press this.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.120
And then I could obviously
dismiss this as well.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.540
You notice that showing that
pop-up actually automatically

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.670
pans the map, so that whatever
was currently in the center

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.195
remains at the visible center.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:09.730
OK.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.690
So I think that was the map.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.570
Is there anything
else we should--

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.930
talk about the live stream?

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.610
ADAM KOCH: We can very
quickly cover it.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.210
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.830
I think we knew this was
going to go long.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.080
So it's fine.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.600
ADAM KOCH: So this is the live
stream activity so you can

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.290
watch the sessions
that are being

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.920
streamed live on YouTube.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.310
We just plugged in some of
our own values here.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.310
So we've got ADIA inside ADIA.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.060
But we can't actually show
this on the phone.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.160
But on the tablet here, on the
left side, you'll see one pane

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.840
broken out.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.890
And on the right side, there's
a split between tabs for the

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.880
social stream from Google+,
and then captions.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.560
So some of the live streams
actually had

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.650
live captions as well.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.970
On a phone device, it'll just
be collapsed into the three

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.640
tabs that fall below
the video.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.860
And then I guess you can go
full screen as well here.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.000
So this is the YouTube
API for Android.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.870
So it sort of comes with all
the standard bells and

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.130
whistles that you could expect
from the YouTube player.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.720
And we'll actually cover a
little bit more on the full

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.070
screen modes shortly after
this I/O app recap.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.200
That's pretty much it, right?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.250
ROMAN NURIK: Well, we can
show the full screen

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.102
really quick, right?

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:21.574
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:23:21.574 --> 00:23:22.046
Let's see if it works.

00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:22.328
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:23:22.328 --> 00:23:23.303
That should work.

00:23:23.303 --> 00:23:24.130
ADAM KOCH: OK.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.300
ROMAN NURIK: And then you
can toggle the controls.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.670
We'll actually talk about
this in a moment

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.720
with toggling controls.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.450
You notice that almost
everything, the status bar,

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.610
the navigation bar, and the
action bar, all fade away,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.130
leaving just the content.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.290
And we'll talk about that,
actually, in the deep dive for

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.500
full-screen UIs.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.920
All right.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.640
So really quickly, just to
recap, there's a lot of cool

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.730
things in this app.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.160
It will be open source
very soon.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.430
Well, hopefully very,
very soon.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.960
We're just waiting on a couple
things to be sorted out before

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.500
we can do that.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.320
And yeah.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.320
It's been a pleasure
working on it.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.550
There's some things that
we probably do

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.370
differently, right?

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.040
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.680
Actually, at I/O, there was
an app clinic live.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.530
And one of the comments that
Rito gave us is about the

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.570
refresh button.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.490
ROMAN NURIK: Right.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.450
So we have this manual Refresh
button at the top.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.530
And when we actually sinking
content will show a spinner

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.140
and place but one of the
comments that Ian and Rito

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.310
gave us was that, why
do you need Refresh?

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.140
This should automatically
sink in the background.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.360
Refresh should not be
a primary action.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.020
It should be secondary if
anything, if at all.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.260
we do actually have Google Cloud
Messaging enabled here.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.740
So we do refresh on push
from the server.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.690
So we could probably very simply
remove the Refresh

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.390
button, or move it into
the overflow.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.600
So definitely, especially if
you have a sink adapter, if

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.610
you have Google Cloud Messaging
turned on, you don't

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.900
necessarily need Refresh.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.170
So we may remove that
for next year.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:46.230
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.000
I think maybe one other purpose
of the refresh button

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.700
was to refresh the
Google+ stream.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.790
So we had some limitations there
in terms of how we would

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.220
fetch new content and actually
display in line there.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.530
But hopefully in a future
version, we can get rid of

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.450
that Refresh button and

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.850
intelligently refresh as needed.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.140
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.960
So that was a whopping
demo of the I/O app.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.150
We probably have like
three seconds for

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.090
the rest our content.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.390
But there's a lot of
good content left.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.180
Let's see.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.093
So let's jump back
into the slides.

00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:17.510
There they are.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.380
So that was the I/O app.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.190
Again, if you install it now and
just play around with it,

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.860
here's the QR code.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.210
But let's jump into sharing.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.400
ADAM KOCH: All right so go
through this very quickly this

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.070
shallow dive and sharing content
so I sort of talk

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.790
about a few things.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.400
You're sharing's something
that's very system-wide.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.210
And so I think convention is
very important when it comes

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.950
something like sharing.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.490
So hopefully, whenever you to
use a share action, you always

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.490
use the native Android
Share icon.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.960
That's actually, surprisingly,
something we see done

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.320
incorrectly many times.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.910
So definitely do that.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.520
Also, avoid hard coding to
specific apps or services.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.200
So there may be a specific
use case where it's

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.220
useful to do that.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.450
But for the vast majority of
cases, you should really be

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.660
calling out to the system share
intent-- which, I'll

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.790
show you some examples of
that in just a second--

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.790
rather the hard coding to fire
up a specific app or a

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.640
specific service that
receives sharing.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.700
I think Android users have just
become really, really

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.350
used to being able to use
whichever application or

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.960
service they want to use.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.970
And so when they don't
get that, they're

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.685
just going to be unhappy.

00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:27.000
And that's going to be a
frustrating experience.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.350
ROMAN NURIK: One other thing
I wanted to note is that

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.650
sometimes you want to do a
really rich integration with a

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.790
certain network, like
Twitter or Facebook.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.080
That's OK too.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.760
But if you do decide to do that,
then make sure that you

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.100
have an equally prominent--

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.660
at least, equally prominent,
equally--

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.180
ADAM KOCH: Obvious.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.650
ROMAN NURIK: --visible.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:43.800
Yeah.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.420
ADAM KOCH: Visible.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.910
ROMAN NURIK: --option
to share with other

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.270
things on the platform.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.030
So if you want to do a rich
integration, that's fine.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:54.520
But make sure to also offer this
as a visible alternative.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.410
ADAM KOCH: And then lastly,
Share goes very, very well as

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.150
an action bar action, or as an
action provider, which is

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.590
something I'll talk about in
just a second as well.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.420
Or alternatively, if it's not
a primary action for your

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.040
particular activity, you can
go into the overflow.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.250
It's also fine to
put it in line.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.860
That's a valid option as well.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.110
I think a lot of the time, it
does suit the Action Bar very

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.950
well, though.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.710
If it's primary, it goes
straight there

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:23.840
in the visible action.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.730
If not, it can fall
into the overflow.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:31.340
So let me very quickly talk
through the two main ways that

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.970
the Sharing action goes
into the Action Bar.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.250
So first of all, there's the
Share Action Provider.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.340
So it's kind of hard
to see here.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.060
Let's zoom in a little bit.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.920
This is how it looks.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.410
It's going to be kind of hard
to see on the video.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.960
But you'll see there's
a very thin outline

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.220
with the Share icon.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.040
A little arrow in the
bottom right corner.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.110
And then right next to that is
your most recently used, or

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.540
most frequently used application
that you've used

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.360
to share in this particular
application before.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.810
So tapping on that Share icon
could actually brings down

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.330
this menu, which shows three
additional share options.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.140
This is ordered by
frequency of use.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.350
And then if you tap See All,
it'll sort of expand out to

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.990
show you the rest.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.550
The really nice thing about this
Share Action Provider is,

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.380
it's not going to throw up
this sort big dialogue.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.550
It feels like you're still
within your application.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.270
And it's also bubbles up any
of the applications you're

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.330
using the share and orders
by frequency.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.000
So it does all these things for
you while still letting

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.405
you feel like you're inside
the application.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.060
And then, down the bottom
here, you'll see for

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.936
developers, to implement this,
a quick tip is to use the

00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:47.330
sharecompat.configure
menu item.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.020
It does all these things
for you in a

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.270
backward-compatible manner.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.300
And then the other option is
just to have it as a regular

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:56.880
share action.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.810
So rather than an action
provider, it's just a standard

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.380
Action item that goes in
the action bar there.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.410
So here, you should
just use the

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.680
standard icon like I discussed.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.890
And then call out to some
standard system share intent,

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.400
which is Action Send.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.050
And that will fire up this
system dialogue, which goes on

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.750
top of application here.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.190
And this is what the more recent
version of it looks

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.660
like on, I think,
Jellybean Plus.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.300
The nice thing about this is
that it's being called by the

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.970
system, so you get this
consistent feel across all

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.740
applications that are creating
this dialogue.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.980
It also is optimized for larger
screens, so when it

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.250
shows on, say, a 10-inch
tablet, it's

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.440
going to go into multi--

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.510
well, it's already
multi-column.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.170
It's going to go into, probably,
three columns.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.140
ROMAN NURIK: It's also worth
noting that you can

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.410
add items to this.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.040
So you can pre-pend intent
to show at the top here.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.250
So by default, it'll just show
whatever can respond to the

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.490
send intent.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.230
But you can obviously add
things at the top.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.500
So I think it was Pocket, or
there's some app out there

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.770
that actually introduced a
Copy to Clipboard, where

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.370
basically, you can share
directly to the clipboard to

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.430
get that URL and paste it
wherever else you want.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.690
ADAM KOCH: And the nice about
this dialogue is, it may vary

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.560
with OS version.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.630
Or maybe we'll change it
in a future OS version.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.360
But as long as we call this
intent, you'll get the

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.160
standard system behavior
there.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.270
And then, just down on the
bottom, again, for developers,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.230
implement this intent.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.190
Use sharecompat.intentbuildup.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.240
And then last quick point.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.960
You can go completely custom.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.720
These are all available
programmatically to fetch what

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.020
applications can receive
a share intent.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.590
Generally, it's not recommended
unless you want to

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.500
do something particularly
different.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.460
So there's no slide for that
here, but just something to

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.295
keep in mind.

00:30:41.295 --> 00:30:41.610
All right.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.400
Let's keep on moving.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.180
ROMAN NURIK: Let's keep on
rolling to full screen UIs.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.030
So this is basically you talking
about how you deal

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.220
with system bars, like the
Status bar and the Navigation

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.750
bar, where your content is
supposed to be immersive.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.810
So for example, photos, videos,
or books, or things

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.910
like that as you're reading.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.900
So very quickly, just a
couple of definitions.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.210
You have the status bar, which
contains notifications as well

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.370
as time and date--

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.150
well, not date, but time as well
as battery level, WiFi,

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.500
cell signal, things like that.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.840
That's the Status bar,
just for terminology.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.130
The Navigation bar is the bar
at the bottom that contains

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:20.970
Back, Home, and Recent.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.890
On earlier versions of the
platform, you don't actually

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.900
have a Navigation bar.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.540
Because you have, I
guess, soft keys.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.230
I never know if you should
call them soft

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.510
keys or hard keys.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.840
You have keys that are built
into the device for that.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.540
So the Navigation bar is
something that appears on

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:41.110
newer devices that don't have
any sort of keys on the front.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.642
And just in terms of sizes,
for designers, you should

00:31:43.642 --> 00:31:45.480
obviously care about the
size of these things.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.050
They can vary from
device to device.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.380
There's no single standard.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.390
And this fits in with, don't
design for one pixel

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:51.910
resolution.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.650
But in case you are interested,
roughly, in

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.380
general, the Status bar
is about 25 dips tall.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.130
And the Navigation bar
is about 48 dips.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.940
I think on phones in landscape,
it's actually a lot

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.760
smaller, like 40 dips.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.460
And again, don't rely
on these numbers.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.500
These are numbers that will
probably change in the future.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.950
And they'll probably change
on different devices.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.200
On earlier versions of the
platform, there was this

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.820
combined bar that combined both
the Status bar and the

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.920
Navigation elements.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.760
And this was also generally
48 dips tall.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.400
But this is more deprecated.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.190
So if you see screen shots,
especially, with this, they're

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.360
using the older system
UI style.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.440
So make sure that you
plan for both.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.100
Because if you're supporting,
for example, Android 4.0--

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.820
actually, it was 4.0?

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.040
Yes.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.430
4.0 was using this.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.380
If you're supporting Android 4.0
and higher, be aware that

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.150
your notifications may actually
be on the bottom

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.280
right at some point.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.090
OK.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.340
So there are lots of different
full screen modes.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.100
And this slide is littered
with stuff.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.140
But you basically have
a couple of modes.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.410
You have Normal Mode, where
everything is visible.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.680
You have Low Profile mode, where
the bars are visible.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.340
And actually, you can
selectively mix and match what

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.120
happens to the status bar
and navigation bar.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.750
But the Low Profile mode still
shows the bars, but it recedes

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.730
them visually.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.270
So you'll notice that the status
bar here is dimmed.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.050
You actually don't even see
the notification icon.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.270
You see just a little dot
indicating that there's

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.560
something there.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.170
And then your Back, Home,
and Recents are

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.710
also visually recessed.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.830
So they're also just little
dots, hinting to the user

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.290
that, hey, there's
something here.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.690
It's not completely
non-interactive, but touch

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.200
here to find out.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.060
And then a couple of points.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.810
Generally, when you use this
kind of UI, something that

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.160
works really well is overlaying
the Action bar.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.560
So here, this is actually
the Action Bar with a

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.320
semi-transparency applied.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.190
Another important point is, when
you touch on the content,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.430
you should always toggle.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.630
Right?

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:57.600
So you should never permanently
be in Low Profile

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.910
Mode or this other mode,
which we'll talk about.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.320
So touching should actually
be the action

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.570
that toggles things.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.070
And actually, in this Low
Profile Mode, you obviously

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.710
also want to hide other
UI elements as well

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.030
as the action bar.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.820
That's actually one
thing I should

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.790
mention right after this.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.449
So there's another mode called
Hide Navigation.

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.949
And Hide Navigation hides the
Navigation Bar at the bottom.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:26.360
And it usually also hides the
top bar, the Status Bar.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.020
So in this case, you have
full control over the

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.150
pixels on the screen.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.590
So basically, your
app is drawing

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.520
everything to the screen.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.159
And this works really well
for video content.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:39.590
And one caveat here is that
this isn't permanent.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.127
As soon as the user touches the
screen, the system will

00:34:43.127 --> 00:34:44.870
automatically show the
navigation again.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.500
Because you don't want to lock
the user into a place where

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.489
they have no access to Back,
Home, and Recents.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.130
That's just really,
really bad.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.400
So there's one thing I
wanted to mention.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.230
Oh, right.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.250
The last thing I wanted to
mention about these different

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:02.000
modes is, you generally want
to only switch between two,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.520
Normal and Low Profile.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.430
Or Normal and Hide Navigation.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.380
And you don't want to have
different UI elements on the

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.730
screen going on and off
at different times.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.570
You actually want to make sure
that you either have the

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.462
Status Bar, the Navigation Bar,
the Action Bar, and all

00:35:16.462 --> 00:35:19.720
of the other UI controls all
visible, like here, or none of

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.790
them visible.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.270
So basically, this boils down
to, make sure that the Action

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.930
Bar visibility is tied to the
visibility of the other

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:27.980
elements of the screen.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.680
ADAM KOCH: The way I like to
think about this, too, is that

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.190
Low Profile is for an immersive
activity where there

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:33.990
may still be some user
interaction.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.250
Like maybe you're swiping
through photos.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.350
Maybe you're reading a book
or something like that.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.800
Whereas the Hide Navigation is
more useful for something

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.150
where you're not interacting
with it.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.930
Like watching video.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.980
You're sitting back and
looking at the screen.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.840
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.980
Exactly.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.400
OK.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.170
So those are the different
modes.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.450
Just a couple of examples on
apps that do this, in our

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.470
opinion, really well.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.920
First is Google Play Books.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:01.400
So by default, you see your
actual book itself, as well as

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.850
some controls at the bottom, and
the action bar at the top.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.950
But as soon as you touch--

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:07.890
well, actually, not here.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.190
As soon as you touch the screen,
the Action Bar, the

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.700
Status Bar, and the UI control
at the bottom, the Scrubber,

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.870
they all fade out.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.520
And then the Navigation Bar goes
into Low Profile Mode.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.430
So what you end up seeing
is nothing but content.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.310
Nothing but the body
of the book itself.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.450
And then there are some actions
here for Back, Home,

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.420
and Recents, obviously.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.150
Those should be visible.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.660
Another nice thing that this
does is that the content

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.760
doesn't jump.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.520
So if I touch to toggle, the
content doesn't realign itself

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.150
or re-lay itself out.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.660
And this is possible
on Jellybean.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.090
So in Jellybean, we introduced
some new APIs to make sure

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.350
that this is possible.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.940
On earlier versions, it's much
harder to do that if you're

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.440
showing and hiding certain
things, like the Navigation

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.090
Bar especially.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.310
Another app that does this
really well is Pocket.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.230
So they're also a reading app.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.920
But one thing that they've do
slightly differently is, they

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.330
also toggle on touch.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:12.870
But they also hide the system
UI as you start scrolling.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.740
So as you start scrolling
down, it goes

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.060
into Low Profile Mode.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.890
It still shows the status
bar, which is good.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.940
Because if you have an email
come in, you want to be aware

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.300
that something is happening.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.260
And also, it shows Low Profile
Mode for the Navigation Bar.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.050
So it's really, really subtle.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:32.960
But it's very nice to let the
user really focus on the

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.510
content itself.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.820
And lastly we have YouTube.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.490
So YouTube is the canonical
example of a great

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.290
video-playing application.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.060
And obviously, what YouTube
is, they hide everything

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.610
possible when you go into
this full screen mode.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:54.900
So this is, again, possible with
the new Jellybean APIs.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.370
And, oh, one thing to note is
that, in the new Jellybean

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:02.260
API, one of the caveats, or
consequences is that the

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.830
Navigation Bar can actually
overlay your content.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.190
So you notice here that the
Navigation Bar is actually

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.700
cutting off the content.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.610
So if you have something
really important at the

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.640
bottom, or I guess in this
case at the right of your

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.630
screen, you've got to make
sure that you're not

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.940
necessarily using that flag.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.412
You probably just want
to use Low Profile.

00:38:18.412 --> 00:38:18.760
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.490
And the I/O app uses the YouTube
player API, so it gets

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.630
a lot of these things
for free.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.620
It handles all of the
full screen modes.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.080
For you.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.800
And then one quick
developer tip--

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.740
are we really far over?

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.490
ROMAN NURIK: Nah, it's fine.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:34.010
ADAM KOCH: If you go to Eclipse,
and I think IntelliJ

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.275
or Android shortly, you can
create a full-screen activity.

00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:38.220
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.340
ADAM KOCH: Which kind of
implements a pretty large

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.330
chunk of this behavior for
you, at least for photo

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.910
viewing, or full screen
viewing activity here.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:47.840
ROMAN NURIK: I was actually
playing with it yesterday.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.930
I think there's a bug in it.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:49.990
I'll have to fix it.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.910
ADAM KOCH: Don't use
it yet, then.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.700
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.400
It's a great starting point.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.090
It'll get you most of the way
there for almost all platform

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.790
versions, I think.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.050
Yeah.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:01.330
All right.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.750
So we're going to fly
through design news.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.910
So I think we're about
40 minutes.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.810
This is obviously a
very long episode.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.000
Let's just quickly fly through
some design news.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.750
First, I don't know how to
pronounce their names.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.550
I love these guys.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.260
I think it's ah-pall-ooh?

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.230
ADAM KOCH: We think
it's Apollo.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.570
Right?

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.340
Mikey can tell us later.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.080
ROMAN NURIK: Oh-pa-loo,
or Apollo.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.070
Mike on the Apollo team actually
created wrote up this

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.020
blog post called "The Holo
Grail?" Question mark.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.010
"Android Design Guidelines--

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:33.290
A Realistic Approach." And it's
a really good perspective

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.730
on how do you treat
the guidelines.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.910
Do you treat them as rules?

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:40.370
Do you treat them as
visual guidelines?

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.960
How can you deviate from them,
and in which cases should you?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.810
It's not full-on in-depth.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:46.570
It's not comprehensive.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.430
But it's a nice perspective
on it.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.820
Basically, one of the anecdotes
that he had was

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.060
that, in one of their apps,
Timer, they introduced a dark

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.750
theme that used an orange
accent color.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.650
And a bunch of users were like,
oh, this isn't Holo.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.130
This isn't Holo.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.320
Because it was orange
and not blue.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.580
And that's absolutely
not true.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.670
You can still be in line with
the guidelines if you use your

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.220
brand's accent colors.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.090
So definitely don't feel like
the guidelines are the end-all

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.410
be-all of design.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:21.610
Next, Taylor Ling, who's been
on here a million times, has

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:25.060
created a UI design, UI
wire-framing kit for Google

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.240
slides, for, I guess,
for Google Docs.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.730
And he also updated his
Photoshop version.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.410
So if you're interested in wire
framing, high-fidelity

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.986
prototyping--

00:40:35.986 --> 00:40:37.090
not really prototyping.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.190
High fidelity wire frame
stuff, check

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.440
this out, for sure.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.510
ADAM KOCH: Taylor Ling again.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.760
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.100
So Taylor issued--

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.950
I guess, very similar to the
Android Design in Action Live

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.090
lab that we were in at I/O,
Taylor issued a redesign

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.040
challenge on his blog.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.340
If you're interested in
participating, I think he's

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.050
giving away Google Play
gift cards as prizes.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:01.990
So definitely feel free
to check it out.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.295
And I think this
is not the one.

00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:03.620
No.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.880
There's one more.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.080
You want to talk about Gmail?

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.270
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.300
So a Gmail update went live in
Play I think yesterday, or

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.640
maybe the day before.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.930
There's a few new design
patterns in there worth

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.210
checking out.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.290
First of all, there's the
navigation drawer.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.070
The official navigation drawer
pattern there is implemented

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.990
in the new Gmail app.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.550
So we didn't have the official
screenshots of

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.300
the drawer out here.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.800
But you can see there, it's got
the drawer affordance in

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.570
the top left.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.790
And of course, that brings
out the drawer.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.340
Edge swipe brings
out the drawer.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.710
ROMAN NURIK: This replaced the
Action Bar spinner that was

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.840
there before.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.540
ADAM KOCH: And then there's
the refresh UI.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:37.910
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:44.400
So the new Gmail app also has a
new take on a swipe down to

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.730
refresh type of UI that's been
very popular in other apps.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.160
It's not done using an elastic
band type thing.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.380
It's done using this other
type of visuals.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.380
We don't have it here, but it's
pretty interesting if you

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.480
want to check it out,
by all means.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.170
One thing I will say is that
this is not an official

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.300
guideline or anything.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.000
This is just one exploration
of how refresh can be done.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.200
Until something gets published--
and we're not sure

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.300
if this will be published in
the guidelines-- but until

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.300
something gets published, I
wouldn't rush to implement

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.463
this in your own apps, unless
you just really want to for

00:42:16.463 --> 00:42:16.750
some reason.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:17.520
But yeah.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.430
Refresh.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.790
Our current best practices for
Refresh are either automatic

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.530
Refresh, not even giving the
user the option or the need to

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.380
refresh, or something
in the action

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.450
overflow, or action bar.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.110
ADAM KOCH: It is a very
nice Holo take on

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.270
this swipe to refresh.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.486
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:42:32.486 --> 00:42:32.950
I'ts cool.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.120
ADAM KOCH: It's very cool.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.900
ROMAN NURIK: And I
think this is--

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.320
no, that was the last one.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.890
So the last is this new website
called screensize.es.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.290
Screen sizes.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.300
It's this really nice, really
quick reference to common

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.020
devices, as well as their screen
sizes and densities.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.990
So if you're really quickly
trying to do some

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:55.220
back-of-the-napkin calculation
on dips or something like

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.480
that, you can hop over to this
website that has a list of

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.790
common devices.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.690
Also, its mobile friendly, so
if you pop it open on your

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.440
Android device, it'll
look great.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.090
And I think that's it, right?

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.410
ADAM KOCH: Yeah.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.170
What a doozy.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.230
So I think we promised a
doozy, and I think we

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.720
delivered a very long show.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.650
Sorry for going way, way over,
but it's been a pleasure.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.240
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.820
ADAM KOCH: See you
later, guys.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:19.920
Adam Koch here.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.820
ROMAN NURIK: See
you next week.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.120
ADAM KOCH: Bye.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.370
ROMAN NURIK: Peace out.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.067
