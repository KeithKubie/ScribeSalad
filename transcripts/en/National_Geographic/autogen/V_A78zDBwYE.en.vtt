00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.930
- [Narrator] The invention
of the electric light bulb,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.040
150 years ago,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.520
was one of the most transformative
milestones in history.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.220
This new form of light, artificial light,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.150
brightened and made
safe once-dark streets,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.000
prolonged waking hours into the evening,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.170
and brought electricity into
homes for the very first time.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.313
Today, this glow has grown, but at a cost.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.550
Light pollution is the over-illumination

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.370
of cities and night skies
by artificial lighting.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.860
It's caused by the abundance

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.430
of light sources emitting light outside

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.640
of an intended direction.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.950
Several types of light pollution
exist, including glare,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.490
which is a disruptive light
that shines horizontally,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.910
light trespass, the unwanted shining

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.280
of light onto nearby areas,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.250
and sky glow, a halo over
inhabited areas caused

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.373
by the scattering of light particles.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.850
No matter what form light pollution takes,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.730
each can have unintended,
yet harmful impacts.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.620
Wildlife, particularly sea turtles,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.470
have had their nocturnal
patterns disrupted.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.950
The turtle hatchling's
instinct to follow the light

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.420
of the moon in order to reach the sea

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.450
is intercepted by the
light of inland cities.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.123
Because of this, many never
find their way to the ocean.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.420
Human's well being is also
compromised by light pollution.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.320
The excess light can
overwhelm photoreceptor cells

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.240
in the retina, damaging ones eyesight.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.030
Plus, it disrupts natural sleep cycles,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.050
and causes sleep deprivation,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.230
leading to a number of health problems,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.090
possibly including cancer.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450
Light pollution also
results in the production

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.780
of additional carbon emissions.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.850
Each year, potentially billions

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.910
of dollars worth of coal or oil,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.160
which are burned to produce electricity,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.583
are wasted on unnecessary light.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.000
Over the past several
decades, light pollution

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.900
in North America has increased

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.270
an estimated 6 to 10% each year.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.060
A rise fueled by growing populations,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.900
greater access to electricity,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.300
and increased urban development.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.710
Efforts have been made
to help counter this rise

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.130
in excess light, including the development

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.750
of alternative
energy-efficient light bulbs

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.690
and smarter directional lighting designs.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.970
These and other innovations will continue

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.310
to refine this 150-year-old technology,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.222
artificial light, and optimize
it, for a brighter future.

00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:41.389
