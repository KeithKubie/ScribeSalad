DANIEL GRACHANIN:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:09.300
My name is Daniel Grachanin.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.842
I'm the Cloud Gaming
Product Manager.

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:13.091
And today I want to talk to
you about something really

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:15.087
important to us at Cloud
for Game Developers,

00:00:15.087 --> 00:00:17.420
telling your virtual story
and giving you the technology

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.379
to do that and scaling
and making your world

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.170
on a virtual cloud.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.260
So a lot of it requires kind
of building outside the box.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.250
And I want to first
kind of go back

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.840
through the history of how
we went from all the way

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.180
back to cave paintings to
current generation technology

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.042
and next-generation technology,
which will actually allow us

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:34.500
to make immersive
technologies have

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
these massive, scaleable worlds.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.985
So, from its inception,
cave paintings

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:41.610
were actually used
as a way to tell you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.770
the limit of your world.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.570
They were made to say, there
are predators, so don't go here,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.090
or the "here be dragons"
type of situation.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.130
Moving on, we moved on
to actually written text

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.600
that was put onto boxes
or, actually, tablets.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.750
So that would be your
box in that situation.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.560
There was no audio.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.393
There was no visual.

00:00:56.393 --> 00:00:58.360
It was just completely
written text.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.600
We moved on to things like
the Gutenberg Bible, which

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.891
was made by the printing press.

00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:04.319
And then you actually had
distributed, scalable books

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.892
or stories.

00:01:05.892 --> 00:01:08.100
This moves on to the TV,
which is great except for it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.180
lacked audio.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.800
So we added visual
with it and audio.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.090
We brought it together.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.747
And we developed our
first video game,

00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:15.330
which was called
"Noughts and Crosses"

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.350
back in the early '40s.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.480
Moving on, there was
the second-- technically

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.700
the first-- video game,
which was called "Space War."

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.930
The problem with
"Space War" is it was

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.180
associated with this hardware.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.480
So this game was completely
tied to its hardware.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.175
It didn't scale.

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:31.800
If you didn't have this box and
the visual and the game itself,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.972
there was no way to just
have more of these games.

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:35.430
That's where the
console generation

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.890
began with a mix of lots
of different consoles.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.152
But Atari is the most popular
one that's recognized.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:41.610
What Atari did is
allow you to have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.484
a console and different
stories, if you will,

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:44.401
with these cartridges.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.775
You could use the
cartridge, have

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.310
it play "Asteroids"
in this case,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.436
play "Dig Dug" or
something else like that.

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:53.060
So I want to talk about this and
kind of go into the technology

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.425
that was from the past and
how we've moved into where

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:57.044
we're going to the future.

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:58.710
Essentially what this
did is, as I said,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.880
the console-cartridge
relationship

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.200
made everything
kind of localized

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.220
but it at least
gave you the chance

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.415
to have different experiences
in different games.

00:02:04.415 --> 00:02:06.540
A save feature, which was
actually implemented back

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.990
in '87 with "The
Legend of Zelda,"

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.380
allows you to actually
have a continued story.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.880
That way you can actually take
a picture of it, if you will.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.220
But that was only associated
with the character.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.594
And that was only limited by
as large as a game could be,

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.266
which, back then,
was very small.

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.265
There was no generation.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.000
It had limited instructions.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.850
And it was, again, limited to
your on-premise local machine.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.080
Not to mention that
matchmaking probably

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.370
consisted of you having your
friend use your Mad Catz

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.230
controller and plug it
in for said Player 2.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.030
So the current generation
of technology--

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.970
how we're doing matchmaking and
server technology and scaling

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:36.636
worlds--

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:38.010
is the client-server
model, which

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.107
Mark was kind of going
over just a second ago.

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:42.190
The problem with this is
it had stateful services.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.689
These services are associated
with whatever the character is

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.130
doing or your client is
with the server, which

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.810
means they're bounded together.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.162
What this does is it makes a
kind of a theme park reset.

00:02:51.162 --> 00:02:52.620
So if you play
"World of Warcraft,"

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.285
you go into an
instance and it'll

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:55.785
be this great,
immersive experience.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:57.660
But when you come back
out, you go back in

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.830
and it's a theme park reset.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.996
There's no actual world
being distributed and scaled

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.800
and persistent.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.860
So a lot of this was also
leveraged by currently

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.834
on-premise data centers.

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:08.500
So this is where we
kind of go into what

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.420
I want to talk
about today, which

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.130
is the next-generation
technology

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.340
of the entity-component
model, which was made famous

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.482
in early '70s.

00:03:15.482 --> 00:03:17.940
The thing with this model is
we didn't have cloud computing

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.299
technology to scale all this.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.090
So recently we're
partnering with a company

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.080
called Improbable.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.360
And they have this technology
called Spatial OS, which

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.510
allows you to make distributed
operating systems in the cloud.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.060
What it does is, the whole
entire concept of client

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.372
physics and logic, It separates
out into many workers.

00:03:33.372 --> 00:03:34.830
These workers can
then individually

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.780
scale and make massively
scalable worlds

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.040
that are actually persistent.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.210
Which is to say,
the world is living

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.800
when you're not playing
it, and you can still

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.240
live when you come
into the game.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.570
It makes stateless
services, allows

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.980
for actual procedural
generation.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.730
You can actually have
worlds that actually

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.050
keep scaling and scaling--

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.591
technically limitless,
as long as you

00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:51.720
can afford the cloud bill.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.794
And also it gives you the
ability to leverage the cloud.

00:03:54.794 --> 00:03:57.210
The game called "Worlds Adrift"
built on their technology.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.160
What this allows you to
do is have actual worlds

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.090
whenever you're going
to interact with it,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.850
since you've separated all these
dynamics of client and logic

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.840
and physics.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.532
If this ship crashes
into that actual planet

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:08.740
or that structure, it will
be destroyed in the world.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.050
It won't reset.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.865
It'll actually have a story to
itself, the whole entire world.

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:14.740
Why this is interesting
to us is it allows us

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.140
take snapshots of these states.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.699
It allows us to do logging
and real-time telemetry on it.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.490
And it lets us make
machine-learning models

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.300
out of that.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.758
So when you're watching a game
like the "League of Legends"

00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:26.490
Tournament last year
for 2016 or 2017,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.310
it allows you to go back and see
how you would have done in that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.830
situation by
associating AI models--

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.120
machine-learning models--

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.786
because you have these
persistent worlds

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.894
that are constantly generated.

00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:38.310
Another thing we're
doing, too, is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.795
looking at leveraging chipsets,
so physics and your logic

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:44.430
and client using
graphics-processing units, CPU,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.655
and your TPUs, which
will be coming out soon.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:48.030
What is interesting
about that is

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.460
it allows you to actually
have games at scale

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.920
and then, depending on
the hardware you're using,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.461
it won't matter,
because you can have

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:54.900
games that can scale forever.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.940
And it won't matter about
the technology you're using.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.200
So we'll actually be
talking more about what

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.470
Mark Mandel talked about--

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.322
game server scaling,
big data analytics.

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:07.030
And as far as the
improbable relationship

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.710
we have for that
Spatial technology,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.560
if you're interested,
please approach us, myself

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.490
or Mark Mandel.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.690
And I will be
followed by Wouter.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.290
Thank you.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.740
