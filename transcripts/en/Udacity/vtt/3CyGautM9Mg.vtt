00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.380
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I started at Georgia Tech and ended up getting my PhD there in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.310
computer science. Did work in software architecture, software engineering.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.740
User interface design and kind of the intersection of those, those three.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.130
After I got my PhD I was a faculty member at Michigan State University for

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.050
about 12 years. Did research in, in formal modeling of software architecture.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.770
For the past I guess about six years, I've been working at a local company

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.915
called Logic Blocks. That specializes in smart databases, and uses a lot

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:50.845
of the modeling ideas and formal methods ideas that I've been working on in,

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.100
in my research, in, in practice. So it's been very interesting.
