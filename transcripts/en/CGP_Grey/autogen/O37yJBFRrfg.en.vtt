00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.290
 Where is the European Union? Undoubtedly somewhere, but just like in the continent 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.630
 the European itself, which has an ambiguous boundary, the European Union also has ambiguous edges 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.130
 for her. 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 To begin with, the official members of the European Union are in the descending order of the population: 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.589
 * Germany * France 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:14.690
 * United Kingdom * Italy 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 * Spain * Poland 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.059
 * Romania * Kingdom of the Netherlands 

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:17.840
 * Greece * Belgium 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.980
 * Portugal * Czech Republic 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.720
 * Hungary * Sweden 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.619
 * Austria * Bulgaria 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.509
 * Denmark * Slovakia 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:22.270
 * Finland * Ireland 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.099
 * Croatia * Lithuania 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.849
 * Latvia * Slovenia 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:24.539
 * Estonia * Cyprus 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.970
 * Luxembourg * Malta 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.880
 The edges of the EU will probably continue to expand further than there are other states 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.590
 at different stages trying to become a member. 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.410
 Just as the works of the European Union are very complicated, 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 but for this video you only need to know three things: 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.300
 1. States pay membership and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.490
 2. Vote for the laws they all have to follow and 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.920
 3. Citizens of member states are automatically citizens of the European Union as well 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.720
 The latter means that if you are a citizen of any of these places you are free to live 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.829
 and work retired into any state by others .. What's good especially if you think of your place 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.130
 is too big or too small or very hot or too cold. The European Union gives you the options. 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.620
 By the way, did you notice how all three of these statements have attached the stars 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.240
 this unhelpful explanation? Well, get used to this: Europe loves the stars to add exceptions 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.020
 for complex deals. 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.630
 These three, for example, lead us to the first part of border crossing with Norway, 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.579
 Iceland, and Liechtenstein. None of which are in the European Union, but if you are 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.950
 an EU citizen that you can live in these states and the Norwegians, Icelanders, or Liechtensteiners 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 can live on yours. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.710
 Why? In exchange for the freedom of movement of people that they have to pay membership fees 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.310
 in the European Union - although they are not a part of it and so will not take a role 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.479
 in her laws they have to follow. 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.350
 This agreement is the European Economic Area and it looks like a terrible deal, yes 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.170
 the imo was for that star which gives the EEE but no EU members a transition to some areas 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.659
 law, especially agriculture and fishing - something a state like Iceland can take care of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.520
 much to do their way. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.259
 Between the European Union and the European Economic Area, the continent appears to be largely covered, 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.529
 with the exception of Switzerland, which remains neutral and fiercely independent, 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:57.689
 except for its participation in the Schengen Area. 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.249
 If you are from a country that keeps its borders very clean and / or well-patrolled, 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.920
 The Schengen area is a bit unbelievable because it is an agreement between states to take 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.849
 a 'meh' border approach. 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.940
 At the international borders the Schengen area looks like this: no border officers or passport controls 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 of any kind. You can walk from Lisbon to Tallinn without identification or without 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.440
 answering the question: "business or pleasure?". 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.490
 Because Switzerland was part of the Schengen, but it is not part of the European Union means that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.710
 non-Swiss people can enter at any time they want, but they can never stay. 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.620
 This border approach has not been appreciated by all in the EU: mostly, the Kingdom 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.720
 the United Kingdom and Ireland who argue that the islands are different. So go on these islands 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.420
 honest, you will need a passport and a good reason. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.940
 The reluctance of the UK to get fully involved with the EU brings us to another theme: money. 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.040
 The European Union has its own sophisticated currency, the Euro used by most, but not all 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.210
 members of the European Union. This economic union is called the Eurozone and unite 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.410
 in one country must first achieve certain financial goals - and lying about achieving these goals 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.540
 certainly is not something that someone will do. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.650
 Most non-eurozone members, when they meet their goals, will leave their local currency 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.890
 in favor of the Euro, but three of them Denmark, Sweden and, of course, the United Kingdom, 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.820
 have drawn stars into the Euro section of the treaty giving them a permanent exclusion. 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.160
 And strange, four small European countries Andorra, San Marino, Monaco and the Vatican 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.270
 have a star giving them the opposite: the right to print and use the Euro as much as their money, 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.530
 even though they are not in the European Union. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.210
 So this is the whole prospect: there is the EU, which makes all the rules, the eurozone inside 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.440
 that with a common currency, of the European Economic Zone outside of it, where people can move freely 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.560
 and selective Schengen, for countries that think borders are worthless. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.790
 As you can see, there are some strange overlaps with these boundaries, but we're not ending talking 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.490
 about complications for a long time, because the emperor. 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.910
 So Portugal and Spain have their islands from a colonial day that they have never shared with: 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.200
 these are Madeira and the Canary Islands are on the shores of Africa and the Azores as well 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.180
 in the Atlantic. Because these islands are Spanish and Portuguese they are part of 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.760
 The European Union too. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.530
 Adding a few islands to the EU borders is not a big thing until you consider France: 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.110
 the queen of the non-let go. It still holds on a bunch of islands in the Caribbean, Reunion 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.760
 off the coast of Madagascar and French Guiana in South America. As far as France is concerned, 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.530
 these are too France, which in itself expands the edge-to-edge distance of the Union 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.400
 Europe across a third of the Earth's Earth. 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.430
 Collectively, these pieces of France, Spain and Portugal are called the Foreign Regions 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 and they are the result of the simple answer of the empire: just keep it. 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.010
 On the other hand, it is the United Kingdom, the master of maintaining complex relationships 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.490
 with its quasi-ex-lands - and it's not alone in this on such a continent 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.120
 empire-happy. 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.570
 The Netherlands and Denmark and France (again) all have what the European Union calls Territories 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.240
 Outside: they are not part of the European Union, instead they are an endless hole 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.310
 the stars because of their complicated relations with both the European Union 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.720
 and their related places which makes it difficult to say a meaningful thing about them as a group 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.490
 but... 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 in general the law of the European Union does not apply in these countries, although in general people 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.100
 who live there are citizens of the European Union because in general they have citizenship 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.190
 of their respective country, so in general they can live anywhere in the EU they want 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.060
 but in general other citizens of the European Union can not move freely in these territories. 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.440
 Which makes these sites weird the right European Union membrane and 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.410
 the last part we are going to talk about in detail though there are still many, 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.960
 many more one-miles stars you can stumble upon, such as: The Isle of Man, or those Spanish Cities 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.940
 in North Africa or Gibraltar, who claims to be part of Southwest England sometimes, 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.340
 or that region in Greece, where it is entirely legal to forbid women, or Sebei and friends 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.210
 who are part of the Netherlands and so should be part of the EU, but not the Isles 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.510
 Faroe Islands upon which while the citizens of Denmark live they lose their citizenship in the EU, and over 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.860
 and over it goes on. 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 These stars almost never end, but this video needs.
