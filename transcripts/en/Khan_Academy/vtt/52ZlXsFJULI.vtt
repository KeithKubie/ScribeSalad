00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.710
Welcome to the presentation
on adding and

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.300
subtracting fractions.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.450
Let's get started.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.120
Let's start with what I hope
shouldn't confuse you too much.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.130
This should hopefully be a
relatively easy question.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:23.940
If I were to ask you
what 1/4 plus 1/4 is.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.270
Let's think about
what that means.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.420
Let's say we had a pie and it
was divided into four pieces.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.180
So this is like saying this
first 1/4 right here -- let me

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.730
do it in a different color.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.530
This 1/4 right here,
let's say it's this

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.400
1/4 of the pie, right?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.570
And we're going to add it
to another 1/4 of the pie.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.610
Let's make it this one -- let
me change the color -- pink.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.070
This 1/4, this pink 1/4
is this 1/4 of the pie.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.270
So if I were to eat both 1/4s
or 1/4 and then I eat another

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.570
1/4, how much have I eaten?

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.260
Well, you could look from just
the picture, I have now eaten 2

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.280
out of the 4 pieces of the pie.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.480
So if I eat 1/4 of a piece of
pie or 1/4 of a pie, and then I

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.550
eat another 1/4 of a pie, I
will have eaten 2/4 of the pie.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.940
And we know from the equivalent
fractions module that this is

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.490
the same thing as I've
eaten 1/2 of the pie,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.330
which makes sense.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.150
If I eat 2 out of 4 pieces of a
pie, then I've eaten 1/2 of it.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.700
And if we look at it
mathematically, what

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.960
happened here?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.230
Well the denominators or the
bottom numbers, the bottom

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.270
numbers in the fraction
stayed the same.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.730
Because that's just the
total number of pieces

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.360
I have in this example.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.930
Well, I added the numerators,
which makes sense.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.490
I had 1 out of the 4 pieces of
pie, then I ate another 1 out

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.600
of the 4 pieces of pie, so I
ate 2 out of the 4 pieces

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510
of pie, which is 1/2.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.840
Let me do a couple
more examples.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.240
What is 2/5 plus 1/5?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.760
Well we do the same thing here.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.230
We first check to make sure the
denominators are the same --

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.130
we'll learn in a second what we
do when the denominators

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.900
are different.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.340
If the denominators are the
same, the denominator of the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.030
answer will be the same.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.480
And we just add the numerators.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.580
2/5 plus 1/5 is just 2
plus 1 over 5, which

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.100
is equal to 3 over 5.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.390
And it works the same
way with subtraction.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.430
If I had 3 over 7 minus 2 over
7, that just equals 1 over 7.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.480
I just subtracted the 3, I
subtracted the 2 from the 3

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.150
to get 1 and I kept the
denominator the same.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.860
Which makes sense.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.040
If I have 3 out of the 7 pieces
of a pie and I were to give

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.800
away 2 out of the 7 pieces of a
pie, I'd be left with 1 of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.180
the 7 pieces of a pie.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.370
So now let's tackle -- I
think it should be pretty

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.330
straightforward when we
have the same denominator.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.870
Remember, the denominator
is just the bottom

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.880
number in a fraction.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.410
Numerator is the top number.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.430
What happens when we have
different denominators?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.100
Well, hopefully it won't
be too difficult.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:24.330
Let's say I have 1/4 plus 1/2.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.190
Let's go back to that
original pie example.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.260
Let me draw that pie.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.250
So this first 1/4 right here,
let's just color it in,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.470
that's this 1/4 of the pie.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.550
And now I'm going to eat
another 1/2 of the pie.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.460
So I'm going to eat
1/2 of the pie.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.100
So this 1/2.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.400
I'll eat this whole
1/2 of the pie.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.230
So what does that equal?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.190
Well, there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.210
First we could just
re-write 1/2.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.135
1/2 of the pie, that's actually
the same thing as 2/4, right?

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.290
There's 1/4 here and
then another 1/4 here.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.470
So 1/2 is the same thing as
2/4, and we know that from the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.520
equivalent fractions module.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.460
So we know that 1/4 plus 1/2,
this is the same thing as

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.110
saying 1/4 plus 2/4, right?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:36.160
And all I did here is I changed
the 1/2 to a 2/4 by essentially

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.820
multiplying the numerator
and the denominator of

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.410
this fraction by 2.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.740
And you can do that
to any fraction.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.890
As long as you multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.620
by the same number, you
can multiply by anything.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.880
That makes sense because
1/2 times 1 is equal

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.440
to 1/2, you know that.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.080
Well another way of writing
1 is 1/2 times 2/2.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.490
2 over 2 is the same thing as
1, and that equals 2 over 4.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.380
The reason why I picked 2
is because I wanted to get

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.580
the same denominator here.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.530
I hope I'm not completely
confusing you.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.220
Well, let's just finish
up this problem.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.220
So we have 1/4 plus 2/4, so we
know that we just add the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.570
numerators, 3, and the
denominators are the same, 3/4.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.190
And if we look at the picture,
true enough, we have

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.380
eaten 3/4 of this pie.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.320
Let's do another one.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:44.730
Let's do 1/2 plus 1/3.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.570
Well once again, we want to get
both denominators to be the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.370
same, but you can't just
multiply one of them to get --

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.850
there's nothing I can multiply
3 by to get 2, or there's no,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.510
at least, integer I can
multiply 3 by to get 2.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.900
And there's nothing I can
multiply 2 by to get 3.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.870
So I have to multiply both of
them so they equal each other.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.230
It turns out that what we want
for, what we'll call the common

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.850
denominator, it turns out
to be the least common

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.130
multiple of 2 and 3.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.400
Well what's the least common
multiple of 2 and 3?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.750
Well that's the smallest
number that's a multiple

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.860
of both 2 and 3.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.390
Well the smallest number
that's a multiple of

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.480
both 2 and 3 is 6.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.890
So let's convert both of these
fractions to something over 6.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.340
So 1/2 is equal to what over 6.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.320
You should know this from the
equivalent fractions module.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.500
Well if I eat 1/2 of a pizza
with 6 pieces, I would have

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.270
eaten 3 pieces, right?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.820
That make sense.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.950
1 is 1/2 of 2, 3 is 1/2 of 6.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.650
Similarly, if I eat 1/3 of a
pizza with 6 pieces, it's

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.730
the same thing as 2 over 6.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:57.700
So 1/2 plus 1/3 is the same
thing as 3/6 plus 2/6.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.980
Notice I didn't do
anything crazy.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.030
All I did is I re-wrote both
of these fractions with

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.220
different denominators.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.050
I essentially changed the
number of pieces in the

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.830
pie, if that helps at all.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.410
Now that we're at this
point then the problem

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.190
becomes very easy.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.830
We just add the numerators,
3 plus 2 is 5, and we keep

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.430
the denominators the same.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.970
3 over 6 plus 2
over 6 equals 5/6.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.740
And subtraction is
the same thing.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.460
1/2 minus 1/3, well that's
the same thing as 3

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.110
over 6 minus 2 over 6.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.530
Well that equals 1 over 6.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.060
Let's do a bunch more problems
and hopefully you'll

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.990
start to get it.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.120
And always remember you can
re-watch the presentation, or

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.630
you can pause it and try to do
the problems yourself, because

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.250
I think sometimes I talk fast.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.100
Let me throw you a curve ball.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.330
What's 1/10 minus 1?

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.630
Well, one doesn't even
look like a fraction.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.150
But you can write
it as a fraction.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.970
Well that's the same thing as
1/10 minus -- how could we

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.020
write 1 so it has the
denominator of 10?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.590
Right.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.830
It's the same thing as
10 over 10, right?

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.330
10 over 10 is 1.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.900
So 1/10 minus 10 over 10 is the
same thing as 1 minus 10 --

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.950
remember, we only subtract the
numerators and we keep the

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:31.170
denominator 10, and that
equals negative 9 over 10.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.380
1/10 minus 1 is equal
to negative 9 over 10.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.920
Let's do another one.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.470
Let's do one more.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.680
I think that's all
I have time for.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:47.320
Let's do minus 1/9
minus 1 over 4.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.770
Well the least common
multiple of 0 and 4 is 36.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.590
So that's equal to 36.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.070
So what's negative 1/9 where
we change the denominator

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.010
from 9 to 36?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.030
Well, we multiply 9
times 4 to get 36.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.230
We have to multiply the
numerator times 4 as well.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.860
So we have negative 1, so
it becomes negative 4.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.860
Then minus over 36.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.110
Well to go from 4 to 36, we
have to multiply this fraction

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.070
by 9, or we have to multiply
the denominator by 9, so you

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.190
also have to multiply
the numerator by 9.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.370
1 times 9 is 9.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:35.770
So this equals minus 4 minus
9 over 36, which equals

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.580
minus 13 over 36.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.850
I think that's all I have time
for right now, and I'll

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.000
probably add a couple more
modules, but I think you might

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.520
be ready now to do the adding
and subtracting module.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.020
Have fun.
