spectrograph fastener capture plate and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650
spectrograph fastener capture plate and
 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.290
spectrograph fastener capture plate and
it's a beefy tool pretty impressive

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300
it's a beefy tool pretty impressive
 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.050
it's a beefy tool pretty impressive
this whole thing we snap on to the front

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
this whole thing we snap on to the front
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.360
this whole thing we snap on to the front
of the science instrument so it's it's

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370
of the science instrument so it's it's
 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.860
of the science instrument so it's it's
on top of the cover we have to remove

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
on top of the cover we have to remove
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.080
on top of the cover we have to remove
and if you look closely it's a lexan

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090
and if you look closely it's a lexan
 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.900
and if you look closely it's a lexan
cover and there are 111 holes in this

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910
cover and there are 111 holes in this
 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.909
cover and there are 111 holes in this
and what that allows us to do is to

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919
and what that allows us to do is to
 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.800
and what that allows us to do is to
access the screws on the cover of the

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810
access the screws on the cover of the
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.090
access the screws on the cover of the
science instrument now these screws are

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100
science instrument now these screws are
 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.800
science instrument now these screws are
they Phillips head screws or these

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810
they Phillips head screws or these
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.420
they Phillips head screws or these
standard screws or what is it crazy

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
standard screws or what is it crazy
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.860
standard screws or what is it crazy
screws there's three different kinds and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870
screws there's three different kinds and
 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.810
screws there's three different kinds and
most of them are Torx head screws horses

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820
most of them are Torx head screws horses
 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.520
most of them are Torx head screws horses
those are really funky bit really funky

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530
those are really funky bit really funky
 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.440
those are really funky bit really funky
bit we have torque set and everything is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450
bit we have torque set and everything is
 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.909
bit we have torque set and everything is
color-coded on the fastener capture

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919
color-coded on the fastener capture
 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.230

plate to help the astronaut and the

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240
plate to help the astronaut and the
 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.850
plate to help the astronaut and the
ground team to communicate and not be

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860
ground team to communicate and not be
 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.830
ground team to communicate and not be
confused so the astronaut puts the red

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840
confused so the astronaut puts the red
 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.740
confused so the astronaut puts the red
sockets onto his mini power tool sticks

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750
sockets onto his mini power tool sticks
 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.570

releases the screw and then the screws

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
releases the screw and then the screws
 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.770
releases the screw and then the screws
are all floating around inside the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780
are all floating around inside the
 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.210
are all floating around inside the
fastest at plate and covered so they

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220
fastest at plate and covered so they
 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.920
fastest at plate and covered so they
won't be free inside the telescope with

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930
won't be free inside the telescope with
 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.350
won't be free inside the telescope with
a new bed
