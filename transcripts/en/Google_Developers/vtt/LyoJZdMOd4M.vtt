JOSH LIVNI: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.445
My name is Joshua Livni.

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.380
I'm on the Maps Developer
Relations Team.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.580
And we have a guest
here today.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.780
Peter Birch works here as
Project Manager for Earth,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.070
Earth API, and various
related products.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.810
He's been here quite a
while and has all the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.200
inside info on Earth.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.860
So I thought it would be fun to
start out today's Hangout

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.710
with just some questions
maybe about the early

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.720
days of Google Earth.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.270
I think you joined back
when it was Version 4.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.700
It has come a long
way from then.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.180
Maybe you can talk about some
of those early days.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.950
PETER BIRCH: Yeah sure.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.650
So I actually joined in 2006.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.780
And I actually came in just
before what was the first Geo

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.710
Developer Day.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.200
I don't know if you remember
that but--

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.760
JOSH LIVNI: I was there.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.410
PETER BIRCH: Yes, that was sort
of the precursor to what

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.810
has now grown into Google I/O.
So I jumped in right in the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.270
thick of it as we were starting
to get the first

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.720
version of Google Earth 4 out.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.600
JOSH LIVNI: I think that's
when we introduced

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.440
superoverlays, I recall.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.540
PETER BIRCH: That was.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.178
JOSH LIVNI: I remember hacking
on a little Python script to

00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:10.180
create some master
superoverlays.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.010
Those were the days.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.240
So things have come a
long way from there.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.350
Maybe you can mention some of
the biggest changes that have

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.110
happened in the last few
years, the ones that

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.230
really stuck out.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.070
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, certainly.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.930
So Earth has gone through
this progression.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.340
So it started off as a
Windows desktop app.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.800
We added Mac support in
3.1, I believe, which

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.360
was before my time.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690
We introduced Linux support.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.110
But since then, there's been
a lot of big changes.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.810
So obviously, the introduction
of the Earth API in 2008 was

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.830
really one big change in the
way of bringing that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.510
experience to the web and
really creating another

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.480
developer community in addition
to what could be done

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.660
with KML, being able to use
JavaScript to control Earth.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.190
The other big change obviously
is mobile.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.170
We launched, again
in 2008, the iOS.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.110
So at the time, it was
the first iPhone.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.140
Since then, we've added
obviously Android, we've added

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.430
iPads, and Android tablets.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.700
So there's been a lot.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.140
I think everyone's pretty
aware there's just been

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.660
tremendous growth in mobile.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.960
And that Geo kind of things,
whether it's maps or location

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.410
information, is such an integral
part of the mobile

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.670
experience that it's really
an exciting space for us.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.330
So we've been spending lot of
time kind of thinking about

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.300
mobile as well.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.480
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and I think
it's the latest 6.2.2 version

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.970
that has some new-found
abilities with KML in mobile.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.923
Maybe you just want
to talk briefly a

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:46.945
little bit about that.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:52.230
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I mean, when
we first came out with

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
Earth on mobile, everyone's
first question was when can I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.260
have KML displaying on it?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.200
And I think that what we knew
at the time was that we're

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.070
actually sharing a lot of the
same code between these

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.800
different devices.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.660
But obviously, a mobile device
is a more constrained

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.980
environment.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.840
And so it took us some time,
first of all, to expand on to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.070
multiple platforms and make
sure we worked on tablets.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.820
And then there were some other
just general things we needed

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.920
to do to make sure that KML
would work successfully.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.740
But we're really excited to
finally be able to turn that

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.600
on in 6.2 and have that
available simultaneously on

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.490
iOS devices and Android
devices.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.660
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, it was really
nice to work with the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.710
KML and have it load right up
in the native application.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.710
And it had some pretty
robust stories.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.860
Tours look great on the tablet
devices, look amazing.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.260
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I was really
excited to get Tours in

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.840
there as well.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.960
I think it was really important
to us to really

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.870
support KML and the
KML developers.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.450
Because there's just so much KML
out there that we really

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.410
wanted to make it so you didn't
have to create this

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.920
mobile only experience or some
other kind of thing.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.900
So that basically if you have
KML linked off of your page

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.440
somewhere, you can click on
that, download it, and do it.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.170
And I think that really just
expands the existing community

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.910
of Geo developers and people
who are using KML without

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.519
having to create something
that's kind of slightly

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.490
different and new.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.455
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and the other
one I want to recognize

00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:28.180
is if you have a Tour in the KML
and then in your tablet or

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.646
phone, it just brings up that
play automatically.

00:04:30.646 --> 00:04:33.120
That's pretty intuitive.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.990
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, it's
something we're actually

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.750
experimenting with.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750
In some ways, the mobile
platform gives us a little

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.730
more leeway to experiment
because there's not as much

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.340
past usage and expectations.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.680
So we are able to play around
with the things a little bit

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.080
differently.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.310
So that was one of things where
we wanted to try that

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.260
out and see if it works.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.780
So the fact that you have a
Tour, you load it up, you

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.030
immediately start playing it,
may be an idea that we carry

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.210
back over to the desktop.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.100
Because I know that a lot
of people who do Tour

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.650
development, you end up with
this awkward double click here

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.850
on the icon on the left-hand
panel, not very intuitive for

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.950
users that aren't necessarily
familiar with KML.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.920
So we're looking at ways of
making it an easier, more

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.640
fluid experience for everyone.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.660
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, I love that
latest. It's fun to play on

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.265
the tablet for sure.

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:23.540
But going back to something
you said earlier about the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.000
Earth API, we had Paul
Rademacher on a few weeks ago.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.150
I know he worked on the early
API, but we didn't talk about

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.760
that so much.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.290
Do you have fun stories
of how that started?

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.110
Anything interesting that the
general public might not know

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.390
about the early, early days
of the Earth API?

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.400
PETER BIRCH: I think the fact
that Paul worked on it is a

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.290
pretty interesting fun fact.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.936
JOSH LIVNI: Because he came from
the Maps background with

00:05:46.936 --> 00:05:47.130
the mashup.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.130
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, so, I mean,
he sort of was the guy who

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.250
created Google Maps API
in some ways, right?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.080
So basically Google Maps was
out there with its housing

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.070
maps, basically hacked it in
such a way that he actually

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.480
started to mash up
his own map.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.220
In this case, it was like
Craigslist data with our maps.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.240
And so, we were really excited
when he did join Google and

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.130
really wanted to work on Earth
API and bringing the 3D

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.126
experience in.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:20.220
He has a background in
3D graphics as well.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.950
So that was pretty cool.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.960
It was kind of like someone
coming in who both had the 3D

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.770
animation experience
and who was sort

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.180
of one of the pioneers--

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.300
JOSH LIVNI: Pioneering
what a mashup is.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.810
PETER BIRCH: --in creating a
mashup as the driving force

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.300
behind getting the
Earth API built.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.840
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, yeah, and
we've seen a lot of adoption

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.500
since then.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.870
So I guess just a couple more
questions before we go to

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.290
open-ended questions here from
folks on our moderator.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.280
If you are watching that live
stream on YouTube, you're

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.210
welcome to click the link
in our + page to

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.470
ask a moderator question.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.350
Otherwise, we'll gather some
more questions from the folks

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.500
in the Hangout as well.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.370
So just a couple of
quick questions.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.025
What's your favorite app that
you've seen recently that

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:09.010
people have developed
on the API?

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.530
PETER BIRCH: So I'm a big fan,
of course, of Paul van Dinther

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.210
his work on PlanetInAction.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.680
JOSH LIVNI: Beautiful stuff.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.720
PETER BIRCH: Always great to see
what he's coming up with.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.950
And the most recent one, which
is the ocean current

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.990
animation, is just
really stunning.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.810
It's actually based on some data
that NOAA put together,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.260
so it's satellite-based
high-resolution time-sequence

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.460
imagery of currents.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.940
And like any great Geo data, it
gets even better when you

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.450
actually put it on
Google Earth.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.570
Being able to--

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.960
JOSH LIVNI: Really see those
patterns globally.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.010
PETER BIRCH: And if you go to
planetinaction.com, you can go

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.050
in there and play with
it yourself.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.100
Doing it on a Hangout probably
won't do it justice to the

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.630
experience.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.690
But it really is a great way of
actually visualizing real

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.970
scientific data, which
is the sort of

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.220
perpetual current patterns.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.840
And you can actually fly around
the Earth and see them.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.360
You can see different
eddies occurring.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.500
You can really start to
understand what marine

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.750
navigation was like in the day
when people were trying to

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.300
figure out how do they get from
one place to another.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.890
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah,
it's amazing.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.750
PETER BIRCH: I'm a
sailor as well.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.730
So it's always interesting
seeing how our planet is

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.050
moving around and churning.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.600
And that's a great visualization
of it.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.625
JOSH LIVNI: It would be
interesting to overlay some

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.082
SID tracks and pop in those even
today and see how much

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:30.910
they take advantage of the
different currents.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.500
All right, next mashup.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.070
And what about some new
data that we've

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.900
added to Google Earth?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.350
I know we keep adding lots of
different data all the time.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.470
What are some of your favorite
tasks with new data additions?

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.230
PETER BIRCH: So probably my
favorite one we've done

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.740
recently is part of our
historical imagery.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.550
We've recently added--

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.750
so I live in San Francisco.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.410
And we recently added 1938 San
Francisco imagery, which is

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.460
just fantastic.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.280
So the historical imagery
feature in general has always

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.310
been one of my favorite features
that people don't

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.980
necessarily know about
because there's

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.940
just such a vast archive.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.540
We're always bringing in
new imagery, and we're

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.000
laying it on top.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.190
And we're covering up a lot
of what was there before.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.030
So the fact that when we
introduced it in Earth 5, this

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.060
ability to be able to kind of
peel back and go back in time

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.990
is tremendously powerful.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.380
Now we're starting to
turn up these data

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.860
sets like this 1938.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.090
It's one-meter resolution
imagery

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.910
of all of San Francisco.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.940
It's incredibly high resolution,
and you can, for

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.590
those of you who know San
Francisco, have been there,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.660
it's really fantastic.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.230
You can go and look at Crissy
Field, which now it's like a

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.980
park and marine wetlands area
that used to be an airstrip.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.350
So you can actually see
it as an airstrip.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.330
You can see planes on it.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.410
You can see the hangars.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:50.545
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah,
the waterfront,

00:09:50.545 --> 00:09:52.250
there's just so much.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.990
PETER BIRCH: Yeah,
and it's funny.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.720
You can see what hasn't
changed as well.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.160
So it's a great data set.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.060
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, definitely
take advantage of the

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.030
historical imagery when you're
browsing on Google Earth.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.550
But also if you're
a developer, take

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.970
advantage of that, too.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.650
If you're telling a story that
takes place over a period of

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.690
time, you can programmatically
disable and enable historical

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.740
imagery and choose what
era you're looking at.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.830
PETER BIRCH: And that's
something we have in

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.480
the Earth API today.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.540
It's not something we have on
mobile yet, but it's obviously

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.020
something that we've
thought about.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.080
Because being able to bring
that kind of experience to

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.950
wherever you are I think would
be pretty powerful.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.590
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, it's amazing
to see how the Earth changes.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.250
So we should probably move on
to some live questions here.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.260
I'm going to go ahead
for those of you--

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.740
I've muted everybody who joined
this Office Hours.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.190
Can you raise your hand if
you have a question?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.950
I'll unmute you and be happy to
answer any questions that

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.680
we can here.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.010
All right we have a question
here from Don.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.420
Let me figure out how
to unmute you.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.990
I think you're open.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.940
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious about
the future of Google

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.320
Earth on mobile and whether or
not that's going to be a

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.035
platform where developers and
what we've been able to do

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:06.500
with the Earth API are going
to be able to do anything

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.230
similar at all in
terms of mobile?

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.570
PETER BIRCH: Sure.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.630
So that's a great question.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:17.360
So the first part of that, I
think, is the 6.2 release is

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.310
really kind of the first
step towards that.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.630
So prior to that, there was
really no way for anyone to

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.070
customize or put data on it.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.640
So we're starting by saying
use your existing KML.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.850
Any data that you have, you
can view that on a map.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.490
And there's really quite a
lot you can do with that.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.210
So not only can you just take
existing KML data, you also

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.770
can use Tours.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.810
So basically, if you have a
Tour in your data, you not

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.050
only can have the data there,
but you can have the whole

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.560
visualization for it and the
fact that, as Josh mentioned,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.450
we'll go ahead and auto
launch the player.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.730
There's also another interesting
little feature in

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.310
there, which is we have
something called a Tour

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.220
Generator, where we will
auto-generate a Tour.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.740
And I think we need to get some
documentation up for this

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.130
on the dev site, because
you can actually pass

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.110
in an ID for a feature.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.925
And then Google Earth will
auto-generate the best Tour it

00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:16.680
can based on that data.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.180
And we'll be talking some
more about that later.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.880
We need to get some--

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.500
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, a nice
KML article on that.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.260
That's a great idea.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.900
PETER BIRCH: And in fact,
we're using it in the My

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.900
Tracks app right now.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.160
So if you go off and say, go for
a bike ride, and then you

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.950
want to say, hey, I want to view
this, you can hit play.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.960
It will launch Earth.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.360
Earth will automatically
generate a Tour for it and

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.620
then will replay it.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.020
So that's step one.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.050
Is there going to be another
stage where you can have a

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.090
complete full-API control?

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.090
And it's definitely something
I'd like to see happen.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.790
We don't have anything to
talk about right now.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.320
And we need to think about what
the right platform is.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.630
We have to think about
Android and iOS.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:07.610
So the JavaScript API, given the
restrictions of plug-ins,

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.540
means that there isn't a great
story there right now.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.000
But I definitely see
us moving in that

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.540
direction in the long term.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.840
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks guys.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.390
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, thank you.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.790
Any other questions
from folks here?

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.860
We got one here, and then we'll

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.475
hop over to our moderator.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:33.250
Let's see, can we hear
you, Jeremy?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.890
AUDIENCE: It's a Street View
question, actually.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.480
We have a site called the
Best Driving Roads.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.285
And it's an interactive thing.

00:13:41.285 --> 00:13:45.930
It's KML overlaid on
top of Google Maps.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.730
What are the chances of at
some point in the future

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.850
people being able to drive along
through Street View?

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.030
So you're making Street View
images into a movie.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.920
So you could go along stage
by stage by stage.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.910
It would be a jaggedy movie,
but it would flow

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.490
you down the road.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:03.320
PETER BIRCH: It's an
interesting idea.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.720
I think that within the API--

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.060
I don't know what things on the
Maps API side people have

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.215
done with transitions from
Street View image to Street

00:14:11.215 --> 00:14:12.900
View image.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.910
Certainly within Earth API, we
already have the ability, at

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.870
least some limited capabilities,
of moving the

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.050
camera, and Earth will sort of
automatically update the--

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.560
JOSH LIVNI: Kind of
interpolate it.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.700
PETER BIRCH: Does the
interpolation between them.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.700
So that's something that might
be worth playing around with.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.670
I don't know if you have
any familiarity on

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.440
the Maps API side.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.380
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, the Earth API
does have a much smoother

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.810
animation with some pretty
complex interpolation that we

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.840
do inside of Earth, and
it's quite nice.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.090
On the Maps API side, that's
certainly getting better with

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.610
the HTML5 version of Street
View looking a lot more

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.840
smoother between these
discrete steps.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.150
It's not a smooth--

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.200
really video yet.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.690
So I think that's a really good
feature request-- and

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.550
we've heard it before-- to try
make a smoother animation as

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.080
you navigate through
Street View.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.100
And that's I think--

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:06.720
AUDIENCE: I think it's
not just us.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.500
I think all sorts of people
could use a way of moving

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.815
across the landscape,
couldn't they?

00:15:11.815 --> 00:15:14.090
PETER BIRCH:Yeah, I mean,
there's a couple of ways that

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.060
it could be approached.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.090
One is the one that we've
talked about, which is

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.270
basically moving your
virtual camera

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.160
through a series of panos.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.860
And there'd be some kind of
transition as you move from

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.410
one to the next to the next.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.350
The other one would be some kind
of offline rendering of a

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.920
video for a given sequence,
which would obviously involve

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.380
a different set of
infrastructure on our side

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.630
where we'd actually try to
create that video on demand

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.900
and then be able to
play it back.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.260
That would be pretty
cool, though.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.010
JOSH LIVNI: Actually, that's
a very cool idea.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.840
AUDIENCE: For instance, we
could do it ourselves.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.820
We could take a section of the
roads and put that together so

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.690
we have it on.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.175
But you guys don't like us
taking this stuff on board, do

00:15:57.175 --> 00:15:58.360
you, and having it
on our side?

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.050
I know it's just the
nature of Google.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.510
JOSH LIVNI: Yes, so definitely
our terms don't allow you to

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.340
do offline analysis on the
Street View imagery.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.610
Also, another pretty common
feature request, though.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.890
So it's not that
we ignore them.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.420
We definitely--

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:13.820
AUDIENCE: No, I understand,
yeah.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.760
JOSH LIVNI: --look at people's
questions for that.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.990
We try see if we can build a
service that would do the

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.800
things that are needed, but
case in point noted.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.270
And I think there's actually
open feature requests for that

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.330
on the Maps API issue tracker.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.340
And if you go there and you
star those, the more

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.170
developers that star those
things, the more they pop up

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.540
on our radar every time we have
a meeting and say what

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.530
should we do next to make this a
better developer experience.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.272
The more people clamor for
something, the more likely it

00:16:40.272 --> 00:16:41.000
is to happen.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.036
So that is really
good feedback.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.910
AUDIENCE: Pulling off that,
how many many stars do you

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.890
need for something
to really figure?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.010
Do you need like 20 stars or--

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.250
JOSH LIVNI: Definitely
more than one.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.690
Unless there's a really good
point on that one.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.250
PETER BIRCH: There's also

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.040
obviously a trade off between--

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.780
there's a full spectrum
of different

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.900
types of feature requests.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.550
There's things that are
basically just a bug that we

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.980
haven't got to yet that
might be fairly

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.910
straightforward to fix.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.030
There are things that we may
already have been working on,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.270
and it's just a matter
of like, OK,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.290
well, now it's ready.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.530
There might be things that we
hadn't thought of before, but

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.339
actually are fairly
easy for us to do.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.900
And then there are things that
may be great ideas, but they

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.220
also involve a pretty
significant amount of work.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.740
And in those cases, those things
take longer or we may

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.770
or may not get to them.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.980
So unfortunately, there's not
a straightforward answer.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.870
JOSH LIVNI: Sort of an
engineering effort.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.120
But if you look, for example,
just today, I think we put out

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.750
a blog post on the Geo developer
blog about a bunch

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.850
of new features in
our Places API.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.230
And all of those features, I
can assure you, were driven

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.030
entirely by user requests
on the issue tracker.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.570
And we looked at the top
requests, and we implemented

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.800
those for the Places API.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.210
So this happens all the time.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.870
We definitely look at that.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.540
It's a great way to give us
feedback about what's

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.880
important to you guys.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.500
PETER BIRCH: And it keeps us
from going off and spending

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.840
time doing stuff that you
guys don't care about.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.870
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, but at the
same time, there are ones that

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.080
would require just
disproportionate effort , or

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.460
for various other reasons,
we just can't do them.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.130
And then even a large number
of stars might not get you

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.850
what you're looking for.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.372
We try to give you feedback
when that's

00:18:12.372 --> 00:18:14.180
going to happen, though.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.410
MODERATOR: Should we jump
on this right here?

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.250
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, let's hop into
some moderator questions,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.500
and then we'll come back here
for a quick last question or

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.460
two if there are any.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.290
I'm just going to go ahead and
mute all of these screens.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.210
And I'll share the screen here
so we can all see these

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.960
moderator questions.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.500
There we go.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.480
OK, wow, that was pretty cool.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.020
Oh yes, let's go to
the top question.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.740
"What is Google's
plan with Google

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.020
Earth Desktop and plug-in?

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.370
With Sketchup being sold and a
growing aversion to plug-ins,

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.840
I cannot help but wonder if it
is the end of Google Earth?

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.060
Is that in sight?"

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.820
PETER BIRCH: Absolutely not.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.870
So basically plug-ins are the
worst solution ever, except

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.915
for all the others.

00:19:01.915 --> 00:19:04.530
I think plug-ins are something
that are really

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.760
a means to an end.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.840
And no, I hate plug-ins
as well.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.040
And I think the real question
is, given what we're trying to

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.450
do and all the functionality
with the high frame rate 3D

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.710
graphics, what's the best
way to bring that to

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.440
developers on the web?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.160
And that answer has been and
continues to be using our

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.030
plug-in to provide
that capability.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.160
Now, obviously, there's
some really

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.390
exciting stuff going on.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.610
In the web world now there's
a lot of things with--

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.620
JavaScript is getting faster
and faster all the time.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.780
There's worker threads.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.840
WebGL is showing a lot
of great promise

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.370
with our Maps TL.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.060
It's sort of an indication
of our commitment to that

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.710
technology and our commitment
to really push the limits of

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.100
the web as a platform.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.450
So we're absolutely looking at
ways to further bring together

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:05.460
an immersive 3D environment
and the web.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.340
And it's hard to know how that's
going to play out and

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.650
when it's going to play out.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.980
Obviously, we're very
interested in WebGL.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.560
We're looking at it.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.770
But today, it really takes the
plug-in to provide the full

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:24.970
breadth of functionality that we
want to have. But overall,

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.930
we're very committed to mapping
out the world and

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.980
providing this virtual
3D experience.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.040
And I think over the years, what
that means in terms of

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.560
technology is going to
evolve and change.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.700
I mean, five years ago we
wouldn't have thought about

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.390
mobile device as even
being a factor.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.850
And yet here we are, and mobile
is a critical part of

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:51.440
our products, our stories,
our developers.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.362
Everyone wants to know
how mobile is going

00:20:53.362 --> 00:20:55.000
to play into it.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.900
What are things going to look
like five years from now?

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.560
I don't know yet.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.500
But we're committed to really
creating the best experience

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.610
we can on whatever platforms
our users are on.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.240
JOSH LIVNI: You don't
know what's going to

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.540
happen in five years?

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:05.920
PETER BIRCH: Well, I do.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.466
I just can't say it.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:07.840
JOSH LIVNI: You're right.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.900
You can't share that
information today.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.660
So let's hop back up to
this next window.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.030
We have--

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.580
it's just coming into focus.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.870
"How are applications chosen
or considered for the

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.050
developer showcase?"

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:21.730
PETER BIRCH: Josh.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.270
JOSH LIVNI: Yes.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.890
So we have our new developer
channel at

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.320
developers.google.com.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.120
And one of the things there is
a pretty nice showcase that

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.000
includes a whole lot of Maps
and Earth, sort of the

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.100
best-in-breed out.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.726
So how does your app get
on there and how

00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:36.870
do we choose them?

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.470
The short answer is, it's a
curated list. We go over and

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.850
we look at things that have
caught our attention one way

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.880
or another that we think show
off some of the cool

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.400
capabilities, like a really nice
styled map, an amazing

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.090
tour in Earth, what have you.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.670
And then we also pay attention
to what people are talking

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.440
about online on different
social networks.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.950
And then obviously, if you guys
have something that you'd

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.940
like to submit or that you think
is great, whether it's

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.150
your own or somebody else's, you
can hit over our + page,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.130
the Maps API Google+ page, and
let us know about it there.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.470
We'll take a look, and we try
to refresh the ones that are

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.380
on there periodically.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.180
Make sure there are nice, new
examples that are taking

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.350
advantage of compelling
features so that other

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.280
developers can come and say,
well, I didn't really know you

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.730
could do that.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.190
Or that's a great way to do
that thing that I used do.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.920
PETER BIRCH: What about more
Earth API examples?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.910
JOSH LIVNI: There are
so many out there.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.730
We have a lot.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.130
That's a good point.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.760
OK, I pledge we'll get one
or two up this week.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.690
I'll take another look.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.950
Well, that PlanetInAction one
you mentioned was amazing.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:39.800
PETER BIRCH: Well, there's a
whole bunch of other ones that

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.940
I'd like to see up
there as well.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.980
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, so as you can
see, it's a very formal

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.620
process here.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.440
But definitely let us know
if you have something.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.930
We kind of try to curate a list
that we think is just

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.240
going to be compelling
for developers to

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.790
learn something from.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.915
So this next question.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.410
OK, so "rotating ground overlays
in Google Maps API,

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.680
can it be done?" So this is a
question, I think, by Paul van

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.000
Dinther, who we mentioned
earlier.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.530
And it was asked also
on Stack Overflow.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.580
And there's not a
comment here.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.380
I'll try to add a comment to
this moderator later, but we

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.120
answered that.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.420
The short answer is yes,
absolutely you can.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.235
Brendon on our team posted some
working code sample that

00:23:21.235 --> 00:23:22.160
shows you just how to do that.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:29.320
So absolutely you can use canvas
rotation, no problem.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.800
Next question.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.550
Feature request--

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.880
a set of design patterns, best
practices for data biz on the

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.190
mobile, on the desktop discovery
sort of based on--

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.740
I'm guessing--

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:47.243
what our UX and engineers think
are the best way to go.

00:23:47.243 --> 00:23:49.300
I shouldn't be bring
that up yet.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.610
It's a really good question.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:55.020
I'm going to bring us out of
the screen share here.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.370
So I think that's a
fantastic idea.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.280
And we should absolutely
do that.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.510
I'll let you answer, then I'll
add some more detail there.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.810
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I mean, I'd
love to see that, too.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.720
I think the thing that is
changing this equation as well

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.920
is the fact that Earth has been
a desktop large screen

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.230
application for a long time.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.060
So I think, at least from a KML
perspective, people have

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.440
built some of their own kind
of best practices.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.660
But we really haven't talked
about like if you're going to

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.930
put a legend up, where do you
put it on the screen, and a

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.030
lot of those kind of things.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.690
And now with the transition to
mobile, things got a lot more

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.470
complicated.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.820
You've got to worry
about phones.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.850
You've got to worry
about tablets.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.180
You've got to worry about
portrait mode and landscape

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.180
mode, and that really
complicates the UI.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.090
And we see that ourselves in
the application development

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:45.190
that there's not like a
one pattern fits all.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.300
And it also depends on what
type of application do you

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.810
have. Do you really need
a legend there?

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.760
What's the right way
to present it?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.990
I'd love to see that.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.380
JOSH LIVNI: I mean, generally
on Android, it's always good

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.210
to follow the standard best
practices that the average

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.880
person who used all kinds of
apps on the phone are going to

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.690
be familiar with.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.720
And I know that the Android
guys have--

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.570
I think they call it Android
University--

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.740
a lot of best practices
there and examples.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.570
You can follow folks
like Roman Nurik.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.000
He used to actually work a lot
with Google Earth over on the

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.670
Android team.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.710
And he's a great designer, and
I think he posts links to a

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.200
lot of the best practices for
layout and ways to build your

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.660
app with that in mind.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.550
But more generally, I think
it's a great idea.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.140
A lot of our examples right now
say, here's how you get

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.150
started here is the best way to
enable ground overlays or a

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.260
sidebar or something.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.850
But then we don't really take
that next step and what's the

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.260
whole screen space going
to look like?

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.080
What's the whole application
going to look like?

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.470
And yeah, I think we could
probably put together some

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.193
compelling stuff with our UX
guys and maybe post a couple

00:25:45.193 --> 00:25:47.960
of good articles out there,
so great feedback.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.370
PETER BIRCH: For Earth API, it'd
be good to know how to

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:54.290
handle embedded in a page versus
going to a full-screen

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.580
mode and some things to consider
for that as well.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.280
JOSH LIVNI: Absolutely.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.010
Yeah, we've seen a lot of people
implement the left-hand

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.740
panel for the Earth API
in different ways.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.760
I really like that open source
KML tree application.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.150
But more generally,
yeah, exactly.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.530
We could put out some best
practices there.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.460
I think that's an
excellent plan.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.370
Where are we here?

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:20.680
"How much does Google Maps and
Earth inform Google insights?"

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.580
PETER BIRCH: Is that insights
with a capital I or a

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.840
lowercase I?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.530
JOSH LIVNI: Well, here
it's a lowercase.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.490
But that could mean anything.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.440
PETER BIRCH: How does it
inform Google insights?

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.290
Well, I'll just sort of think
about it generically.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.570
I mean, obviously, location
information is a really core

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.630
part of everything.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.690
And I think that Google is a
search company, and we're all

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.980
about making information in
the world universally

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.000
accessible and useful.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.450
Location is a really key part
of the world's information.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.710
If you think about it,
everything that has happened

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.400
somewhere in the world--

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.180
everything we've ever done has
happened somewhere on this

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.710
world, if you exclude
space travel.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.820
So the location component
is such a critical part.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.150
We already are working on
surfacing local data and other

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.000
things as part of Google
search itself.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.370
I think of location as being
yet another search term in

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.400
anything that you might
want to do.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.490
Especially for our Google Maps
for mobile, if you're out on

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.570
the town and you want to know
about a bar, for example, you

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.210
probably want to know about
the ones that are walking

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.850
distance from you.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.840
And so this idea of really
making sure that location is

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.600
tied in with the broader Google
experience is something

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.320
that I think is really
important.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.180
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah,
I agree 100%.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.765
And unfortunately, I'm
not entirely sure--

00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:47.665
are either of you the people
who asked that question?

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.870
May we ask for a
clarification?

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.320
No?

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.770
OK.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.280
Well, we'll move to
the next question.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.710
Hopefully, that was the
intended question.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.800
And the last question we have
"when will Google Earth get

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.180
Google+ layer to display?

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.620
And will there be a separate
later to display pictures from

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.770
Picaso Web and G+?" I think some
overlays on top of Earth

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.230
are being requested.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.560
PETER BIRCH: Sure.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.280
So I think it's a great idea.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.840
I mean, obviously, the key part
is to make sure that you

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.200
have information and
the location.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.160
And that's something that I need
to look further into to

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.190
say is there feed available that
basically is a location

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.040
tag stream of posts.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.520
But I think that would
be fantastic.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.490
JOSH LIVNI: Yeah, and I have
seen some mashups out there of

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:37.810
people who use the public G+ API
to read in check-ins, for

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.810
example, where those occurred.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.230
That's certainly the type
of thing you could do.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.420
Could we make it a little
bit more robust or

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.660
potentially show you--

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.140
I mean, certainly with Earth
API, you could do it today.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.280
But I think that is an
interesting idea.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.220
There's a lot of good content
being shared out there.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.436
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I
think that's great.

00:28:57.436 --> 00:28:58.010
JOSH LIVNI: OK, cool.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.130
So I think we're done.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.060
Does anyone in the live
Hangout here have any

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.180
last-minute questions?

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:04.670
Looking good.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.950
OK, well, thanks for joining
us everyone.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.690
We really appreciate it.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.620
Peter, thank you very much
for joining us this week.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.080
PETER BIRCH: My pleasure.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.930
JOSH LIVNI: And I think
we have another

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.470
one next week scheduled.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.030
I will post a link to the exact
time, probably 1:00 PM

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:14.705
Pacific Time.

00:29:14.705 --> 00:29:16.430
We were a little early
this week.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.180
And thanks again.
