when she's not being a beast she's the
cutest thing on earth and of course we

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:00.570
cutest thing on earth and of course we
 

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:05.590
cutest thing on earth and of course we
have the two other cuties you know I

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:05.600
have the two other cuties you know I
 

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:10.849
have the two other cuties you know I
think these both are pretties because we

00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859
think these both are pretties because we
 

00:57:10.859 --> 00:57:14.359
think these both are pretties because we
know that plonk has the the much really

00:57:14.359 --> 00:57:14.369
know that plonk has the the much really
 

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:17.150

dark spots and the he has a two patches

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160
dark spots and the he has a two patches
 

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:20.240
dark spots and the he has a two patches
of white just on each side of his of his

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:20.250
of white just on each side of his of his
 

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:24.800
of white just on each side of his of his
spine and he also has that kind of a C

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:24.810
spine and he also has that kind of a C
 

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.500
spine and he also has that kind of a C
upon his on his thigh and then I also

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:27.510
upon his on his thigh and then I also
 

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.060
upon his on his thigh and then I also
think on the other side he has kind of a

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:29.070
think on the other side he has kind of a
 

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:30.859
think on the other side he has kind of a
triangle without corners if that makes

00:57:30.859 --> 00:57:30.869
triangle without corners if that makes
 

00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:33.890
triangle without corners if that makes
sense and so these two I'm pretty sure

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900
sense and so these two I'm pretty sure
 

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.880
sense and so these two I'm pretty sure

talking about whether are the hyenas
 

00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:13.039
talking about whether are the hyenas
because all the only hyenas that we've

00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:13.049
because all the only hyenas that we've
 

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:18.230
because all the only hyenas that we've

apparent territory kind of encompasses

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:32.490
apparent territory kind of encompasses
 

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:33.970
apparent territory kind of encompasses
it seems like it's a lot for a small

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:33.980
it seems like it's a lot for a small
 

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:39.200
it seems like it's a lot for a small
amount of hyena but then Jaime also told

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:39.210
amount of hyena but then Jaime also told
 

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:41.329
amount of hyena but then Jaime also told
us that when there was an elephant

00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339
us that when there was an elephant
 

00:59:41.339 --> 00:59:44.599
us that when there was an elephant
carcass then there are other hyenas that

00:59:44.599 --> 00:59:44.609
carcass then there are other hyenas that
 

00:59:44.609 --> 00:59:45.769
carcass then there are other hyenas that
have come in as well

00:59:45.769 --> 00:59:45.779
have come in as well
 

00:59:45.779 --> 00:59:47.269

obviously they were fighting and other

00:59:47.269 --> 00:59:47.279
obviously they were fighting and other
 

00:59:47.279 --> 00:59:51.710
obviously they were fighting and other
sorts of things but it's interesting in

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720
sorts of things but it's interesting in
 

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.000
sorts of things but it's interesting in
fact I was just thinking about it today

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.010
fact I was just thinking about it today
 

00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:55.549
fact I was just thinking about it today
about the territories and and exactly

00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559
about the territories and and exactly
 

00:59:55.559 --> 00:59:57.230
about the territories and and exactly
who else would come in and how would

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240
who else would come in and how would
 

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.880
who else would come in and how would
they come in but so far I have just just

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:01.890
they come in but so far I have just just
 

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.799

been lucky enough to be with our little

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:03.809
been lucky enough to be with our little
 

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:18.440
been lucky enough to be with our little
Chu my plan here everyone's sleepy

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:18.450
 

01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:20.440
look at those

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:20.450
look at those
 

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.660
look at those
there you can clearly see it so when you

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:22.670
there you can clearly see it so when you
 

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:26.440
there you can clearly see it so when you
see a hyena track that's exactly what

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:26.450
see a hyena track that's exactly what
 

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.850
see a hyena track that's exactly what
you're seeing and I always love to see

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:27.860
you're seeing and I always love to see
 

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.260
you're seeing and I always love to see
the actual pole because it gives you a

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:29.270
the actual pole because it gives you a
 

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.080
the actual pole because it gives you a
good understanding of the shape and size

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.090
good understanding of the shape and size
 

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.640
good understanding of the shape and size
of that track so you can see that the

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:33.650
of that track so you can see that the
 

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:37.690
of that track so you can see that the
back pad only has two lobes whereas with

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:37.700
back pad only has two lobes whereas with
 

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.220
back pad only has two lobes whereas with
a leopard or line you see the three

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:39.230
a leopard or line you see the three
 

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.550
a leopard or line you see the three
lobes and also if you think of your own

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:42.560
lobes and also if you think of your own
 

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.580
lobes and also if you think of your own
hand when you take paint in you pop it

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:45.590
hand when you take paint in you pop it
 

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.730
hand when you take paint in you pop it
in in the paint and you pop it on a

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:48.740
in in the paint and you pop it on a
 

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:51.220
in in the paint and you pop it on a
piece of paper then you also kind of

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:51.230
piece of paper then you also kind of
 

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.460
piece of paper then you also kind of
have two lobes at the bottom by your

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:54.470
have two lobes at the bottom by your
 

01:00:54.470 --> 01:01:01.990
have two lobes at the bottom by your
wrists look at the legs crust yes you

some this afternoon we've actually just
 

01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:10.469
some this afternoon we've actually just
found a very interesting thing if one of

01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:10.479
found a very interesting thing if one of
 

01:23:10.479 --> 01:23:13.799
found a very interesting thing if one of
the mud pans is a random egg that was

01:23:13.799 --> 01:23:13.809
the mud pans is a random egg that was
 

01:23:13.809 --> 01:23:15.629
the mud pans is a random egg that was
just deposited on the side of the pan

01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:15.639
just deposited on the side of the pan
 

01:23:15.639 --> 01:23:18.629
just deposited on the side of the pan
and there wasn't too much evidence

01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639
and there wasn't too much evidence
 

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:20.910
and there wasn't too much evidence
around to suggest who left it there but

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920
around to suggest who left it there but
 

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.620
around to suggest who left it there but
certainly a nice

and you see all these depressions
 

01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:50.260
and you see all these depressions
they've created even she's sitting in

one oh who was that you saw the moment

01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:58.490
one oh who was that you saw the moment
 

01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:14.330
one oh who was that you saw the moment
of collapse

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340
 

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.370
bumblebee you'd like to know if there

01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:16.380
bumblebee you'd like to know if there
 

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:21.140
bumblebee you'd like to know if there
are albino hyenas the possibility exists

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:21.150
are albino hyenas the possibility exists
 

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:24.440
are albino hyenas the possibility exists
I'm sure but I would think it's more

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:24.450
I'm sure but I would think it's more
 

01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:26.000
I'm sure but I would think it's more
likely that someone would see a

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.010
likely that someone would see a
 

01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:29.450
likely that someone would see a
leucistic hyena and I know that French

01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460
leucistic hyena and I know that French
 

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.480
leucistic hyena and I know that French
saw a leucistic hyena in the Mara so

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:32.490
saw a leucistic hyena in the Mara so
 

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:33.740
saw a leucistic hyena in the Mara so
that would be really really interesting

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:33.750
that would be really really interesting
 

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:35.000
that would be really really interesting
in fact it'd be great to see a picture

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:35.010
in fact it'd be great to see a picture
 

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.770
in fact it'd be great to see a picture
of that because I don't know if you guys

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:36.780
of that because I don't know if you guys
 

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.650
of that because I don't know if you guys
have noticed but pretties bigger Cup

01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:39.660
have noticed but pretties bigger Cup
 

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.380
have noticed but pretties bigger Cup
looks really really pale so it'd be

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:42.390
looks really really pale so it'd be
 

01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:44.990
looks really really pale so it'd be
interesting to know if maybe that could

01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000
interesting to know if maybe that could
 

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.030
interesting to know if maybe that could
be a logistic Cup though everything else

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040
be a logistic Cup though everything else

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:03.460
specifically to the Kruger can be about
 

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:08.010
specifically to the Kruger can be about
150 kilometers squared so that is that

01:28:08.010 --> 01:28:08.020
150 kilometers squared so that is that
 

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.650
150 kilometers squared so that is that
is a big big space and I think that's

01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:10.660
is a big big space and I think that's
 

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:14.610
is a big big space and I think that's
that's something that's more more

01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:14.620
that's something that's more more
 

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.030

think that this clan occupies that kind

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:21.220
think that this clan occupies that kind
 

01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:23.640
think that this clan occupies that kind
of space I really don't think so but

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:23.650
of space I really don't think so but
 

01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:25.410

carcass cheetah and some jackals to come

02:00:38.850 --> 02:00:38.860
carcass cheetah and some jackals to come
 

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:43.439
carcass cheetah and some jackals to come
in and take what I actually say I could

02:00:43.439 --> 02:00:43.449
in and take what I actually say I could
 

02:00:43.449 --> 02:00:45.180
in and take what I actually say I could
only assume it would be a Thomson's

02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:45.190
only assume it would be a Thomson's
 

02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:47.819
only assume it would be a Thomson's
gazelle or some small antelope that they

02:00:47.819 --> 02:00:47.829
gazelle or some small antelope that they
 

02:00:47.829 --> 02:00:50.490
gazelle or some small antelope that they
have but as I said this a tall grass is

02:00:50.490 --> 02:00:50.500
have but as I said this a tall grass is
 

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:58.830
have but as I said this a tall grass is
making it a bit difficult just move

02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840
making it a bit difficult just move
 

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.839
making it a bit difficult just move
around a little bit further so you get

02:01:00.839 --> 02:01:00.849
around a little bit further so you get
 

02:01:00.849 --> 02:01:11.060
around a little bit further so you get
better angle

02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:11.070
 

02:01:11.070 --> 02:01:14.120
so I was expecting cab cubs but it's

02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:14.130
so I was expecting cab cubs but it's
 

02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:20.060
so I was expecting cab cubs but it's
actually just a yes a sub-adult how's

02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:20.070
actually just a yes a sub-adult how's
 

02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:24.080
actually just a yes a sub-adult how's
that good cool so this one is really

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:24.090
that good cool so this one is really
 

02:01:24.090 --> 02:01:33.890
that good cool so this one is really

now I'm not sure as to the
 

02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:42.460
now I'm not sure as to the
identification of these cheetahs

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:42.470
 

02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:45.140
obviously this one here is a relatively

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:45.150

02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:30.719
can't see behind me and it is night time
I don't wanted to do anything to disturb

02:30:30.719 --> 02:30:30.729
 

02:30:30.729 --> 02:30:34.080
the animals so just bear with me for two

02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:34.090
the animals so just bear with me for two
 

02:30:34.090 --> 02:30:54.841
the animals so just bear with me for two
seconds

02:30:54.841 --> 02:30:54.851
 

02:30:54.851 --> 02:30:57.640
so it seems like the cheetah may have

02:30:57.640 --> 02:30:57.650
so it seems like the cheetah may have
 

02:30:57.650 --> 02:31:01.541
so it seems like the cheetah may have
retreated off the carcass is that was

02:31:01.541 --> 02:31:01.551
retreated off the carcass is that was
 

02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:03.401
retreated off the carcass is that was
that the other cheater or a jackal over

02:31:03.401 --> 02:31:03.411
that the other cheater or a jackal over
 

02:31:03.411 --> 02:31:09.131
that the other cheater or a jackal over
here to the left ah yes

02:31:09.131 --> 02:31:09.141
here to the left ah yes
 

02:31:09.141 --> 02:31:12.911
here to the left ah yes
so seems like the Jackals may have won

02:31:12.911 --> 02:31:12.921
so seems like the Jackals may have won
 

02:31:12.921 --> 02:31:16.600
so seems like the Jackals may have won
this one actually they have moved away

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:16.610
this one actually they have moved away
 

02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:19.690
this one actually they have moved away
now I'm just gonna get my flashlight out

02:31:19.690 --> 02:31:19.700
now I'm just gonna get my flashlight out
 

02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:21.401
now I'm just gonna get my flashlight out
and see if I can relocate the carcass to

02:31:21.401 --> 02:31:21.411
and see if I can relocate the carcass to
 

02:31:21.411 --> 02:31:26.980
and see if I can relocate the carcass to
see if there is yeah okay so just to my

02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:26.990
see if there is yeah okay so just to my
 

02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:30.121
see if there is yeah okay so just to my
right we can see the Jackals have

02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:30.131
right we can see the Jackals have
 

02:31:30.131 --> 02:31:36.451
right we can see the Jackals have
managed to get themselves in Wow

02:31:36.451 --> 02:31:36.461
managed to get themselves in Wow
 

02:31:36.461 --> 02:31:39.911
managed to get themselves in Wow
incredible stuff absolutely incredible

02:31:39.911 --> 02:31:39.921
incredible stuff absolutely incredible
 

02:31:39.921 --> 02:31:43.451
incredible stuff absolutely incredible
so don't feel bad for the cheetah they

02:31:43.451 --> 02:31:43.461
so don't feel bad for the cheetah they
 

02:31:43.461 --> 02:31:46.690
so don't feel bad for the cheetah they
did get their field the little one was

02:31:46.690 --> 02:31:46.700
did get their field the little one was
 

02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:51.480
did get their field the little one was
snacking away for quite a while there

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:51.490
 

02:31:51.490 --> 02:31:57.241
how crazy is this

02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:57.251
 

02:31:57.251 --> 02:32:03.190
well accolades to the jackals for the

02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200
well accolades to the jackals for the
 

02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:06.190
well accolades to the jackals for the
point food and clothes you know he's

02:32:06.190 --> 02:32:06.200
point food and clothes you know he's
 

02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:08.261
point food and clothes you know he's
cheated off the mother was doing a great

02:32:08.261 --> 02:32:08.271
cheated off the mother was doing a great
 

02:32:08.271 --> 02:32:10.541
cheated off the mother was doing a great
job of keeping them away with being with

02:32:10.541 --> 02:32:10.551
job of keeping them away with being with
 

02:32:10.551 --> 02:32:12.461
job of keeping them away with being with
this carcass for about 20 minutes or

02:32:12.461 --> 02:32:12.471
this carcass for about 20 minutes or
 

02:32:12.471 --> 02:32:15.041
this carcass for about 20 minutes or
half an hour and the jackals had made a

02:32:15.041 --> 02:32:15.051
half an hour and the jackals had made a
 

02:32:15.051 --> 02:32:18.310
half an hour and the jackals had made a
few attempts to get towards it but every

02:32:18.310 --> 02:32:18.320
few attempts to get towards it but every
 

02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:20.531
few attempts to get towards it but every
time they got the chased off looks like

02:32:20.531 --> 02:32:20.541
time they got the chased off looks like
 

02:32:20.541 --> 02:32:21.881
time they got the chased off looks like
there may even be a little bit of

02:32:21.881 --> 02:32:21.891
there may even be a little bit of
 

02:32:21.891 --> 02:32:29.970
there may even be a little bit of
dispute amongst the Jackals themselves

02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:29.980
 

02:32:29.980 --> 02:32:32.250
Cathy I don't think the cheaters would

02:32:32.250 --> 02:32:32.260
Cathy I don't think the cheaters would
 

02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:35.551
Cathy I don't think the cheaters would
ever eat the Jackals would probably

02:32:35.551 --> 02:32:35.561
ever eat the Jackals would probably
 

02:32:35.561 --> 02:32:38.301
ever eat the Jackals would probably
prefer a nice at Thompson's gazelle

02:32:38.301 --> 02:32:38.311
prefer a nice at Thompson's gazelle
 

02:32:38.311 --> 02:32:40.980
prefer a nice at Thompson's gazelle
cheetah and jackals are both carnivores

02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:40.990
cheetah and jackals are both carnivores
 

02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:44.040
cheetah and jackals are both carnivores
so they will compete for food but they

02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:44.050
so they will compete for food but they
 

02:32:44.050 --> 02:32:46.801
so they will compete for food but they
will most likely not eat one another

02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:46.811
will most likely not eat one another
 

02:32:46.811 --> 02:32:48.930
will most likely not eat one another
perhaps in desperate situations if they

02:32:48.930 --> 02:32:48.940
perhaps in desperate situations if they
 

02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.940
perhaps in desperate situations if they
did come across a dead jackal

02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:50.950
did come across a dead jackal
 

02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:58.230
did come across a dead jackal
but I highly doubt it Kristin that is

02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240
but I highly doubt it Kristin that is
 

02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.480
but I highly doubt it Kristin that is
very likely that all of that commotion

02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:00.490
very likely that all of that commotion
 

02:33:00.490 --> 02:33:02.280
very likely that all of that commotion
and noise made by the jackals could

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:02.290
and noise made by the jackals could
 

02:33:02.290 --> 02:33:06.301
and noise made by the jackals could
bring in other scavengers it may have

02:33:06.301 --> 02:33:06.311
bring in other scavengers it may have
 

02:33:06.311 --> 02:33:10.020
bring in other scavengers it may have
been heard by some hyenas yes I through

02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:10.030
been heard by some hyenas yes I through
 

02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:12.390
been heard by some hyenas yes I through
think that it may throughout the night

02:33:12.390 --> 02:33:12.400
think that it may throughout the night
 

02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:15.960
think that it may throughout the night
have attracted some more attention and

02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:15.970
have attracted some more attention and
 

02:33:15.970 --> 02:33:18.421
have attracted some more attention and
so it will be interesting at UC at what

02:33:18.421 --> 02:33:18.431
so it will be interesting at UC at what
 

02:33:18.431 --> 02:33:20.970
so it will be interesting at UC at what
it does unfold over this carcass then

02:33:20.970 --> 02:33:20.980
it does unfold over this carcass then
 

02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:23.220
it does unfold over this carcass then
maybe yeah as I said some bigger hyenas

02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:23.230
maybe yeah as I said some bigger hyenas
 

02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:25.740
maybe yeah as I said some bigger hyenas
come through to chase the jackal off but

02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:25.750
come through to chase the jackal off but
 

02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:28.650
come through to chase the jackal off but
I didn't get to have a good look at the

02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:28.660
I didn't get to have a good look at the
 

02:33:28.660 --> 02:33:30.600
I didn't get to have a good look at the
carcass so I wasn't sure exactly what it

02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:30.610
carcass so I wasn't sure exactly what it
 

02:33:30.610 --> 02:33:32.940
carcass so I wasn't sure exactly what it
was I'm guessing it is a small antelope

02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:32.950
was I'm guessing it is a small antelope
 

02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:38.100
was I'm guessing it is a small antelope
of some sort so perhaps it might just be

02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:38.110
of some sort so perhaps it might just be
 

02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:39.750
of some sort so perhaps it might just be
enough to feed the jackal and it wasn't

02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760
enough to feed the jackal and it wasn't
 

02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:42.210
enough to feed the jackal and it wasn't
pretty well it fed on as well while we

02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:42.220
pretty well it fed on as well while we
 

02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:44.881
pretty well it fed on as well while we
were with it but yes there is every

02:33:44.881 --> 02:33:44.891
were with it but yes there is every
 

02:33:44.891 --> 02:33:47.131
were with it but yes there is every
chance that the noise could attract

02:33:47.131 --> 02:33:47.141
chance that the noise could attract
 

02:33:47.141 --> 02:33:53.980
chance that the noise could attract
other scavengers throughout the night

02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:53.990
 

02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:57.230
so a little bit of knock enos going on

02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240
so a little bit of knock enos going on
 

02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:03.290
so a little bit of knock enos going on
there between them I'll just move up two

02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:03.300
there between them I'll just move up two
 

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.179
there between them I'll just move up two
wards at the caucus a little bit so we

02:34:05.179 --> 02:34:05.189
wards at the caucus a little bit so we
 

02:34:05.189 --> 02:34:32.801
wards at the caucus a little bit so we
can try and get a better look

02:34:32.801 --> 02:34:32.811
 

02:34:32.811 --> 02:34:35.900
Sally is happier for the Jackals that

02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:35.910
Sally is happier for the Jackals that
 

02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:37.761
Sally is happier for the Jackals that
they got some food is saying way to go

02:34:37.761 --> 02:34:37.771
they got some food is saying way to go
 

02:34:37.771 --> 02:34:39.921
they got some food is saying way to go
I'm actually kind of thinking the same

02:34:39.921 --> 02:34:39.931
I'm actually kind of thinking the same
 

02:34:39.931 --> 02:34:42.470
I'm actually kind of thinking the same
just because the cheaters did get a good

02:34:42.470 --> 02:34:42.480
just because the cheaters did get a good
 

02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:46.070
just because the cheaters did get a good
feeding I yeah it was a nice little win

02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080
feeding I yeah it was a nice little win
 

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:48.350
feeding I yeah it was a nice little win
to see actually I do love a black back

02:34:48.350 --> 02:34:48.360
to see actually I do love a black back
 

02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:51.560
to see actually I do love a black back
jackals if anybody was joining us in our

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:51.570
jackals if anybody was joining us in our
 

02:34:51.570 --> 02:34:53.480
jackals if anybody was joining us in our
regular broadcast just before you were

02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:53.490
regular broadcast just before you were
 

02:34:53.490 --> 02:34:54.950
regular broadcast just before you were
the scene at the one though I was

02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960
the scene at the one though I was
 

02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:57.051
the scene at the one though I was
following along the road they're such

02:34:57.051 --> 02:34:57.061
following along the road they're such
 

02:34:57.061 --> 02:34:59.750
following along the road they're such
brave animals they don't often run in

02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760
brave animals they don't often run in
 

02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:05.500
brave animals they don't often run in
the face of danger and a very very

02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:05.510
the face of danger and a very very
 

02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:09.591
the face of danger and a very very
confident around bigger animals as we

02:35:09.591 --> 02:35:09.601
confident around bigger animals as we
 

02:35:09.601 --> 02:35:19.520
confident around bigger animals as we
just saw then

02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:19.530
 

02:35:19.530 --> 02:35:22.960
we have one that's just scampered off

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:22.970
we have one that's just scampered off
 

02:35:22.970 --> 02:35:26.150
we have one that's just scampered off
I'm just gonna have a quick look and see

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160
I'm just gonna have a quick look and see
 

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:28.940
I'm just gonna have a quick look and see
if I can see if the cheetah is still

02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:28.950
if I can see if the cheetah is still
 

02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:35.540
if I can see if the cheetah is still
inside okay so they are over there all

02:35:35.540 --> 02:35:35.550
inside okay so they are over there all
 

02:35:35.550 --> 02:35:38.700
inside okay so they are over there all
righty well

02:35:38.700 --> 02:35:38.710
 

02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:41.670
just

02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680
 

02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:43.830
I'll just move a little bit closer so we

02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840
I'll just move a little bit closer so we
 

02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:45.719
I'll just move a little bit closer so we
can see they're jackals actually feeding

02:35:45.719 --> 02:35:45.729
can see they're jackals actually feeding
 

02:35:45.729 --> 02:35:48.179
can see they're jackals actually feeding
and then I'll go back over to those

02:35:48.179 --> 02:35:48.189
and then I'll go back over to those
 

02:35:48.189 --> 02:35:50.399
and then I'll go back over to those
cheetah who just a little bit up the

02:35:50.399 --> 02:35:50.409
cheetah who just a little bit up the
 

02:35:50.409 --> 02:35:52.819
cheetah who just a little bit up the
road from it will not up the road up the

02:35:52.819 --> 02:35:52.829
road from it will not up the road up the
 

02:35:52.829 --> 02:36:16.631
road from it will not up the road up the
aftergrass from us

02:36:16.631 --> 02:36:16.641
 

02:36:16.641 --> 02:36:20.890
Lynne yes so cheetah are very wary of

02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:20.900
Lynne yes so cheetah are very wary of
 

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:23.200
Lynne yes so cheetah are very wary of
other predators and definitely don't

02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:23.210
other predators and definitely don't
 

02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:26.051
other predators and definitely don't
want to be injured so she just really do

02:36:26.051 --> 02:36:26.061
want to be injured so she just really do
 

02:36:26.061 --> 02:36:31.570
want to be injured so she just really do
rely on their body and their speed stay

02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:31.580
rely on their body and their speed stay
 

02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:45.690
rely on their body and their speed stay
quite well this disabilities going on

02:36:45.690 --> 02:36:45.700
 

02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:48.480
but yes so they really do not want to

02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:48.490
but yes so they really do not want to
 

02:36:48.490 --> 02:36:50.340
but yes so they really do not want to
risk injury so you'll see they are very

02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:50.350
risk injury so you'll see they are very
 

02:36:50.350 --> 02:36:53.580
risk injury so you'll see they are very
timid towards other attacks especially

02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:53.590
timid towards other attacks especially
 

02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:57.780
timid towards other attacks especially
around carcasses and yeah they really do

02:36:57.780 --> 02:36:57.790
around carcasses and yeah they really do
 

02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:00.810

rely on their body functioning it

02:37:00.810 --> 02:37:00.820
rely on their body functioning it
 

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:04.400
rely on their body functioning it
normally in order to be able to make

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:04.410

02:37:04.410 --> 02:37:06.990

survival for themselves to be able to

02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000

survival for themselves to be able to
feed and move around find mates on water

02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:12.630
feed and move around find mates on water

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:20.730
so an injury out here can really really
can mean death in many cases for an

02:37:20.730 --> 02:37:20.740
can mean death in many cases for an
 

02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:24.210
can mean death in many cases for an
animal especially a delicate animal like

02:37:24.210 --> 02:37:24.220

speed rather than for power and strength
and so can be hurt quite easily

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:36.130
and so can be hurt quite easily
 

02:37:36.130 --> 02:37:38.460
