Speaker 1:          00:03          You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio W and Y C o n n p,

Speaker 2:          00:15          ah,

Speaker 1:          00:17          are live at the Fitzgerald Theater and shape.

Speaker 3:          00:20          Paul, Minnesota.

Speaker 4:          00:29          October 30th, 1938 on that night, the United States experienced a kind of mass hysteria the we'd never seen before. And the reason which today sounds almost comical was a radio play

Speaker 5:          00:45          tell me I did say to him was that Orson wells and the mercury set her on the air and the water of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:56          around 12 million people were listening. Most got the joke. It was Halloween after all. But if you consider that about one out of every 12 people didn't get the joke. That's what surveys found afterwards about one out of every 12 people who heard the broadcast thought it was true and that some percentage of that 1 million people ran out of their homes, towels over their faces, clutching children, tripping, breaking limbs will. That constitutes a major freak out. [inaudible] and in this, our first ever live hour on radio lab here at Saint Paul, Minnesota at the Fitzgerald Theater. We ask why, why do people panic? And of course we'll ask the big question as well, which is Canaan happened again. I'm Jad I've been rod, thank you all for coming in.

Speaker 3:          01:47          Where is my coat?

Speaker 1:          01:54          So let me, let me just say at the outset, I'm just a tiny bit of puzzle before you do it, just tell it. Tell everyone who you are. I, yeah, I'm Robert. Can you just say Robert Krulwich, which is my name. And uh, uh, with all due respect, I mean if we had any number of things we could have done in the hour and could have done sex lives of watermelons or something interesting about chrysanthemums, I don't know why choose a Martian invasion radio show from 1938 old, old, old. I'm thinking, I can't believe you wait till now to ask me a question. I'm just thinking. So some of them might be thinking, you know, old, old,

Speaker 4:          02:27          no, I'm gay. Well, I guess it's a valid question you ask. Truth is, I actually only discovered the war of the worlds recently in a 2001 kind of late 2001 actually not long after that day in 2001 and it just really struck me and it wasn't so much that the broadcast had a kind of end of the World Nis that I guess we were all feeling in real life at that moment, but it was more just the way that the, the story unfolded step by step by step and how in the broadcast you feel like you were lost inside a newscast, which is not unlike what it was like. Yeah, we were all glued to the TV and real life grasping at these pieces of news, trying to figure out what was going on. And that was very much, I think what they were trying to create in the broadcast.

Speaker 4:          03:15          But now, many years later, what I'm really left with is a question, what? Well, if I were alive in 1938 in front of the radio and I heard this sounds, what would I have thought would I have believed it would have not believed? I mean, I don't know. What about you? I don't really know. I don't really know. I Dunno. Okay, let's do something. Just start us off here. Let's actually go back to 1938 and see if we can figure out how these sounds landed on people's ears and what information they had in their heads. So, and I need your help with this. How would I help with that? I want you to go over to that seat right there. That's, we're going to call that seat in 1938 all right. There Nike. Okay. Now just, let's just all imagine there you are on your easy chair. You're maybe drinking a cream soda. Let's tune the dial. Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:11          Trying to find something here. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:31          Raymond Ruck. Hello, who is Rick Mark,

Speaker 6:          04:33          you know a Raymond ruck. Hello.

Speaker 3:          04:36          The thoughts of the Fetish Raymont recolor lead dog with lower cupboard.

Speaker 4:          04:44          You don't know that there's no such person as Ramon Rick. Hello. And that it's just a record in a CBS studio, but it sounds professional enough. So you sit back, you relax. But then later

Speaker 3:          05:16          we're not. We're telling you to the music of Ramrod Kelo playing for you in the Meridian Room or the Park Plaza Hotel situated in downtown New York.

Speaker 4:          05:28          So at this point you think

Speaker 6:          05:30          I'm thinking explosions on Mars, hydrogen gas moving towards earth. A little strange, but how could it be so bad if I still get to listen to the fabulous nodes at the lovely Raymond that color

Speaker 4:          05:41          and he does continue to play for another minute, 34 seconds.

Speaker 3:          05:45          But then it happens again. Ladies and gentleman following on the news, given an odd bullet in the moment of golf, the government media or logical bureau has requested the Lord.

Speaker 4:          05:54          No. Before we go any further there for, are we going to get further? Let me ask a really basic question here. I mean, we're dealing with a play, a radio play. Yeah. Why would Orson wells in his posse of of troubadours start their play this way?

Speaker 1:          06:07          The original hg wells story was written in 1898 so it was really an old book at the time. And there, there is no reporter character in the book. By the way, does everybody know this word? The world story. And most people do. The story basically is this little green creatures from Mars for a number of reasons having to do with thirst or something, have to leave their planet and they come to Earth. They're not very nice people. They invade, they destroy quite a number of us. And then ironically in the end they get killed by little viruses, our smallest inhabitants of our planet, bite them and destroy them. And it's science fiction of course. But in 1938 most kids knew this story. It was very popular. So I don't see why.

Speaker 4:          06:47          Right? And in fact, let me bring in a clip from a Orson wells producer at the time, John Houseman,

Speaker 7:          06:52          uh, Austin and I chose it. We decided the time had come, we should be doing a science fiction show. I'm so, we tried a few of that one. Very easy to do,

Speaker 4:          07:01          do in just a few days before they had to be on the air with their next installment. John Houseman pulls that book off the shelf to shows it to o w says, Hey, what about this? And Orson Welles says this, you want me to do this?

Speaker 7:          07:14          Well, he, uh, had trouble in what sense? In the sense of the design, you said it was dough. No, he told it he was boring. Uh, if it was something that happened 50 years ago, everybody knows it didn't happen. So, uh, who the hell care, right?

Speaker 4:          07:30          If we're going to make people care about this old story, we've got updated not 18, 98 and 1938. And it just so happened that one month prior, something had happened that forever changed the world. Ban The news. The wall was that we'll begin with the, this,

Speaker 3:          07:47          the, my, my [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          07:54          Hitler was threatening Europe first, Austria, then Czechoslovakia World War Two was right around the corner and cvs sent a team of guys to cover the story among them.

Speaker 3:          08:05          Columbia continues with expensive coverage of the European cartoons

Speaker 4:          08:08          and in September, Moreau and his CBS producers did something with the news that was kind of novel. The broke in.

Speaker 8:          08:16          We interrupt this program of music by Harry James and his orchestra to bring you a bullet in just received. And the w o r new is wrong.

Speaker 4:          08:22          No, this had happened before but never quite liked this with live reports, eye witness accounts, and never quite so much

Speaker 8:          08:29          square up in broadcast and bring it up in part in the [inaudible] night of prep

Speaker 4:          08:32          in just one month. These bulletins have become so numerous. Yeah, interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast. That bulletins were practically interrupting bulletin. We interrupted program to bring you with Special Brighton guys. We interrupt this broadcast and to bring her this important bulletin from the United

Speaker 8:          08:45          we interrupt this program to take you to the NBC News Room. Here is a special [inaudible] on the NBC.

Speaker 4:          08:49          So after weeks and weeks of hearing these constant interruptions, it's easy to understand why this [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          08:55          the gentleman following on the news given an odd bullet in the moment of goal, didn't sound like a play, but government media a lot. We have arranged an interview with another astronomer, Professor Pierson.

Speaker 3:          09:24          I don't know whether I need anymore. Raymond. Marcelo, I need to know a little more about this Martian, uh, thing.

Speaker 4:          09:30          Just seeing how slowly it starts. And by the way, um, what time do you got on your, uh, your, uh, fucker watch their, uh, the pocket watch says eight Oh four, eight oh four. Tell me when it gets to eight oh five to what? Eight oh five to eight. Oh five, eight oh five. You know, just let me know. [inaudible] no. Okay. It'll five. This is my favorite minute in understanding one of the greatest media hoaxes of all times. Cause the thing that's interesting is that at this moment in, uh, October of 1938, art, Orson wills and the mercury theater of the air were not that popular. They had a tiny, tiny slice of the audience. And so not too many people were listening. Certainly not at the beginning. From eight o'clock to eight Oh four and so not too many people heard this very important introduction,

Speaker 9:          10:23          the Columbia Broadcasting System and the affiliated station. Was that the war of the world by h g wells?

Speaker 4:          10:29          Well, what, wait, why didn't they hear that? Well, cause at that very same moment, the majority of people listening were tuned into this

Speaker 3:          10:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          10:41          the makers of Jason Sad barn copied is the power of Glam. You know, it's fresh. Resent the chase in San Bono,

Speaker 3:          10:48          um, that chase and Sandborne hour. Now that that was good. That was Ed Bergen. It had the puppet Charlie McCarthy who, who, who liked girls. It was, this was rainy. It was the most popular show at the time, right opposite

Speaker 4:          11:00          three. Theater Theater had 10 times the audience. But at eight oh five host Don Ameche introduces and not so popular singer

Speaker 9:          11:10          and it's the rousing rip roaring song of Vagabond from the Vagabond J.

Speaker 3:          11:16          Aw, you're the Megan [inaudible]. And yesterday moment, thousands, hundreds. We don't know how many listeners started to dial surf.

Speaker 4:          11:32          Where are they landed on the mercury theater of the air already in progress where they stayed.

Speaker 9:          11:37          We are ready now to take your to the principle observatory at Princeton

Speaker 4:          11:40          because by then a strange meteor had landed

Speaker 9:          11:43          where Carl Phillips, our commentator will interview Professor Richard Pearson, famous astronomer. That's it. The IB cannot question at any time but better. No Piping.

Speaker 10:         12:06          Typically Mr Product Guy cannot account for it. I just know.

Speaker 4:          12:11          Yeah, we've had four interruptions now at this point you've called your whole family into the room.

Speaker 1:          12:16          Marge on media is on Mars, March. Meteors what meteors on Mars

Speaker 4:          12:23          and just as you are utterly confused. Along comes the expert, you know, people surveyed afterwards said, I didn't believe this thing. I thought it was all baloney until I heard that government official guy or the a Princeton professor and this script is chocked full of believable experts.

Speaker 10:         12:40          Great. Or the Natural History Museum Professor Endoscopists of the California Astronomical Society. There are General Montgomery Smith, Capitan, Lansing of the signal card.

Speaker 4:          12:48          Maybe subconsciously that had an effect to convince people that something was in fact happening. A feeling furthered a moment later when the professor and uh, the reporter Carl Phillips go live to that field in Grovers mill, New Jersey with that media, right. Or whatever it is. It's landed metal casing is definitely,

Speaker 10:         14:00          yeah. Great. The mouth, that's kind of be shape. What's the lie, but dripping sweat. I hate reenlist lips. Actually

Speaker 4:          14:08          now before we get too far into this, see, let me play you a another clip,

Speaker 11:         14:12          right? You're providing majestically Prada like them. Great. Better,

Speaker 4:          14:16          no doubt. [inaudible] a little bit more

Speaker 11:         14:21          lining the windows. Looking down the road ahead of him. [inaudible] it's my editor. Oh my. Get out of the way, please. If Bernie bursting into flames and it's falling on the mornings, that all the humanity and all the Freebie garage,

Speaker 4:          14:38          this is tape of the Hindenburg crash. Sure. It's still fresh in people's minds. Happened one year before the broadcast, before going on the air that night after Frank Reddick who played that reporter, Carl Phillips in the field, he went to the library, dug up this old tape or not so old and played it to himself.

Speaker 11:         14:54          Oh, the humanity and all the managing all the humanity and all that bad, maybe karate of the humanity and all that faceted. Maybe

Speaker 4:          15:05          get himself in the right frame of mind for that now famous attack scene in that field in New Jersey, the transmission cuts off.

Speaker 3:          15:48          Okay.

Speaker 4:          15:48          12 million people have just heard slithery green aliens. He visceral policemen, farmers and reporters followed by

Speaker 3:          15:58          nothing.

Speaker 9:          16:00          Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grovers mill. Evidently there is some difficulty with our field transmission. However, we will return to that point at the earliest opportunity

Speaker 4:          16:12          and when they do return, what you learn is that that grounded flying saucer that just zapped all those men has now stood up. It's grown legs, it's as tall as a tree and it is marching through the countryside, stopping everything in its path. And then we are taken to field reports, bleive battles, scenes between militia and paws. But before we do, let me play one more clip. This one is real.

Speaker 12:         16:35          If you ran and one of the areas you mentioned or like a child of school age and where did you have an evacuated, you should send him to school tomorrow Friday with hand luggage containing the child's gas mask, a change of under clothing.

Speaker 4:          16:51          This is Edward r Murrow reporting from London. Same time period. Just to give you a sense of how scary it was to be alive at this moment in time, kids in England were being told to take gas masks to school, all of which would have made the following dramatize battle scenes.

Speaker 3:          17:07          Thank you. Now to the field headquarters of the state military, there's Broberg now New Jersey,

Speaker 4:          17:12          all the more real

Speaker 3:          17:17          37 degree up

Speaker 4:          17:24          here. The New Jersey militia fire on a fleet of marsh and pods to no avail. Their sales bounce right off in the Martians in retaliation release a cloud of poisonous gas, which slowly overtake the soldiers

Speaker 9:          17:42          he meet us. He touched you. [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         17:52          ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that that was strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmland tonight are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars.

Speaker 12:         18:12          The Battle of which took place tonight at Grove of mills has ended in one of the most stopping the feet ever suffered by an army in modern times. 7,000 men armed with rifles and machine gun pit it against the single fighting machine of the invaders from Mile 129 survivors. One moment please. Ladies and gentleman now the Bolton from Langenfeld, Virginia. The monster is not in control of the Middle Section of New Jersey and has effectively cut the state through its center highways to the north, south, and West. The clot with frantic human track lease, not army reserves are unable to control the med flight communication lines are down from Pennsylvania to the radio tracks. The tone and service just continue to prevail throughout New Jersey. In eastern Pennsylvania. The Bolton cutting planes report enemy machines. Now three numbers increasing speed north when kicking over house at the same time we take you to Washington, hit the sun was up a nation, the secretary of the interior, I shall not try to conceal the gravitate bullet in it handed me. Pick your way from the doctrine. Doesn't do that

Speaker 3:          19:08          with a cup at the end now, no more defense. Everything wiped out. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          19:37          we don't know exactly how many people panic that night. Here's what we do now. The Trenton Police Department got 2000 calls in under two hours. The New York Times switchboard received 875 calls alone from people wanting to know where they'd be safer

Speaker 1:          19:55          on the roof or in the gas rate shelter in the cellar. We're lucky we do have transcripts of what happened on the other side of radios that night. Thanks to a Princeton sociologist who went out and conducted a series of interviews after the broadcast and what's amazing is how effective that broadcast was. Some listeners said they actually felt like they were choking. Others reported to police that they saw with their own eyes. As they looked at the Manhattan skyline, they saw a thin veil of smoke from the battle over the city. Some said they saw marsh and machine's high stepping their way down the palace aide, splash, splash, splash. Uh, and many people, when they called operators or police, they didn't say, oh my God, we're being invaded by Martians. They said, oh my God, we're being invaded by Germans. Here are some of the literal transcriptions. This is what real people actually said. Everybody ready? I knew it was some Germans trying to gas us all, but when the announcer kept on calling them people from Mars, I just thought he was ignorant. I immediately called up the Maplewood police and asked if there was anything wrong. They answered, we know as much as you do, keep your radio tuned in and follow the announcer's advice.

Speaker 10:         21:07          I called into my husband, Dan, why don't you get dressed? You don't want to die in your working clothes. I looked in his box and saw some chicken left from Sunday dinner that I was saving for Monday night dinner, said to my nephew, we may as well eat this chicken. We walked in here in the morning.

Speaker 12:         21:31          This is Austin Wells, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that the war of the world has no further significant and at the holiday offering it was intended to be. We are not related the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the CBS. You will be relieved. I hope to learn that we didn't mean it and that both institutions are still open for business.

Speaker 4:          21:56          That was how Orson wells concluded the war of the worlds broadcast with those words. Basically it was a joke. Gotcha. But it was only after he and his producer John has been left and read the papers the next day and they understood just how much trouble they had caused [inaudible] because of for at least a couple of hours we believe we were mass murder.

Speaker 13:         22:22          Extremely surprised to learn that I story, which is become familiar to children through the medium of comic strips and a

Speaker 4:          22:30          this as well as in the press conference. That following day,

Speaker 13:         22:33          mini succeeding novels and adventure stories should have had such an immediate and profound effect upon radio listeners.

Speaker 4:          22:42          So immediate and so profound that the FCC Commissioner of the time, George Henry Payne, labeled the Mercury theater of the air, get this terrorists

Speaker 10:         22:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          22:56          radio terrorists.

Speaker 5:          22:58          But there is one thing we must not overlap all this took place in 1938 and our less sophisticated yesterday that did not know the atom bomb guided missiles and rockets that may shortly fly to the Moon Edward

Speaker 10:         23:11          r Murrow in 1957 was he correct when he said that?

Speaker 4:          23:16          Where are we really so on sophisticated in 1938

Speaker 10:         23:20          I mean, it's so different from now. Well, let's see.

Speaker 1:          23:25          Stay with US folks. I'm Robert Krulwich and Jana boom rod. We're alive at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota radio lab will continue.

Speaker 10:         23:33          Just a moment [inaudible].
