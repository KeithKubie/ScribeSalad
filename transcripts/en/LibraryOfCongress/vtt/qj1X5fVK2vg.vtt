00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.830
&gt;&gt; Stacy: Now what I'm going
to do is turn it over to Kurt

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.130
for our third session.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.080
Thank you again.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.060
&gt;&gt; Kurt Helfrich: Thank
you very much, Stacy.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome back, and I do hope

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.360
that you all had an enjoyable
lunchbreak with opportunities

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.090
to see old colleagues
and get to know new ones.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.630
My name is Kurt Helfrich
and I'm an Archivist

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.420
in the National Gallery of
Art's Gallery Archives here

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.470
in Washington, D.C. It is a real
pleasure and honor to be able

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.700
to moderate this session
on access use cases.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.530
Before I introduce today's
speakers I hope you won't mind a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.500
slight digression.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.960
Being here today I am
reminded of a comment made

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.120
by my British colleague,
Charles Hind, at a conference

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.300
on digital design records I
was involved with that was held

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.600
at the Royal Institute

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.070
of British Architects
in London in 2013.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.410
At the end of the conference
Charles challenged us to,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.040
in quotes, show me the uses
by external researchers

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.920
for these digital files
and I will really begin

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.820
to understand their
value, end quote.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.170
Today's speakers
are doing just that.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.820
Through their presentations
they are helping us

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.790
to understand how researchers
are and will be making use

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.030
of not just digital
files, but datasets.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.370
They are also examining
the context

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.300
in which these files are
created as a means for us

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.320
to further understand their
potential research value.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.360
And now I'd like to briefly
introduce today's four speakers.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.680
Please note that more extensive
biographies of them can be found

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
on the Symposium website.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.780
So our first presenter
today is Andrew Witt

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.450
and Andrew is Assistant
Professor in the Practice

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.370
of Architecture at
the Graduate School

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.510
of Design, Harvard University.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.040
Our second presenter
will be Euan Cochrane,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.000
who is the Digital
Preservation Manager

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.510
at Yale University's Library.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.620
Our third presenter
is Matthew Allen,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.920
who is a Doctoral Candidate

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.800
at Harvard University's Graduate
School of Design and teaches

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.930
at the University of Toronto's
John H. Daniel's Faculty

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.350
of Architecture,
Landscape and Design.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.130
Our final and fourth
speaker is Dennis Shelden,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.350
who is Associate
Professor and Director

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.320
of the Digital Building
Laboratory

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.340
at the Georgia Tech School
of Architecture in Atlanta.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.650
We are keeping our speakers
to a tight 15-minute schedule

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.700
to allow time following their
presentations for questions

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.950
from the audience, so
I'm afraid we're going

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.610
to be a bit draconian.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.470
With that, though, I would
like to ask Andrew Witt to come

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.500
up to the podium and
begin his presentation.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.930
Thank you very much.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.420
&gt;&gt; Andrew Witt: So we heard
a lot about structured data

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.720
in the first half a day.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm going to go in exactly the
opposite direction and talk

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.690
about a lot of unstructured
data and ways to deal with that,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.790
or semi-structured data
I guess I would say.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.830
So the expanded intellectual and
technical scope of architecture

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.810
in the 20th and 21st Centuries
has drawn architects the use

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.280
of automation to organize and
scale information and work.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.790
Automation includes both
commercial authoring software

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.650
and the customized
scripts and softwares

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.210
that designers, themselves,
create.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.480
These methods encapsulate or
black box domain knowledge

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.680
to be applied automatically.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
And I showed this
image just to mention

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.680
like in a previous life
Dennis and I worked together

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.960
at Deerey Technologies
and I curated this sort

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.470
of like portion of this massive
retrospective of the provenance

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.960
of Frank Deerey's use of
technology, and so a lot

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.270
of my perspective is
shaped by like digging

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.570
through those archives
and trying

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.980
to reassemble what actually
went on when those things were,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.680
when those buildings
were being put together.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.150
So scripting has significantly
impacted how design is developed

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.590
and, thus, how historians must
understand digital documents.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.460
So here I'm going to propose
three implications of that.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.470
First, source code as
a historical document.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.710
Second, digital forensics,
and I realized actually

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.570
after the first session that
I'm using this term forensics

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.000
in a slightly different way
than the sort of technical term

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.230
of art sense, but
we'll get into that.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.510
And, third, AI archival agents.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.100
Ultimately the possibility is
that historians, themselves,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.290
might script their own tools
to understand these documents

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.420
and at the frontiers of this
possibility are the applications

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.560
of things like sentiment
analysis, machine vision,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.540
artificial intelligence to crawl
archives, yes, to crawl archives

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.340
and sort of make sense
of them at a large scale.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.660
So this is a video
of a textual analysis

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.640
of important theoretical text

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.340
from the '60s called
the pattern language.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.610
It applies sentiment
analysis ideas

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.820
to theoretical architectural
text and then compares them

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.350
to understand who is being
sort of the most polemic,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.550
the most sort of like unbiased,
and the most sort of hyperbolic.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.200
So computational processes
in design have given rise

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.020
to new kinds of collateral
documents,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.560
and one potentially very
rich new archive, obviously,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.840
these scripts and
code bases themselves

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.080
for the applications
developed specifically

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.950
for design projects.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.290
The language in which code
is written, the organization

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.080
of its components, the subject
domains of the external modules

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.890
that it draws on, all of these
reveal certain proclivities

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.710
in the way that designers choose
to organize technical knowledge.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.690
And it suggests how
designers, themselves,

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.540
might feel about how
architectural practice might

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.950
evolve in the future.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.010
So each of them are sort of
like putting a stake in the sand

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.480
about how they think the
discipline should evolve.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.180
So let's contrast two projects
that are actually drawn

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.190
from the CCA's digital
archive --

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.990
Mark Goldfarb's [assumed
spelling] hypo surface

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.810
and Chuck Hoberman's iris dome.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.250
So we'll begin with
the iris dome.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.520
So both of these projects are
large geometrically complex

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.320
kinematic installations

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920
with very sophisticated
mechanical systems.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.590
Both are composed of hundreds
of custom moving parts

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.890
and they both relied

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.030
on extensive scripted automation
directed by the designer.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.980
But the distinction
between the use of scripting

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.130
and automation is I
think very revealing,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.790
so we'll begin with Hoberman.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.090
So Hoberman's archive preserves

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.810
about 74 distinct scripts
developed in the lisp language

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.640
of AutoCAD, so any
of you who have been

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.300
around for a little while
that probably takes you back.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.600
These scripts were
used to layout

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.900
and draw the mechanical
components

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.900
of his complex assemblies
and, thus,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.850
were reused on multiple
projects.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.020
It became a sort of
repository for knowledge reuse.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.320
It became a way to automate

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.590
and parametrically adapt
certain aspects of the design.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.230
And on the dome project
Hoberman had

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.840
about 12 different specific
scripts for that project

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.520
and about 52 drawing files.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.290
So as a general rule maybe like
20% of the design intelligence

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.620
of the project was
embedded in the source code.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.980
So Hoberman developed
these tools as pragmatic,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.120
on a pragmatic and
on demand basis

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.160
to address very specific
problems, so it's really obvious

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.530
when you're reading
through these

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.860
that he wrote them himself,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.540
he didn't really
document them extensively,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.840
if you know anything

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.670
about source code there were
very, very few comments.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.920
And the way in which they're
written is kind of like it's raw

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.190
in a way, but it's
also very adaptable.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.490
They're written in a code style

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.510
which suggests a very
specific single author and user

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.780
and very sort of like targeted
and tactical applications.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.710
So Mark Goldfarb's approach

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.260
to hypo surface was
quite different.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.400
It was a single and
unique project,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.320
a significant monumental
project,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.620
but a single project nonetheless

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.750
and there was no
knowledge with use per se.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.910
Instead there was
a need through code

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.330
to manage a complex
collaboration structure.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.370
So the project demanded
support from a range

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.910
of unusual consultants,
people like mathematicians,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.500
megatronics experts, pneumatics
engineers, rubber researchers.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.860
So architects are no
strangers to collaboration,

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.040
but these particular domains
were quite I would say foreign

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.040
to typical architecture
practice.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.070
So the single software
application became one

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.450
of the templates for managing
that collaborative knowledge.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.870
So, yes, there wasn't
knowledge use per se,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.240
and so there was a need
to manage these domains.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.940
So the software components
were developed

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.670
by Goldfarb's team members,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.520
primarily Zaviae Rubitai
[assumed spelling],

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.950
who is sort of like
listed in this organogram.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.210
And instead of a flat list of
the spoke scripts as you have

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.500
in Hoberman's case the hypo
service team hierarchically

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.500
combined componentized libraries
into more extensive packages

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.850
and a single coordinated
software.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.080
So you have a more
hierarchical organization,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.690
which essentially mirrors
the project team structure.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.290
So mathematical,
mechanical, electrical control

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.200
and design parameters all
coexisted in the software.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.040
It wasn't intended actually
to automate the design

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.980
of the hypo surface,
as in Hoberman's case,

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.830
but instead to automate
its control

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.130
and in particular the motion

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.760
of the hundreds of
linear actuators.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.780
So here in this exploded
assay you can see

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.390
where those linear
actuators fall.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.690
And I think it's kind

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.990
of interesting is you
have the layers of sort

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.290
of like electrical control,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.920
sort of like this very
specific this spoke rubber,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.740
the actuators themselves,
and the architecture kind

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.050
of like mirrors in a
certain way the script

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.350
organization actually.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:32.090
Yes, so Hoberman and Golfarb's
approaches illustrate two

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.960
architype of different
approaches to code.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.930
The artisan computational
designer, maybe in the case

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.770
of Hoberman, on the one hand

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.380
and the organization
builder on the other.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.980
One effectively synthesizes
knowledge,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.580
synthesizes that knowledge him
or herself, so Hoberman was sort

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.420
of like a sculptor, an
architect and an engineer.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.190
The other is a means, the
other uses code as a means

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.490
of knowledge synthesis.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.500
So both are kind of
forerunners in a certain way

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.020
of approaches that we see today.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.480
Now computers are not
only geometry producers,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.680
but they're also
recorders, obviously.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.560
So a digitally conceived
drawing is, in fact,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.430
just an automatic
log of transactions.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.280
And the operations recorded
therein are sometimes atomically

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.660
stamped with things
like time, location,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.010
and authorship information.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.760
The automatic nature of digital
recording can actually be a tool

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.280
for very interesting forensic
reconstruction processes.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.740
So a curious quality of these
particular kinds of sequences

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.050
of operation is that they record
chronologically not only human

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.910
authorship, but also
the sequence

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.560
of certain algorithmic
processes.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.390
So I should mention
there's some great work here

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.020
from Jona Rhys Meyers and
Renbe [assumed spelling],

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.620
who were involved
with this project.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.870
So different software
generates the same dome

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.080
in different ways
leading to distinct

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.520
and characteristic
operational footprints.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.520
For example, this diagram
compares a different programs

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.390
log operationally sequences
in slightly different ways.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.530
&gt;&gt; Five minutes, so.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.970
&gt;&gt; Andrew Witt: Really, okay.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.570
My stopwatch says
differently, but maybe.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.370
Thanks to the journaled
and sequential nature

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.090
of digital design files we
can reconstruct the chronology

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.580
of their creation.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.950
So with certain formats, I mean
it's very format particular,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.480
but this allows us to see step

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.800
by step how a designer
modeled the particular form.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.550
It can even allow us to see
gaps, erasures and hesitations.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.820
So here we see the timeline
of a particular Revit file

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.360
and the sort of like
chronological deconstruction

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.660
of that file.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.860
So at the far right you see a
sort of like linear sequence

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.280
of how the designer
actually modeled that file.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.460
So we can visualize
these sequences

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.410
as three dimensional exploitive
econometrics revealing a kind

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.710
of digital column SaaS

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.070
and literally see the
design process unfold.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.660
So this is a matrix of a series
of these kind of exploited axos,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.020
and it's very, you know, it's
revealing in certain cases

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.750
because you begin to understand,
okay, what are the problems

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.500
that the architect sort of
like really labored over,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.590
what are the problems which
were really sort of like done

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.230
as a matter of course,
and we can begin

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:07.770
to interpret priorities in
these sort of expanded drawings.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.440
So, yes, it's possible to track,
journal and visualize authorship

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.360
in real time, just as -- yes,
so it's possible to do this

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.660
in real-time, as well.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.010
So just as our eyes track
irregular cicada patterns,

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.960
designers in the sort of
irregular way also rotate,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.620
flip and work with their models.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.310
I'm not sure how this line
drawing is coming through,

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.740
but essentially this is
a process of modeling

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.550
which has tracked the motions
of the designer, themselves.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.130
So you can see how the
designer manipulates the models.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.520
You can begin to sort of create
this kind of like cyclometrics

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.280
of design purely
from these logs.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.400
And here's another
example of that.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.610
So briefly I want to
mention maybe a new frontier,

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.980
which is kind of alluded
to in the first session.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.020
Advances in techniques from data
science and AI allow us to work

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.420
with these logs and
digital files in new ways.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.100
So often associated
with big data trends

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.500
and machine learning
they're highly relevant

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.730
for less structured
sets of data.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.390
So images that we
might have from as sort

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.420
of like project collateral, sort
of the visual representation

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.980
of models as opposed to
their data representation,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.580
we can begin to scan these
and use machine vision

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.630
to classify them in
historically interesting ways.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.210
So I'll mention an example,
not directly archival

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.080
but with archival implications,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.780
here we see a machine
vision algorithm --

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.270
or, sorry, this is an example
of a façade which the way

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.130
that the human would see
it on the left and the way

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.440
that the machine would
see it on the right,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.860
and from this network
you can sort

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.570
of like prioritize certain kinds
of operations which extract sort

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.650
of invariance about
what this façade means

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.910
and you can use this for very
broad classifications of forms.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.340
So this example is not
directly archivable,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.210
but it has archivable
implications.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.730
This is a machine
vision algorithm,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.440
crawling a New York City
plan and classifying

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.960
by common plan outline of
thousands of buildings.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.620
And so this is the -- you'll
see over time it builds actually

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.560
like this phylogenetic
tree of form,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.900
just from the morphological
characteristics.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.750
And what's interesting about
this is that imagine you were

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.940
to take a museum
archive of visual objects

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.760
or building documents or
façade elements or 3D models

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.110
and ask questions about
how do these, what are all

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.270
of the possible precedents
for this one object?

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.210
This is a way to actually do
that by scaling up machine,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.590
scaling up human intuition into
a sort of machine platform.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.340
And so this is sort of a zoomed
out view of 100,000 buildings

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.050
in central Berlin, so here
you see those buildings sort

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.340
of like clustered by
similarity, and as you move back

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.070
out you begin to see these
kind of like continents of form

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.450
that emerge from
that classification.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.370
So the software draws new
charts of the past that allow us

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.790
to make sense of what we build
holistically and to map all

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.250
of architecture as it were.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.980
We can algorithmically
map our cultural

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.370
heritage comprehensively.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.970
So these are just a couple of
the ways in which new archives,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.640
these new archives, these
files considered almost

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.310
as logs allow us new ways
of addressing questions

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.610
about the design process.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.610
So how do designers organize
and encapsulate knowledge,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.980
how do different
designers draw differently,

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.100
how do designers proceed
in the design process,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.220
and how does the whole catalog

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.340
of built form relate
holistically.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.490
So these examples reveal new
possibilities for the use

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.360
of programmatic information
generated by both the designer

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.330
and the historian to
uncover the heuristic

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.460
and epistemic methods of design.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.510
So I think I got it.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.510
Thank you.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:13.110
[ Applause ]

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.830
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane: I'm going to
talk about emulation for access.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.240
I was asked to talk about
a particular use case.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.400
I can talk about this more
generally, but I'm going to go

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.270
through a particular use case.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.460
This is it, I can't remember
exactly when this was,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.090
but some months ago we had
a small architecture design

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.180
archivist meeting
and symposium at Yale

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.640
and the Architecture School.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.160
And at the time the Academy for
Architecture and the head of,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.240
in collaboration with,
they had an exhibit

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.230
in the Architecture School about
archaeology of the digital.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:55.970
And I worked with Tim Walsh up
at CCA and Susie in the archives

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.680
at Yale to put together
this workstation

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.830
in which the user
can just click into.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.910
And they gave a screen, an HTML
screen like this with a list

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.020
of environments that
they can click on.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.760
Now when they click on those
it loads an emulated version

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.760
of the original environment,
the original computer associated

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.520
with those designer codes
and they can interact

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.900
with them using the
original software.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.600
And I was going to put
some screenshots in here,

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.030
expecting none of this to
work, but I think it is kind

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.430
of working so I will try and
show you what that looks like.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.600
The example I just showed

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.160
in that photo was all
running on a local computer.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.510
It's what we call the reading
room or exhibit implementation

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.910
of this software that we're
using, but it also runs

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.650
in a web browser,
that's the standard way

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.530
to access this emulation
framework.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.280
And I'll talk more about it, but
just to show you what it's like.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.500
For the end user whenever
they want to interact

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.230
with something they get a link
and they click on the link

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.550
and it loads the environment
automatically in the background.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:59.120
So this is Windows
'98, as you'll see.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:07.260
[ Music ]

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.500
Clicked the wrong button there.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.900
Try that again.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.460
Yes, so I'm loading it again,
but Windows, as you saw,

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.380
it's just the click of
a button, it loads up.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.090
And what the user gets presented

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.680
with in this case is
a folder of files.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.670
[music] Right, so this
example is actually

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.970
from Balmori Associates.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.900
We had someone from
there talk this morning.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.780
It's in the archives at Yale.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.920
And if I open this
now it'll open

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.860
in AutoCAD release 14 I think.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:58.340
Right, and I can click that
and you see the diagram.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.100
And you can just interact
with it like you would

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.940
if using the original software,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.260
so in a minute we'll
have you -- and it works.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:12.630
Let's see if I have this on
here while I'm here, so go ahead

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.940
and see if the clip runs.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.700
[laughter] There it goes.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.690
[applause] Right, so
I'll start this one.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.870
Go back to the slides
and start talking

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.020
about this technology briefly.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.740
So emulation is a service is
what's being used to power all

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.810
of this, both the online version
you just saw and the one we had

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:46.220
on the device in the room, the
reading room implementation.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.830
It provides remote access to
preconfigured virtual computers

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.440
that can be accessed
with one click.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.910
It can be done by a web browser

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.920
or in a reading room
environment.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.220
It just requires a web browser,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.800
any modern web browser
can access this.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.100
And one of the best things

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.250
about it is it abstracts
away all the issues

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.680
with configuring emulators from
the end users and even the staff

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.260
and archives and
libraries and so

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.020
on because they can be
preconfigured by experts

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.590
and the user then just needs
to add the content to them

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.980
or the staff maybe can just add
the content, click the button

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.480
and it loads in the
browser for them.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.680
You can also choose to configure
these environments so that

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.330
when an end user
does something inside

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.680
of it it is either saved or not.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.240
And most cases, in most cases
we just say let them save it,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.720
they can do anything,
they can delete things,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.020
they eat it, we don't care.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.320
Because when the next user goes

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.620
to it it'll be exactly
the same as it was before.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:42.320
Oh, talk a little more about how
this configuration happens next,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.780
but another key attribute
of this is

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.040
that you can restrict
interactivity.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.290
So you can make it so that
users can't print anything

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.590
from within the environment.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.610
You can make it so that they
can't download or copy anything

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.910
out of the environment.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.380
The worst a user could do
would be to take a screenshot,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.730
and if you restrict
this to a reading room

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.450
that even becomes less relevant.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.400
And all the emulations
run remotely

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.210
and the users are actually
accessing it via the web browser

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.400
as kind of a remote
desktop tool.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.890
So the process I went through
to configure that workstation

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.200
for the reading room was
somewhat complicated,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.640
and we're doing a lot of work
to automate a lot of this away

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.000
so that other users
that want to use this

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.750
in the future won't have
to go through this process,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.540
but I'll walk you
through it briefly.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.010
So what we do is we
create a basic environment

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.280
and then we add layers
on top of that.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.480
We are actually going a step
further than we might need to.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.890
We're buying original
hardware or getting donations

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.950
and then we're making an
image of the hard drives

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.600
and putting those directly into
the emulation framework so that

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.000
if someone in the future
really wanted to validate

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.290
that the emulation was accurate
they could come and try it

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.760
out on the original
hardware for as long

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.190
as that hardware is
going to be around.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.640
So then we load those into
our emulation framework,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.940
you can see a list here,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.640
and then we just start getting
software to go into those.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.360
I mentioned that software,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.150
here's a slightly
more relevant example

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.280
that I never actually
managed to get working

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.650
because of a hardware dongle,

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.100
and we put that software
in here.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.230
And then we configured that
using the online interface,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.560
just it gets attached as a CD or
whatever to the base environment

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.860
and you just install
the software

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.160
like you normally would.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.460
And then you can click
a button, save it,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.220
and it saves a new environment
with that software installed.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.270
And the way it does that by the
way is it creates a derivative

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.800
of the original environment,
so it only saves the difference

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.770
between that first
master environment

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.300
and whatever you've added to it.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.330
So from a preservation speak
if you don't have the cost

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.630
of replicating all that data

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.820
of the base environment
every time you make a change

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.120
to create a derivative.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.800
Now that process doesn't always
work for this particular setup.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.010
I actually ended up having to
install the software in one case

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.000
on the original computer and
continually image the drive

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.490
as I added more content.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.650
The reason being
that the emulator

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.650
for this particular operating
system didn't allow us

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.720
to change disks while it was
running and to install something

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.730
that was 10 disks I had to do
it on the original computer

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.140
and then image that computer.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.630
So it's not always
that straightforward,

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.930
but we're making progress.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.930
And to fix this particular
problem all that actually needs

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.390
to happen is some
developer needs to add

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.160
that feature to that emulator.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.890
We just haven't got there yet.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.690
Here's some photographs I took.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:36.930
All right, now for the reading
room setup what we had was just

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.970
a little Intel mix unit of
computing, Nook computer,

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.190
what you see in the red box
there, which I first tested

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.750
with some old hardware
plugged into it.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.190
And then I got a little
software running on it

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.680
and I was using more modern
hardware to connect to it.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.350
And then for the actual
exhibit I did what looked

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.700
like older hardware,
but actually in reality

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.980
that little computer is
back there somewhere.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.960
So this was just that computer

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:07.240
on the left there is just
completely doing nothing.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.100
[laughter] So you see
it in the space there,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.130
and there is a little
computer sitting back there

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.830
that people don't see,
so that's just a prop

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.080
for that other computer.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.710
All right, so there are a
lot of challenges with this.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.010
Here's some of them.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.940
Actually I'll show you
a few more in a demo,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.940
which might be more relevant.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.480
Twelve, yes.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.600
Here is -- one second.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.470
This mouse has a
back button on it

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.060
that I keep accidently hitting.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.880
Why don't we try this one.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.320
This was an absolute
pain to configure.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.850
It's AutoCAD release 12 for
Microsoft DOS and just to get it

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.800
to install was crazy,
far too difficult,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.190
but now that it's installed I
can add any content to this.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.610
I can share that environment
with others depending

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.070
on all the intellectual
property challenges,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.960
and then they can add
the content and use this

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.510
to study now that
it's configured.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.540
So in here another
thing we see is that --

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.210
I'm not very good with
the mouse on this.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.510
Is it working still?

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.250
No, I'll just restart that.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.390
What you'll see is that when
you go to open a file in here,

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.430
firstly, you need to know
that there's a menu up there

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.500
and most end users these
days have no clue how

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.390
to use Microsoft DOS software
and would you have known

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.050
to move the mouse up to
the top quadrant to see

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.760
that there's a menu so you
can go and open the file?

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.090
Would you know the command
to open a file in MS DOS?

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.400
That's a challenge, it was
certainly a challenge for me,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.930
and I just happened
to find this.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.230
[laughter] So now
I can go through

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.290
and you'll see the next issue.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.740
I go into the folder that
has the files and open one.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.500
You can't find this file,
which is I believe a font file.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.240
So it turns out after having
a look around in here,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.390
AutoCAD actually
comes with some fonts

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.170
so you can just replace
the one that it's looking

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.940
for with an AutoCAD one.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.300
But this is too difficult,
right?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.170
We can definitely
improve on this.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.250
Either way eventually you
get in here and, whoops.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.700
I'll put a Gothic font in,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.910
and there you go,
there's the D file.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.990
But those kind of issues, the
fact that the object didn't come

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.990
with fonts it reflects
the kind of things

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.820
that were discussed this morning
about modern design environments

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.460
where you have multiple
dependencies

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.610
and if you don't have them all
you may not get the same thing

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.290
that you were expecting
originally.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.330
This has been happening
for a very long time,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.600
including in Microsoft DOS.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.950
Let's see if I can show
you one more thing.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.930
This is slightly less relevant,
but I'm going to show you

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.230
because I tweeted
about it this morning

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.120
and it might be of
some interest.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.250
We have been going through
our general collections

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.090
in the library and imaging all
of our CDs on floppy disks,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.040
which we have far too many,
thousands, and we're going

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.380
to start providing
access to them,

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.590
but our emulation is a service.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.470
This is the configuration
interface you're seeing here.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.900
What we're trying to do is
make this extremely simple

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.900
for configuration and then
we're just going to have a link

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.840
in the catalog for each of them,
and this interface now is able

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.610
to suggest which environments
that CD is likely to run on.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.210
And then configuring staff
then can just test one of them,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.500
and actually what it does is it
scans all the files on the disk.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.640
You can see the file formats
down on the list here.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.380
And it says these file
formats probably run

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.640
on these environments, you
might want to try one of those.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.270
But this one in particular,
the only reason I'm putting it

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.410
up here is because it happens
to have a few design files on it

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.030
which I thought were
kind of interesting.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:44.850
So as a configurem user this
might be the process we would

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.930
use [music] for staff to try
to get an environment set-up

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.000
to provide access to
some end user to some

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.690
of your architectural records.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.330
You would attach them
through the interface

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.380
or you could upload
them or what have you.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.170
And what we should
see is that they end

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.590
up in a CD ROM drive on here.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.580
I could browse that, but I'm
just going to double click

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.520
and open and in this
case it just runs.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.910
And what I would do now if I was
configuring this is I would put

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.000
a link into the start menu,
into the startup area so that

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.420
when the computer starts mix
time it will automatically load

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.960
to the screen, and then all
I do is hit create object

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.990
environment, put in some
metadata and it'll get saved

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:26.840
and you'll get a link back
that you can then provide

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.160
to any users, put in your
catalog and what have you,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.640
and that's as easy as it is,
it's fairly straightforward.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.680
Let's see if there's anything
we need to look at on here.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.890
And right now we have all
sorts of operating systems

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.230
and environments available
preconfigured, but we're going

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.720
to be adding more and more.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.660
So we'll just go
back to the slides.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.140
So, as I've mentioned and shown
a few up there, there are a lot

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.200
of challenges getting
to the point we did

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.080
with just the exhibit
environment.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.060
We had to get all the
hardware and the software,

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.180
configure all the
emulators, configure

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.930
and install the software on
those emulator environments.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.660
We had to deal with DRM,
including just license key

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.110
but also in the case of Form Z I
wasn't able to get that working

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.760
because I had a hardware dongle

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.200
and I couldn't emulate
that at the time.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.850
Intellectual property is
something that's another whole

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:21.000
topic, which I'm sure Brendan
and Peter could answer questions

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.500
about if you have any.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.540
And then there are the issues
of the end user being able

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.160
to use the software,
which I showed you before

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.800
with the DOS example where it's
not intuitive anymore especially

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.700
to the younger folks who have
grown up with touchscreens,

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.800
for example, or mobile
devices, which we are going

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.100
to emulate a little bit of.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.420
We can do early Android on
here which is quite nice.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.330
And then there are, I mean
authenticity, so I don't know

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.910
if I loaded the AutoCAD 2002
environment, but it comes

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.620
up with a whole lot of pop-ups.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.420
And you had a question
should I configure it

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.510
so that they automatically come
up and the user sees what it was

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.260
like or should I configure it so
they don't come up so it's not

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.940
as annoying if you just
want to get to the content?

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.120
And then you need to do things
like export the environments

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.040
if you want to use
them in a reading room.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.590
We're making that easier
so you can configure one

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.890
in the web environment,

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.540
export it so you can
put it on your stick.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.840
By the way, this is all

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.800
that that reading room
environment thing runs off of.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.830
I can plug this into my
laptop and run it off of that.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.550
If I want to export one of those
environments to go on here,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.360
though, we're making it a
little bit easier by making it,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.970
you can just click a
button in the interface.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.270
And then configuring

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.340
that exhibit hardware wasn't
entirely straightforward,

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.460
we had to get the right
dongles to get it up like

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.070
in the old hardware and so on.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.900
All right, one minute.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.450
So we're aiming to
make this really,

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.750
really easy for everybody.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.250
I'm starting some work
soon in collaboration

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.190
with the Software
Preservation Network,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.490
which if you have questions

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.180
about I'm sure Jessica
would be happy to answer.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.910
To basically make it so
that there are a whole set

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.620
of preconfigured emulatable
computers available to anyone

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.580
that wants to participate
in this network of emulation

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:05.170
for service notes that we're
planning on putting together.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.470
And so that you can just
say I've got this file,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.770
give me the right
software to render it,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.730
give me the original software,
and you'll get that back

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.430
in the web browser in
that original software.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.060
Amongst other things,
there's a whole number

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.990
of various things we're going to
be doing with this general idea.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.010
One of the things we would
love to be able to do

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.260
in the future is guide the
user through using the software

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.620
by adding layers on top of
the emulator environments

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.390
to say click here to do this,
you know, scroll here and so on.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.560
And it's a pretty
straightforward thing

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.820
to do technologically,
we just need to get there

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.970
and that's going to take
a little bit longer.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.510
And I mentioned here figures
for software, there's a project

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:44.830
that Brendan and Peter are doing
at the University of Virginia,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.310
which is trying to establish our
rights to do this kind of thing

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.590
from an intellectual
property perspective.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.000
I think we're moving on to the
next person, but I'd be happy

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.300
to answer questions later.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.500
That is my hometown of New
Plymouth in New Zealand

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.960
and the new extension
to the art gallery,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.930
this missile looking
building in the background,

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.710
which I think looks amazing.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:07.510
[laughter] Thank you.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:11.210
[ Applause ]

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.810
&gt;&gt; Matthew Allen: So what
I thought I could bring

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.420
to this particular panel
is a discussion of some

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.720
of the more normal ways

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.200
that a architectural historian
might use the digital archive.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.500
[laughter] So the
projects I'll talk

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.520
about aren't using cutting edge
methods and they weren't carried

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.350
out with a lot of resources.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.430
I wanted to highlight that
the typical conditions

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.920
under which an architectural --

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.290
&gt;&gt; There will be a rebuttal.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.360
[laughter]

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.330
&gt;&gt; Matthew Allen: Especially
I'm thinking in particular

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.570
of historians approaching
a topic

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.620
that they aren't even sure
they want to commit to sort

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.110
of working on and what
they maybe might look

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.410
for in an archive.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:55.010
So I'll discuss three
projects that have led so far

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.570
to three small exhibitions.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.820
The starting point for the first
project was Greg Lynn's [assumed

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.780
spelling] observation about how
software is sometimes visible

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.200
in images of architectural
design.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.060
In this case different
software allows users

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.680
to create different
types of lines or curves.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.790
My question was given a bunch
of images of design projects

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.000
from a certain period
can we infer

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.860
which software was
used to make them?

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.240
Beyond this can we start
to analyze the feedback

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.200
between software and ways of
thinking about architecture?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.440
From the time I spent in
the Exhibition Department

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.750
at the Harvard Graduate
School of Design I knew

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.220
that they had a set of student
projects that they collected

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.460
at the end of every semester.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.820
Because these were just quick
student projects the images were

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.230
not very polished.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.950
The evidence of the software
hadn't been scrubbed away,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.550
so to speak.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.380
This collection was not
really archived, per se.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.080
The computing services team
had done some work putting the

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.590
collection in order,
but what I had to work

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.370
with was essentially a
pile of about 28,000 JPEGs

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:10.590
from about 5,000 projects and
an Excel file with all sorts

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.950
of different metadata.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.850
So knowing that the files were
there I suggested an exhibition

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.760
to the school and
they graciously agreed

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.470
to give me a wall
in the library.

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:25.880
I also proposed linking the
show to research I was doing

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.810
on older software, so the
show became a dual exhibition

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:34.370
on software in the '60s and '70s
and software in the recent past.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.280
Finally, part of the project was

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.250
to more properly archive the
student work so the idea was

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.320
to sort of usher the
work into the library,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.810
both symbolically
and physically.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.110
Because I had a hard drive

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.500
with all the files access was
not particularly difficult.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.550
I made a copy of the files,
renamed them and looked

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.010
at them all with a few
different image viewers.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.460
I tagged them, sorted
them, rearranged them based

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.740
on visual conventions that I
thought that I was interested in

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:07.410
and how I might be able
to use them in the show.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.820
Part of the show was a
wash of all of the images,

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.990
so I wrote a script to shrink
them and combine them together

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.590
and lay them out in a series
of PDF files for printing.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.870
Another section had the
names of all the students --

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:23.920
oh, here's a -- so
this is the wall.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.820
Another section had the names
of all the students involved

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:32.700
so I copied and pasted from
Excel to InDesign for that.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.720
[laughter] Finally, there was a
slide show that pulled out some

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.600
of the images and correlated
them with little bits of text

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:45.670
that sort of analyzed the
visual conventions involved,

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.840
so this slide show was
playing in the library.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.230
This is what the exhibition
looked like in the end.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.800
There was also a little
wall with screenshots

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.380
of current projects that
I solicited from students

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.360
at the school, sort
of a live feed

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.320
of what was happening
upstairs in the school.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.950
I'll also note that my ambition
has been to put this research

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.180
into a sort of field guide
of the visual conventions

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.910
of architectural software
during this period,

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.190
so I was somewhat
rigorous about sort

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.100
of what I was looking
for in these files.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.400
All right, one lesson
from this project begins

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.970
with the observation
that it only worked

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:26.020
because I had unusually
direct access to the files.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.900
I could flip through thousands

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.280
of JPEG files, sort
them, tag them.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.660
It's hard to imagine doing this
without direct access like that.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.950
This was similar to digging

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.810
through physical
archives in some ways.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.030
In both cases we're
confronted with a pile of stuff

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.130
which we can pull things
out from and put it back

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.590
as we want very quickly with
digital files creating this sort

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.830
of hands-on feeling

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.420
of manipulation is
essential I think.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.010
I'd like to imagine that there's
no good reason it can't be made

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.360
possible to check-out
an entire archive

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.330
on an external hard
drive, for example.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:10.410
My point here is that
historians are usually operating

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.630
under a severe time crunch,
especially when deciding whether

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.380
to work on a project or not,
and if it appears difficult

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.650
to get ahold of the files
they may choose not to take

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.980
on the project at all, right?

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.610
Okay, the second project
I'll talk about begins also

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:31.000
with a heap of files, but it
was a more heterogeneous heap.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.710
The occasion for this
research was that an architect,

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.210
Preston Scott Cohen,
was given an opportunity

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.210
to do an exhibition of
a major project of his,

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.950
the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.850
I was asked to help reconstruct
part of the design process

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.800
and I did some of
the preliminary work

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.660
and it was installed at Harvard.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.210
Reconstructing the
design process would seem

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.340
to be relatively
straightforward.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.130
The project was designed by a
small number of people and most

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.430
of them were still around.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.270
It was an entirely
digital project.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.420
A range of models and drawings
from the very beginning

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.580
of the project coexisted in
the firm's project archive,

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.120
so this is sort of a
picture of what you would see

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.860
at the opened -- yes, that
folder on their server.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.300
And it existed in more or
less the same structure

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.460
as when it was being worked on,
so the organization was ad hoc,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.230
let's say, but it
was easy to access.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.050
I just had to go to the
office, plug into the server,

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.180
make a copy, and I could
use it as I wanted.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.200
The problem, of course,
was that it was not

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.710
at all clear what were the
most important documents.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.830
I could gather all the AutoCAD
or Rhino files into one place,

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.300
but it was difficult to know

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.540
which one contained the
important design decisions.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.020
Because my research was destined

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.140
for an exhibition the architect
had some incentive to help,

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.270
of course, so I sat down
with him and went through all

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.810
of the files comparing
differences and trying to figure

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:01.310
out how sort of what changed
between the versions and why.

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.260
So the process involved
a lot of comparison

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.280
of different types of files.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.220
We also in the process
made a bunch of diagrams.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.390
In fact, it was through this
process of drawing diagrams

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.380
that a lot of the important
points came out and sort

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.130
of jogged their memory.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.360
One of the coolest things
we found was this little

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.960
geometrical sketch, off to
the side, of one of the files,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.070
which was later sort of moved
into the middle of the building

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.510
and became the sort of focal
point of the whole project

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:35.420
as you can see on the left.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:39.630
All right, so it's clear

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.510
that insider knowledge
was key to the exhibition.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.360
Without the architect
to carefully think

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.010
through the design process,
pulling out important moments

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.400
from the files would have been
a much more difficult task.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.460
One useful archival
practice then,

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.300
and this was mentioned earlier
and especially for small firms,

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.570
would be to ask designers
to spend some time

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:05.160
after a project is over simply
copying and pasting sort

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.130
of some key files to a separate
folder that could serve as sort

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.240
of reference points later
on if you wanted to sort

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.750
of reconstruct the
design process.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:18.300
All right, going through these
files I found a collection

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.320
of documents, I found that
a collection of documents

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.480
in their original order
provided some valuable clues

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.780
for the historian.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.860
A folder structure
can tell you a lot.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.730
File adjacencies are sometimes
meaningful to make sense

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.970
of a workflow, having
access to files

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:38.150
in their original structure
is sometimes crucial.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:43.200
Things like scripts or reference
images, next to original models

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.720
or drawings, you know, can
make all the difference

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.180
in interpreting it.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.030
In contemporary modeling
practices the best way to ensure

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:56.050
that a model would even
open correctly would be

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.440
to have a sort of snapshot of
the whole computer it seems like

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.700
and actually absent that
it's hard to guarantee

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.610
that some things would
even work at all, right?

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.880
I think ultimately that the
way to think about design needs

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.230
to change drastically as we
think about digital archives.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.440
Sometimes I personally
lapse into imagining

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.980
that design is something an
architect does with pencil

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.100
and paper, and then I go to
look for sketches and drawings

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.440
for evidence of design
decisions.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.370
But it's clear that with digital
design an architect is usually

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.980
looking over someone else's
shoulder as they're zooming in

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.820
and out, turning layers on
and off, and rotating things

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.900
to get just the right view.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.810
The important thing is not
only to look at the right file,

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.610
but to have the right
viewpoint within the file,

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.100
the right combination
of layers and so on.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.630
So digital files have a much
greater depth and complexity

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.060
than drawings on paper,
I mean we all know this.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.160
But luckily historians can
approach archives in new ways.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.960
We don't have to be
respectful of digital files

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.540
in the same way we are
careful about drawings.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.940
We can make a copy of everything
and move things around,

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.660
cut out pieces, save as
new files, delete things,

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.260
create our own folder
structure and so on.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.310
The more this can be
enabled I think the better.

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.380
All right, so the third project

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.540
that I'll just very briefly
discuss builds on the second.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.130
As an architecture student I
came to appreciate the impact

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:25.790
of software limitations
and bugs on design.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.230
If you know that a
program will crash

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.400
after you have let's say
10,000 of something you'll try

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.180
to design with only 9,000
of them, and then once

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.110
that bug is fixed
you'll go crazy and make

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.610
like 100,000 of them, right?

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:42.630
I know that 10 years ago
students were eagerly installing

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.980
beta versions of software
as soon as it came

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.570
out to use the latest features.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.670
So this final project was an
exploration of the relationship

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.550
between the evolution of
software and the evolution

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.370
of architectural culture
and ultimately the evolution

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.860
of architecture,
itself, let's say.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.090
I didn't begin with a
traditional archive,

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.900
but three different
sources of information.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.850
The first was the change
log of Rhinoceros 3D,

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.370
a popular digital
modeling package.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.620
I knew the change log
was available in pieces,

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.260
but I wasn't able to get it
directly from McNeel so I ended

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.140
up pulling it piece by piece
from archive.org actually.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:28.260
The second source was text
and images from forums

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.210
that showed bugs that
architects encountered in Rhino.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.110
And for the third I put a call
out to friends and students

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:40.320
for anecdotes about what they
thought was the most important

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.370
command in Rhino.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.940
So the idea of the show
was to fill-up a wall

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.520
with the change logging and
to correlate the anecdotes

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.590
and the images with it.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:55.710
So this is sort of
what it looked like.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:58.970
So again it was to, so at
certain points you could see

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:02.310
in the change log that a new
command would be added to Rhino

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:05.270
and then there would be
anecdotes about like how

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:09.910
that particular command related
to architectural design, right?

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:13.480
So it made a good
conversation piece definitely.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.380
Let's see, where are we -- and
it may have gotten some people

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.380
to think about the
link between the sort

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.730
of behind the scenes
practices of software design

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.450
and our own design work.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:29.220
I wanted to show this project
here to emphasize the relevance

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:34.460
of all this seemingly peripheral
stuff to architectural projects.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.000
If as a historian you're not
focusing on finished buildings,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.300
a lot of the things

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.140
in traditional archives
simply don't get to the point.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.270
For this show I didn't want
drawings or renderings,

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.870
but screenshots and forum posts.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.670
If I'm trying to
focus on some aspect

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:53.150
of architectural culture
archival work becomes something

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.240
like anthropological fieldwork.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.810
Part of the job is to scout
out possible archives.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.950
So in this case if I care
about the impact of software

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.230
in architecture it makes me
wonder if we should be thinking

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.750
of archiving not only
old versions of software,

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:08.130
but things like change logs

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.220
and tech support
forums, for example.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.650
The ambitious question
to ask here it seems

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:18.640
to me is how would we
archive digital culture?

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.710
One project I'm working on right
now is to collect snapshots

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:26.470
of entire computers and to save
them in sort of time capsules

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.760
that capture not only
specific projects,

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.120
but an entire way
of working, right?

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.610
These may or may not be
interesting a couple decades

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:39.730
from now as kind of
case studies, we'll see.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.260
I'll end by noting a commonality
between the projects I showed.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.970
My own privileged position
with direct access to files

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.310
and the people who created them.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.970
My sort of final question here
is how can we set-up archives

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.100
that recreate as much

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.480
as possible this
privileged position

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.510
for every researcher
approaching an archive?

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:02.510
How can we allow a
feeling of direct access

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:04.880
or of a window onto a culture?

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.560
I suspect that this would
require a very particular type

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.550
of archive that we don't
actually see very often.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.510
Okay, thank you.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:18.540
[ Applause ]

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.840
&gt;&gt; Dennis Shelden: Okay,

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.310
so I think this is going
to be a good wrap-up.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.000
I'm going to try to connect,
it actually turns out I'm going

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.710
to try to connect some of
the themes from this morning

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.580
around interoperability
and IFC and all that kind

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.200
of I guess BIM stuff
with some of the themes

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.510
from this afternoon,
including some systems

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.080
that normal humans use
and some of the stuff

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.500
that Andrew talked
about, but not as smart.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:50.770
[laughter] So just very briefly,
yes, about me and the lab.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.110
As Andrew mentioned, so before
I joined Georgia Tech I was

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.670
associated with Frank
Deerey's office

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.210
as the Technology
Director and then the CTO

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:01.880
of Deerey Technologies.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.210
Produced a bunch of
different software,

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.400
I'll talk about one piece of it,
and then in parallel I've been

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.910
in academia both at MIT and
Georgia Tech and other places.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:14.840
And the lab definitely focuses
on things like data standards

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.360
and interoperability,
also this kind

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.680
of general I think project
delivery systems may have come

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.770
up but how you connect tools,
organizations, data work and all

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:28.200
that kind of stuff and
then some automation stuff

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.740
and what goes on.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.560
So I'm actually going to
talk about four use cases.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.290
Two of them I'm not
going to talk about BIM,

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:39.110
IFC and open data
standards because I was told

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.150
that we had that
subject covered.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.710
I'm going to talk
about two data systems,

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:49.080
one which was actually
Andrew's brainchild back

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.420
in Deerey Technologies, another
system which is a GSA project

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.870
that some of the audience may
know better than me, CourtsWeb,

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.080
which is about sort of
archiving design intent

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.530
of different courthouses.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.150
And then two things that are
more about sort of the language

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.930
of design and if we can do
stuff to capture that, as well.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.100
So, without further ado,
this is the first project

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.920
that I mentioned.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.480
This is a system that was
developed actually originally

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.830
by Andrew when he was working

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.230
on the Louis Vuitton
project in Paris.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.380
And the notion there
I think people talked

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.530
about Katia [assumed spelling],
I won't mention that too much

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.150
but this idea that
you have to manage,

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.460
with that system you have
to manage tens of thousands

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.900
of files that are
evolving asynchronously

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.640
by different stakeholders
across the world and sort

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.350
of managing versioning of
that and who did what and sort

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.180
of just dealing with that sort

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.310
of evolving asynchronous
compound document problem.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.280
So the system was originally
conceived of as sort

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.530
of wrapping this set of files --

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.560
let's see, can I point with
anything -- but making those,

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.220
exposing those visually
on the web.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.940
This is pretty early in the web,
you know, it wasn't that early,

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.030
but not everything
was on the web then.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.440
But, more importantly, kind

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.460
of capturing the social
transactions that happen

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.140
between different players

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.510
as these models evolve
asynchronously over time.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:22.160
So this is just a kind of an
early screenshot of kind of the

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.630
like what we call the feed
of different people working

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.930
on different components.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.780
You could click through it
and you'd see the files.

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.880
This became a kind of
a more robust system,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.520
which became a commercial
product called G Team.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.620
I think I'm auto, yes,
okay, we'll just let it run.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.630
Okay, which included
again this idea of kind

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.110
of the Facebook wall of the
project, who did what, when.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.910
You could drill into that.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.320
You had a file structure, as
well, because we needed that.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.070
You could get the data on those
models, and then you could pull

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:58.640
up the kind of the
organization of those files

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.240
and it was very sort
of tree structured.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.200
It's kind of a light version of
ISC, which is tree structured

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.210
as opposed to this big
complex hairball relationships.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.640
But it did sort of wrap
all these different files

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.380
in the sort of social
transactions among players,

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.540
and I think that's an important
piece for at least to consider

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.260
when you're archiving
a project is the fact

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.750
that these transactions
are no longer happening,

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.370
this super rigid kind of
hierarchical structure

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.620
that we associate with
project contracts and delivery

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.480
but there's actually sort of
cross-pollination happening.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.890
It's more of a web of
transactions than it is

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:36.540
like a hierarchy, so it was
kind of, you know, handled both

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.900
of those in kind of
an early fashion.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.390
And just to kind of
close the loop, yes,

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:42.390
we sort of started
looking at this

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.970
as actually something you could
embed in social media, as well,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:46.900
so you could take the
model at this state

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.690
and plug it into Facebook.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.520
So that was kind of the
beginning of it at least.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.750
And I guess I should say that
as the system evolved you could

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:03.720
upload files in native formats,
you could actually download them

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.630
in IFC and it stored it

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.530
in its own file format,
its own data format.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.260
You could connect
different objects

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.900
to their associated objects,

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.560
like so here you have
a view that's tied

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.900
to a drawing, those
kind of things.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.150
So these abilities to
kind of tie model objects

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:23.400
and transactions in different
digital assets I think this is

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.770
becoming possible now.

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:28.580
This became a commercial product
or got bought by Trimble,

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.260
who then and now it's known as
Trimble Connect and it's moved

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.900
on beyond that, and there
are certainly other systems

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.200
that do this, as well.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.460
So that's a little
bit kind of back

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.820
to where we were this morning.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.640
I wanted to point out another
project which isn't, you know,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.050
I've had nothing to do with,
but it is done by the people

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.350
in the program at Georgia Tech.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:48.280
And it's a project for
the GSA called CourtsWeb,

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.280
that's the link, but you
can just Google CourtsWeb.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.570
Does anybody from the GSA
know about this project?

00:51:54.570 --> 00:52:00.020
Okay, good, so I
can make stuff up.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.600
[laughter] But essentially what
this is is an online database

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.520
of about 30 or 40
different courthouses

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.830
that have metadata associated
with those courthouses, images,

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:19.180
data associated with where
it is, who was the architect,

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.720
all that kind of good stuff.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.370
And some analyses that I think
are the most interesting things.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:27.450
So you can do comparisons, pick
a couple different courthouses

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:28.750
and see them together.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.580
It has things like the
drawings in the 3D models,

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.820
but also a figure
background kind of views,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:39.340
different analyses,
images of course.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.780
And then maybe most
interestingly

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.240
as a segway 3D models that talk

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.150
about the different
circulation paths,

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.400
so from what I understand, you
guys may know better than me,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:56.800
but courthouses have a very
sort of mission critical idea

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.010
about which different
constituencies,

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.660
I mean basically the
judiciary goes one way,

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.730
the public goes another way,
the indicted go a different way

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.300
and you have to keep
them separate.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.390
And in a three space
configuration that's actually

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:12.810
fairly challenging, it's
challenging to understand, too.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:17.910
So this system is I think
complementary to some

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.670
of the design guidelines
that would be associated

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:25.100
with courthouses and sort of
present an archive of some

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.190
of the critical things
that are in that guideline

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:30.730
and that the GSA and
the court systems care

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.030
about for those buildings.

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:35.320
So it's seen as kind of
a database and archive

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.820
of again different features

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:40.270
of those different projects
that you can compare.

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:45.300
So those are the two
kind of portal views

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.480
of this kind of digital
archiving.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:53.110
And then from there I
want to quickly go to some

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.850
of the more rarified stuff
around design language.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:58.450
So I thought this was an
original thought when I came

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:01.690
up with this slide,
but on the left --

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:04.600
okay, so on the left
obviously the Rosetta Stone,

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.490
in the middle Andrew talked
about Christopher Alexander

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.620
and pattern language, on
the right the court stuff

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.750
which isn't mine either.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:18.130
And I think the point is, you
know, the point I want to make

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:22.320
about the Rosetta Stone is --

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.660
I guess are there any
linguists in the audience?

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.960
Okay, mostly architects.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.110
So obviously the
purpose of an object

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:34.220
like the Rosetta Stone isn't
just to archive itself,

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:38.420
it's to serve as an archive
for all possible languages --

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.160
what do you want to
say, sort of sentences

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.470
or configurations associated
with those languages, right?

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.670
That's why it's so important.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.640
So the question that
I think I would pose

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.880
and I think Andrew did
this a little bit, as well,

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.430
is can we not just
archive a specific object,

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.730
maybe it's been representation,
but get a little bit deeper sort

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:05.150
of in terms of the forensics
of understanding the DNA

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:07.820
of that particular
typology, right?

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.980
So what do all GSA
courthouses have in common?

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.270
How could you compare
them to each other?

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.600
Is there a way of
sort of qualifying

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.680
or quantifying those
features, right?

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:25.130
So there is some really
interesting research work

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:28.480
that is really about --
I'll just cut forward --

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.700
is about sort of understanding
the languages of design.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.810
It goes by a special term
called shape grammars,

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.060
some of you may have heard of
this, but it really is sort

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.890
of a direct descendent of
computational linguistics.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:45.040
And I guess I would
just compare these two

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.370
because this is worth
digging into a little bit.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.600
I learned the diagram on the
left when I was in high school,

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.350
that probably dates me.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:55.390
I should say I didn't learn
it, the English teacher brought

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.590
that up one afternoon,
nobody could figure

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:59.530
out what he was talking
about and he dropped it.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:01.970
And I imagine a lot of you
have had a similar experience.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:07.060
So Norm Chomsky, known for a
lot of important work but came

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.490
up with this epiphany

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:10.840
that really all sentences
are structured

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.400
as these binary decompositions.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.330
So a sentence can
be decomponented

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:17.050
into its noun phrase and its
verb phrase, the verb phrase

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:19.160
in terms of a verb
and a noun, whatever,

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.610
a participle I think -- you guys
might know better than me --

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.160
and they sort of
cascade down, right?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:26.410
There's this substitution
from a high level object

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.830
and its decomposition into
richer and richer sort

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:31.640
of substructures, right?

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.550
So if you tee it up
that way the idea

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:38.450
that there might be some sort
of way of decomposing a project

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:40.660
into its constituent
components and then further

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.270
and then further and
understanding that structure

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.640
as you go makes some
sort of sense

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.200
and that's really the basis

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.530
of the shape grammar
canon, if you will.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.800
So left and right are two
examples I'll show you.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.750
Let me see, let me
go to a specific --

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.590
well, here's the theory,
which is that it's

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:06.660
about again these substitutions,
every shape, every building,

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.200
every project can be decomposed
into replacement rules

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.840
that architects might replace
one thing with another.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.360
I see a square, I rotate
it, blah, blah, blah.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.640
I can find that shape
in my design,

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.250
I can do that replacement.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:22.380
And so a lot of the work about
documenting, this has been done

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.390
with Frank Lloyd Wright
projects and Palladian Villas

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.700
and the list goes on and on,
but you can essentially sort

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:33.880
of archive that set of rules
and use it to play back

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.180
for all kinds of different
projects of that typology.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.610
So here's some work
that ties directly

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.110
into the CourtsWeb project,

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.440
which is looking at
Meise courthouses.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.540
As far as I understand
there's quite a few of them.

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.640
On the left are the
original sketches from Meise,

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:54.170
on the right are those
generated typologies

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:59.670
and those are generated by this
list of these substitution rules

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.460
that you can apply to take
the overall courthouse,

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.310
maybe split it up into,
Lord knows, the public

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.800
and the private and then
down to other refinements.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.100
So even down to things

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:13.650
like actual construction
typologies, right?

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:16.850
So here's again that set of
rules being applied and the fact

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.230
that you can apply
to a whole bunch

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:19.800
of different possible
configurations

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.600
of this Meise courthouse.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.390
Last thing I'll show you is some
work that actually is just part

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.820
of what I teach to all the
students at Georgia Tech.

00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.740
And it's a little bit the same
idea and it's using Grasshopper,

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:38.120
which I think many of
you will know is a sort

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:42.200
of visual scripting
add-on to Rhino.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.560
How many of you have
heard of Grasshopper?

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.500
Okay, and it's a very easy way
to do some of the crazy stuff

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.150
that Andrew was talking about.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.040
So basically you can
generate scripts by dragging

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.300
and dropping these blocks and
then you make modifications

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.060
to the blocks and it
generates these forms.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.300
But I think for me what's
interesting and what I try

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.160
to force the students to believe
is that you can actually use

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.350
that as a diagraming tool in and
of itself for the organization

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:11.380
of the logic of the projects.

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.740
And we do a number
of case studies

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:18.160
of historical projects
using these frameworks,

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.190
and there's kind of a high level
hypothesis that we actually,

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:26.210
that I brought from
Gary's work which says,

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.930
and this may sound
crazy or simple

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:30.400
or really dumbing it down.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.270
But all projects
can be decomposed

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:37.340
into three high level systems,
the exterior volume of it,

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.370
the floor, top of floor
planes, top of slab planes,

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.170
and the structural grid.

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:46.290
And once you have those three
canonical systems you mix

00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:48.630
and match them and then
you get sort of the frames

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.080
that the mullions go in,

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.130
the core goes in,
those kind of things.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.700
So there is this kind of natural
hierarchy of all projects

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.320
of that decomposition and
just we actually can look

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.500
at some core templates and
how those things play out,

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.040
but we look at different
sort of typologies, towers,

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.400
grids, stadium, stations.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.310
We actually give out
these little templates

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.690
and then the students
can kind of mix

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:15.680
and match those component
systems to sort

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.310
of plug-and-play
different configurations.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:20.430
And here's an example of what
an undergraduate team did,

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.770
the Beijing Stadium.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.710
Turns out, you know,
there is a very --

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:26.290
it's a great project
because it is a very --

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.590
it looks like a hairball,

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.530
but it's a very rational
top-down hierarchical system

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.570
of this ellipse with
the oculist,

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:38.660
the ribs that connect those,
and then that produces a set

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.710
of configurations that these
different subsystems can

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.010
go into.

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:47.740
And then so again we're using on
the bottom kind of the program

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.100
as the map and that
allows you to kind

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.410
of also decompose the project
into its constituent systems

01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:55.080
and then, of course,
you can do kind

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.860
of generative reconfiguration
of that stuff.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.430
So I think that's it.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:02.510
Thanks.

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:08.810
[ Applause ]

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.110
&gt;&gt; Kurt Helfrich: So
now we'd like to be able

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.550
to have questions
from the audience.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.170
Oh, come on now -- oh, okay?

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:32.870
&gt;&gt; On the emulation,
how far back can you go?

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:36.100
Can you go back to
greenscreens and VMS and?

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:41.150
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane: Okay,
so the way the emulation

01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:47.620
as a service framework works
is it brings together a bunch

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.920
of emulators.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.300
We just added another
one recently.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.650
I think they also added the
EME granulator last year.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:56.770
If there's an emulator for it
we can add it to the network,

01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:59.040
and I believe there
are emulators for a lot

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.340
of the earlier machines.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.040
We haven't added them because we
haven't had any use cases yet,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.310
but as soon as there is
we can get the developers

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.610
to integrate them.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:07.910
&gt;&gt; What about the systems

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.950
that had very different
display systems

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:13.130
or very different input devices?

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:15.620
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane: The display
systems are always going

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.920
to be a challenge.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.220
And one of the things
we're looking

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.520
at from a research perspective

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.820
or actually I should say
the University of Freiburg

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.250
who developed the emulation as
a service framework are looking

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.570
at is how to access these,
the desktop environments

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:28.100
from mobile devices, which is

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.920
where so many people
access things these days.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.550
And there may just be no way

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.470
to properly map old
displays to modern hardware.

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.020
One of the things
that I'm interested

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.400
in is accessing these
kind of things

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.050
in virtual reality environments

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:44.570
because you can simulate
whatever kind

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.320
of interface you wanted
in virtual reality,

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.880
and I have seen someone
that did that.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.430
They made a virtual
reality environment

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.770
with an emulator backing the
computer sitting inside of it,

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.780
so you could use the
original computer

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.280
in the virtual environment.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.750
The original hardware
was simulated.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.640
It was really cool.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.870
And input devices, what they can
do is they translate any input

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:07.150
to any equivalent
that is available

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.710
in the emulator theoretically

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.010
and they've done
that in practice.

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:12.990
They've done it for video
cameras and other sensors

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.990
that we use for digital
outworks,

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:18.320
so they've connected those
to the emulator version

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.630
of the hardware when the
original computer that was

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.270
on this digital outwork
installation died.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.890
So they connected it
to the new computer,

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:26.190
which was running the emulation

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:30.030
and they translated
the sensor data camera

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.140
or like a motion sensor
I think was one of them

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.210
to the emulator environment
and it accepted

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.370
and used that input directly.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:38.700
So if there's a way to
translate it to something

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.000
that means anything

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.060
to the emulator then I mean it's
all just coding, it just depends

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.460
on how much time and money
you want to put into it.

01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:51.110
&gt;&gt; Ryan Donaldson:
Hi, Ryan Donaldson

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:52.500
with the Durst organization.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.670
It's great to hear in these
examples of really being able

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:59.840
to bring to light
architectural practices,

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.830
to be able to make
them more engaging.

01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.380
And my question touches
on kind of the response

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.430
to these projects and in
particular the emulation

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:09.800
and exhibitions that were done.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.770
In terms of the emulation piece
is there any kind of measuring

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.300
in terms of almost the
performance that's going

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.740
on in terms of user experience,

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.010
being able to see what
they're going to and being able

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:23.640
to then inform further
work that you're doing?

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.770
And on the exhibition
side in terms of visitors

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:29.030
and visitor responses
and metrics around that?

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.450
Was that something that was a
part of the project, as well?

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:33.750
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane:
I'm sure that's a no,

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.650
but it's something
we've talked about.

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.210
And we can definitely,
we could add monitoring

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.740
of say where users click.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.770
And, in fact, for awhile there
they had an implementation

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:46.950
of this that was used for doing
bulk migration between formats,

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.480
where you'd run a
migration on one file

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.770
and it would copy
your interactions

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.950
with a virtual computer and
you could just replay thousands

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.060
of files to migrate them
using the original software.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.920
And so the technology is
there if we wanted to monitor

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.550
and interact with
these things we could.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.950
And we didn't monitor
the use of the machines

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.980
in any way in the exhibition.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:13.840
&gt;&gt; Yes, I mean I'll just say
that also, no, unfortunately.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.440
You know, especially the last
exhibition I showed was meant

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.600
to be sort of embedded within
the community that sort

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.900
of that the work was showing.

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:32.510
And maybe not, let's say,
surveys or something like that,

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:35.490
but some way of creating
feedback and sort

01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:39.580
of interactive displays
or putting

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.060
up your own post-it notes

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.250
or some more sophisticated
version of that.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.320
Yes, if I were to do a
bigger version of the project

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:53.260
that would be exactly the
direction I'd go with it.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.240
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Ouelette, Vectorworks
and buildingSMART International.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.360
So it goes back to the emulation
and you sort of threw it out

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:05.010
or threw it off, the problem you
face when you have applications

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:08.620
that used hardware
keys for protection

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.450
and how difficult
then that becomes

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:15.490
to then provide emulation
and continuity?

01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.720
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane: There are
at least two organizations,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.050
I believe Peter and Brendan
representing one of them,

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:26.100
that are looking at whether
we could get a DMC exemption

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.420
for breaking DRM.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.270
There are ways to do it, whether
we're legally allowed to do it

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.070
or not is another question.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.850
But you can emulate the
dongles and attach them

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:37.880
to the virtual serial
port or whatever.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.660
&gt;&gt; Right, so really it's
more of a legal issue.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.350
&gt;&gt; Euan Cochrane: But for
the most part it's still hard

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:46.540
to emulate them, someone has
to do that for every single one

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.140
and that's work, but
once you've done it once

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:54.290
that software can then be
used millions of times.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.980
&gt;&gt; Hi, Elisa again from Stuckey.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:04.230
My question, I have two, so I'll
start, is about the space --

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:08.120
I don't know the
actual words you used?

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.420
&gt;&gt; Shape grammar, I think.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.720
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.020
Thank you.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.320
And the whole concept of
visual orders that goes

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.310
into that I think is really
important because from someone

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:17.720
who doesn't have an
architecture background,

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.210
which is not always the case
but it's often for archivists

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.460
who are going to be taking care
of these things afterwards,

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.530
there has to be some way for us
to be better educated in order

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:30.990
to be able to take on
these next days I think.

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:35.290
Because a lot of the rose-tinted
glasses and appreciation

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:38.010
of the paper-based drawings
you can just say these

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.310
are beautiful.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.630
I understand, I grasp
why this is important.

01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:41.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:43.760
&gt;&gt; And it's lost often when
you're looking at a black screen

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.550
with a bunch of neon
colored lines.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:50.240
And so I'm wondering how do
we prepare ourselves for that

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.870
and if you think space
grammar is the way to go

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:54.780
or if there's something else?

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.080
&gt;&gt; Oh, God.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.160
Well, let me start because
I think there's quite a bit

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.480
of answer to that.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.680
I mean I'm not sure, I think
do you need to know linguistics

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.980
to be good at language?

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.930
No. Are most people
good linguists?

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.250
Probably not even if
they're good at language.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.860
I think it's a useful technique.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:21.650
I think it is very germane
to the historical forensics

01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:24.920
and understanding of
past decision making.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.490
It seems like -- what
am I struggling for --

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.640
it seems like it may
not just be a set

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.600
of abstract computational
technique,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.200
it might actually be
something that is, you know,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.700
could be seen as being human.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.480
Certainly the people that
work on it believe that it is,

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.600
that it's part of the process
of design to recognize things

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.900
and replace them and that it is.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.580
I'm certainly part of a
group that thinks that.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.050
I'm a structuralist so I
believe that the structure

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.300
of language conditions what
we do as whoever we are.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.460
So, but it's certainly
only one technique for kind

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.630
of discovering features
of and understanding,

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:08.300
retroactively understanding
designs.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.600
&gt;&gt; Kurt Helfrich:
Well, with that,

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.900
I'm afraid we've
run out of time.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.300
So thank you very
much to our panelists.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.510
I think they gave
excellent presentations.

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:19.130
[ Applause ]

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:20.840
And, as well, I'd like
to acknowledge Grace,

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.840
our timekeeper who
has kept us on track.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.030
[applause] At this point
we'll take a short break

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:30.300
and come back I think at three.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.770
&gt;&gt; Yes, sure, come
back at three.

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:34.070
[break]

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.570
&gt;&gt; Stacy: As we start off and
wrap-up today I did want you

01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:40.730
to please stick around because
we are going to have a summary

01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:43.400
by Tim Walsh to wrap us up

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.490
and then also Kate will
be back to make comments.

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:50.310
But let me kick it off now for
our fourth session, please.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.610
Thank you so much.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.230
&gt;&gt; Kit Errington:
Okay, hi, everybody.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:09:59.530
What a great day we're having.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.420
Wow, I love the energy of
having to quiet everyone

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.210
down because there's
so much to say

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:05.790
and so many great
people to say it with.

01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:09.360
So thanks, everyone,
for a great day so far.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.710
I'm Kit Harington.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.850
I work in the Prints and
Photographs Division here

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:16.310
at The Library of Congress, the
home for the 80 East Center.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:21.740
I started here in 1995 and cut
my teeth, and I'm continuing

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.040
to work very hard today

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.210
on the historic American
building survey,

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:27.220
historic American
engineering record,

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.960
historic American
landscape survey,

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.210
fabulous collections
that started in 1933.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:36.920
All of the access and styles
and sociology and history,

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.210
these collections are used
constantly this way today

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.610
and people are downloading
the images

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.160
and the drawings and
making 3D models.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.250
Like it's in a live collection,

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:49.060
it's becoming more digital every
day, and we hope to continue

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.700
to be able to provide access
to it in those new ways.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.130
So we've got the heroes
is what I'm thinking

01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:58.430
of what this panel is.

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.540
We've had a lot of really
interesting challenges

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.330
that have been phased
and described,

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:08.030
and what these guys are doing
is the hard work of trying

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.520
to provide some of those
answers and solutions

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.740
of software and standards.

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.440
So we're going to be hearing
from Phil Rosche yet again,

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.150
wonderfully, from the
CAx Implementors Forum.

01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:24.450
Jessica Meyerson, Software
Preservation Network,

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.330
SPIN I think is how
it is pronounced.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:31.520
Jeff Ouellette is going to be
talking about smart building,

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.950
give us IFC information.

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:36.760
And Roger Grant from
NEBS is going

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.440
to be introducing some
standards information for us.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.080
So welcome and let's
get started.

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:51.390
&gt;&gt; Phil Rosche: Well, as
you know, earlier I was kind

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:57.190
of filling in for Rick Zuray
of Boeing and, unfortunately,

01:11:57.190 --> 01:11:59.190
that's not the first time
I've done that, but anyway.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.900
[laughter] I'm going to talk

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.260
about something that's a bit
nearer and dearer to my heart,

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.650
which is interoperability
testing.

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:13.790
And, you know, that word
interoperability has become very

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:16.440
common I think in the
last or five or 10 years,

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.090
but I think it was the community
that I run in where it came from

01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:28.070
but I'm taking credit
for it anyway.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:29.370
[laughter] You started

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:33.880
to see translation software
built upon the steps standard

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.350
or based upon the
steps standard probably

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:40.190
in the '90s, the early '90s.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:45.270
And actually big OEM companies
liked the Boeings of the world,

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.670
would actually develop their
own translation capability

01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:50.910
for their CAD system.

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:52.220
And then finally you started

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.930
to see the actual software
companies developing this

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:59.180
translation capability, but none

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.620
of them worked very
well together

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.800
and the steps standard was
supposed to be straightforward

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.780
and unambiguous and all
these kinds of things

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.670
but these systems didn't
interoperate at all.

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:17.580
So, and actually I think I'd
said this a little earlier,

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.990
but myself and some other folks
in this industry got together

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:23.990
and we said, well, how
can we test this software?

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:29.050
And we didn't like those words
like compliant and conformant

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:31.510
and things like that
because I think if you look

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:35.860
out in the general software
industry there are certainly

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:40.030
examples of software that's
conformant or compliant

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:42.040
but not interoperable at all.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.670
So interoperability
was our number one goal

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:49.770
in starting the CAx
implementor forum.

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:54.130
There's currently three
hosting organizations of it.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.260
The organization
that I'm on contract

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.320
to is called PDES, Incorporated.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.800
It's primarily an aerospace
and defense consortium.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.650
Prostep is a project
under PDES, Inc.

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:13.090
Prostep ivip is I would call
them a German automotive

01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:15.070
consortium, but they
probably prefer

01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.670
to be called a European
automotive consortium,

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:20.750
heavy German influence.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:25.520
And then AFNet, and don't
ask me what that stands for

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.750
and it's probably French anyway,
but they're kind of a trains,

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:34.340
planes and automobile
industry group of France.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.180
But those are the
organizations that host us.

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.290
The group is composed
of computer aided design

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:45.590
and computer aided
engineering vendors

01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:48.000
and also what we call
third-party vendors,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.330
which are the translation
software vendors.

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:53.520
They don't, a third-party vendor
doesn't have any authoring

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.850
software, they just change
the gender of a native file

01:14:58.850 --> 01:15:02.370
to a neutral file or
something like that.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:06.960
It is a closed group,
we call it a sandbox.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.750
We do not release results of a
particular vendor to the world

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:14.800
or to our member organizations.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.870
The only results they see
are kind of rolled up,

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:21.500
so how well did we do
on geometric accuracy

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.800
or something like that.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.680
And so it is a trusted
environment,

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.620
and I don't think
you see this much

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.380
in other software
development groups,

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.820
but you'll actually
see somebody from --

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.120
I'm just going to
make this up --

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.460
Deso Systems helping out
somebody from Siemens NX

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:48.140
or Solid Works or whatever, and
it's kind of a neat environment.

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.720
We launched this in '99,
that was kind of part

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.150
of the history lessons.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:57.110
We've actually done 40 rounds
of testing on the CAD side

01:15:57.110 --> 01:16:00.350
and we're just starting
on the CAE side,

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:05.090
and really our primary mission
is to meet industry's needs

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:15.560
by providing them with these
interoperable products.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:19.420
I already said we test
on a closed environment.

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.450
We don't let any
specific results out.

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:27.730
All the participants are
testing alpha and beta software,

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:31.710
it's pre-production, so this
early detection of errors

01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:34.850
in their software
actually provides them

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.720
with a faster development cycle.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:44.530
One other thing that I think
is a big benefit of this is

01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:47.010
that we actually
test the standard

01:16:47.010 --> 01:16:48.380
as it's being developed,

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.700
and you'll see a
chart a little later,

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:56.640
but the current steps standard
we're working on is AP242

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.710
and it was as soon as
we had a data model

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:05.490
of AP242 we started testing
it and yet it's going

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:09.430
through the ISO ballot
process at the same time,

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:11.520
so it's not even an
international standard yet.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.620
So we tested the standard
while it was being developed,

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.780
we provided input back to them

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.670
so that they could
improve the standard

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:27.540
and get rid of the bugs in it.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.560
We call this CAx-IF on a page,

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.570
but up in the upper left there
we have the user companies

01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:38.620
and then there are a broad
range of types of companies.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.730
There are aerospace and defense,
there are automotive, you know,

01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:48.890
shipbuilding, you name it,
but they kind of provide us

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:50.540
with their requirements.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.540
And a relatively recent
requirement is that we have

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.680
to have geometric and
dimensional tolerances

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.520
in the step-based products.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:07.430
So we go off and see how hard
that's going to be to do and see

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.460
if it's in the data
model, the group down there

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:13.490
in the lower left, the ISO.

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.880
And then we also get test
models from the user companies

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.130
to do our testing with,
and we go off and test it.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:26.490
And so the user companies get
interoperable software back.

01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:30.920
The standards groups they get
standardization issues fed back

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.220
to them.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:34.980
And just to the general world
over there on the bottom right,

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.610
you know, they get
commercial products that work.

01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:43.450
So I'm not going to spend any
time on this, this is kind

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:48.990
of the scope of AP242, but
it's all those kinds of things

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:53.000
that they use in a
mechanical design context.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.150
And an important word there
is managed model based 3D

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.520
engineering, so it's
designed to be managed

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.770
by a PDM or a PLM system.

01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:08.780
Again, it has all the
data necessary to do that.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:15.390
And, like I said, this is the
kind of the history of AP242

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:17.060
and testing it, if you will.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.390
And I think I said we were
on the 40th round of testing,

01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:26.190
but the development of AP242
started at the end of 2010.

01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:31.640
And along the left-hand side
those are all the various ISO

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.060
valid steps you'd
have to go through.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.540
And so we've been testing
it all the way along,

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:42.310
and actually sometimes
we've actually been ahead

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:46.010
of the standard and we'll
see things that aren't

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:49.110
in the standard and we'll
just make up a data model

01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:52.290
and stick it into the main data
model ourselves and go ahead

01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:55.570
and test it and then feed that
back to the standards folks.

01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:02.520
Regarding our methodology,

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.250
the steps standard uses both
express and XML schemas.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:10.740
XML is primarily
used for what I kind

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.070
of consider the softer
stuff, the metadata

01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:18.260
and the part number,
stuff like that.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.900
And then we use the
express, it is primarily used

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:24.270
for the geometry and
the complex stuff

01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:30.830
because express is a lot more
richer modeling language.

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:34.320
We also provide these documents
called recommended practices

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.250
documents, and it's kind
of a cookbook approach

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:41.110
on how you implement
the steps standards.

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.850
And, as I said earlier,
these standards were supposed

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:47.850
to have been unambiguous,
but obviously they weren't.

01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:50.920
And there's a lot of
times in the standard

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.310
where there's multiple
paths you can take

01:20:54.310 --> 01:21:00.600
or you don't really know what
kind of value is expected

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.900
or something of that nature.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.560
So we write these recommended
practices documents based upon

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.590
discussion we have with
all the software developers

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:11.430
and it's an agreement,
if you will.

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:17.060
And then the test
case definitions.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.420
When the vendor produces a step
file based upon a particular

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:25.340
functionality we test it for
syntax, so is it conformant

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:29.220
to the schema, and typically
that's kind of as far

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.110
as conformance testing goes,

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:34.250
just is it conformant
to the schema.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:37.670
But we also test it for
structure and semantics,

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:41.060
and we kind of consider that
to be conformant to our --

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.470
and I don't like to even
use that word conformance,

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:49.470
but applicable or it lends
itself or it follows along

01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:51.800
with the recommended
practices documents.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:57.330
And actually we get a
lot of I think the IFC

01:21:57.330 --> 01:22:00.680
and BIM folks have had a lot of
interaction with the NIST folks

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:05.220
over the years and kind of
the same help, if you will,

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:11.010
so and NIST helps
us out with this.

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:14.480
Anyway, so these step files
are submitted and they're found

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.300
to be good, and all the other
participants post-process t hem.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.710
And we actually have an online
system for the participants

01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:28.100
to go on and they enter
in data about the exchange

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:30.320
that they just did,
whether they're the native

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.290
or the target system, and
the system does an automatic

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:38.310
comparison and shows you where
issues are and things like that.

01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:42.450
It's basically an Excel
spreadsheet on steroids.

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:46.450
And then a lot of times we
find issues during the testing

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:48.380
that are actually
resolved before the end

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.490
of that particular
round of testing.

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:53.660
The recommended practices
documents,

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.790
I mentioned there's one on how

01:22:55.790 --> 01:23:00.810
to do business object model
assembly structure, geometric

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.110
and assembly validation
properties

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:04.870
and external references.

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:09.100
We provide a test case
specification at the beginning

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.290
of every round of testing.

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:16.940
Typically there's a number of
test cases in a test suite.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.410
A test suite is the overall
document and there's a number

01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:20.710
of test cases in it,

01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:23.940
and sometimes it has modeling
instructions and it always talks

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:30.070
about what statistics are needed
by the statistic system we use.

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:33.740
There's just a screenshot of our
statistic system, like I said,

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.990
it's like a spreadsheet
on steroids.

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:42.820
There's a lot of
other things going

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:46.180
on in the step and
the AP242 realm.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:50.140
NIST has an MBE validation
project going

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.820
on that we kind of feed on.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.960
They also have a step
file analyzer that we use

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.660
and also provide feedback
to so they can improve that.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:04.430
Besides our own implementor
forum there's also two other

01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.580
implementor forums that are
kind of in the same realm

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.120
and there's a lot of
cross-pollination between them.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.950
there's the JT implementor
forum, JT is a --

01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:20.170
&gt;&gt; Phil, could you step
forward to the mike, please?

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:21.470
Thanks.

01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:22.770
&gt;&gt; Phil Rosche: I'm sorry.

01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:25.430
JT is kind of a semi-proprietary
visualization format

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:31.340
from Siemens, but they also
use the step data model

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.990
as the underlying structure
for like assembly structure

01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:37.530
and the metadata
and stuff like that.

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:42.830
So we meet with them on a
relatively regular basis,

01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:45.360
and also there's a
PDM implementor forum

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.650
but it's the PDM systems
implementing the steps standard.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:53.510
And that's it.

01:24:53.510 --> 01:25:01.090
[ Applause ]

01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:04.010
&gt;&gt; Jessica Meyerson:
Hello, everyone.

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:07.650
Again, my name is
-- or not again --

01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:10.810
my name is Jessica Meyerson.

01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:14.130
I was a Digital Archivist at the
University of Texas at Austin

01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:16.530
for five years before
taking my current position

01:25:16.530 --> 01:25:20.700
with Educopia Institute and
there I conduct applied research

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:23.490
that advances understanding
of digital preservation

01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:26.200
and scholarly communication
landscapes.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.520
And I proudly serve the members

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.760
of the Software Preservation
Network and it is

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.830
in that capacity that I
get to join you here today.

01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:36.080
And before I begin
allow me to express mine

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.660
and all SPIN participants
and collaborators' thank you

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.080
to The Library of Congress
and the tremendous work

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.380
of the organizing

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.850
and programming committee
for today's summit.

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:46.650
Sincerest thanks
to all of the staff

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:48.960
that have made this event
meaningful for the attendees

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.690
and thanks to all of
you for attending.

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:53.720
We're grateful for the
opportunity to be in dialogue

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.410
with you today and I want
to recognize Matthew Allen

01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:59.110
for introducing me to
the work of Andrew Kovac.

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:02.560
All of the images that I
use today in the slides are

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.410
from Kovac' archive
of the affinities,

01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:06.000
which I highly recommend.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.020
There are citations for each
of the Tumblr citations,

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.150
for each of the images
included in the slides.

01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:19.570
Okay, the first part of my
presentation is the case

01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:22.290
for software as infrastructure.

01:26:22.290 --> 01:26:25.270
So, well, a sneak preview.

01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:29.870
So Susan Leistar, who is an
information infrastructure

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:33.140
scholar, sadly is
no longer with us,

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:36.030
wrote in a paper called The
Ethnography of Infrastructure,

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:38.560
quote, people commonly
envision infrastructure

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.270
as a system of substrates.

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:43.040
It is by definition invisible,
it's part of the background

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.590
for other kinds of
work, end quote.

01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:46.980
Infrastructure is
a fundamentally

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.460
relational concept.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.020
The cook considers the water
system as working infrastructure

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:52.320
and a role to making dinner,

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.140
while for the city
planner it's a variable

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:59.020
in a complex planning process
or a target for repair.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.270
Star and her colleague completed
a study in the early 1990s

01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:05.840
on an online community
called WORM, and concluded

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.170
that infrastructure has
several key characteristics.

01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:09.470
So this is their model.

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.810
And I'm going to present the
case that software has all

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:14.770
of these characteristics with
examples where appropriate

01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.070
from architectural design

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:17.700
and engineering
scholar-practitioners,

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.640
as well as much broader examples
provided by the cofounder

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.720
of Netscape, Mark Anderson,
in his 2011 article,

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.460
Software is Eating the World.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.510
The examples still hold true
and, frankly, even more so.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:33.310
So software is embedded,
it's sunk into and inside

01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:36.420
of other structures, social
arrangements and technologies.

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.440
Anderson writes, more
and more major businesses

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.580
and industries are being
around software delivered

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.630
as online services from
movies to agriculture,

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:47.400
to national defense,
to global finance.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:52.000
Mack U. Allen [assumed
spelling], reviewing

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.020
and exhibit entitled,
Architecture, Architectural

01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:00.530
and Architecture with a capital
A, describes as evidenced

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:01.830
by the works included

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:03.320
in the exhibit how
software is not a part

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.650
of the specific workflow or
phase of architectural design,

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:10.790
but rather that it's embedded
into a creative work routine.

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:14.480
Software is transparent
and specifically

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.260
in this context meaning that it
doesn't have to be reassembled

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:20.090
or reinvented each
time or for each task,

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.990
but that it invisibly
supports those tasks.

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.380
Anderson writes, on the backend
software programming tools

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.120
and internet based
services make it easy

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:29.380
to launch new global
software powered startups

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.990
in many industries
without the need to invest

01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:35.890
in new infrastructure
and train new employees.

01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:38.260
Software has reach and scope,

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:41.490
beyond a single event
or one site practice.

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.420
Anderson writes, software
is also eating much

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.620
of the value chain of industries
that are widely viewed

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.080
as primarily existing
in the physical world.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.110
Software runs engines, it
controls safety features,

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:54.130
it guides drivers
to destinations,

01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:56.890
it powers logistics and
distribution capabilities

01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:59.430
of FedEx, Walmart and the like.

01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:03.000
As is evidenced by discussions
here today the built environment

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.220
often begins in a
software environment.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.350
Software is learned as
part of a membership,

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.140
so similar to the
art of drafting,

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:13.760
specific planning documentation
for the built environment

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.640
and different forms of modeling
certain types of software

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.280
or specific uses of
that software are part

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:20.820
of the repertoire
of a profession

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.280
or a community of practice.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.060
Software is the embodiment
of standards,

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:30.050
so speaking to Katie's
analysis in her dissertation

01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:31.960
of architectural
practice as associated

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.810
with technical system, a
practice has specific needs

01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:37.310
and standardized
workflows or business rules,

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:40.260
some of which can be translated
into the functional requirements

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.320
of software applications.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.470
These applications as
embodiments of standards

01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:47.570
and conventions have their own
impacts on the daily practice

01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:50.280
as they are adopted and adapted.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.030
The use and reuse
of these software

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:55.160
and resulting digital objects
may shape the need or demand

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.090
for changes or enhancements
to the software in the future.

01:29:59.090 --> 01:30:01.950
Software is built on
an installed base.

01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:03.990
All new infrastructure
wrestles with the inertia

01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:05.760
of the installed base.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.720
Software is always wrestling
with existing practices,

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.350
user expectations and tools.

01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:14.300
Software is fixed in
modular increments,

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.120
not all at once or globally.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.750
Because software
exists in a universe

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:20.150
of dependencies you're
always pursuing a fix

01:30:20.150 --> 01:30:22.030
that is the most well contained

01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:24.750
or most loosely coupled
to everything else.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.250
The fix for the Windows XP users
during the WannaCry ransomware

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:32.520
event in May 2017 was a patch,
not a comprehensive upgrade

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.120
for those users from
XP to Windows 10.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.820
What is the smallest
change we can make

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.740
that will repair the
system or bring it back

01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.810
into an operational state?

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:44.190
Because of this software is
in a state of ongoing repair.

01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:48.590
And then finally software
becomes visible on breakdown

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:50.150
and this is what
will problematize.

01:30:50.150 --> 01:30:52.500
And I don't know
if you can see it,

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.970
but the infrastructure is
showing in that photograph.

01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:58.370
It got cut-off a little bit.

01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.670
Your infrastructure is showing.

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:04.540
[laughter] So software
can break, it has bugs,

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.910
but breakdown doesn't
map as well as the others

01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:08.600
because software is so embedded.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:12.260
So to use Anderson's words
consumptive of all structures

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.480
in industries that we
can't decouple the software

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.090
from other substrates in
the system including users,

01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:21.090
the network, the regulatory
framework and the industry.

01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:23.890
I argue that what we mean
by software breakdown

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:25.860
in today's context is
much bigger than that.

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.990
It's better understood
as the access breakdown

01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:31.020
or the inability to
support meaningful access

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.830
to digital information.

01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:34.360
This could be reproducible
science

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.510
and social scientific research
or as McKenzie Smith wrote

01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:41.540
in her 2012 article for AIA
Online, quote, the need to refer

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.130
to an old design, consult
a change order or ASI

01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:47.030
from a completed project,
or consider an addition

01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:49.230
to an old building, end quote.

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:50.890
The access breakdown reveals

01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:54.550
or makes visible the social
structures and practices

01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:57.020
in which the software
is embedded.

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.490
I'll repeat that, the
access breakdown reveals

01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.870
or makes visible the social
structures and practices

01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:03.820
in which the software
is embedded.

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.140
The access breakdown is
a comprehensive breakdown

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:09.190
of social structures to
support information access,

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.840
communication, legal
systems and the market.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.760
And when these social structures
breakdown they produce

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.470
and necessitate system
level change.

01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:22.570
So a little bit more about
the access breakdown.

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.350
Our cultural record is
increasingly made-up

01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:27.480
of complex digital
logics as evidenced

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.750
by discussions here
today, which are coupled

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:33.400
to software both proprietary
and nonproprietary.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.220
And I really, really,
really, really,

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.770
really wish that I could go

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:39.390
into this software
preservation history,

01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:43.480
but this is a timeline
that's complementary to all

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.410
of the amazing work that
Elisa and Tim and Katie shared

01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:51.620
with you earlier today,
that looks at the history

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:55.310
of just the software
preservation discourse and just

01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:57.110
in information science,

01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:59.500
computing history,
and the archives.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.870
So our culture is
increasingly made-up

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:05.450
of complex digital
objects or what Peterson,

01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:09.100
Trudy Huskein Peterson [assumed
spelling] to be exact, termed,

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.830
quote, software dependent
in 1985.

01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:13.780
Evidenced by the 30
plus year discourse

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:16.150
and information studies,
history of computing

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.930
and cultural memory preservation
alone, and that's not

01:33:18.930 --> 01:33:21.120
to say there aren't other
discourse of communities talking

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.880
about this for a long time.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.950
The access breakdown, like
most infrastructure breakdowns,

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:29.560
is relatively to software
slow in the making.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.490
So the access breakdown
necessitates system level change

01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:37.470
that acknowledges
software as infrastructure.

01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:42.410
System level change, so in 1995
Liam Bannon [assumed spelling]

01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:47.040
posted a short piece in ACM
called, The Politics of Design.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.340
Quote, the development

01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.580
of computer based applications
requires the collaboration

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.560
or involvement of a variety
of distinctive communities,

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.280
workers with different
skills using different

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.160
representational frameworks.

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.200
This poses a number of
problems which can't be removed

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.240
by simply ensuring
good communication.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.840
He argues it's more
fundamental than that,

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.470
it arises out of different
practices of the groups.

01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:08.970
So how to construct a shared

01:34:08.970 --> 01:34:11.560
or common information space
among these groups is seen

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.520
as a central concern.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.940
Collective impact is a model

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.270
for understanding
system level change.

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:23.020
Collective impact has
five distinct components.

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:25.510
The common agenda, so engaging
all of the stakeholders

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:27.510
around a problem area
and helping them to come

01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:30.600
to an agreement upon a common
vision or goal for change.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.100
Shared measurement and data

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.010
that helps each group determine
what specific incremental steps

01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:38.930
it can take to continue forward
progress at the system level.

01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:42.000
Mutually reinforcing activities
that meet the vested interest

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.140
in economic drivers of
each stakeholder group

01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.590
and the system, itself.

01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:48.530
Constant communication
and refining of goals

01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:51.520
of the stakeholders, both
individually and as a system.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.980
And a lightweight backbone
comprising focused facilitators

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.080
providing the necessary
connection work.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.990
The Software Preservation
Network is building capacity

01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:03.170
to serve as a lightweight
backbone organization

01:35:03.170 --> 01:35:05.660
that embodies and supports
a collective impact approach

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.500
to software preservation.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:11.770
SPIN was first discussed in a
public forum in 2014 as an idea,

01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:15.570
an idea that was conceptualized
as a logical extension

01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:18.610
of the work spanning that
roughly 30 plus years

01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:21.920
that had come before, including
the Preserving EXE Summit hosted

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.740
at the LOC in 2013.

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:26.240
SPIN believes that software
is important to preserve

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.480
because it is information
in and of itself,

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.540
as well as a dependency to
access other digital objects.

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.880
So the common agenda or mission
that unites SPIN's participants

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.810
and supporters is
to preserve software

01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:41.780
through community engagement,
infrastructure support

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.090
and knowledge generation.

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.980
SPIN defines software
preservation

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.340
at the network level

01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.540
as basically five core
activity areas necessary

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:53.290
for successful software
preservation.

01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:56.310
So the first of these
is research,

01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:57.610
so the research working group

01:35:57.610 --> 01:36:00.740
in SPIN is currently creating
a toolkit that people can use

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.520
to gather data about software
preservation and curation,

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.850
upstream, downstream, that's
all in the scope here,

01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:08.650
in their local communities.

01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:11.280
These shared measurements
and associated data establish

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.940
and understanding of
the problems faced

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.020
as it shifts over time.

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.440
The training and
education group is working

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.250
on two major initiatives,
the translation

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:20.790
of their peer working
group's findings

01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:24.060
into educational materials,
as well as a series

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.440
of software curation
recommendations and guidelines

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:29.910
for data curators and data
management professionals.

01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:32.080
The metadata and
standards group sent

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.440
out a survey earlier this
year to provide a baseline

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.980
of metadata being
used to describe

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:38.820
and manage the preservation
of an access to software,

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:41.210
and based on those findings
even in institutions

01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:43.830
that actively collect software
with policies and agreements

01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:45.650
in place they're
still struggling

01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:48.070
with issues pertaining to
standards, best practice

01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:50.760
and preservation workflows.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.780
The legal policy group is
focused on legal research

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.040
and advocacy pertaining to
copyright and licensing,

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.810
so this includes the
various best practices,

01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:02.080
work that Euan mentioned
earlier that Brendan

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.790
and Peter are very
actively pursuing.

01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:09.580
This also includes the 1201
exemption, so SPIN has partnered

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:12.380
for the last two or so years
with the Cyber Law Clinic

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:14.340
at the Brookman's Client
Center for Internet

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.640
and Society at Harvard.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:20.360
And then on 2018, in 2018
we're looking to expand

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.990
to a comparative legal study
that looks at similar approaches

01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:25.190
in two different
national contexts.

01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:29.090
The technological infrastructure
working group is starting their

01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.970
data gathering at
the consortial level,

01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:33.170
this is digital preservation
consortial level,

01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:35.320
to understand what existing
digital infrastructure

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.670
organizations already
have in place

01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:41.400
to support storage preservation
access and sharing of software

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.280
and metadata associated
with software.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.520
And then the communication
working group

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.570
and the governance working
group are all doing the work

01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:53.380
to support those other
five core activity areas.

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:55.970
We also have affiliated
projects.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:38:00.390
There are currently two
already funded and underway

01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:02.250
that are focusing on areas

01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:05.100
that we feel are really
important with one in tow.

01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:08.140
So those areas would be
broadening participation

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:11.290
in this work, establishing
the various best practices

01:38:11.290 --> 01:38:16.250
for software preservation, and
scaling access to emulation.

01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:20.510
This is a mostly up-to-date
list of organizations, projects

01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:21.810
and programs represented

01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.840
in SPIN's membership
and activities.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.060
As you can see, a lot
of these or if not all

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:32.120
of these are cultural memory
institutions of some sort.

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:35.240
We do have a couple
of different firms

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.360
and we have Software
Heritage, which is focused

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.310
on source codes, specifically
research source code.

01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:43.460
So we have some variation
and we're working

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.380
on that representation.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:48.980
So partner with the
Software Preservation Network

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.510
and let's save software
together.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:39:06.040
[ Applause ]

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Ouellette: Okay, thank
you all for hanging in there.

01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:13.770
An ultimate presentation, okay,
one left to go after mine.

01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:15.500
[laughter] I am so happy
you're hanging in there,

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.050
though, we've been jamming.

01:39:17.050 --> 01:39:22.170
Well, Tim is -- you
do the wrap-up, right?

01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:25.830
We're still jamming information
down their gullets, right?

01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:29.220
I think it's interesting
I have to come all the way

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.370
to Washington, D.C. to meet
two fellow Austin, Texanites.

01:39:33.370 --> 01:39:37.150
It happens all the time.

01:39:37.150 --> 01:39:39.810
I'm actually here
as a representative

01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:42.070
of buildingSMART International.

01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:45.580
Also, in my fulltime job,

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:48.210
which sometimes prevents
my work getting done,

01:39:48.210 --> 01:39:50.680
is with Vectorworks.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:53.560
We're a software
vendor, we're based just

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.440
up the road in Columbia.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.220
And I get to see people

01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:00.140
like Greg Schloizner [assumed
spelling], Roger Grant,

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:03.280
Christine Falon, there are
many of us who are associated

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:06.400
with buildingSMART, both
locally or nationally

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:10.650
and internationally to
sort of promote and put

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:12.120
into practice some of
the ideas I'm going

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.420
to talk about right here.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:14.840
So hang on, here we go.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.450
All right, so I want to talk

01:40:19.450 --> 01:40:22.920
about who is buildingSMART
International, what is IFC,

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:26.790
which is one of the standards
that we deal with, and why,

01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:28.500
why should we worry about IFC,

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.080
why should we be
concerned about it.

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.370
So his buildingSMART
International?

01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:34.570
Simple as this, it's
an international home

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:37.180
of OpenBIM, okay?

01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.630
What do we mean by OpenBIM?

01:40:38.630 --> 01:40:40.830
When we talk about BIM we talk

01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:42.320
about building information
modeling.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.930
When we talk about OpenBIM what
we're trying to do is remove

01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:48.440
that proprietary
layer, we're saying

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.540
that the data is more important
than the tools, themselves.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:55.100
And so as architects, as
engineers, as designers,

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:59.740
as owners, as operators
we should have access

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:03.260
to that information in a
way that's completely free

01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.320
of any particular tool so that
we can move it from tool to tool

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.190
and operate with that
information as we need.

01:41:12.190 --> 01:41:15.750
So as an organization
buildingSMART is international

01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:19.580
and it's supported by the
chapters all over the world,

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.820
and I believe we're
actually up to 18 now,

01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.660
there's about 15 showing there.

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.980
Russia just actually
started their own chapter.

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:30.470
And most of these chapters
are nationally based.

01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:34.160
The Australasian chapter
includes Australia

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.580
and New Zealand and
also Tasmania,

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:40.190
a couple others out there.

01:41:40.190 --> 01:41:44.120
And then the Nordic countries
have a Nordic chapter

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.130
that is also broken down
into one for each country.

01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:49.110
But the idea is is that
we see a perspective

01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:52.480
of the building industry
across the entire globe.

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.480
And this is one of the
things I want to emphasize

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.800
in this talk is dealing
with an expanded context.

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:02.070
I think a lot of times when
we get together in symposiums

01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:06.160
like this and talks about this
we really sort of hyper focus

01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:09.150
on an immediate market
or immediate problem.

01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:12.320
And what we hope to do with
buildingSMART is to get people

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:15.070
to understand that there
is a larger context,

01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:18.930
that this is a problem lots
of people face in many parts

01:42:18.930 --> 01:42:21.390
of the world, if not
all parts of the world,

01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:26.230
crossing multiple languages
and cultures and practices.

01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:30.290
And so that input is necessary
in order to create standards

01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:33.050
that work well for everybody
or at least baselines

01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:35.100
in which everybody
can built upon.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:37.890
And there are a number of people
that are involved that belong

01:42:37.890 --> 01:42:41.820
to this organization
to run the organization

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:48.820
and promote these ideals and
to develop the standards.

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.880
And the three core programs
we work on are things

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.000
like standards, users
and compliance.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.770
By standards that's
developing things we'll see

01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:56.070
in the next slide.

01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:58.230
By users it's an
international user program,

01:42:58.230 --> 01:43:00.020
we're actually engaged
with practitioners,

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.540
we have to bring them to the
table to, A, educate them

01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:05.820
about what the standards are and
why they're useful and then, B,

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.790
how to use those things and, C,
get input back from those people

01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:12.020
to understand what are
the best ways to mature

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.320
and move those forward.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.850
And then finally
there's compliance.

01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:18.500
Like Phil was talking
about with the CAx Forum,

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:23.390
we have certification
of software to be able

01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:27.190
to exchange this data using
IFC, which we'll talk about.

01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:29.470
We have that certification
program that does that.

01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:32.380
So in the building industry
there are applications

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.680
that have been certified
to be able

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.540
to exchange information
with each other.

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:38.550
The challenge is getting
end users to understand that

01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:40.150
and to actually utilize it.

01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:42.920
And then we're also
launching soon a professional

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:46.100
certification which says,
hey, I not only understand BIM

01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:48.790
but I understand OpenBIM
at a professional level

01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.140
as an individual but
also as a business level

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.480
and an organization level.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:56.980
So buildingSMART is a
conglomeration of companies

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.560
and organizations that
are putting their money

01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.860
where their mouth is.

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.170
At different levels of
support and sponsorship

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.470
in many different parts

01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:08.570
of the world they're saying this
matters to us, we see the value

01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:11.140
of trying to provide
standards for the industry

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:13.210
across all the different
processes,

01:44:13.210 --> 01:44:16.820
and so we're putting money
in in order to fund all

01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.730
of the activities
that are necessary

01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:20.440
for this to move forward.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.390
And essentially what do we do?

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:25.500
So simple as this, we develop

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.880
and maintain open
international standards for BIM.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.660
As I said before, how do we
remove that proprietary layer

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.540
from the exchange of data?

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.610
And there are three main
or three core standards

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:39.020
that we really deal with.

01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:40.320
Information delivery manual

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.980
which essentially is how do
you establish the business case

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:47.150
for exchanging data or
storing this data, right?

01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:49.620
Greg was alluding to this
earlier about there has

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:53.300
to be a business
value, that makes sense.

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.000
So if we can establish what
those business values are then

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.970
we can begin to build the
standards and the technology

01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:03.320
that then support
all of those values.

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.350
The industry foundation classes
is really the technical part

01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:12.020
of our standards, and this is
the technical specification

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.270
or the data model for
that free exchange.

01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:16.800
And then there's the
international framework

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:19.530
for dictionaries, or as Roger
will talk about this idea

01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:21.920
of the buildingSMART
data dictionary,

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.330
is how then do we cross all
of these cultural and market

01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:29.110
and language lines to
have common understandings

01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:32.930
of what building elements are
and what materials are so that

01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:37.220
when somebody says it in one
language we know immediately

01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:39.630
through translation what it
means in another language.

01:45:39.630 --> 01:45:42.720
And that's no small
thing because we live

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.200
in a global market now, right,
we are in a global industry,

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.570
we get parts from all
other parts of the world.

01:45:49.570 --> 01:45:51.340
We can have designers
from multiple parts

01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:53.000
of the world working together.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.520
So we have to have those
layers of understanding.

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:57.870
And it's not just about design,

01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:01.200
this is about the entire
lifecycle of the building.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.300
In effect a reiterative
lifecycle of the building

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.500
in which when you come
to decommissioning,

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.780
the end of the lifecycle
of a building,

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.080
if we can gather enough data

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.900
about that building's
performance over its lifecycle

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:15.610
that gives us more
information to then turnaround

01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:18.250
and do a better job
on the next building.

01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:21.520
Or decide what do we do with
all of those old assets,

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:24.460
can we recycle them, can we
reuse them, if we download them

01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:25.840
where are they going to?

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.140
We can capture a lot

01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.570
of information throughout
the entire lifecycle.

01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:32.570
And buildingSMART International

01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:35.570
as an international organization
is a standards organization

01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:38.860
and works through multiple
organizations primarily

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:41.240
at the top ISO, right?

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:45.790
This all exists internationally
because of ISO, but we also work

01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:48.210
with other national
standards organizations.

01:46:48.210 --> 01:46:51.250
So, for example, in a regional
sense we deal with CEN,

01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:52.760
which deals with all of Europe,

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:54.460
but then within CEN
you have things

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.760
like the British standards

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.980
and you have the
German DIN standards.

01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.600
And when something is accepted

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.990
at the ISO level it
trickles on down.

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:04.150
Now we also get things
from ISO in order

01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:08.180
to feed the IFC standard and
step is one of those, step,

01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:12.970
IFC is actually a derivative of
step and we use XML, we use X3D,

01:47:12.970 --> 01:47:15.150
these are all other
ISO standards that feed

01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:18.280
into what we're doing so that
we're not really reinventing the

01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.040
wheel, we're using best
practices and best standards

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.870
that are already out there.

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.170
And in the end what
you really need

01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:28.430
to understand is
buildingSMART are people.

01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:30.270
So this is a photo that
was taken just a couple

01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:31.910
of weeks ago in London.

01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:33.210
Greg is in there somewhere.

01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:35.000
Roger is in there somewhere.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.610
Where we all got together and
we talk about these issues,

01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:42.190
we talk about what are ways
to improve the coverage

01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:43.890
of IFC throughout the
built environment?

01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:47.970
What are the use cases
for exchanging data

01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:50.230
between different stakeholders?

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:51.530
You know, what are
these projects

01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:53.430
that we can bring together and
make it more useful for people?

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:56.800
How do we promote it to
the rest of the world?

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.540
Okay, so as I said,
three main standards.

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.200
The one I really want to
talk about today is IFC

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.310
because in this context

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:06.060
of how do we preserve
information this is the one

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:07.730
that matters really the most.

01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:12.320
So IFC in its essence
is just a description

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:17.430
of the built environment
that's open public standard.

01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:21.460
It's nonproprietary, no vendor
owns it, can control it, right?

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.020
It belongs to the world.

01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:24.560
It's free to access.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:28.010
And the whole idea is that
in that description it's

01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:30.240
about geometry and
information, not data,

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.800
because the data side just
once told me he says data is

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.660
for computers, information
is for people.

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:38.380
It's context, it's semantics.

01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:42.630
So if I look at an example of
a piece of geometry I can look

01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:44.110
at it and say, well, what is it?

01:48:44.110 --> 01:48:45.610
This means nothing, it looks

01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:48.400
like something, but
I could guess.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.830
And what IFC does is it has data
structures in there that says,

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:56.420
okay, well, as geometry is this
a solid or is it a surface,

01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:59.460
you know, what level of
complexity of it is there?

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.260
What is it, what is
it in relationship

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.090
to how we think of buildings?

01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:07.590
Is it a column, is it
a duct, is it a pile,

01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:09.730
is it a piece of a wall, right?

01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:11.030
And then what are
the attributes,

01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:13.120
what are the properties to
it, how do I identify it?

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.360
What are its physical
attributes?

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.340
What is its performance
values, and how do we use

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:23.270
or how do we classify it in
terms of these other systems

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:29.280
when we do the costing
or mapping to systems

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.140
for tracking processes, right?

01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:35.180
And then what are
the relationships?

01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.400
When then I can see, I can
determine is something external

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.700
to the building or
internal to the building.

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:41.670
Is it being supported by or is
it supporting something else?

01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:42.970
Is it within a particular room?

01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:44.950
Is it within a particular wall?

01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:47.500
So then I can say, hey,
this particular piece

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:50.720
of geometry has all of
this data attached to it,

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:53.700
it has an understanding of
what it is and I can query it

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.650
and I can look at it and
I can get a better sense

01:49:55.650 --> 01:49:58.730
of what's going on
and what it is.

01:49:58.730 --> 01:50:03.220
But it even stretches out to
understand the built environment

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:05.110
as we understand the
built environment.

01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:07.320
There's a project level,
there's the site level,

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320
there's the building level,
and then there's all the pieces

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.690
that become a part of it.

01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:13.870
And it's not just about objects,
but it's also about this idea

01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:18.320
of controls, of performance
history, of processes,

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.430
of the people that are
actually assigned or a part

01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:25.290
of these objects
and these processes.

01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:26.670
And it's more than
just buildings now.

01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:28.370
We're currently in a
phase where we're looking

01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:30.970
at describing the
entire built environment.

01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:34.400
Infrastructure is now being
worked on by multiple countries,

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.730
describing roads, bridges,
railways, tunneling.

01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:41.610
We're not going to
stop at buildings.

01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:43.460
And this has been
going on for some time,

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:47.730
so over 21 years,
31 years, oh, jeez.

01:50:47.730 --> 01:50:52.370
And it began with an alliance
with Autodesk and trying

01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:53.900
to determine how
do they get data

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.540
between all these different
permutations of the platform

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.490
and has turned into
something greater than that

01:50:58.490 --> 01:51:00.650
and involves a lot of
different people and a lot

01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:03.350
of different applications.

01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:05.850
IFC can be expressed
in multiple ways.

01:51:05.850 --> 01:51:07.550
We're talking about
the step file,

01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:10.670
but there's also using
computer science best practices

01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:14.710
as being able to exchange this
information using XML formats.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:17.270
And being able to zip these
things up into containers

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.810
that can be exchanged
more efficiently.

01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:21.630
But the future is
looking even better.

01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:23.290
It's really amazing as we look

01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:25.330
at what computer science
has done over the last 10

01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.190
to 15 years, how can we apply

01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:29.810
that to what we're trying
to do with our data?

01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:32.020
When can we get to the point
where we're no longer talking

01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.890
about file exchange,
but we're simply talking

01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:36.490
about querying tool to tool and
we're streaming data around,

01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:40.600
where we're saving all
of it somewhere or linked

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.790
in multiple places
and we're able

01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:45.600
to bring information
together at that point of use

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.220
and the point of need?

01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:49.460
So we're beginning to follow
along what's happening

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.190
in the greater computing
industry

01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:54.160
to really mature the
standard and how we use data.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:57.970
And in the end it's the
best way to communicate

01:51:57.970 --> 01:52:00.850
to building data
globally without barriers.

01:52:00.850 --> 01:52:04.070
There's no other option
really out there that gives us

01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:08.140
that ability of determining
semantics and context

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:12.070
and description and processes.

01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:17.830
And we're doing this because
the software industry globally

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:19.460
is large.

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.120
I know there's a lot
of talk about vendor A,

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.420
I hear this all the time, right?

01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.440
You can imagine how many of
these conferences I go to

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.130
and it's all about this,
it's all about this.

01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:34.210
Yet if I look globally
there are hundreds,

01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:36.110
over a thousand different
software companies

01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:40.820
that serve all of their markets
very well with many users,

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:43.560
and they all have data that
needs to work together in order

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:47.470
to accomplish the idea of
designing, procuring, building

01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:50.090
and operating buildings.

01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:51.540
Because if I work on this

01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:55.510
as a tool centric methodology
it requires a lot of work

01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:58.390
for one vendor to connect to
a bunch of different vendors.

01:52:58.390 --> 01:53:01.400
And instead what we need to do
is we need to turn this model

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:04.530
from being tool centric
into being data centric

01:53:04.530 --> 01:53:06.970
because this is expensive
for a developer

01:53:06.970 --> 01:53:09.570
to do, it's very expensive.

01:53:09.570 --> 01:53:12.200
So if I move the model
from application centric

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.480
to content centric I may do
about the same amount of work

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.380
to get two applications
to talk to each other,

01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.680
but when I get beyond

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:21.490
that one-to-one relationship
it becomes more difficult

01:53:21.490 --> 01:53:23.160
for somebody.

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.420
And if I'm dealing with many
partners that are trying

01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.030
to speak to each other there's a
lot of work that has to be done,

01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:29.700
and then lots of
things are broken

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.880
as each individual person
revises their content

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.500
or revises their applications.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.930
So if we're all working
on establishing

01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:40.530
or supporting a single standard
we all do the same amount

01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:43.800
of work and in the end what
we're doing is were doing less

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.180
work, we're lowering
the threshold for more

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:49.670
and more people to come
in and utilize that data

01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:51.870
and be valuable to the process

01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:54.760
and we're creating a larger
ecosystem for the end users,

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.880
for the market who want this
data, who want these tools

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.190
to do more and more stuff.

01:54:00.190 --> 01:54:03.190
Because in the end what
happens is if we rely

01:54:03.190 --> 01:54:06.800
on a tool centric model, if
you invest into a platform

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.770
and that platform doesn't
contain certain functionalities

01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:12.310
that are necessary for
your business process

01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:14.390
that means you don't do them.

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:16.760
Now is that acceptable?

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.440
If you were to say, hey,
you can buy a Ford vehicle,

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:21.800
but you can't drive on
any of the interstates,

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.470
would that be acceptable?

01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:27.790
So why do we accept that
in the building industry?

01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:31.390
And owners and designers need
to turnaround and force us

01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:33.810
as vendors to say you
need to support this

01:54:33.810 --> 01:54:36.940
because our data is more
important than your tools are.

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:41.280
So the whole point is this
is about creating value

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.280
in the data, that
you own the data

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.930
when it's open format, right?

01:54:46.930 --> 01:54:49.010
Otherwise you have to have an
explicit agreement with each

01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:51.960
of your vendors and if you stop
paying the vendors you stop

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:54.460
having access to that data.

01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:58.390
Every owner should hear
that statement and go is

01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:02.890
that acceptable,
is that acceptable?

01:55:02.890 --> 01:55:06.580
If you can't access it 10 years
down the road what was the point

01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:09.770
of even aggregating all
of it in the first place?

01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.690
So you have that
ability, it has longevity.

01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:15.030
And as a standard that we
provide we're also providing

01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:16.740
this ability to making
it extensible.

01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:19.770
You can keep building
on that data over time.

01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:21.990
We don't have these radical
changes in the standard

01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:26.920
that says, oh, well, now
like miniCAD 5 I can't open

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.560
in VectorWorks 2019, it's
almost impossible to do.

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.120
But with IFC files, with these
IFC standard I can always build

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:41.220
tools on top of those old
IFC files and access them.

01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:44.690
So for more information
go to buildingsmart.org,

01:55:44.690 --> 01:55:47.030
there's a technical site
that deals with developers,

01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:49.340
and those who are
interested contact me,

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.510
I'd love to tell you more.

01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:58.810
[ Applause ]

01:55:58.810 --> 01:56:04.110
&gt;&gt; Roger Grant: Hello, and
thank you for the opportunity

01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:07.350
to be here to share
some thoughts,

01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:10.030
ideas and some work with you.

01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:11.440
I'm Roger Grant.

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.270
I'm the Program Director
at the National Institute

01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:19.060
of Building Sciences or
some people know us as NIBS.

01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:21.970
We are a nonprofit
here in Washington,

01:56:21.970 --> 01:56:26.260
D.C. that was created by the
Congress, but we are funded

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.790
from work we do primarily for
Federal agencies to help them

01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:33.480
with their building programs,
a whole range of things

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.590
from how do you respond
to earthquakes,

01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:39.390
to how do you manage the
information in your building.

01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:42.480
So I'm going to talk
about that aspect of it.

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:44.270
As Jeff said, I'm also involved

01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:45.580
with buildingSMART
International.

01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:48.680
I lead the Product Room at
buildingSMART International,

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.980
and our primary focus is
on all the information

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.750
that really sits outside of
models, but contributes a lot

01:56:57.750 --> 01:57:01.290
to the building process,
standards, specifications,

01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:07.280
procurement information,
data or information

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:11.180
about all the products
that go into buildings.

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:16.190
So I'm going to be coming
from those two contexts.

01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:18.880
This is out of the National
BIM Standard and since we're

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.390
at a library I thought we should
have a good definition of BIM.

01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:25.490
So you can find this at the BIM
Standard, but it's pretty good

01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:28.070
for one sentence about
what we're trying to do

01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:33.030
with information across the
lifecycle and functional

01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:35.900
and physical characteristics
of a building.

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:38.330
So I know we're here to
talk about archiving,

01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:42.410
but I think what Jeff was
referencing was how we use

01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:44.810
standards to organize
information, and I'm going

01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:46.830
to talk about that
aspect of it, too.

01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:50.150
I think of we don't have well
organized information it makes

01:57:50.150 --> 01:57:53.980
the problem of archiving it and
reusing it a lot more difficult.

01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:57.260
So most of our work is really
focused on how do we organize

01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:02.370
and get value out of information
and apply it to solve problems.

01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:05.210
I'm going to go through a couple
slides here real quickly to kind

01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:08.550
of set it up, and then I'm
going to share some use cases

01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:10.770
of projects we've
worked on for agencies

01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:12.900
where they have been
implementing some

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.340
of these concepts.

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:18.620
And so this is, you know, I just
want to point out that a model

01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:22.260
and IFC gives us a
structured way to do this,

01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:26.640
but the good thing about a
model is it consists of objects

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.290
and those objects
have properties.

01:58:28.290 --> 01:58:31.620
And once you've identified
those things as the key aspect

01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:34.980
of a building you can attach
a lot of other things to them.

01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:37.370
You can structure the
properties in an organized way.

01:58:37.370 --> 01:58:40.130
You can put identifiers on
them that let you find them

01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:42.220
in all kinds of other
applications.

01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:46.420
You can embed specifications
that say more about it

01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.810
in language that
people can understand.

01:58:48.810 --> 01:58:50.950
You can connect it to
external information.

01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:52.870
So that's the interesting thing.

01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:55.670
And the model, we spend
a lot of time looking

01:58:55.670 --> 01:58:58.170
at how do you replicate
the graphics that were done

01:58:58.170 --> 01:59:00.130
in all kinds of different
systems?

01:59:00.130 --> 01:59:04.420
But a lot of the value in
using models is in the data

01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:08.250
or the information that
gets attached to them.

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:12.720
It's not trivial to think
about the information, itself,

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:15.230
and I've borrowed
this from Kimono Numa,

01:59:15.230 --> 01:59:17.310
who works with us on
a lot of projects.

01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:23.580
And the idea that platforms
and separating information

01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:26.400
from the applications is
critical, and we're sort

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.540
of viewed as being behind
in the building industry

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.570
and I think that's relatively
well accepted in our adoption

01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:34.820
of technology, but we can
look to others like Telcom

01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:37.120
and what they've been
able to do and think

01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.470
about how it applies to us.

01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:41.620
You know, inside owner
organizations there's tons

01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:44.870
of valuable information,
but it's in databases

01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:47.590
that were created years
ago, they have structures

01:59:47.590 --> 01:59:50.230
that have gotten a little
out of whack over time.

01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:53.520
But it's still there and
a lot of it is good data

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:57.060
and if you can reorganize
it, apply some standards

01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:59.080
to it you can make
it a lot more useful.

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.580
The key thing is starting by
separating the information

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.710
from the applications, the key
information that is valuable

02:00:05.710 --> 02:00:07.770
to how you run your business.

02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:09.960
I'm not going to say
too much about this,

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:14.380
but other than to say
this is a way to be able

02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:17.650
to preserve information if you
have it logically organized.

02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:20.330
And a lot of it is tabular data,

02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:24.060
it's data about the
things that you're doing.

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:27.090
It's nice to represent it with
models and there's some things

02:00:27.090 --> 02:00:28.800
that you can't do
without a model,

02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.850
but a lot of it is
about the data.

02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:34.400
And also in the case of the
Government it's real important

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.920
to use standards because
you can't be proprietary

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.010
about the tools you request.

02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:43.310
So if you have an open
standard you can reference that

02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:45.510
and you can ask for tools
that comply with it,

02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:47.730
and that's really important.

02:00:47.730 --> 02:00:49.820
There's another important
thing on that slide was legacy.

02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:52.970
We're never going to
remake every legacy system

02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:56.670
to follow a standard, but if
it's structured well enough

02:00:56.670 --> 02:01:00.330
that we can map standards
to it then we can share it

02:01:00.330 --> 02:01:03.520
with all the other processes
that are out there that we want

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:06.580
to connect to and then I
think we can also have a way

02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.650
to keep track of it over time.

02:01:11.650 --> 02:01:14.420
We need the information to
be useable, that's important,

02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:18.160
but useable is a lot different
in a lot of different context.

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:21.520
I mean if I want to say this is
a space what do I need to know

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.200
about it, but if I also want

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.060
to capture the lighting
requirements and the air changes

02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:27.650
and everything in it
we need different kinds

02:01:27.650 --> 02:01:30.940
of information to do that.

02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.400
But without the information
we can't make good decisions,

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.810
so we really want to figure out
how do we organize information

02:01:36.810 --> 02:01:39.590
in a way that can support the
decisions that we need to make

02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:44.330
and give us the ability to
make it useful over time,

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:45.830
not just in one sense.

02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:50.090
And I guess I put this on
here because, I don't know,

02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:51.390
what are we trying to solve?

02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:53.480
Well, at the end of the
day we're really doing this

02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:55.940
because we want to make things
better and more efficient.

02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:58.410
I mean it's fun to talk about
computers and how they work,

02:01:58.410 --> 02:02:03.810
but if we can't lower cost,
if we can't use less resources

02:02:03.810 --> 02:02:06.500
in the environment it probably
doesn't matter all that much.

02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:09.580
And so the Brits are kind
of an interesting study

02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:12.630
because they have one
agency that manages building

02:02:12.630 --> 02:02:16.730
for the whole Government
and they take a macro view

02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:19.790
of how the building industry
supports everything they're

02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:22.610
doing, and they have
set targets,

02:02:22.610 --> 02:02:25.230
they've got this whole
program on level one,

02:02:25.230 --> 02:02:27.430
level two, level three BIM.

02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:29.250
BIM is at the core
of it for them

02:02:29.250 --> 02:02:31.740
to make their processes better,

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:34.110
and they've actually
upped their targets

02:02:34.110 --> 02:02:37.210
on what they think they
can do to lower cost,

02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:40.590
to make their country more
productive, to reduce emissions.

02:02:40.590 --> 02:02:44.640
So it's just good to keep in
mind why we're doing this stuff.

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:46.930
I don't have to talk about this
because Jeff did a good job

02:02:46.930 --> 02:02:48.780
of describing the
buildingSMART standards.

02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:52.110
But one thing is to get your
information organized in a way

02:02:52.110 --> 02:02:54.540
that it's logical and
you can access it.

02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.350
The next thing is to
apply standards to it

02:02:56.350 --> 02:03:01.270
so others can efficiently
utilize your information.

02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:03.250
It's one thing to
organize it for yourself,

02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:04.550
but it's another
thing to open it

02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:07.290
up so others can
use it efficiently.

02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:08.870
So what we've been
trying to do is look

02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:10.840
at how can we apply
buildingSMART's standards

02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.340
in some kind of a process
so that we could replicate.

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.330
And we've been experimenting
with this

02:03:16.330 --> 02:03:17.630
on several projects now.

02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:20.850
Somebody said there's no one
solution and that's really true,

02:03:20.850 --> 02:03:23.920
and you'd have to experiment
to find a good solution.

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:26.860
But IFC is the best way
to document buildings,

02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:30.390
and there's some
connected processes, IDM.

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:32.990
It's important to know what
you're trying to accomplish,

02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:36.080
where it fits into the bigger
picture, IDM lets you do

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.880
that by having a process map

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.730
and defining exchanges
of information.

02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:43.210
And then within the realm
of IFC there's a way

02:03:43.210 --> 02:03:46.960
to document those exchanges
so that they can be captured

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.360
in software, and that's really
important because we don't want

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.290
to do this stuff with
pencil and paper.

02:03:51.290 --> 02:03:54.080
We want to automate
it and digitize it.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.660
And we think it's also, we think
every exchange should have a

02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:59.900
specification that says
what you're trying to do,

02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:01.240
who wants the information,

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.150
who is the sender,
who is the receiver.

02:04:03.150 --> 02:04:05.330
And what is it, if
there's a dictionary,

02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:08.010
a data dictionary associated
with it that tells you

02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:10.580
in multiple languages, because
this stuff is being used

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:14.690
and reused all over the
world, what's in that exchange

02:04:14.690 --> 02:04:17.320
and then you can put
that into applications.

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:21.920
And we can do a better job of
standardizing these processes.

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.550
I guess Greg said,
what's the business case?

02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:26.720
Well, the business
case is we have

02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.320
to invest a little more
upfront to save a little more

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.990
on the backend, and that's
really in the owner's realm.

02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:35.270
So I think where a lot
of the opportunity comes

02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:38.680
to push this forward is for
owners and they're the ones

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:42.660
who also need to archive this
information about these assets.

02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:44.480
So the first use
case I want to talk

02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.900
about is some work we
did for Federal Highway.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.560
They were trying to say how
can we have a standard for how

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:53.310
to get digital models
of bridges, you know,

02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:55.920
every piece of infrastructure
in the contract?

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:59.080
You deliver a drawing that
says the requirements on it,

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.430
but if we want to move to
modeling we need a way to do

02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:04.480
that that is standardized,
that can be replicated,

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:08.320
that's not based on one
vendor's software solution.

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.030
And so they were
looking at options.

02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:14.180
We explored using the IFC,
the buildingSMART tools

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:16.260
as the foundation for this.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:19.660
We developed an IDM that for
the entire bridge construction

02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:22.600
process we focused on
one of the exchanges,

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:24.420
designed to construction.

02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.800
We, importantly, took
some real examples

02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:28.710
and actually modeled them

02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:31.580
and developed the
requirements from real examples.

02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:33.590
So really it's important
to begin at the end

02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:34.890
and work your way backwards,

02:05:34.890 --> 02:05:37.270
and that's what this project
gave us the ability to do.

02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:39.830
We were able to develop
a process map

02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:41.580
and the exchange specification.

02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:46.580
We worked with Georgia Tech,
we worked with a specialist

02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:49.470
in modeling and within IFC.

02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:52.000
And now this project is
continuing to move forward.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.730
AASHTO is picking
up the development

02:05:54.730 --> 02:05:56.030
of a national standard,

02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:58.750
they have projects
going now in this realm.

02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:01.540
So we're talking a lot
about documenting buildings,

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:04.910
but documenting infrastructure
is really important

02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:07.910
if we're going to add all
kinds of services on top of it.

02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:10.990
And one interesting thing in
the infrastructure market,

02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:14.840
there's 50 owners of our
infrastructure assets

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:18.850
in this country, there's
not 50,000 like there are

02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:20.690
for buildings or
500,000 or whatever.

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:23.490
So they have some power to
consolidate what's going on.

02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:25.410
And there's a lot
happening worldwide in this,

02:06:25.410 --> 02:06:28.020
so there's a lot
they're borrowing from.

02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:31.300
So in the building realm
we only have process,

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.600
we don't have a process
map for buildings

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.180
but the buildingSMART
alliance is working on it.

02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:38.620
So I just put this in here,
I don't have time to talk

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.800
about it, but we need to be
able to know what's the process

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.490
and what are the exchanges.

02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:47.350
And inside of a process are
these uses, and it's important

02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:51.710
to also define the
uses that you want

02:06:51.710 --> 02:06:55.200
to have processes to support.

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.550
So these were developed by,
identified by Penn State --

02:06:58.550 --> 02:07:00.120
put them on this slide.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:03.640
And so this is another
project for Defense Health

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.890
in the Veteran and VA to take --

02:07:06.890 --> 02:07:08.720
space management is
very important for them

02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:12.080
and equipment management in
their facilities so they need

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:15.650
to identify the spaces and
what equipment goes into them.

02:07:15.650 --> 02:07:17.930
This was all in PDF documents.

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:22.040
We worked with them with
Anuma to convert this to data,

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:25.690
take all the information out of
the PDFs, put it into databases,

02:07:25.690 --> 02:07:30.970
and also expose it
to their consultants

02:07:30.970 --> 02:07:34.300
so they could get access to the
requirements from a web service.

02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:37.960
It's all posted on max.gov,
and this tool you can look

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:40.650
at it online helps you to
organize that information

02:07:40.650 --> 02:07:43.140
and parse it out so it
can be put into models.

02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:48.450
It's got an equipment database
connected to it, as well.

02:07:48.450 --> 02:07:50.470
I'm kind of giving you
a quick overview here

02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:52.680
because I'm going
to run out of time.

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:54.350
But we're also working
on projects

02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:56.260
for the Department of State.

02:07:56.260 --> 02:07:57.740
They have an interesting
challenge,

02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:02.740
they have a worldwide portfolio
of like over 12,000 assets

02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.840
and missions in multiple
countries

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:06.940
that speak multiple languages,

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.380
and they have an
ongoing building program,

02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:11.680
so how do they organize
all of that?

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:14.330
So we've focused on
several of these use cases

02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:15.630
as a starting point,

02:08:15.630 --> 02:08:18.780
in particular space planning
is real important to them,

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:22.270
and we started to look at
how they do space measurement

02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:25.650
and there's a number of
different ways to measure space.

02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:28.630
And so you see that when
you look at the results

02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:31.320
in different systems and
there's also a number

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:32.780
of different ways you
might name things.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:36.520
And all of our organizations
over time, you know, we develop,

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.080
we get different
names for things,

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.360
and actually naming
is real important

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:44.180
as a fundamental starting point,
but just having it consistent

02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:46.120
in a way that you can --
and put it in someplace

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.660
that you can say this
is the source of truth

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.820
and then you can point the
rest of your organization to it

02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:52.120
and you can start
to build on it.

02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:55.240
So this is really the
starting point, and we've gone

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.300
through this by looking
first at, you know,

02:08:57.300 --> 02:08:59.690
to get space organized we've
gone through this process,

02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:03.020
look at coordinated, the
standards and the guides

02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:05.840
about the information, look

02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:08.820
at now we'll apply industry
standards, we'll continue

02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:12.250
to do that, but first let's
get the information organized.

02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:14.450
It's then developed
ways to communicate

02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:19.010
out to your consultants so that
comes in through execution plans

02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:23.870
and documents that
your contract documents

02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:25.680
and those need to be updated.

02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:28.370
And we also want to move,
and Jeff mentioned this,

02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:29.930
to being able to validate.

02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:31.310
Having a specification

02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:35.140
for information let's you
automate the validation process,

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:38.230
and I think the whole area
of design review is one

02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:42.050
that we need to continue to
evolve to move away from,

02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:44.370
to move to its much
automated designer view

02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:46.030
as we possibly can.

02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:47.330
Of course, we need
to train people,

02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:52.320
but the end result is we can
rationalize what we call things

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:55.450
and how we measure things
and communicate that

02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:58.290
and have it work a
lot more efficiently.

02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:00.820
I'm not going to talk
about COBie at all,

02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:04.010
but COBie is an excellent way.

02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:06.590
It uses IFC, it's widely used,

02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:08.670
it's a way to organize
information.

02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:12.300
But I do want to spend a little
time just sharing with you

02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:14.580
about a use case we've
worked on for GSA.

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:18.430
GSA has been working
on BIM for a long time

02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:20.330
and how to implement it.

02:10:20.330 --> 02:10:21.630
They've got a lot of guides,

02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:25.450
they did the first information
exchange specification

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:29.480
for spatial program
validation that's been in use.

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:31.130
And we've been recently
working with them

02:10:31.130 --> 02:10:35.410
to move this concept further
along, and we've been working

02:10:35.410 --> 02:10:37.220
on a use case for
energy analysis

02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:42.900
to say our buildings use energy,
we have baseline standards,

02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:47.840
we have modeling of energy and
design, energy uses and design.

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:49.880
And then when the building
is operated we have actual

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:51.180
energy usage.

02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:54.260
But all that stuff is relating
back to the same systems,

02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:58.610
and so if we can put together
a model to evaluate that,

02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:01.550
that could be valuable for
operating the building.

02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:03.840
So we did a process
model of this.

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:10.690
We took an 8-story real building
that had lots of systems in it

02:11:10.690 --> 02:11:14.420
and we used that
as a case study.

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:19.170
Then we mapped the ASHRAE
90.1 as the baseline standard,

02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:22.750
EnergyPlus for building,
for doing the modeling,

02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:27.010
and Project Haystack
for the controls data,

02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:29.610
and we mapped all that to IFC.

02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:33.210
So now there's a specification
for how a model needs

02:11:33.210 --> 02:11:36.850
to be configured to
provide, there will be,

02:11:36.850 --> 02:11:40.600
for how to provide the data
for doing analysis and also

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.910
for measuring once the
building has been put

02:11:42.910 --> 02:11:45.520
into operation, the meter data.

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:51.080
So GSA plans to share the
specification for this

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.400
at some point once the
project is completed,

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.860
and I think it'll be
an interesting thing

02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:57.430
that can be reused.

02:11:57.430 --> 02:12:00.510
I know I'm almost out of time, I
know I'm virtually out of time,

02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:03.060
but I'm going to just do a
couple more quick things.

02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.060
So that I really talked about.

02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:09.260
And this idea of having
a process is important,

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:11.810
and I think this is something
that needs to continue

02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:15.370
to evolve, but how do we define
requirements, how do we publish,

02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:19.130
extend and implement it in
software and then validate it.

02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:23.760
So this is what we're
basing these projects on.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:25.770
And the other important
thing is having a place

02:12:25.770 --> 02:12:28.290
to archive information
that you've produced

02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:30.250
so it can be accessed by others.

02:12:30.250 --> 02:12:33.360
And so at NIBS we have
the National BIM Standard,

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:36.860
which holds the COBie
exchange and other exchanges,

02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:38.160
and these things we're working

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:41.010
on for agencies will
ultimately end up there

02:12:41.010 --> 02:12:43.440
so that we can use the
reference standards,

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:45.860
use national standards
and publish this stuff

02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:48.610
and make it available
for industry to use.

02:12:48.610 --> 02:12:51.990
And the process that's
documented there is really good

02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:54.670
for how do you develop
information exchanges

02:12:54.670 --> 02:12:57.660
and make those useful.

02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:00.060
We're kind of at a phase
where we're moving out now

02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:03.030
to implement this in software,
so we're going to find

02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:08.440
out how this works with
GSA's activities fully.

02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:12.830
And this is kind of complemented
by this guide for owners

02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:15.240
to help them organize their
information because I think

02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:18.790
if you don't ask for it in
the right way you're not going

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:20.720
to get it in the right
way, and as we heard

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.990
if you're not validating it

02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:25.740
against your requirements you
may not get what you think

02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.040
you're getting.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.100
So you need to know
how to structure things

02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:32.050
so you get what you want.

02:13:32.050 --> 02:13:34.800
So there's a lot of good
information out there,

02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:36.340
there's a lot of
progress being made,

02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:39.860
and it's an interesting
area to work in.

02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:41.660
Thank you.

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:50.150
[ Applause ]

02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:51.610
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:52.910
Well, that's not too far over.

02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:55.260
And we still have 10
minutes for questions.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:57.550
So any questions?

02:13:57.550 --> 02:14:06.090
&gt;&gt; I've got a couple if
nobody else does yet.

02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:10.500
Okay, I'll start.

02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:18.710
Adoption, so my question is
for both buildingSMART and CAx,

02:14:18.710 --> 02:14:21.850
you guys had tons of logos

02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:23.890
of who is supporting
the initiatives,

02:14:23.890 --> 02:14:26.580
but it's been described
particularly

02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:29.080
in the architectural world that
there's a problem with adoption.

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.120
So what's the difference
in challenges

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.130
between people recognizing,
a broad recognition

02:14:34.130 --> 02:14:36.200
that these things need to
happen and investing in them,

02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.650
but then adopting
them, what's the --

02:14:38.650 --> 02:14:41.920
can you talk about
that a little bit?

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:49.010
&gt;&gt; Jeff Ouellette: So from the
buildingSMART perspective the

02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:51.310
vendors have worked a lot,

02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:53.540
especially in the
last five years,

02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:57.990
on implementing these
standards in the software.

02:14:57.990 --> 02:15:03.580
Prior to that time we will
admit, I will admit as Chair

02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:06.700
of the group, that there
was a lackluster effort

02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:09.690
by a lot of the participants.

02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:12.860
Fortunately, the demands by
mainly European Governments

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:15.170
and European organizations
have pushed that further,

02:15:15.170 --> 02:15:19.120
pushed it to the point where
they say you cannot sell,

02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:22.690
or your end users in our
countries will not be able

02:15:22.690 --> 02:15:26.180
to provide services to us
unless they use software

02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:28.110
that interoperable.

02:15:28.110 --> 02:15:31.060
And so that really
lit a fire under a lot

02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:36.160
of people's backsides and that
provides a business case then

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:38.830
that says then we
must support this.

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:42.930
The next challenge then, of
course, is to get the end users

02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:46.250
to recognize that that
capability is in their software

02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:48.840
and that they can use it, and
that we make it easy enough

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:51.320
for them to use, which I think
we do a pretty good job of,

02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.110
but they need to
understand that it's there.

02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:56.650
Yes, Christine, we
could do a lot better.

02:15:56.650 --> 02:16:01.210
But think of it as
version 1.0 and, you know,

02:16:01.210 --> 02:16:02.510
some of us who know our way

02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:03.810
around this application
a little better

02:16:03.810 --> 02:16:06.420
than others can make
it do magical things,

02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:08.760
but there is the
ability to at least do it

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:11.680
to a rudimentary level, so.

02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:19.600
&gt;&gt; Phil Rosche: I wouldn't say
that our experience has been

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.910
that much different than yours.

02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:24.250
And I think recent
-- is this thing on?

02:16:24.250 --> 02:16:28.790
Hello? I think there's been,
you know, it's like 90%

02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:31.160
of the development has been done
in the last five or 10 years

02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:33.800
and before that it
was everything else.

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:38.090
I think we were lucky in
the mechanical CAD industry

02:16:38.090 --> 02:16:40.460
because there's, if you look

02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:45.750
at the market there's really
not that many big users.

02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:47.410
And I'm just going to pick
a system, I'm not going

02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:51.230
to make-up the numbers, but
let's, it's DOS O. You know,

02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:57.910
DOS O's 10 biggest customers
probably are 80% of their sales,

02:16:57.910 --> 02:17:00.200
it's the Airbus's
and the Boeing's

02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.750
and the Daimler's of the world.

02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:08.260
But what it took for
us was since we are

02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:13.200
so concentrated was all those
big people beating the CAD

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.580
vendors over the
head with a stick.

02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:19.250
We're trying to get computer
aided manufacturing vendors

02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:23.280
to implement this capability
now, that's really tough

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:27.200
because you look at the computer
aided manufacturing and it's

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.110
like Joe's Machine Shop and he
has one license of Mastercam

02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:35.910
and what's Joe going to do, what
does Mastercam care, you know?

02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:38.640
So anyway those kind
of our experience.

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:44.290
&gt;&gt; This doesn't really apply
to software preservation.

02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:47.290
&gt;&gt; I have a question for Roger.

02:17:47.290 --> 02:17:48.590
&gt;&gt; Roger Grant: Okay.

02:17:48.590 --> 02:17:49.890
&gt;&gt; Hi, Roger.

02:17:49.890 --> 02:17:51.190
&gt;&gt; Roger Grant: Hi, Christine.

02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:54.040
&gt;&gt; I'm Christine Falon from
Christie Falon Associates.

02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:58.010
Product data, now in
manufacturing if you go

02:17:58.010 --> 02:18:03.760
to aerospace stuff is sort of
custom made for a plane, right?

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.040
But we use a lot of stuff, what
we call off-the-shelf products

02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.130
in our buildings, right?

02:18:11.130 --> 02:18:16.950
And what I'm running into in
implementations I'm doing is

02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:22.950
this kind of great babble
of product data, you know,

02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:27.420
what are the properties, what
are the appropriate properties

02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:30.800
for a tiller and where
do I get the properties.

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.310
And at this point it's an
incredible stupid manual thing.

02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:40.190
Is there any movement in
getting manufacturers to agree

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:44.400
on standard property
sets for their products

02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.700
and delivering them
in a standard format?

02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:50.360
&gt;&gt; Roger Grant: Well,
manufacturers have worked

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:52.710
to make their information
available online,

02:18:52.710 --> 02:18:55.440
but they haven't structured
it in a common way.

02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.170
I think that there is movement
in Europe on this subject

02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:02.590
because there are EU regulations
that require manufacturers

02:19:02.590 --> 02:19:06.450
to report information about
their products in a certain way

02:19:06.450 --> 02:19:08.290
and about aspects
of their products.

02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:12.850
So that's driving in
Europe a SEN standard,

02:19:12.850 --> 02:19:14.240
a common European standard

02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.090
for how product data
templates should be made.

02:19:17.090 --> 02:19:19.010
We're going to adopt
that in buildingSMART

02:19:19.010 --> 02:19:20.890
and have it be a
buildingSMART standard.

02:19:20.890 --> 02:19:24.850
We're looking at it originating
from IFC because I mean

02:19:24.850 --> 02:19:28.300
that an object has
properties and so all

02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:29.600
that stuff can be structured.

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.290
So I think it's going to
get here, it's starting more

02:19:32.290 --> 02:19:34.530
so in Europe, and I think
we'll see that because many

02:19:34.530 --> 02:19:36.460
of the manufacturers
are worldwide.

02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:37.840
&gt;&gt; Jeff Ouellette: If
you haven't figured

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:42.180
out the common thread or trend
here it's not always starting

02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:44.780
in the US.

02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:48.650
And the fact of the matter
is if you look, to be honest,

02:19:48.650 --> 02:19:53.510
amongst all the software vendors
at least in our industry most

02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:58.280
of us make the majority
of our money outside

02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:01.340
of the United States,
simple as that.

02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:04.340
The United States is a big
market, but the majority

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:06.580
of our money is made
outside the United States.

02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:12.300
In 2011 it's a $7 trillion
building industry from design

02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:18.370
through production, only $1.7
trillion of it was generated

02:20:18.370 --> 02:20:23.560
in the US, $3.5 trillion
was China alone, okay?

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:27.190
So we, again, it's context,
right, we have to look

02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:28.490
at the bigger picture of this.

02:20:28.490 --> 02:20:29.790
So if significant parts

02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:33.570
of our global market are pushing
this forward then we adopt it

02:20:33.570 --> 02:20:34.870
and it moves forward

02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:36.190
and it becomes a
standard everywhere else,

02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:38.590
whether they like it or not.

02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:42.750
&gt;&gt; We've got time for one,
maybe two more questions.

02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:46.690
&gt;&gt; So this is for Jessica, I
confess a lot of what you talked

02:20:46.690 --> 02:20:49.150
about was total new
alien science to me.

02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:51.200
I hope I'm not alone in that.

02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:52.500
&gt;&gt; Yay.

02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:56.360
&gt;&gt; Maybe I can just ask
you to comment on --

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:57.660
because I'm very familiar

02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:00.980
with the ISC open data standards
questions, so how does that fit

02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:03.600
into the questions
that you're raising?

02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.430
Why do would you need
to preserve software

02:21:06.430 --> 02:21:09.290
if we could just preserve
the data standards?

02:21:09.290 --> 02:21:10.590
&gt;&gt; Jessica Meyerson: Sure.

02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:12.400
So Tim mentioned this earlier
in the day, so we're kind

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:14.800
of talking about different
sets of stakeholders

02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:17.090
and we're talking about
different tax associated

02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:18.670
with those different
sets of stakeholders.

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:23.780
So I think future forward
standards approach makes perfect

02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:25.080
sense, right?

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.850
It's still a complex
digital object,

02:21:26.850 --> 02:21:29.520
so ultimately you are going to
have to deal with those layers

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:32.300
of mediation that
will still come

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.120
in different versions even
though they can open a file

02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:37.100
that includes the same
underlying standards.

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:40.140
So there's that, but the
standards is a future forwards

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:42.810
approach, while at the same
time librarians, archivists,

02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:45.740
digital preservationists,
researchers that are looking

02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:49.200
at recent history the
last 30, 40, 50 years

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.570
or so are still contending
with what we do

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.660
with everything that
we already have.

02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:58.840
So if we look at collecting
repositories we've invested

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:03.420
since the latter part of since
the '80s I would guess even

02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.640
earlier maybe, we have things
coming in from the '70s,

02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:10.960
we've already been collecting
passively digital objects

02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:13.200
and proprietary file formats.

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:15.120
They're embedded
in our collections

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:18.330
and we don't process collections
in archival repositories

02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:22.550
at an item level, we bring
them in in an aggregate level

02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:25.880
and we describe them
at an aggregate level.

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:29.360
And so what we're finding is
that as researchers come in

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:34.290
and they have these use
cases for access we're faced

02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:36.920
with this issue of how do we --

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:39.560
we've already invested
all this time, expertise,

02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:42.790
storage resources to go back to
some of Tim's earlier questions

02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:46.530
around these digital objects
and they take time to process.

02:22:46.530 --> 02:22:49.660
And then we come to the
point of processing them both

02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:52.390
for identifying their
historical and cultural value,

02:22:52.390 --> 02:22:56.240
what we would call appraisal, as
well as providing access to them

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.650
in a reading room
scenario or in sort

02:22:58.650 --> 02:23:01.090
of a private network
scenario based

02:23:01.090 --> 02:23:02.950
on something like university ID.

02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:04.920
So we're sort of looking

02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:08.180
at the stuff we already
have primarily right now.

02:23:08.180 --> 02:23:10.540
And then what I would say
is the future forward part

02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:12.560
of what we do, sort of focused

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:14.700
in cultural memory
broadly defined,

02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:18.770
which includes higher
ed, would be scientific

02:23:18.770 --> 02:23:21.070
and social scientific
reproducibility.

02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:25.570
And so this is also a standards
future forward facing approach

02:23:25.570 --> 02:23:28.260
which you have things like
the Software Sustainability

02:23:28.260 --> 02:23:31.410
Institute in the UK that's
doing things like helping

02:23:31.410 --> 02:23:34.350
to create recommendations
and standards for how

02:23:34.350 --> 02:23:36.380
to write better research
software.

02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:38.660
But even then, so
you're using some

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:40.120
of the same underlying
libraries,

02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:42.560
but you're creating
a unique object.

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:44.900
Another place that
standards sort of plugs

02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:47.390
into the Software
Preservation Network of all

02:23:47.390 --> 02:23:50.550
of these different organizations
that fit into the network

02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:52.550
in different ways, they
have different roles.

02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:56.510
So some organizations, in
fact, NIST has a software,

02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:58.870
the national software
reference library that's used

02:23:58.870 --> 02:24:03.280
as a data corpus just
based on its hash values,

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:06.000
but it is actually
a software library.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.930
And so you have these
known collections

02:24:07.930 --> 02:24:09.230
of historical software.

02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:10.530
The internet archive,

02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:13.120
the national software reference
library, Yale University library

02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:16.490
and special collections,
the Computer History Museum.

02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:18.740
And so if we think
about the fact

02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:21.400
that no one institution
is ever going to be able

02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.390
to have all the software
they need

02:24:23.390 --> 02:24:26.920
to accommodate the use
cases of their end users

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:29.150
for the complex digital
objects that they have

02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:32.650
in their collections, we also
are having the same conversation

02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:34.980
around standardization.

02:24:34.980 --> 02:24:38.300
It's just a different
set of stakeholders.

02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, not to put
you guys on the spot,

02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:42.760
but are you all going
to the happy hour?

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.060
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:45.360
&gt;&gt; Okay, so good,
because questions are

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:46.660
up so you've got to ask more.

02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:49.080
I'd like to thank
our panel again.

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kit.

02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:57.430
[ Applause ]

02:24:57.430 --> 02:24:59.820
&gt;&gt; And now if you'd hang
on for another minute.

02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:02.370
Have Tim Walsh come up.

02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:03.740
&gt;&gt; Tim Walsh: Okay,
I'll try to keep this

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:06.120
to a reasonable length.

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:11.780
I'd be remiss not to start
with some thank you's.

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:13.080
Personally it's a real honor

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:16.660
to be here giving
these remarks to you.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:19.580
I think we all owe a giant thank
you to The Library of Congress,

02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:21.960
the Architect of the Capitol,
and the National Gallery of Art

02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:24.510
for organizing this
really amazing forum.

02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:30.470
[ Applause ]

02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:35.420
In particular I'd like to thank
Kit, Kate, Leslie and Jamie,

02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:38.410
who is still sitting back
there in that solo seat,

02:25:38.410 --> 02:25:41.840
for doing so much of the
work for organizing this.

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:44.620
To the Planning Committee,
who put it all together.

02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:48.510
You know, these things are
always or almost always sort

02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:52.170
of secondary things to all the
important day-to-day challenges

02:25:52.170 --> 02:25:54.490
and deadlines and whatever,
so it's a lot of work

02:25:54.490 --> 02:25:58.260
and they did a really
good job of it.

02:25:58.260 --> 02:26:02.910
And thank you all for being
here, to all the panelists too.

02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:06.000
I'm going to try more
or less off the cuff,

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000
although I've been taking
notes frantically all day,

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.160
to just kind of parse back
through some of the things

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:15.390
that we have heard and sort of
try to make some connections.

02:26:15.390 --> 02:26:18.620
Because I think we heard
a lot of similar comments

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:21.430
and content coming from
different perspectives

02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:24.210
that really reflect all
the different stakeholders

02:26:24.210 --> 02:26:26.930
that we have, when we're
thinking about the sort

02:26:26.930 --> 02:26:30.210
of like long-term
preservation and access

02:26:30.210 --> 02:26:32.850
of these very complex,
very software dependent,

02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.670
although maybe in the
future not quite as much,

02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:36.580
which is really encouraging,

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:40.960
kind of digital objects
that we're producing.

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.760
So if we start with the
sort of creators, producers,

02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:49.220
the architects, the engineers,
the people in aerospace

02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:53.230
and automotive, who are actually
creating all these objects

02:26:53.230 --> 02:26:56.070
to begin with, I think
we heard a couple things.

02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:58.370
One that I think
we could all agree

02:26:58.370 --> 02:27:00.470
with in our respective
domains is

02:27:00.470 --> 02:27:02.930
that standards are not
so easy to implement.

02:27:02.930 --> 02:27:06.040
There's a lot of
work being done.

02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:08.130
You know, the buildingSMART
initiative is amazing,

02:27:08.130 --> 02:27:10.470
same with the CAx
Implementor Forum.

02:27:10.470 --> 02:27:13.130
You see the amount of
resources, both people's time,

02:27:13.130 --> 02:27:16.890
people's money, organizational
support by software vendors

02:27:16.890 --> 02:27:19.790
and institutions that goes
into making these standards

02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:22.010
to begin with, and then they
have to get implemented.

02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:26.400
And, like Greg said,
these standards need

02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:27.940
to be market based
or the motivation

02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:30.200
for using the standards
has to be market based.

02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:32.250
This has come up
time and time again,

02:27:32.250 --> 02:27:34.370
I mean Roger said
the same thing,

02:27:34.370 --> 02:27:37.120
looking at the British
building industry.

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:40.370
There's always going to be
competing higher priorities

02:27:40.370 --> 02:27:43.120
than tying everything up
very nicely with a bow

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.900
at the end of a project.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:48.200
So really it has to come back
to things like deliverables,

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:54.220
like externally imposed
requirements.

02:27:54.220 --> 02:27:58.310
If we, as Greg said, if the
standards are not only asked

02:27:58.310 --> 02:28:01.800
for by clients, by Governments,
by regulatory agencies,

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.850
but also tested and verified
then they will happen.

02:28:06.850 --> 02:28:11.660
I thought it particularly
interesting comment

02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:14.730
from that first session,
too, a couple things.

02:28:14.730 --> 02:28:19.160
One, still on standards,
Greg's comment

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.810
that we don't have standards
about how you get there,

02:28:20.810 --> 02:28:23.390
just what ends up being
delivered is really fascinating

02:28:23.390 --> 02:28:25.180
and I think ties into a
lot of the other comments

02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:27.540
that we've heard about the need

02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:32.090
for say submitting
narratives along with files

02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:33.530
or documenting workflows.

02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:38.010
This idea that like, especially
in the architectural realm,

02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:41.300
especially with smaller
firms every project is going

02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:46.000
to have its own workflow and its
own needs and its own software,

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.700
unless there's some
reason not to.

02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:51.540
But maybe that's okay, it's just
that when it gets ultimately

02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.450
to other architects,
to architects

02:28:53.450 --> 02:28:56.270
at the same firm 20 years
later to deal with the assets,

02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:58.630
if it comes to a
place like CCA we have

02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:59.930
to know a little bit more.

02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:01.930
We can't just be
presented with the files.

02:29:01.930 --> 02:29:05.150
I think in our experience at
CCA doing the kind of thing

02:29:05.150 --> 02:29:09.840
that Balmori is doing with Yale
is a really great exercise.

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.900
We've even sometimes
when we get the files

02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:14.580
in basically set-up a
Skype call with the people

02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:16.260
who actually created them
and shared our screen

02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:17.660
and just walked through
the directories

02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.740
and like tell me a story about
this, the same way you might do

02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:22.590
in history by like
showing someone a photo

02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:23.890
to jog their memory.

02:29:23.890 --> 02:29:26.450
These kinds of things are
really, really important.

02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:31.420
I think we hear some consistent
things about labor and time,

02:29:31.420 --> 02:29:34.820
that firms often don't have a
person dedicated to arranging

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:36.410
and scribing the data
or that it's sort

02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:38.890
of like a secondary
task at the end.

02:29:38.890 --> 02:29:41.530
That it tends to be either
the architects, themselves,

02:29:41.530 --> 02:29:44.380
sort of all pulling the
weight or technologists,

02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:46.580
who maybe have a
different perspective.

02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:50.420
My plug here would be if you
can afford it you should hire

02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:53.200
archivists because we
think about this a lot,

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.960
but that's not realistic
for everyone.

02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:58.670
And like with collecting
institutions no individual firm

02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:00.640
or practice is going to solve
these things on their own,

02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:02.650
so all these initiatives
that we hear

02:30:02.650 --> 02:30:04.990
and they're very collaborative
I think are extremely important

02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:06.290
for a firm for moving
us forward.

02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:08.990
You know, things like
Lotar is a great example

02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:13.280
of basically different, actually
competing commercial entities

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:15.870
recognizing that they
have common problems

02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:19.240
and cooperating together
demonstrating the business value

02:30:19.240 --> 02:30:22.380
and then actually being
able to implement standards

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.690
to drive their cost
down, lower the number

02:30:24.690 --> 02:30:26.070
of mistakes being made,
all that sort of thing.

02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:33.460
And thinking about the creators.

02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:36.180
Also, something that's easy
to forget sometimes I think

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:38.940
for us collecting
institutions who are faced

02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:42.690
by how daunting CAT and BIM
and 3 modeling files are

02:30:42.690 --> 02:30:44.440
that there's things
besides those

02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:45.820
that we need to be collecting.

02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:50.460
There's a whole realm of
documentation of knowledge

02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:53.840
about corporate culture,
about presices, about events

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:57.840
that predated larger cultural
contexts that shine a light

02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:00.030
into why projects
happen as they were,

02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:02.830
why designs happened
as they were.

02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:06.270
And these things mean that
we're going to be receiving,

02:31:06.270 --> 02:31:08.240
thinking about collecting
institutions,

02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:14.660
not just an IFC model or not
just CAD files in whatever

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:19.050
of the like 300 possible
formats they're in or whatever,

02:31:19.050 --> 02:31:20.730
but also we're going
to be receiving things

02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:23.660
like photo documentation
and video and e-mail

02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:26.150
and increasingly web
based collaborative

02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:29.040
like note platforms
and all kinds of stuff.

02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:32.580
And we need to be able
to address all of that,

02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:35.210
which means we can't focus all
of our efforts, time and money

02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:37.630
on like very selected pies.

02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:40.570
I think this also comes back to
collaboration, why this needs

02:31:40.570 --> 02:31:41.870
to be a collaborative effort

02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:43.950
because there are other people
working in those spaces.

02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:48.890
And the Mellon Foundation funded
a really amazing task force

02:31:48.890 --> 02:31:51.970
on e-mail archiving, sort of a
state-of-the-art of where we are

02:31:51.970 --> 02:31:54.310
with people from a bunch of
major research institutions,

02:31:54.310 --> 02:31:56.750
but also others like Microsoft.

02:31:56.750 --> 02:31:59.810
And those sorts of things
can really drive us forward.

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:03.350
We, in the ADEAC
realm like don't need

02:32:03.350 --> 02:32:04.650
to reinvent the wheel,

02:32:04.650 --> 02:32:05.950
we can plug into these
other communities

02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:09.360
and like provide our
unique perspective and gain

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:12.090
from other work that's
happening in the field.

02:32:12.090 --> 02:32:19.710
And I think there's a little bit
of kind of careful reflection

02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:22.980
that we should do
around capturing things

02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:26.130
like Matthew called
it capturing culture,

02:32:26.130 --> 02:32:30.080
Dennis called it
capturing transactions.

02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:32.240
In the end often what
we're interested in,

02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:35.580
especially in sort of more
like research institutions,

02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:38.660
is not just the end built
product but how we got there,

02:32:38.660 --> 02:32:39.960
the theory, the practices.

02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:42.420
And for those sorts of things
capturing the cultural elements

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:46.310
that come before are
especially important.

02:32:46.310 --> 02:32:51.130
If we sort of move on a little
bit to the second panel,

02:32:51.130 --> 02:32:54.030
researchers and scholars,
I loved the quote

02:32:54.030 --> 02:32:56.730
from Kurt's colleague, show
me the uses and I'll begin

02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:58.230
to understand the value.

02:32:58.230 --> 02:33:01.140
Unfortunately, I don't remember
your colleague's name, Kurt,

02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:03.740
but that's really great
and I'm really glad

02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:05.290
that we had that session today.

02:33:05.290 --> 02:33:07.160
Who did that, I think those
of you who are working

02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:10.470
with primary, digital primary
source materials are really sort

02:33:10.470 --> 02:33:12.220
of on the vanguard.

02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:15.500
In some ways there's not a
lot of scholarship out there

02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:19.060
that tells us how people
use these materials,

02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:22.210
which to me means
I would implore you

02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:25.430
to not just share the end
products of your research,

02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:27.120
not just like publisher exhibit,

02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:29.820
but to share the
process, how you go there.

02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:31.700
Like what your research
questions are,

02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:33.550
whether you were able to
actually do what you intended

02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:36.300
to do or had to change
because of not being able

02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:39.090
to find collections or
not being able to do

02:33:39.090 --> 02:33:40.790
with collections
what you wanted.

02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:42.850
For those of us who
manage these collections

02:33:42.850 --> 02:33:44.830
and provide the access to them
these are things that we need

02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:46.590
to know in order to
inform our practice

02:33:46.590 --> 02:33:49.790
and better serve you in the end.

02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:52.100
Another thing that really
struck me is that almost none

02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:53.850
of the use cases that
were presented today dealt

02:33:53.850 --> 02:33:56.130
with a specific singular
project.

02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:58.520
They differed a lot
from how sort

02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:02.160
of like traditional
architectural historiography

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:03.900
often gets presented.

02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:06.890
Instead it was a lot about
large datasets, comparisons,

02:34:06.890 --> 02:34:09.660
design languages, typologies.

02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:12.870
I'm wondering if this is because
we now have the technology

02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:15.220
to enable these sorts of
researches, if there's something

02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:19.080
about this present moment,
or if this interest is going

02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:20.380
to continue over time?

02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:22.980
I suspect it's the latter,
but the kinds of work

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:26.530
that Andrew is doing
are really innovative,

02:34:26.530 --> 02:34:29.900
could not have been predicted
probably 10 or 20 years ago

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:33.210
by collecting institutions
who are ultimately responsible

02:34:33.210 --> 02:34:34.850
for a lot of these collections.

02:34:34.850 --> 02:34:37.460
And I think that's a thing
that we need to think about,

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:40.950
that maybe we don't need
to over-engineer the ways

02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:42.590
that we provide access
or the ways

02:34:42.590 --> 02:34:44.230
that we describe
our collections.

02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:46.340
Maybe the primary
responsibility for us is

02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:50.230
to securely hold these
collections, provide access

02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:53.750
as we can, and then
respond to scholarship

02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:56.210
and to the actual use,
rather than our sort

02:34:56.210 --> 02:34:59.250
of preconceived notions of how
people might want to interact

02:34:59.250 --> 02:35:01.430
with this material over time.

02:35:01.430 --> 02:35:03.690
Another thing that really
struck me that's a question

02:35:03.690 --> 02:35:05.920
that I have no beginning
of an answer

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.530
for is I thought there was
a really interesting back

02:35:08.530 --> 02:35:11.820
and forth between sort
of Matthew's question

02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:14.820
of like can we guess which
software created a file

02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:17.820
by the geometry of the
design, versus this idea

02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:19.890
of fully interoperable
data that's not tied

02:35:19.890 --> 02:35:21.590
to specific software platforms?

02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:23.170
I think there's probably
a lot to unpack there,

02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:31.700
I don't really know how, I'll
leave that to some of you.

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:36.030
Yes, again, I'd implore you
basically tell us as much

02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:38.190
as you can about what you
are doing with this material

02:35:38.190 --> 02:35:39.530
and what you want to do.

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:42.570
We will be bound sometimes
by other obligations,

02:35:42.570 --> 02:35:44.060
by our donor agreements
for instance.

02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:46.550
It's not so easy to
convince donors to give

02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:49.960
over 3D high fidelity
representations of buildings

02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:52.220
that could be used to
reconstruct it or basically are

02:35:52.220 --> 02:35:54.300
like a virtual analog
of a building.

02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:56.220
So there are other sort
of factors at play here,

02:35:56.220 --> 02:36:00.050
but I think we are, we will
largely be open to reflecting

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:04.700
on our practices and seeing if
we actually are able to break

02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:06.390
with some of our older
practices, if we're able

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:08.030
to provide freer
access, if we're able

02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:12.650
to better support new
research methodologies.

02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:17.860
A couple things for the
collecting institutions

02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:22.110
and maybe this is the part where
it might be a bit more of a call

02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:27.480
to action for me because this
is my world a little more.

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:31.830
Like I said, let's not start
trying to go from A to Z

02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:34.350
and like over-engineering
our access solutions.

02:36:34.350 --> 02:36:40.480
From what I hear from Matthew,
from Andrew the collections

02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.550
that people need to support
scholarship largely are not

02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:46.590
in our collecting institutions,

02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:49.170
and to me that should
be our first priority,

02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:53.090
especially for these sort of
like these first few decades

02:36:53.090 --> 02:36:58.460
of digital design where largely
they were incidentally collected

02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:06.560
by collecting institutions and
won't be there for very long

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:10.590
for us to collect,
either from people moving

02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:13.770
on to different projects,
retiring, the media degrading.

02:37:13.770 --> 02:37:16.860
I spend a lot of my days
getting data off of old media,

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:19.350
it's all well past
its reliable lifespan,

02:37:19.350 --> 02:37:21.910
there is significant data
corruption in even the stuff

02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:26.310
from 10 years ago, 20 years
ago, so that's a real thing.

02:37:26.310 --> 02:37:31.010
I think it's really, we
need to think about this,

02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:33.420
these sort of new research
methodologies, like I said,

02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:36.120
machine learning and
machine vision, AI,

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:38.440
thinking about that our
researchers may not necessarily

02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.970
want individual drawings,
they might want datasets

02:37:40.970 --> 02:37:42.440
and they might be
asking questions

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:44.680
that are not interrogating
a specific architect

02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.120
or a specific archive but
a specific type of work

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:51.130
that stretches across
archives and practitioners

02:37:51.130 --> 02:37:54.150
and whether we can actually
support discoverability

02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:57.490
to help people find the
material, like regardless

02:37:57.490 --> 02:38:00.290
of its provenance that meets
their research interests,

02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:03.220
is an interesting
question to me.

02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:06.230
One thing Matthew Allen
said that really struck me,

02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:07.560
that a collection of documents

02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:10.070
in their original order
provides a lot of clues.

02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:12.220
As an archivist that
sort of warmed my heart.

02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:14.520
I think it's true.

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.640
[laughter] That's been
my experience, too,

02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:18.800
that with digital material
especially with all

02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:21.180
of the ex-wraps that you can
break if they're not bound in,

02:38:21.180 --> 02:38:22.690
all of these things,
often it's better

02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:25.190
to leave these collections
as they are and describe them

02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:27.470
as best you can and annotate
them with other kinds

02:38:27.470 --> 02:38:29.210
of information rather
than going in and trying

02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:31.800
to restructure them
and provide some sort

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:36.230
of definitive hierarchical
binding style view

02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:37.970
into the material.

02:38:37.970 --> 02:38:43.040
And that we can maybe let
people be a little more hands-on

02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:44.860
and interactive with digital
archives than we could

02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:47.090
with physical, which is
something Matthew brought

02:38:47.090 --> 02:38:49.430
up as well.

02:38:49.430 --> 02:38:52.460
That, like Euan says, if our
access tools like emulation

02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:53.760
as a service allow us

02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:55.630
to basically spin-up a new
environment every time that's

02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:57.360
identical to the
original one regardless

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:01.390
of what the person came before,
can we be a little freer,

02:39:01.390 --> 02:39:04.420
do we actually need to impose
so many restrictions that we had

02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:06.490
to largely based around
preservation concerns

02:39:06.490 --> 02:39:09.100
that aren't actually
that applicable to a lot

02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:10.400
of these new kinds of materials,

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:13.060
I think is another
thing to ponder.

02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:14.720
Here's my call to action part.

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:17.560
I think the biggest thing
holding us back as a community

02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.900
in this is not the difficulty,
not the size of the challenge,

02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:23.790
but the size of our capacity.

02:39:23.790 --> 02:39:26.780
That in the end of the day
before we can do any of the rest

02:39:26.780 --> 02:39:29.900
of the stuff we have to have the
files, we have to collect them,

02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:31.520
we have to preserve them.

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:33.050
That means that libraries,
archives

02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:36.120
and museums need basic digital
preservation infrastructure,

02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.700
which is easier than
it used to be.

02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:40.710
There's a lot of really maturing
software out there, standards,

02:39:40.710 --> 02:39:43.300
professional communities.

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.600
But at the end of
the day regardless

02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:46.960
of how you implement digital
preservation it does mean

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.260
that you are going to have to
dedicate staffing and funding

02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:55.180
to it, which is as far
as I can see maybe one

02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:56.530
of the biggest obstacles

02:39:56.530 --> 02:39:58.880
to really moving
forward as a community.

02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:00.390
And we've been talking
about a lot of these issues

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:06.550
for 20 years now and I think
we have a pretty good idea

02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:08.290
of what we need to
do at this point,

02:40:08.290 --> 02:40:10.320
we just need more
resources behind it.

02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.190
That's not all our fault,
though, because most

02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:13.820
of us don't have more
resources than we used

02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:16.780
to have even though we
have all these new types

02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.080
of assets to handle.

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:21.170
So I think funding institutions,
too, should take this

02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:23.250
into consideration, but
ultimately it's probably going

02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:26.280
to require a lot of critical
evaluation of our services,

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.120
where we spend our money.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:31.090
Maybe not everyone
needs to do it

02:40:31.090 --> 02:40:33.650
and probably not everyone needs
to do it and not everyone needs

02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:35.410
to collect at a large
scale, but if you want

02:40:35.410 --> 02:40:41.380
to it requires funding
and staffing ultimately.

02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:43.480
I think that said, we
don't have to start

02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:46.040
with the complete solution for
these things right off the bat.

02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:47.340
Things like the NDSA levels

02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:49.320
of digital preservation
are there to guide us.

02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:51.820
It's best to start at a level
where you know what you have,

02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:54.050
you know that you have backups,
you know that you can restore

02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:59.270
from those backups, and
then iterate up from there.

02:40:59.270 --> 02:41:01.540
There's a lot of education
and training out there.

02:41:01.540 --> 02:41:02.840
I think one of the things

02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.390
that didn't really get
addressed today all that much,

02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:08.550
except maybe obliquely through
some questions, is training

02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:11.920
and staffing around working with
these materials and archives,

02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:15.680
that suddenly we're expected
to have these competencies,

02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:19.740
that we understand archival,
we have archival expertise,

02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:21.900
we understand the sort
of architecture, design,

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:23.960
engineering worlds,
we understand how

02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:26.520
to operate this CAD software
at least well enough to open

02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:29.340
up the files and look
around and say what they are

02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:30.890
and to describe them
to other people

02:41:30.890 --> 02:41:32.840
who probably have
more expertise than us

02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:34.940
in a way that's not invalid.

02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:39.720
Somehow we have to develop
a whole community of people

02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:41.870
like this and I think
we're getting there,

02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:44.230
but we can use some
critical self-reflection

02:41:44.230 --> 02:41:48.930
about how we set-up, how we
have training for current staff,

02:41:48.930 --> 02:41:50.300
how we encourage
a new generation

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:51.810
of people to come into this.

02:41:51.810 --> 02:41:55.630
Things like the NDSR residency
program are fantastic,

02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:58.660
maybe we should think
about an NDSR architecture.

02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:01.310
I think there's a lot of
things that we could do

02:42:01.310 --> 02:42:03.550
as a community in there.

02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:05.270
Just like in aerospace

02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:09.500
and in the building community
we need to work together.

02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:12.250
We heard over and over and
over again today no one person

02:42:12.250 --> 02:42:15.380
or institution will solve
everything, we all are coming

02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:18.280
at this with different
expertise, different resources,

02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:22.810
different use cases, and the
more we work together the more

02:42:22.810 --> 02:42:25.420
we're going to work through
a lot of these issues.

02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:27.710
And in terms of practice,
like I said earlier,

02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:30.930
we can't really focus only
on CAD and BIM and models,

02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:33.910
we have to take a
larger picture approach.

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:37.330
We have to think about how we
document culture and workflow

02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:41.070
and process and context
so that we don't just end

02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:43.670
up with some models that
are very extremely preserved

02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:45.750
in like perfect interoperable
file formats,

02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:48.670
but with no real
context for them.

02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:53.480
I think the last thing I'd say
for the collecting institutions,

02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:55.460
for my fellow people from
collecting institutions

02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:57.930
in the room, is it's
on us to demonstrate

02:42:57.930 --> 02:43:00.690
that our business case
exists and is viable.

02:43:00.690 --> 02:43:02.130
And we heard this
from the other types

02:43:02.130 --> 02:43:05.770
of stakeholders again today,
over and over and over,

02:43:05.770 --> 02:43:07.330
if you want people to
care about your problem,

02:43:07.330 --> 02:43:09.140
if you want to move forward
you have to demonstrate

02:43:09.140 --> 02:43:11.870
that it matters, why it matters
and that there's a way forward.

02:43:11.870 --> 02:43:14.710
And that's on us collectively.

02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:20.110
For the representatives of
software companies in the room

02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:22.610
or that might be watching
this at YouTube in the future,

02:43:22.610 --> 02:43:25.510
I think a few considerations.

02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:27.730
From architectural
and engineering firms,

02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:30.170
to facility managers, to
librarians and archivists,

02:43:30.170 --> 02:43:34.030
to Governments, we've heard
from a lot of people today

02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:36.310
that they are interested
in retaining access

02:43:36.310 --> 02:43:39.630
to files created in older
versions of your software.

02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:42.610
And maintaining compatibility
with old file formats

02:43:42.610 --> 02:43:45.610
and versions and ensuring that
your software can write files

02:43:45.610 --> 02:43:48.750
in preservation friendly openly
documented file formats have a

02:43:48.750 --> 02:43:50.190
real big role to impacts.

02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:53.090
There's been a lot of movement
on that front around BIM

02:43:53.090 --> 02:43:56.700
and IFC especially, which is
fantastic, but it's a thing

02:43:56.700 --> 02:43:58.630
that we can forget over time.

02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:59.930
And we live in a world now

02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:03.020
where even a W creative
cloud can't open the earliest

02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:05.890
Photoshop files and
Microsoft Word can't open

02:44:05.890 --> 02:44:09.890
up early Word files and those
are much simpler assets.

02:44:09.890 --> 02:44:13.950
So we have to think about
these things in terms

02:44:13.950 --> 02:44:15.790
of business value
clearly, but also in terms

02:44:15.790 --> 02:44:18.470
of their cultural
value and significance.

02:44:18.470 --> 02:44:22.830
As Euan demonstrated, there's
also quite a lot of us out there

02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:25.330
who are interested in running
older versions of the software

02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:28.070
in like virtual machines
and emulators,

02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:29.450
whether it's the
software vendors,

02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:32.250
whether it's software developers
who just think on their own.

02:44:32.250 --> 02:44:33.680
This is a really
interesting topic,

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:36.020
whether it's institutions
thinking about applying

02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:38.920
for grants, we could use a
whole lot more development

02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:40.480
around these kinds of tools.

02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:42.900
What Euan has been able to do
and Klaus has been able to do

02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:44.370
and other people have
been able to do, you know,

02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:45.670
Rhizome for instance
applying this

02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:49.730
in the art world is amazing, but
it will only continue forward

02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:54.250
with kind of like funding and
support and given the promise,

02:44:54.250 --> 02:44:57.350
that's something we
should all think about.

02:44:57.350 --> 02:45:00.970
And, finally I think as a member

02:45:00.970 --> 02:45:03.990
of the Software Preservation
Network myself,

02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:07.270
I love that Jessica stressed
this, we need to acknowledge

02:45:07.270 --> 02:45:10.050
that software is infrastructure,
that it's a tool,

02:45:10.050 --> 02:45:11.360
that it's a way of
interacting with data,

02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.740
but also that it's our
cultural heritage and we need

02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:17.660
to think about that somehow.

02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:19.340
It's tough because there's
always business interests

02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:22.800
on the line and that's
completely understandable,

02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.840
but increasingly as the products
of our creative activities,

02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:31.280
commercial activities are
increasingly software dependent,

02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:33.090
bound now more and more online

02:45:33.090 --> 02:45:35.320
which only increases
these dependencies,

02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.360
I do think that there's a
valid argument to be made

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.000
that there's a sort of
cultural element to this,

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.710
a cultural obligation to this.

02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:47.070
I'm not the only one, you know,

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:49.860
UNESCO has the Persist Project
that's recognizing the same

02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:53.510
exact thing on an
international level.

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:56.220
For the standards
organizations in the room,

02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:58.650
you all are awesome,
keep doing that work.

02:45:58.650 --> 02:46:01.400
[laughter] Pushing for open
and documented standards.

02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:03.580
I found it very interesting
that the compatibility

02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:05.480
and adoption is increasingly
there,

02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:06.820
also that it's increasingly
there

02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:08.120
because Governmetns largely

02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:10.460
in Europe are increasingly
requiring it,

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:11.960
which tells us a lot.

02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:15.250
For the clients and
Government agencies in the room,

02:46:15.250 --> 02:46:18.900
how we get things done and how
we ease our collective problems,

02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:23.860
you know, that the
power of regulation

02:46:23.860 --> 02:46:25.820
and deliverables
requirements is probably one

02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:27.200
of the biggest powers
in the space

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.810
for making things happen came
up over and over and over.

02:46:31.810 --> 02:46:34.660
I'm also really glad
that we ended

02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:37.250
on two buildingSMART
presentations

02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:42.020
because I think it
outlines the kind

02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:43.530
of bright future
that's ahead of us.

02:46:43.530 --> 02:46:46.900
That, like Jessica said, we're
going to have to continue

02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:49.320
to deal with the old stuff and
that will require all kinds

02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:53.300
of creative solutions, it will
inevitably result in some loss,

02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:55.760
that's okay, that's the way
the world has always worked.

02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:58.890
But for the path ahead we
can at least try to lay

02:46:58.890 --> 02:47:01.970
down these standards,
encourage their adoption

02:47:01.970 --> 02:47:04.120
as much as possible.

02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:06.840
Again, for the collecting
institutions in the room,

02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:09.770
I think a lot of us archivists
and librarians have skills

02:47:09.770 --> 02:47:13.170
in terms of knowledge and
information organization

02:47:13.170 --> 02:47:15.620
and long-term preservation
that we're keeping

02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:17.500
within our professional
confines.

02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:20.880
It might behoove us to
think in a slightly more

02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:23.640
like post-custodial model,
like go to conferences

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:26.900
that aren't library conferences,
go to meetings of architects

02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:28.410
and designers and
engineers and talk

02:47:28.410 --> 02:47:31.620
about why we organize
information the way that we do

02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:36.500
and try to make that
a back and forth.

02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:40.140
In general I think clearly
collaborative discussions

02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:44.400
and efforts are going to
be the key in all of this.

02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:47.690
And I thought I would, you know,
we all benefit from standards,

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:49.690
we all benefit from
openly documented formats,

02:47:49.690 --> 02:47:52.720
we all benefit from
good documentation,

02:47:52.720 --> 02:47:55.820
from the firms themselves
who want to go back and look

02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.560
at materials, to scholars,

02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.430
to collecting institutions,
it's really everyone.

02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:03.170
And I thought I would leave this

02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:05.900
by just reiterating
Roger's comment,

02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:08.950
we have to invest upfront
to save in the end,

02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:11.490
which I think ultimately
underscores a lot

02:48:11.490 --> 02:48:12.790
of what happened here today.

02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:15.000
A lot of that investment
is happening already.

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.290
It's clear, look at how
many people are in this room

02:48:17.290 --> 02:48:19.680
that are doing amazing
work on this problem

02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:20.980
from so many different angles,

02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:23.660
coming from so many different
stakeholder communities.

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:27.180
It's fantastic, but it's up to
us to continue the good fight.

02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:28.980
Thank you.

02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:31.530
[ Applause ]

02:48:31.530 --> 02:48:33.060
&gt;&gt; Stacy: So thanks,
Tim, that was great.

02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:35.990
It was a wonderful
wrap-up of the day

02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:38.160
and I really enjoyed
your call to action,

02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:40.280
so I think it gives us
a place to move forward.

02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:43.270
I'd like to give just one
more round of applause to all

02:48:43.270 --> 02:48:44.570
of our speakers today.

02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:47.510
It's been a long day, but I
think it's been a great day.

02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:52.490
[ Applause ]

02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:55.020
It's hard to absorb all of
this stuff when you're sitting

02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:57.410
in the audience on the
first go, so a reminder

02:48:57.410 --> 02:48:59.070
that this is being
taped for YouTube

02:48:59.070 --> 02:49:02.590
and we will have a report about
the themes of the day coming

02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:06.000
out in probably early 2018 and
we'll distribute those widely.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:12.100
A quick announcement, on
behalf of Nancy for IPRES 2018,

02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:13.710
is going to be in Boston.

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:15.740
And correct me if
I get this wrong,

02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:18.320
September 24th through
27th, 2018.

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:19.640
Okay, great, so be
on the lookout

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:23.680
for calls for papers for that.

02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:25.570
Those of you who
are participating

02:49:25.570 --> 02:49:28.320
in our workshop tomorrow
please go to the cafeteria

02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:29.750
and we'll do a little powwow.

02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:31.600
The rest of you should
go to Bull Feathers

02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:33.620
and order me a Chardonnet, okay?

02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:36.070
[laughter] Okay, so
thanks so much for coming

02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:37.810
and it's been a great
experience,

02:49:37.810 --> 02:49:40.510
and we hope you have
enjoyed it as well.
