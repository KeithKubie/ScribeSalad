00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.300
( banjo music playing )

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.739
Ooh...

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.074
I think I left most
of myself in there.

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.309
Uh, I'm telling ya.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.413
I was seeing stars
at one point.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.048
I always tell people

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:19.486
no one stinks up a bathroom
like my brother Skeet.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.886
I'll tell you what.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.154
That's what
I tell them.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.656
What!

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.291
Don't mix those two things.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.593
It's very explosive.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.895
I'm sorry I yelled at ya.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:30.262
I know you got
the blinks now,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.431
but we've gotta get
this batch right.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:33.632
If we can do that,

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.568
we can move out
of this dump

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.971
and move into where
dreams comes true.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.505
Yeah, that's right, Skeet.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.440
Good-bye Kansas City,
Kansas.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.510
Hello, Kansas City,
Missouri.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.812
Hmm.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.881
We'll go fishin' like
we used to, right, Skeeter?

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.483
That's right, Beck.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.586
And we're gonna be using real
fishin' wire this time.

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:55.454
Oh, that's right, Skeet.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.357
Oh, our best days
lie ahead of us.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.160
What!

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.499
Holy Moses.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.334
What the hell?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.636
Oh, my God, Beck,
don't look down.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.071
What? Why?

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.208
What, ah,
I got no damn arms!

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:18.511
Yeah, it seems like
they come up missing.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.447
I can still
go fishin', right, Skeet?

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.349
Sure, sure you can.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.718
Uh, yeah, we'll
go fishin' still, yeah.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.554
I mean, we could still kick
possums around the coal mine.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.523
You don't need no arms for--

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.259
for possum kicking,
do you, Skeet?

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.629
Yeah, I suppose you don't
kick with your arms, yeah.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:37.963
Hey, listen, pumpkin.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.333
I'm gonna go put
these in some ice

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.134
and call an ambulance,
all right?

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:45.504
No, they'll put us
in jail for sure.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.106
I'll just use
this here towel

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.541
to stop the bleeding.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.242
No, Becky Lee!

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:51.611
Oh!

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.081
Oh, jeez.

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.883
Beck, where are ya?

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.417
Skeet?

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.952
Holy Moses.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.322
I can't seem to
feel my legs, Skeet.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.626
That's ‘cause you
ain't got none, Beck.

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:09.695
Oh, makes sense then.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.232
Well, we can still
do all those things

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.800
we talked about,
right, Skeeter?

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.669
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:18.871
I guess you could
put my torso

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:20.673
on a log by the creek.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.875
And I could sing
one of my good songs?

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.211
Sure, we can do all that.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.880
Your torso's gonna
see the world.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.416
It sure is, Skeet.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.218
What are you doing now?

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:35.321
I need to
cauterize the wound.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.523
No, Beck!

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.363
We're gonna make it,
right, Skeet?

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.097
That's right, Beck.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.399
Hey, how ‘bout ya

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:48.634
sing us one
of them good songs?

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:54.707
