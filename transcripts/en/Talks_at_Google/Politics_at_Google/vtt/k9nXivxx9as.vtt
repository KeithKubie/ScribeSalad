- El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Honduras

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.650
are some of our
closest neighbors.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.330
Yet, many North
Americans don't know

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.060
that this region is experiencing
some of the highest levels

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.140
of violence in the world.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.100
Families caught in the
middle of this violence

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.900
have few options for
protection or assistance.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.090
As a result, many people
are left with no choice

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.970
but to migrate across
international borders.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.002
Cristosal is a human
rights organization

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:34.210
based in El Salvador working
to strengthen assistance

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.660
and protection options
for victims of violence

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.390
in the region, to write-based
programming, research,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.440
and learning.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.230
One case at a time, we come
alongside victims of violence

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.360
to provide protection
when they need it most.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
And repair the lingering effects
of violations they suffer.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.540
One community at
a time, we worked

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.140
to build human
rights' environments

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.540
and create conditions where
peace building is possible.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.690
- We started by
taking just one case.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430
That case, and each new case we
commit to, has a ripple effect.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.960
When we say human
rights matter, we

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.970
mean for all people
in all places.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.470
We're fundamentally concerned
about our brothers and sisters

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.600
independently of what
country they live in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.360
because we know ultimately
that how they're treated

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.500
will affect peace and
security for all of us.

in community perspectives.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.660
We work with vulnerable groups
to research the discrimination,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.410
violence, and human rights
violations that affect them.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.780
One group at a time,
we're empowering people

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.360
with the knowledge to
defend human rights.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.580
- With each case, we
protect the individual lives

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.960
of people at risk.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.930
We reject historic
cultures of impunity.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.400
We build human
rights environments

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.140
and we send a
message to the world

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.530
about the value of individual
human life and dignity.

NOAH BULLOCK: Thank you again,
John, for the invitation to be

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.540
here with you all.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.760
And thanks for making time
in your busy schedules.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.930
We know how important
your work is as well.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.000
It's an honor to be
able to share what we do

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.630
and to know that there
are people interested here

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.370
in Palo Alto and Google.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.570
So thank you, again,
for sharing with me.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.970
I thought I'd start
a little bit talking

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.250
about the region itself.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.070
Central America
is a place that's

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.410
geographically close to
us, as Kathy mentioned.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.100
Who doesn't know
a Central America?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.330
They're our neighbors.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.400
They live among us.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.860
They are some of us.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.990
But also, our
countries and regions

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.510
have been interconnected
politically,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870
interconnected in
business relationships.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.430
It's a region of
the world that I

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.650
think a lot of North
Americans don't

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.360
think a lot about unless
there's a negative headline

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.410
in the newspaper.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.330
And one of the reasons,
or one of the ways

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.990
that North Americans have
become more familiar or aware

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.110
of Central America,
is through migrants.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.270
And more specifically,
through children.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.560
Central American children who in
2014 surprised our government,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.500
or country, because they
came in the tens of thousands

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.960
unaccompanied to
our southern border.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.990
And then more
recently, the situation

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.320
of children being separated.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.710
Migrant children from Central
America being separated

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.660
from their families I think
shook the country again

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.880
and made us confront difficult
moral and ethical questions

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.390
about the way we treat people,
our neighbors who come mostly

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.230
looking for protection
in our country.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.580
And I think that's what I
wanted to talk more about.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.720
The issue of immigration is
obviously a polemic issue.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.934
But I think there's
an important statistic

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:35.350
that we should
remember when we're

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.770
trying to interpret what it
means in our country right now.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.550
Immigration is in the
top 10, if not five,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.040
political issues of the day.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.550
Yet strikingly, the
numbers of immigrants

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.820
coming into our country
is at a 30-year low.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.820
So it's important
to reflect on what

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.670
is the nature of
migration crisis,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.030
if it is that we have one here.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.860
And I think it's also important
to put it in context to what's

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.630
happening globally.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.620
There are more people in the
world displaced by violence

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.610
than even during World War II,
which was the previous record.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.160
So there is a significant
crisis globally

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.340
in people fleeing their homes.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.440
Protection of crisis,
because oftentimes

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.470
they flee their homes they
aren't finding the solutions

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.340
that they're looking for.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.670
But in our country,
we can't say that we

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.860
have that problem of numbers.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.100
We can't say that our
communities are being inundated

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
by a wave of migration.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.790
Because statistically
that's not happening.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.100
If we do have a
crisis in our country,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.430
I would say it's a
crisis of response.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.770
What's changed about immigration
from Central America and Mexico

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.680
to the United States
is the demographic.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.200
What we have now
is less the profile

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.410
of an individual coming from
Central America or Mexico

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.930
looking for a job
or temporary work.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.230
And now we're having to
deal with the arrival

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.950
of entire families, mostly
from Central America,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.450
coming to the United States.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.580
And many of them
are fleeing directly

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.740
threats of violence
and persecution,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.190
or indirectly struggling to
live in an environment of what

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.800
we call generalized violence.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.950
And so that demographic
shift in immigration

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.900
has been a significant
challenge because it

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.870
raises important questions
about our responsibilities,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.670
or our government's
responsibilities,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.860
to these people who arrive.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.360
Have they arrived illegally?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.250
Are they criminals?

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.810
How should we respond?

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.790
And I think that's
one of the things that

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.860
made the policy of separating
children from their family so

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.020
shocking to many people.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.070
Because I think that
there's increasing awareness

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.530
among people in
the United States

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.530
that children aren't
here to steal our jobs

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.470
or to cause problems
in our communities.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.440
Something is going
on in the region

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.640
in Central America that's
moving entire families to uproot

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.070
themselves at great risk
to themselves to cross

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.050
a border with little expectation
that they would be received

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.610
and given legal status.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.670
Something must be
compelling them to flee.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.360
And I want to talk a little bit
more about those conditions.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.430
This idea of the prospect of a
demographic shift of migrants

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.190
means that we have to challenge
our traditional narrative

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.405
about immigration in the
Mesoamerican migratory

00:07:35.405 --> 00:07:35.905
corridor.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.790
We've thought for decades
now that the primary profile

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.510
of a migrant moving through
Mexico into the United States

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.390
is an economic migrant.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.780
One looking for opportunity.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.180
And that's the nature
of what a migrant is.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.670
It's someone who's chosen to
leave their homes in search

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.290
of a better opportunity or
other options, education,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.150
family unification.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.720
But when people are compelled
to flee, they act differently.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.880
Often times people
who are forced to flee

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.930
don't even have a
destination necessarily.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.634
They're not moving
with a specific plan

00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:13.550
that they thought out.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.980
They're moving because they
were forced from their homes

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.850
and are desperately
trying to find an option.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.640
And that's different
than when people

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.940
are trying to look for
a better opportunity

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.150
and having planned or chosen
to take on their immigration.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.620
And so in Central
America our work

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.380
has focused primarily on
people who are internally

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.000
displaced by violence.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.890
Meaning that one
of the patterns we

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.470
see that's related
to migratory outflows

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.600
or transnational
movements of people

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.270
is that people who
are fleeing oftentimes

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.240
use internal displacement
as a precursor

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.450
to a transnational
migratory route.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.010
For example, the first step may
often be moving from one home

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.580
to another.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.640
Or staying with a family
member in the country of origin

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.850
as a first means of
trying to find protection.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.870
And when those people exhaust
the options for protection,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.690
even using family
resources or even at times

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.120
trying to get the
state to assist them,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.610
then they make the
decision to cross a border.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.680
And that moment is
really important.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.200
Because when people
are still within

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.650
their national boundaries
of the country of origin,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.600
the international
frameworks tell us

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.190
that internally
displaced people are

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.560
the primary responsibilities
of the state

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.489
and the government of
the country of origin.

00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:38.530
But when they cross an
international border, when

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.360
a person-- this is the language
of the Refugee Convention--

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.550
is unable or unwilling
to avail themselves

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.190
of the protection in
their country of origin,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.380
that responsibility to
protect is transferred

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.430
onto the host country.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.940
And the idea is
that no human being

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.100
can be denied a
place on planet Earth

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.090
where they can live free from
persecution and violence.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.280
It's to say that
everyone should be

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.620
able to find some
place on planet Earth

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.340
where their rights and basic
protection can be guaranteed.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.570
And so when Central
Americans make that decision

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.730
to cross an
international border,

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.210
they aren't being often
recognized as refugees.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.010
They're being treated as
illegal or regular migrants.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.344
And that's a
problematic scenario

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:25.760
because you have
tens of thousands

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.390
of people moving across
borders seeking protection.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.300
And no state is able
to give it to them.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.550
It's almost like forcing
a group of people

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.670
to live in the shadows.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.530
I call it one of the greatest
acts of privatization

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.570
in our generation,
is the privatization

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.070
of the responsibility
to protect,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.030
which is primarily among
states but has been privatized

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.350
to the families.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.590
And families do
courageous and often crazy

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.890
things to try and find ways to
get their members to safety.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.190
And when North Americans
ask, for example,

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.770
how is it possible that
Central American parents send

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.550
their children on a
company to our border?

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.550
It's because they're
making those very difficult

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.060
calculations about how they can
find safety for at least one

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.020
of their members.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.380
And knowing that
the United States

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.480
has made great efforts to deter
migration by using detention.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.260
Or cruel conditions
while in detention

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.880
to send messages back to
Central American families

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.100
about how they will
be received when

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.510
they come to the United States.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.640
That doesn't deter
a family who's

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:38.610
faced with death, torture, rape,
or persecution in their homes.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.140
And so in some ways
these strategies

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.960
that are abusive to migrants
in our own countries

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.270
are also failures
on a policy level

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.500
because they fail to understand
what it means to flee and not

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.990
just migrate for opportunities.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.700
Cristosal-- our work as a human
rights organization focuses,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.450
as you heard in the
video, on accompanying

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.320
victims of violence.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.620
We're not necessarily
working on migration.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.180
We see migration
and displacement

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.580
as a consequence of
failure to protect rights

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.170
and of a situation of
generalized violence

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.800
in the region.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.450
And just to give
you a sense of what

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:20.730
I mean by that,
between 2005 and 2009

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.970
El Salvador, for
example, per capita

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.570
had a higher rate of
violent death than Iraq

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.240
during the peak of
their armed conflict.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.730
There was an interesting
academic article written

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.310
by a colleague who wrote--

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.440
the title of his piece was "More
Deadly Than Armed Conflict."

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.125
And he looked at homicide
rates in the Northern Triangle,

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:42.600
El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Honduras,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.840
and compared those to combined
homicide and casualty rates

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.490
in countries like Syria or Iraq
that have open-armed conflicts,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.920
more traditional
armed conflicts.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.719
And the outcome of
that analysis is

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:56.760
that these are some of
the most violent countries

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.800
in the world even taking into
account countries in open war.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.540
And so what you
have in El Salvador

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.580
is a situation that isn't
necessarily a traditional war,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.490
but one that's generating
humanitarian consequences that

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.730
are comparative to other
armed conflicts in the world.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.090
And that's something
that has been difficult

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.640
not only to integrate into this
narrative about immigration.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.850
Then perhaps we have
a refugee crisis

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.840
on the American continent.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.630
But it's been
difficult to integrate

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.290
into the security approaches in
the countries of the Northern

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.640
Triangle.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.360
And what the governments have
done in response to violence

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.940
is to declare war on
criminal groups that

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.790
are the primary perpetrators
of atrocities and acts

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.220
of violence, so street gangs.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.150
Street gangs is a diminutive
way of talking about them

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.220
because they have
capacities that generally

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.710
go beyond what we understand
in the United States

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.270
as a street gang.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.060
They control territories.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.670
They control many aspects
of the lives of the people

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.030
who live in those territories,
like where they can work.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.640
How they can sell if
they have a store.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.440
Where they can go to school.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.600
Where you can get health care.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.860
We've seen cases
where grandchildren

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.660
have gone to visit
their grandmothers

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.270
and had to cross an invisible
boundary between one gang

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.590
territory and the other.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.420
And that has led to violent
acts perpetrated against them

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.914
in reprisals for having entered
into opposite gang territory

00:14:27.914 --> 00:14:30.080
even though those people
aren't members of the gang.

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.060
The easiest way to understand
it is to compare it

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.550
to the way dictators work.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.620
Dictators control countries.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.130
They control many aspects
of the lives of the people.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.960
And people try and
find ways to live

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.810
within those countries
acquiescent often

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.199
to criminal actions of the state
up until they can't, the point

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:54.240
where they can't anymore.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.930
Let's say in Syria, well,
I no longer can do this.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.430
Maybe I'm going to protest.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.460
And as soon as you challenge the
authority of the dictatorship,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.030
the dictatorship responds
with persecution and violence

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.470
against you the same way that
the gangs act in communities.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.140
Gangs will force community
member for pay extortion.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.830
They'll force young members of
families to join their ranks.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.310
They'll force women
to become sex slaves.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.460
We call them
[SPEAKING SPANISH],, forced

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.440
girlfriends of gang members.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.380
And so homicide, disappearances,
sexual violence all

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.770
become ways of exercising
control in these areas.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.810
And the state is
incapable of stopping

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.190
that Incapable of holding
back criminal groups who

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.480
are capable of violating
fundamental rights of citizens.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.200
And what they've done, the
states, is declare war on them.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.130
And in this war the state
has militarized certain parts

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.710
of the country
and used primarily

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.610
repressive and military means
to try and reduce violence.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.340
Abandoning the consequences
of that violence,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.190
meaning that the entire
security approach

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.940
has been a militaristic one.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.870
And there are no programs to
assist victims of violence.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.900
So when families
do become victims

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.340
the justice system, the police,
the social security networks,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.780
the women's
protection institutes,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.460
the children
protection institutes

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.050
are unable to do
anything for them.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.720
And so when we
try and understand

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.170
why Central Americans or people
from the Northern Triangle

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.380
leave the region, primarily
it's because of commissions

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.610
of violence by criminal groups,
gangs, death squads, narco

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.020
trafficking groups.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.800
But also violence by
the state, the army,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.930
the police in the context
of a war on gangs.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.720
And then omissions, the
failure of the state

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.140
to do anything to guarantee
their lives, to assist victims.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.350
And so our goal
as an organization

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.869
is to provide victims with
a safe space and services

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.160
to stabilize their lives.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.819
And in that sense, it's a
very humanitarian mission

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.410
to try and save lives.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.890
But also use that assistance to
help people to see themselves

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.720
as agents of change.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.260
To try and change and challenge
the security strategy.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.260
To try and build and strengthen
the national protection system

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.220
so that other families who
are in similar situations

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.120
won't suffer without
any recourse.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.500
And so I left on
your rows a poster,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:44.184
a little poster that we made
of a drawing and a poem.

00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:46.100
And I wanted to share
this as a story with you

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.370
to highlight how
our programs work.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:55.040
This drawing was made by a young
girl in one of our safe houses.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:01.190
And this girl was a member
of a family of 30 people.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.650
And this family lived
in an area controlled

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.700
by a gang on the outskirts of
the capital of El Salvador, San

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.620
Salvador.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.280
And this gang came
one day to the family

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.310
and raped two of their members.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.710
They gang raped two
members of this family

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.180
and told the family that if
they reported the crimes,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.540
if they resisted the gang's
future demands that they

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.670
would all be killed.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.790
And so when the family was
threatened and suffered

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.390
these acts of violence they
displaced to another community

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.570
in El Salvador.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.430
And while they were in hiding
in a house in another place,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.530
the military entered into
the community in an operation

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.690
with the police in
which they began

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.230
to detain many of the young
men in that community.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.110
But they entered into the home
where this family was in hiding

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.220
and began to fire.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.900
And they killed the
matriarch of the family.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.230
And they told the family
members that if they

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.140
reported this crime,
if they said anything,

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.980
that they would all die.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.980
And that's when they
entered into our program

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.760
where we were able to provide
safe house protection for them,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.640
humanitarian assistance,
legal assistance,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.660
psychosocial assistance, medical
assistance to try and stabilize

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.740
the family.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.630
But in that process we
began to talk to them

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.920
about their rights, helping
them see that the violence

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.160
and displacement that they had
suffered isn't their fault.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.540
That it's part of a system,
a security strategy that's

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.670
immanently violent.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.100
But also part of a
structural problem

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.470
in which the state
or the society

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.690
hasn't made a commitment
to protecting and assisting

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.520
victims.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.110
But that there's something
that could be done about that.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.860
And we began to talk to them
about maybe reconsidering

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.930
reporting what happened.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.820
And we mentioned
to them the option

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.570
of doing what we call
strategic litigation.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.380
That in El Salvador there
is a special mechanism

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.590
that in the case of violation
of constitutional rights,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.820
citizens can go directly to
the highest judicial authority,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.674
the Supreme Court.

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.090
And we asked them
if they would be

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.020
willing to make a claim to
the Supreme Court holding

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.240
the Attorney General,
the Minister of Defense,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.520
the Minister of
Justice and Security,

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.090
and the Salvadoran legislature
responsible for violating

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.570
their constitutional rights
in failing to protect them.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.550
And they didn't really
even think about it

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.940
very long at all.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.470
They said, we understand
what happened to us.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.830
And if we can do anything
so that other families don't

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.170
suffer what we have,
then it's worth the risk

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.540
of trying to seek justice.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:43.970
And so they gave our lawyers,
our legal team, legal powers.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.370
And we presented a claim to
the Salvadoran Supreme Court

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.610
suing those people I
mentioned for violating

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.710
constitutional rights.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.730
I know this sounds
a little bit boring.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.610
But to make the
long story short,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.840
on July 13th the Supreme
Court of El Salvador

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.740
ruled in favor of the victims.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.450
They said that the
Salvadoran state

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.850
has to recognize internal
displacement by violence

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.310
and their responsibility
to protect victims.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.100
They gave the state
six months to create

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.760
a legislative framework
to build policy proposals

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.410
and make a budget priority for
programs in the national budget

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.240
to assist victims.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.560
And so we moved quickly
with the family.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.780
They authorized
us to draft a law

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.020
and present it to the
Salvadoran legislature about two

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.070
weeks ago.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:35.270
A special law to build a
national response to assist

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.340
internally displaced people.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.860
And the law, when
we presented it

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.820
to the Security Committee
of the legislator,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.450
the President took it directly
to the legislative assembly

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.910
and asked for a streamlined
legislative process.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.440
And we needed 41 votes
for it to be admitted.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.960
And we got 44 on
the first round.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.560
And so now the law is being
assessed at the legal offices,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.580
all the ministries.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.900
And it's moving forward.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.300
So we have this
unbelievable opportunity.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.270
We're working with one case
with, as we said in the video,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.190
with one family.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.240
To safeguard their lives
we're now in a position

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.450
to design the first
national response

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.690
to internal displacement by
violence in Central America.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.100
And that's in El
Salvador, but we

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.520
think that that model can
be used to also respond

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.620
in Guatemala and Honduras.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.550
So it's a great privilege
of ours in the organization

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.002
to be able to work
directly with victims

00:22:34.002 --> 00:22:35.210
and safeguarding their lives.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.840
But also be a part of expanding
protection for human rights

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.120
to an entire
population of people.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.930
And designing also the national
response to this great problem

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.930
affecting our region.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.810
So that's a success story.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.930
We're very happy.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.590
The poem I wanted to
draw your attention to,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.550
we translated at the
bottom of the poster.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:04.230
The drawing, we debated
whether this was something

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.509
that's inspirational or not.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.550
But in the end, I think
it's quite inspirational.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.960
You can see in the
drawing that there's

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:16.920
a caged bird in the mouth of the
girl, something that reminds us

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.870
of the slogan that
many people see

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:20.370
on the walls in the communities.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.330
It is see, here, and shut up.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.120
That's how you stay safe.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.610
And this is, as you can
imagine, a girl writing

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.950
in a clandestine safe house.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.820
She writes this poem and
it is called "Sadness."

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.430
It says, "if I am
free, I will be happy.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.890
I am the light that
illuminates in all places.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.420
I am your refuge and
I am your happiness."

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.840
And I think the poem in
itself has its own merits.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.760
But when I think of how the
courage of her and her family

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.120
in seeking justice and the
impact that potentially

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.040
could have on so many
other people and families,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.260
I think that she's right.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.850
That she is the light and the
refuge for many in her hope.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.970
And if you like, you can
take these posters with you

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.186
to share the story
with other people.

00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:15.206
I wanted to just
maybe close by sharing

00:24:15.206 --> 00:24:16.830
a little bit of a
reflection that we've

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.380
been making about our work.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.740
Kathy mentioned that part
of our commitment to working

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.440
with victims in Central
America has led us also

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.980
to representing the victims
of the El Mazote Massacre.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.300
El Mazote is the
largest massacre

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.580
perpetrated in the Western
hemisphere in modern times.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.010
In 1980, the Salvadoran
military entered

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.320
into the village of El
Mazote and slaughtered

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.500
over 1,000 people.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.950
Most of them were children.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.180
Today, Cristosal, as
a private plaintiff,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.010
is prosecuting the
Minister of Defense

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.490
and the Salvadoran Military
High Command, the people who

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:01.750
were the architects of the war
strategy from 1980 to 1984.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.220
And that war strategy was one
in which the military decided

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.750
to exterminate all people who
lived in areas where there was

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.330
a presence of insurgent groups.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.190
And one of the
things that we talk

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.760
about when we talk about these
types of cases in which we're

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.160
trying war criminals, or
trying people for crimes

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.100
against humanity,
is that we don't

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.750
believe that in successfully
prosecuting this case

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.850
we will stop war crimes from
ever happening ever again.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.610
But what we do think makes
this struggle worthwhile,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.630
beyond the victim's right
to truth and justice,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.850
is that we have the
opportunity to challenge

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.070
the assumption of impunity.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.220
That is the idea
that powerful people

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.640
can do what they like
with weaker people

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.050
simply because they can.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.330
And there will be no
consequences for it.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.340
That's one of the
dynamics of dictatorship

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.470
and authoritarianism,
is this idea

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.530
that I can do what I like
simply because I'm powerful.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.370
And I can do whatever I
like with whomever I like.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.250
And when we look
at those patterns,

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.250
sometimes that impunity
manifests itself

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.950
in atrocities like the
El Mazote Massacre.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.630
And sometimes it
manifests itself

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.360
in simple corruption,
the idea that because I'm

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.490
powerful I can do what I
like with the resources

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.930
of the state, for example.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.550
And so this legacy in
Central America of violence,

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.010
of abandonment of the
victims, and of corruption

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.130
is linked to a historic
legacy of impunity.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.590
And so when we are prosecuting
the war crimes committed

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.200
during the Salvadoran
Civil War 30 years ago,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.920
we think there's a direct
connection with our work

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.224
with victims today.

00:26:42.224 --> 00:26:43.890
And we also think
that there's something

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.100
important to be said in the
world about the assumption

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.115
of impunity.

00:26:48.115 --> 00:26:49.890
When we look around
at our region,

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.510
and we look around
at the world, we

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.150
see a resurgence in
authoritarianism.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.850
New governments
emerging or governments

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:01.260
transforming into increasingly
authoritarian regimes.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.810
And we think that
sending a signal

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.880
through the successful
prosecution of one

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.220
of the largest
unprosecuted war crimes

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.960
will help us to challenge
that assumption of impunity.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.420
To say that we can be
light, like the young girl

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.140
wrote, in the world
right now where

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.720
we see setbacks in many
protections of human rights.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.380
We see setbacks in the
expansion of liberal democracy

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.880
around the world.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.400
That we have to and we
have a responsibility

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.720
to continue to
challenge impunity.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.570
Uphold standards
that we believe are

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.720
the basis for the foundation
of peace and security

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.390
in the world.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.340
And those standards,
we believe those

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.440
to be that all people
are fundamentally

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.000
equal in rights and dignity.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.550
And respect for
that principle is

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:53.110
the basis of peace and
security across the world.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.190
I'm not making that up.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.020
It's what the World
War II generation

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.970
signed into the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.990
The generation
that suffered some

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.300
of the worst atrocities
known in human history

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.080
concluded that our peace,
that peace in the world,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.390
is linked to my
concern with how people

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.040
are treated in my own country.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.120
But also how people are
treated in other countries.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.840
And so I think I'll conclude
my remarks there and maybe

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.516
open it up to questions.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.010
AUDIENCE: So that was
a lot of information.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.380
What can we do here as people
that live here in the Bay Area?

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.000
What can we do to
help with this cause?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.080
NOAH BULLOCK: Yeah, I have
given some thought to that

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.132
specifically in this
first opportunity

00:28:40.132 --> 00:28:41.590
to be with you at
Google, because I

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.465
think there are some
specific things that you

00:28:43.465 --> 00:28:44.500
could help us do.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.500
In general, we need
people to give.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.230
I think all NGOs need donors.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.400
Our work as an independent
human rights organization

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.680
depends on people making gifts.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.720
Unrestricted gifts that
allow us to work on

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.420
issues that other
people don't want.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.630
And to begin to develop
programmatic responses

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.220
before big donors
are willing to.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.550
So individuals like you
all who make gifts allow

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.000
us to do the things that we do.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.880
Also, we need people
who help us to advocate,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.960
who are willing to talk to their
friends about Central America,

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.500
about immigration, and even
about Cristosal's work.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.150
And to help us
expand our network

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.880
of support in the Bay Area.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.060
But more specifically
with Google,

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.620
there's something
that I think we can

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.765
continue in conversation about.

00:29:34.765 --> 00:29:37.470
But NGOs, we don't
have tech budgets.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:41.140
We don't have
technical expertise

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.740
to look at information
security, communications

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.440
plans and strategies and tools.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.010
Any number of things like that
often become the last thing

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.620
that you do with the grant.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.040
The last couple cents
in the grant, right.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.710
And one of the things that
I am absolutely convinced of

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.330
is we have a series
of human rights tools.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.350
I mentioned that we have
litigation and legal

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.980
assistance.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.690
We have protection units.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.670
We have research units.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.310
These are all tools for
advocacy and assistance.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.900
But one of the most
important tools right now,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.150
especially in the advent of this
resurgence of authoritarianism,

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.910
is our ability to
influence public opinion.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.270
The litigation or the
Supreme Court ruling

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.810
wouldn't have happened if
we wouldn't have first won

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.300
the national narrative
about displacement.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.040
The government said
it doesn't exist

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.720
and that the victims are liars.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.620
But the media believe our
statistics and our information.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.460
And I think if you did a survey
of opinion and in El Salvador,

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.310
overwhelmingly people
would support our position

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.900
and the Supreme Court ruling.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.390
But we don't have the tools
to do that so systematically.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.120
I think as an
organization we need

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.910
to have more sophisticated
ways of assessing

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.660
current public opinion,
identifying sectors of support,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.670
identifying the means
of communication,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:09.260
and messages to effectively
influence public opinion.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.230
That public opinion
and expectation

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.050
guarantees that a Supreme
Court ruling is implemented.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.420
Or that a new law holds weight.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.550
That becomes one of
those primary bulwarks

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.100
against the
assumption of impunity

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.990
that powerful groups
in the countries

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.310
can do whatever they want.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.490
Because if they believe that the
citizenry will confront them,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.350
they'll think twice.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.210
NGOs, human rights
NGOs, it's like were

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.020
in the 1980s in terms of
communication strategies

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.500
and resources.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.220
And I mentioned
information security.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.850
We do the best we can.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.590
But I'm sure you
all know a lot more.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.830
So the third one is
something to explore.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.110
How we can work more
closely with you

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:52.550
all who have skill sets that
we don't as human rights dorks,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.050
right.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.190
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.900
I have a question
about indirect support

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.220
to neighboring countries.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:08.290
I hear that in Europe a lot of
politicians across the spectrum

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:13.570
are trying to shift the
narrative regarding migration

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:16.310
to advocate for supporting
countries in the region,

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.150
especially to reduce
economic migration.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.240
And therefore shore up
the right of asylum.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.220
So we hear politicians
in Scandinavia

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.310
who are pushing for
more support for Turkey.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.540
Or to have richer countries like
Saudi Arabia taking refugees.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.780
I'm wondering if you think
that the US can do anything

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.370
given that immigration to the US
is really sensitive to provide

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.370
better resources to Mexico,
Costa Rica, other countries

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.270
in that region.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.070
Or if you think
that's an argument

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.110
to deflect
responsibility to states

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:52.540
that couldn't necessarily
handle the influx of refugees.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.670
NOAH BULLOCK: The issue
that you're touching on

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.160
is called burden sharing.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.070
It's established in the
1951 Refugee Convention

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.520
that no one state
should bear the burden

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.870
of all refugees in the world.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.920
But the whole world
should bear that burden.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.690
And I think in the world
the overwhelming majorities

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:18.070
of refugees are hosted by poor
and middle income countries.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.000
And what I said at the outset
of my presentation here,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.440
the United States is not
suffering an immigration crisis

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.080
or a refugee crisis numerically.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.910
And Europe really isn't either.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:34.550
The largest numbers are in poor
and middle income countries.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.100
And so how do we
respond collectively

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.940
to build capacity but
also share burden?

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.130
And the way that the
international community

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.610
is doing that is
through what they

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:50.550
call a Global
Compact on refugees,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:58.810
but through new strategies to
externalize responsibility.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.480
So for example,
the United States

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.730
supports Mexico with the
Southern Border Plan.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.350
It's this idea of extending
the border to the south

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.219
to stop migrants
before they come,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.620
which can be seen as
a way of cutting off

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.590
traditional access which
is at the border to refugee

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.909
protection.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:22.650
There's a whole series of
actions, like you mentioned,

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.100
that are trying to find ways
to skirt shared responsibility

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.560
directly.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.699
And that tendency
also confronts what

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.610
is the distinction between
a migrant and a refugee.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.580
Because what refugees are
doing around the world,

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.679
they're behaving differently
than they used to.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.699
We have a refugee crisis because
the international community is

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:47.280
incapable of ending conflict.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.670
So all conflicts keep going on.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.739
And new conflicts
become protracted.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:57.120
And so you have an accumulation
of displaced people.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.870
And the world is unable to
supply the humanitarian needs

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.240
of those growing populations.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.600
And so what refugees are
doing is they're not--

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.380
like in El Salvador
in the 1980s,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.010
many refugees crossed the
border and into Honduras

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.680
and waited in refugee camps
for the conflict to end.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.660
And when it ended they returned.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.086
Today where refugees
are doing is,

00:35:17.086 --> 00:35:18.960
I'm not going to sit
around in a refugee camp

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.640
and wait for them
to give me food

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.890
because I don't think this
thing is ever going to end.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.090
And even if it
did, I don't think

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.214
I'll be safe in my country.

00:35:25.214 --> 00:35:28.560
And so they enter into
a migratory routes.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.200
We call that mixed flows.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.400
And so the whole world is
trying to figure out who's

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.170
a refugee, who's a migrant.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:35.550
What are the responsibilities?

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.290
If one is a refugee
and one is a migrant,

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.500
then it's all very complicated.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.600
The largest emerging
displacement crisis

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.600
in the world is Venezuela.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.800
Possibly by next
year there'll be

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.600
more people displaced
in Venezuela

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.030
or something similar to
what you have in Syria.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.357
But there's no armed
conflict in Venezuela.

00:35:54.357 --> 00:35:56.190
And so all of the
countries in South America

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.273
are saying we have a bunch
of Venezuelan migrants.

00:35:58.273 --> 00:35:59.460
We don't have refugees here.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.370
So there's sort of
a crisis, and we

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.620
don't know how to
interpret what's happening.

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.400
We're skirting
responsibilities collectively.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.680
And instead of trying to assume
responsibilities and generate

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.980
a comprehensive humanitarian
response to displacement,

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.430
end conflict, we're trying
to skirt responsibilities

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.010
and externalize it to
countries of origin or host

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.690
countries of refugees.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.540
Having said that, I
also think, for example,

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.850
the bilateral support of
the United States government

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.190
to the three countries
in the Northern Triangle

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.870
to build protection
responses is important.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:41.974
I'll be in Washington
DC in October.

00:36:41.974 --> 00:36:43.890
And I'm going to take
the Supreme Court ruling

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.690
and I'm going to
say to Congress,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.190
this is a roadmap for response.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.780
Support it.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.610
So I think that we have to
play both roles, assuming

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.390
the responsibilities at home,
treating people with dignity

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.930
and respect independent
of their condition.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.920
But also have solidarity
with countries of origin

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.645
as they try and transform
those root causes.

00:37:07.645 --> 00:37:09.345
That was a long answer
to your question.

00:37:09.345 --> 00:37:11.540
But I could actually just
go on and on about it

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.760
because it's the major
contentious issue

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.970
in international
relations right now.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:20.460
It's just a big, big topic.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.360
AUDIENCE: I have a couple.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.410
Just to get back to your
specific example, so

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.900
what was the outcome
for the family?

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.930
NOAH BULLOCK: Yeah,
they left the country.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.640
All of them have
left the country

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.750
and are in the process
of refugee resettlement

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.010
somewhere else in the world.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.530
The last member to
leave the country

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.230
was the father, the patriarch.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.200
And he stayed in the
country long enough

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.290
to give testimony at
the Supreme Court.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.510
And it was a
powerful experience.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.550
Because it's not normal
for the Supreme Court

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.300
to ask for those sort of
first-hand testimonies.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.420
And we did a lot of
witness prep with him

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.680
prior to his interrogation
at the Court.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.520
And the guy, he did numbers.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.160
He did the numbers
about how much

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.790
is in the security
budget of El Salvador.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.550
And he said, we as citizens
are paying all this money

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.384
into security.

00:38:24.384 --> 00:38:25.800
And look, my whole
family is dead.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.710
I lost my house.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.640
I lost my livelihood.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.770
I lost my wife.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:32.640
So they owe me all
that money back.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.866
And we talked to him
about that not necessarily

00:38:34.866 --> 00:38:36.240
being the approach
that we should

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.620
take in the Supreme Court.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.170
But he did an amazing job.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.840
You can imagine that there were
15 defense lawyers representing

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.090
the highest officials in
the Salvadoran government.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.230
And his testimony,
he said, I was

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.660
displaced by gangs at first.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.220
And when we sought help from
the government there was none.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.170
And I lost my home.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.520
I lost 25 years of mortgage.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.710
I lost my business.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.360
My family was dispersed.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.180
We lost all of our belongings.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.350
And then once we were in hiding
and hoping to find protection,

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.910
and he turned and
looked directly

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.400
at the defense attorney
for the Minister of Justice

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.240
and Security and he
said, you killed my wife.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.915
And so it was a pretty
powerful moment.

00:39:24.915 --> 00:39:28.710
The Magistrates of the
Court, in open court

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.770
recognizing executional
killings and procedural fraud

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:35.890
in investigations
and serious issues.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.480
But he had the courage to do it.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.500
And when he was done,
we interviewed him

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.960
and asked him how he
felt. And he just started

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.980
crying tears of happiness.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.960
Something similar happens
with war crimes trials.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.910
When the survivors have given
testimony in court for so long,

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.550
society has told them that
what happened to them is either

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:01.110
their fault, they're criminals,
or it just didn't happen.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.810
And when they're able to
tell their story in front

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:08.120
of the judicial authorities,
it's an important reparation

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.700
to have society acknowledge
the terrible things

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.560
that have happened to
you and acknowledge

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.700
that those aren't
your fault. That's

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.100
what happened to the family.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.530
AUDIENCE: Through your process
of one case, one family,

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.480
one individual at a time, how
many cases, families, have

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.030
Cristosal worked with and
helped in the period you've

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.190
been with them?

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.900
NOAH BULLOCK: Well, I can
remember case number one.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.990
Our first case-- we detected
this problem of displacement

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.150
because we were
administering the High

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.670
Commissioner for Refugees
program in El Salvador.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.220
So our mandate was
to assist people

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.360
from other countries seeking
asylum in El Salvador, which

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.160
were very few people.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.150
And Salvadorans began
to come to our office

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.420
and trying to request asylum
which you can't do until you

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.160
leave the country, right.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.310
But we got so many cases that we
decided that we should probably

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.770
close this one
program down and begin

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.250
to think about how we might
assist Salvadorans fleeing

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.370
violence in the country.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.990
And we began to talk
around and trying

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.640
to do advocacy
internally in the country

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.740
and also externally
about the issue.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.990
But there was really
no context for anyone

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:26.550
to understand it until the
child migrant crisis in 2014.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.740
But what I wanted
to say about that

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:35.310
is that our first case was
a family of 25 people who

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.370
were forced to flee
their homes and ended up

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:41.270
camping outside the US embassy.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:45.510
When we heard about
that I said, oh man.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.490
We have to put our money
where our mouth is.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.340
And we had been planning
on building our protection

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.350
responses and safe houses
and things like that.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.760
But we had no resources yet.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.560
We weren't ready for it.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.060
And I said to my
program director

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.990
the embassy is going to call
us before 10:00 in the morning.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.520
I'm sure of it.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.910
So basically the
first case I spent

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.010
the payroll for the
next month to try

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.480
and activate our
first safe house.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.120
Literally from our
accountants all the way to

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.510
are our tiny legal staff--
we were an organization

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.190
of eight people at that point.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.010
We all took turns
operating the safe house.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.010
And that was case one.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:26.510
And now were on
case 450 something.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:31.140
So we've assisted thousands
of individual people.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.300
And now we're operating
in Guatemala and Honduras

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.870
and beginning to see some of
the first results of our work

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.400
there as well.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.660
This was case 91.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.070
AUDIENCE: One other question.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:47.960
The human rights-based approach
that Cristosal has adopted,

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.916
can you explain that a little
bit in three or four minutes?

00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:51.740
NOAH BULLOCK: Yes.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.260
AUDIENCE: And where
the genesis of it,

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.260
and how you're playing it?

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.120
NOAH BULLOCK: Yeah,
I've used words

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.480
that evoke a rights-based
approach, accountability,

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.970
responsibility, the state.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:12.620
After World War II, the
international human rights

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.480
resume was set up.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.460
It was set up on the basis
of a nation-state system.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.430
And the idea is
that a nation-state

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.580
is the primary guarantor
of human rights,

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.610
but also the primary
violator of human rights.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:31.010
And that means that it's
crime until the state fails

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.750
to respond in a systematic way.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.270
And then it becomes
human rights violation.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.250
A murder is a murder.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.670
But the state's responsible for
investigating and prosecuting

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.900
and protecting.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.460
States have to prevent, repair,
protect citizens, right.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.320
That's what they do.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.610
And so a rights-based
approach is this idea

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.200
that there are people
who have rights.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.610
But then there are also
organizations and people

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.710
who have corresponding duties.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.630
And so when we look at a problem
from a rights-based approach,

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:07.520
we can't as an organization
substitute the people who have

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.060
rights--

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.950
in the case of the
victims, them-- and their

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.190
processes of seeking justice.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.730
And we can't substitute the
state in their responsibilities

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.650
to fulfill rights.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.870
So our actions have
to be empowering

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.850
of both those parties.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:26.960
Meaning we have to empower the
victims to activate justice,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.200
to hold duty bearers or
the state accountable.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.740
But also we have to find
ways of strengthening

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.530
the capacity of the
state to fulfill

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:37.880
through positive actions.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.120
Like for example, in
El Salvador we just

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.120
open a joint safe house with the
Women's Development Institute.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.510
And we're transferring
our knowledge and models

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.780
of protecting families
to a state actor.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.240
But also, we have to
hold them accountable

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.970
for systematic situations
of discrimination

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.940
through actions like litigation.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.560
So what we can't do is
enter into the country

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:08.810
and begin to substitute the
state by only assisting.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.827
That's the responsibility
of the state.

00:45:10.827 --> 00:45:12.410
What we're trying
to do is demonstrate

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:16.730
how that could be done and then
activating the state to do it.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.800
So what's actually
worked out really strange

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.570
with this whole case
of the litigation

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.880
is through legal action
we created an obligation,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.460
a clear one on the state.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.700
Through the presentation
of new legislation,

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.340
we've designed a
national response

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.110
and organized how
the state is supposed

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.840
to be responsible to victims.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.380
And in developing legal
models of assistance,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.140
humanitarian assistance,
psychosocial assistance we

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:45.510
also can show the state
how they will respond.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.780
That's a rights-based approach.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.750
We've been able to assist
now thousands of people.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.720
But in doing that,
we've also demonstrated

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.190
how nationally the
government could respond

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.260
and created an
obligation to do it.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:04.430
It's a different way of working
than limiting your access

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.670
to humanitarian assistance.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.160
AUDIENCE: So how do you
ensure that as you're

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.770
going through the
process you are working

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.660
not only with victims
and with the state,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.770
but also with diverse voices
who come from within the state

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:22.100
and externally to create
a pathway for the state

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.870
to operate with victims?

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.230
NOAH BULLOCK: Yeah, you
can't only confront.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.060
You can't just be
confrontational, right.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.980
Otherwise you're
just on the outside

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.200
screaming towards those
who hold power, right.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.960
You have to find
entry points and begin

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.410
to work also cooperatively.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.600
So we've done that in
all three countries.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.750
In El Salvador, the
human rights ombudsman,

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.630
which is a national
office for human rights,

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.800
recognized forced displacement
I think about four years ago

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.210
in a partnership
agreement with Cristosal.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:57.090
And we did assessments
with how they

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.490
assist and drafted new
protocols and helped

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.820
them to begin to respond.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.420
So they were the first state
institution to respond.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.870
And we've done that with the
public defender's office,

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.610
with the Women's
Development Institute.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.030
We're working on that with
the Ministry of Health.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.780
So you have to find allies.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.890
The state is a big thing.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.960
It's not monolithic.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.120
And so you have to work
both that side, that more

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.710
confrontation or
litigation side,

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.410
to keep an obligation going.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:28.250
But also to work
cooperatively to show how

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:32.160
response and strength and
capacities for fulfillment.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:36.770
So you're right that there
has to be that balance.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.960
And that means you
have to navigate

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:44.000
tricky political
alliances sometimes.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.230
John, maybe one last thing.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:48.920
Before you leave, I just want to
call your attention to just one

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.630
photo here.

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:56.030
This one at the bottom, that's
a photo from the courtroom

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.350
in Morazan where we're
prosecuting El Mozote war crime

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.370
trial.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:06.440
In this day, this woman Rosario
was giving her testimony.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.320
She's a survivor
of the massacre.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.210
And this guy right here with
the gray hair and the glasses

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.970
was responsible for the
Salvadorian Armed Forces

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.050
in 1980.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.960
And he had to present
himself in court that day.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.190
And you can see this look
that she's giving him.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:28.680
I think that's another
example of the light, right.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.630
It's a really powerful
photo because she

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.050
has had to wait 30 years
to be able to confront.

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:38.210
Thank you, all.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.260
