00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.010
I don’t know how to ease you into this so
I’m just going to come right out and say

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.670
it; fish jizz is awesome.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.150
Hey there fish sticks, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.950
Scientists are an innovative bunch, and a
lot of great advances come from finding solutions

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.230
in creative ways.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.800
Well scientists in Japan are getting mighty
creative because they’ve proposed a way

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.590
to recycle electronic waste with, wait for
it…

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.770
Salmon sperm.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.560
You see a crucial component of the high tech
world are rare earth elements.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.559
They are the entire lanthanides group along
with scandium and yttrium, making 17 elements

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.559
total.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.420
They’re used sparingly in electronics but
they’re crucial to their performance.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.340
The Apple iPhone uses 8 rare earth elements
that make the screen, the speakers, and the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.690
circuit miniaturization possible.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.800
And like anything else, it’s better to recycle
them than to dig them up anew every time the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120
next iphone version comes out and everyone
throws last year’s model in a landfill.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.179
So in a great example of thinking outside
the box, Yoshio Takahashi and his research

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.420
team are looking inside the lox.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.789
As it turns out ions of Rare Earth Elements
bond to the phosphate groups that, along with

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.380
a sugar called deoxyribose, make up the spines
of the DNA double helix.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.979
Takahashi’s team wanted to see if they could
use DNA in water to extract these metals and

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.259
Salmon sperm happens to be ideal.

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.520
It’s not water soluble, it’s cheap, and
as anyone who’s seen CSI will tell you,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.540
semen is just silly with DNA.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.610
Takahashi’s team tested the idea by mixing
powdered fish splooge with a solution of neodymium,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.680
dysprosium and trivalent iron.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.890
Once the rare earth elements bonded to the
baby batter, it’s a simple matter of running

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.159
it all through acid and a centrifuge to isolate
the elements again.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.080
Amazingly this is not the first time fish’s
swimmers have been used for science.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.830
Salmon DNA has been used to shape silver nanoparticles
for use in optical data storage.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.999
Herring dna has been tested as a way to fireproof
cotton.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.869
And fish DNA has been used for decades in
molecular biology for detecting specific dna

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920
sequences in a technique called Southern blotting.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.439
And yet with all these uses, the Japanese
fishing industry still throws out tons of

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.219
the sticky stuff every year.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.820
Which raises an important question; who is
beating off all these fish???

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.760
You’d think with the amount of pre-Nemos
fish make, fish populations would be exploding.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.530
But that’s not the case.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.220
Trace explains the problem in a much more
mature video over here.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.260
Absurd science stories like this absolutely
make my day.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.100
If you have a favorite example of weird science,
we’d love to hear about it in the comments.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.280
Until next time, thanks for watching DNews.
