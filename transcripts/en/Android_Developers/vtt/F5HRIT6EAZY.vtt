BEN FRENKEL: Welcome
to this session

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.440
on developing successful
games with Google Play.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.440
Hope you're all having a
fantastic I/O. Is that true?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.830
You guys having a fun time here?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.670
[CHEERS]

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.660
Whoo!

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.167
Exactly.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's get energized.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.583
I know it's 10 o'clock
in the morning,

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:18.820
but let's get excited
for game stuff, right?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.131
Did you guys enjoy all the
festivities last night?

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:22.630
Yes?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.080
I'm seeing some nodding heads.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.246
Did you guys like the
blankets they were handing out

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:27.670
because it was freezing?

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.280
I certainly did.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.400
I grabbed one of those.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.700
So I'm Ben Frenkel.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.620
I'm a product manager
on the Play Games team.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.140
And in this session,
I'm going to provide you

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.520
an overview of what Play Games
is doing for game developers.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.110
And I'm joined today by
my esteemed colleague, TI,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.620
who's going to go into the
nitty-gritty details of how

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.290
to implement both Play Games
and other Play services.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.000
And we also have a very
special guest with us today,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.810
Duke Kim from
Netmarble, who's going

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.056
to talk about both a
background for Netmarble,

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:03.930
what games they have,
as well as what they're

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.060
doing with Play Games
and Play overall

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.430
to improve their business.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.760
But first, let's see
a quick show of hands.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.470
How many of you in this
room are game developers

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.680
or involved in
the game industry?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.380
Excellent.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.860
That is virtually everybody.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.930
I do see a few familiar
faces from the session

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.210
I did earlier in the week.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.410
How many of you were
at that session?

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.060
Good amount.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.560
All right.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.059
Well, the good news
for you, I'm not

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.810
going to bore you with
the same material.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.170
There is fresh content
here, and plenty of it.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.260
But for those of you
who were not there,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.050
I'll go and provide some
background on what Play Games

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.180
Services is all about.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.140
So our mission is to
provide developers

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.340
the tools and services they
need to create great games,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.790
and make money while
they're doing it, too.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.380
And in 2013, at I/O, we
launched Play Games Services

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.630
for the first time.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.100
And when we launched,
we had the basics.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.270
We had achievements,
we had leaderboards,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.340
we had a multiplayer stack,
and so on and so forth.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.970
And since then, we've become
the fastest-growing game network

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.950
ever.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.700
Fast forward to
today, and each month,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.280
hundreds of millions of people
sign into Play Games Services,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.860
and 50% of the top 500
games are integrated.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.910
But over the years,
the needs of developers

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.640
have evolved
substantially, and we've

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.530
had to evolve along with them.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.540
And so, Play Games
Services has since

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.600
expanded to offer things
like video recording

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.880
and predictive
analytics, and tools

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.220
to support live operations.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.790
And another way
we've had to evolve

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.270
is, we needed to start
bringing our tools

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.450
to the different products
that our partners use.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.530
And in particular,
what we observed

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.470
after a number of conversations
with large developers

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.180
and small developers, that
game developers typically

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390
fell into one of two camps.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.850
They either had their own game
engine that was built in C++,

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.310
or they used a game
engine, oftentimes a Unity

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.300
or a Cocos2d.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.310
So just a quick show of hands,
how many of you have your own

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.362
game engine that you've
built in C++ specifically?

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:25.570
How many of you have something,
your own game engine,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.070
not built in C++,
but another language?

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.890
Didn't think so.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.390
All right.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.160
That is not a real
thing, it turns out.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.630
And then, how many use a
game engine of some sort?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.430
OK, that's the vast
majority of the audience.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.610
And that makes
sense, which is why,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.400
when we looked at what
our partners were doing,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.610
we realized we absolutely had to
have support for game engines.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.120
So we actually
have a Unity plugin

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.234
that is a open-source project
that we maintain on GitHub,

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.650
and you can go check it out
and make use of those services

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.700
immediately.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.130
In addition to that, we
also, a couple of years ago,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.550
launched our C++ SDK, so that,
for those of you who do not

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.400
greatly enjoy crossing the JNI
bridge into Java land for doing

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.620
all of your integrations, you
can do them directly in C++

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.410
instead.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.600
And it just so happens
that, if you have a C++ SDK,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.560
it's relatively easy to
integrate Play Games Services

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.710
into game engines that
are built also on C++.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.950
And Cocos2d is just
such a game engine,

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.960
and they have native support
for a number of different Play

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.240
Games Services features to
make it very easy to integrate.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.370
And we're working with
partners to deepen and simplify

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.570
integrations all the
time, and we're always

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.970
on the lookout for
new and exciting game

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.790
engines to partner with.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.690
One recent entry in the
game engine fray is Defold.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.940
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with Defold,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.530
but Defold is a
lightweight game engine

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.800
from our friends
at King, and it's

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.100
a tool that makes it very,
very easy to make games.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.700
It's a simplified
developer experience,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.480
so developers can focus on
the fun and engaging part

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.410
of the game.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.970
And a few months
ago, they gave me

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.080
a sneak preview of
their integration

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.350
with Play Games Services,
and I was blown away

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.400
at how simple it was.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.580
I had to do a double take,
because the integration looked

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.980
so easy.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.420
And this is how
it works for them.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.870
So you first have to go into
the Play Developer Console

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.950
and grab an ID.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.230
This is a very easy thing to do.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.690
And then you go into
the Defold management

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.410
console and copy and paste
it in there somewhere.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.020
And then, once you've done
that very small bit of work,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.760
you can then, in a
single line of code,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.370
integrate Sign-In with
Play Games Services.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.210
So it's almost instantaneous.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.610
And when they
showed it to me, it

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.780
was something that I believe all
game engines should ultimately

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.590
aspire to be able to accomplish.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.960
It should take less than
an hour to integrate,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.962
and they really bring
that vision to fruition.

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.170
And we're excited to see
them launch their Play Games

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.880
Services support
later this year.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.010
So there's a lot of other
territory we could cover,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.910
but I'm going to
focus on three things

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.500
that Play Games can do to
help you engage and retain

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.600
your players.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.230
So first, we're going to talk
about how the Play Games Video

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.750
Recording API can help
you harness the energy

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.570
and enthusiasm of
your gaming community

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.590
to deepen player engagement.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.680
Then, we'll cover how you
can make dynamic updates

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.710
with services that Play Games
Services provides, and finally,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.530
talk about how you can use our
predictive analytics to tune

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.860
and tailor your game to
different player segments.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.170
So let's kick
things off with how

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.250
we can help you deepen your
engagement with your player

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.189
community.

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.980
So for a bit of
background, late last year,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.260
we made it possible for players
to record their gameplay

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.240
from the Play Games app.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.830
And in the next few weeks, we'll
be making the Video Recording

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.730
API available to all
developers, so that players

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.720
will be able to invoke that same
recording experience directly

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.087
from your games.

00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:12.670
And Duke is going to talk about
how they're doing that in some

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.730
of Netmarble titles later on.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.570
Players will also
have the option

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.980
to live stream their
gameplay to YouTube, as well.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.040
It's a really powerful feature.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.650
And we've seen a
lot of excitement

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.126
around video recording, from
the very smallest developers

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:29.750
to the largest we
have in the platform.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.470
And more than a dozen
partners, including Netmarble,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.750
prominently, have already
launched an integration,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.824
because they are participating
in our early access program.

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:40.990
And like I said, this will
be available to everybody

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.905
in the coming weeks.

00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:43.780
And all the games that
you're seeing up here,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.790
you can check out on
the Play Store today,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.240
so you can get an idea of
how the integrations work.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.680
One such excellent
integration is from a partner

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.459
of ours, Camex Games.

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.000
And I was really impressed for
a number of different reasons,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.240
and I'll walk you through
how their integration works.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.320
So from one of the
battle screens here,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.580
you can see on
your left, there's

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.140
a little recording icon.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.020
And if you click that button,
it brings up a video recording

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.530
overlay.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.280
And from that overlay,
you have all the controls

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.550
you need to mute
the mic, turn on

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.030
and off the
forward-facing camera,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.650
as well as start and stop video
recording, as you would expect.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.680
And then, once you're
done recording your video,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.780
you can then share
it on YouTube.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.740
And you can see on the
screen on your right,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.190
here, that I've been able to
clip the video from the end.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.350
And you can also observe
from the screenshot,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:45.630
here, that the engine
has prefilled the title

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.700
and description
with helpful data

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.920
to speed up the process
of sharing replays.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.100
And from Michael Tseng,
the COO of Camex Games,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.770
they said, "the
Google standalone

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.610
Recording SDK took less
than a day to implement,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.720
and players are recording
clips every day now."

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.340
Less than a day to implement.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.680
So it's a very quick
and easy integration.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.290
You can do it in a very
short period of time,

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.720
and immediately get
your players engaged

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.640
with the video
recording capabilities.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.620
And another thing
that I very much

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.240
liked about their
integration was

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.257
that they made the feature
prominent in multiple places

00:09:26.257 --> 00:09:26.840
in their game.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.920
So off of the main screen, you
could launch the recording--

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.820
so ultimately, you could
share a much broader range

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.920
of experiences-- and they also
included, as I showed before,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.150
from the battle screen.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.420
And the more visible the
feature is, the more likely

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.146
your players are to
find it and use it.

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:46.520
In addition to that, they also
turned the video recording

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.120
capabilities into a selling
point for Hero Tactics.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.870
So when you go
into the game, they

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.970
would promote the
use of the feature,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.079
and they even featured it
in their store listings.

00:09:55.079 --> 00:09:56.870
And all these different
things that they've

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.120
done to provide visibility to
the video recording feature

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.700
have been very successful.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.110
So 12% of their users
have recorded videos,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.790
and most of them have
recorded multiple videos.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.780
And they share these
replays through all

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.370
the typical social channels,
as well as, very prominently,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.210
YouTube.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.680
It's a great way to engage
your audience deeply and have

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.770
them sell your game for you.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.660
Very powerful stuff.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.830
So now I want to talk about how
Play Games can help you make

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.990
dynamic updates to your game.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.780
And most developers that we
talk to, very successful ones,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.240
manage their game as a service.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.450
And critical to that is being
able to dynamically control

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.390
different aspects of their
game from the servers.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.094
But it's a lot of hard
work to set up and manage

00:10:44.094 --> 00:10:45.760
these types of things,
and if you're not

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.720
a huge studio with
dedicated server engineers,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.710
every minute you spend on this
kind of backend server work

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.190
comes at the direct expense
of working on your game.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.800
Well, that's no
longer a requirement.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.410
In the coming weeks, we'll be
able to use the Play Games Game

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.560
Parameters Management Tool
so that you can dynamically

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.410
manage the different parameters
that drive your game.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.040
And with Game
Parameters Management,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.290
you'll be able to manage
things like your virtual good

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.040
inventory, your
gameplay parameters,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.290
manage your
different currencies,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.800
and create time and
location-based overrides.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.520
Now, the time and location-based
overrides are really useful.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.830
Many developers that offer
time-limited content,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.840
like a new character or
a level, and so forth,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.140
still have to manually turn
on and off these promotions

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.290
and live events.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:46.411
So if your promotion, let's say,
ended at 11:59:59 on a Sunday,

00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:47.910
we've heard many
developers actually

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.780
have to have someone
come into the office

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.784
and hit a button to turn
off their promotion.

00:11:55.784 --> 00:11:57.450
There has to be a
better way to do this.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.860
And in fact, there is, and it
is Game Parameters Management,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.910
just to be clear.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.720
So if you are running
a global business

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.670
and you want promotions to be
run at locally-relevant times,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.420
with our time and
country-based overrides,

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.230
you'll be able to specify
country-specific start and stop

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.232
times, and we automatically
manage everything for you.

00:12:19.232 --> 00:12:20.690
And like all of
our other features,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.975
this will be available for
free in the Developer console.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.880
And we've been
working very closely

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.970
with our partner,
Concrete Software,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.470
throughout the development of
Game Parameters Management.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.080
And we were inspired to build
the Game Parameters Management

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.000
service by the opportunity
to make it easier, faster

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.920
and cheaper for Concrete to
manage their game as a service.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.950
So in the words of
Keith Pichelman,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.900
Game Parameters Management
will drastically

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.640
cut setup time and
issues while allowing

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.460
us to create all kinds
of new promotions

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.972
they couldn't previously.

00:12:55.972 --> 00:12:58.180
And they're looking forward
to having Game Parameters

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.264
Management in all
their future games.

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:04.180
But let's turn our
attention to how developers

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.070
are using the Player Stats
API to tailor game experiences

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.800
for different player segments.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.470
So we launched the Player
Stats API last year,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.480
and we've continued to invest
in a number of new predictions

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.580
to make the Player Stats
API even more powerful.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.090
We launched with some
basic stats, like sessions

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.070
percentile, spend
percentile, as well as

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.270
with some predictions, the
probability that someone

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.440
is likely to churn,
as well as spend.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.370
And we have two new
predictions coming out

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.560
in the next few weeks.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.020
One of them is a prediction
of how much someone

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.430
is likely to spend
in the next 28 days,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.660
and the other is the
likelihood that someone

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.390
will become a high
spender, a 95th percentile

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.850
spender or above.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.240
And we couldn't be more
excited to see what

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.310
creative things
you'll be able to do

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.760
with these new predictions.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.280
But I thought I'd go through
a couple of different examples

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.696
of what people are
doing, and sort

00:13:55.696 --> 00:13:58.450
of the enthusiasm we're seeing
from the gaming community.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.280
And so, a developer, GameResort,
felt that the Player Stats API

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.490
was one of the most exciting
things that's recently happened

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.950
for game developers,
particularly

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.380
for small developers that
don't have the resources to do

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.450
this type of work.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.360
And that's a common
sentiment amongst many

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.090
of the smaller and indie
developers that we talk to.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.500
The predictive analytics
power that we have

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.060
is something that is very
difficult to do independently,

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.400
and we give that capability
for free, through a Play Games

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.930
Services integration.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.990
And what GameResort
is planning to do

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:34.850
with the API is to
use spend prediction

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.290
to determine whether or not
a user will show ads-- or see

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.880
ads, I should say.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.499
And in fact, this
other developer's

00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:43.040
already launched
such an integration.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.320
So developer Underwater Apps has
a really exciting integration

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.110
of the Player Stats API.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.440
They integrated Player Stats
into their game Tapventures,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.430
and used the spend
prediction signal

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.370
to determine if users should
see ads, as I was describing.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.940
And if a user was predicted to
spend, they saw no ads at all,

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.780
and if a user is not
projected to spend,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.245
they saw ads every time
they opened up the game.

00:15:07.245 --> 00:15:09.870
And they ran an experiment that
compared their current approach

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.560
to serving ads to the
new approach, powered

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.900
by spend prediction, and the
results speak for themselves.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.480
So revenue from ads was 17%
higher in the cohort predicted

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.760
not to spend, and
not showing ads

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.360
to users that were probable to
spend increased in-ad purchase

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.970
transactions by 15%.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.250
You can see the quote there.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.160
But another really exciting
example that we just recently

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.130
heard about is from
our partner eRepublik,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.760
who's implemented another great
use case for Player Stats.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.810
So eRepublik has an internal
custom relationship management

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.260
system they use to
track support tickets,

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.000
and so forth, and manage
outbound communication

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.010
to players.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.420
And all the tickets
in their queue

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.640
are prioritized based
on-- at least today,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.880
and before they have these
new predictions involved--

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.540
based on how much
people are spending.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.790
So your big spenders, the
people who spend it all,

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.634
get prioritized
over other folks.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.050
But with the Player
Stats, they've

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.710
added churn and
spend predictions

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.750
to their prioritization model
to help identify users that

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.420
have yet to spend
that are likely to,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.050
and try to retain users
that are at risk of churn.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.080
And we're excited to see
what other creative use cases

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.990
eRepublik can come up with.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.910
This was something that we
think that many people who

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.810
have their own custom
relationship management

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.230
tools, internally, can
replicate and benefit from.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:44.140
And with that, I'll
hand things over to TI.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.757
Thank you.

00:16:44.757 --> 00:16:47.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.420
TI CHANG: Thanks, Ben.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.630
My name is TI Chang, and I'm
developer for Games Partners.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.150
Google has numerous
excellent products,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.790
but this time, I
want to specifically

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.880
focus on their
product, [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.410
mobile games I worked with.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.069
As you know, there
is a huge competition

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.740
in those segments
of the game market,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.180
and the developers are very
cautious about when they

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.960
decide the product they use.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.150
The product,
[INAUDIBLE], for them,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.920
can be regarded as
competitive in the market.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.359
Moreover, I'd like to show
you how easy to use them.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.530
Here are five product
really, really worked well

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.300
for my partners.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.210
Let me go through them one
by one, and what they are,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.800
and how to use.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.610
The first one is
Pre-registration.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.770
Pre-registration has been
a very common practice

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.560
in PC gaming world.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.800
When you launch a
game, then you usually

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.770
do the beta testing, and
pre-registration, and launch.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.060
Google provides seamless
onboarding experience

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.260
through Google Play
Pre-registration.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.940
It's one of the most effective
user acquisition tool,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.410
and helps the
developer from day one.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.000
In APAC, especially
Japan and Korea,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.530
this is the most common
practice in mobile.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.710
Let me go through the
actual user experience

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.010
for Pre-registration.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.040
When a big title, like
Clash Royale, is launching,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.580
we prepare a free
registration event before,

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.010
and share the message through
various marketing channels,

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.350
so the user can
discover and sign up.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.600
When user clicks the
banner or follows the link,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.960
then they go to the game page in
Play Games store-- Play Store,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.010
sorry-- sign up for
the pre-registration.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.290
At the day of game
launch, the user

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.950
gets a notification
to install the game

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.460
so that they won't miss it.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.550
We found that this type
of onboarding experience

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.170
helps to [? rustle ?]
partners by helping

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.700
hundreds of thousands of users
to install their game from day

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.410
one.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.230
Many of the pre-registered
users remain

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:21.720
to be highly engaging and loyal
to the games for a long time.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.140
Previously, signing in Google
Play Games was depending

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.610
on the users Google+ profile,
which sometimes introduced

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.130
frictions.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.660
If you don't have a Google+
profile in your account,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.250
then you have to create it, and
also give a consent each game

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.910
before you start.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.250
With the recent
update of Play Games,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.750
now you can sign in without
using Google+ anymore.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.880
Instead, we introduce a
new gamer ID and avatar,

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.680
which are not connected to
any of the personal data

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.190
in Google's properties,
and also can be used

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.969
to identify you among games.

00:20:05.969 --> 00:20:07.510
So you don't need
to give the consent

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.830
to every game you install.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.730
If you create a gamer ID for
the first game you sign in,

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.560
then all other games
you install later

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.090
will automatically use it, and
won't interrupt you any more.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.440
Here is the previous sample
called Play Games sign-in.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.690
You can notice that it used
to use Plus.API and Scope.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.500
Now, you won't use it.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.950
Just use Games.API, and
Scope will work fine.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.280
If your game is still
using Google+ features,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.450
such as profiles or
[INAUDIBLE] code,

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.900
then you still need to add
Google+ functionalities.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.100
Then, please use
setRequireGooglePlus method

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.360
to notify to Play Games.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.220
This will help you handle
the rest of the process.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.050
The next great
feature in Play Games,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.590
obviously, is Video
Recording API.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.110
Ben already gave you how
it works on overview,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.630
but I want to focus on how
easy the integration is.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.300
Video Recording feature
is in Play Games App,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.450
and you can use it by simply
invoking the recording

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.000
widget from your game.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.020
Just two lines of
coding make this work.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.190
But please bear in mind
that the feature required

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.230
to install the latest version
of the Play Games app,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:38.170
and devices with Android 5.0
or above, so you'd better

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:43.500
notify this to your users,
before you let them use it.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.940
Also, the recording quality
of the video recording

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.540
is depending on the performance
of the device and your game.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.580
Here, you can see how the
video recording works.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.180
This is a kind of video
recorded by the [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.490
And it shows you how you
can invoke the recording

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.210
widget from the game, and
click to record the gameplay.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.740
Can you play the video record?

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680
Thank you.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:34.078
You can see my face and the
screen recorded together.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.400
Once you're done, just
click the Stop button,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.110
and choose to upload
it to YouTube.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.180
Play it again.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.925
Hey, it's cool.

00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:11.300
BEN FRENKEL: We
can see it twice.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:11.925
TI CHANG: Yeah.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:21.940
BEN FRENKEL: So if you
could stop the video.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.930
TI CHANG: Can you
stop the video?

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.430
OK.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.600
OK.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.720
So integration takes
just two lines of coding.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.750
Start the activity
for recording video

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.690
with an OverlayRecordingIntent.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.976
This API will be
public soon after I/O.

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:51.380
Player Stats API is a
great tool to get insight

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.090
from the user stats.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.480
If you know a user about
the segment he belongs to,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.300
you can tailor the game
experience to make it better

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.000
for the specific user.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.190
The API will tell you lots of
things about the user, based

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.840
on the data regarding player
progression, spending,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.742
and engagement.

00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:14.080
Player Stats API
also predicts how

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.280
the user will behave
in the future,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.170
based on Google's powerful
machine learning technologies.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.280
It will tell you the
user will churn or spend,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.280
or whether he will
be a high spender,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:31.710
or how much he will spend
within the next 28 days.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.790
Let us see how a user
can tailor the game

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.780
experience with this API.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.710
If the user is likely to
spend, you can turn off all ads

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.800
to make the experience better.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.700
Or he's unlikely
to spend, then you

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.410
can show ads every 20 minutes.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.500
If the user is
about to churn, you

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.300
can suggest a chance
to try a powerful item

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.840
to make him stay longer.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.710
If the user has not come
back for just 10 days,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.600
you can send him a
notification about how

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.240
his friends are doing.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.800
He might come back to check it.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.300
If the user is likely
to be a big spender,

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.180
you can show him
a special VIP Item

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.030
which is more expensive
and more powerful.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.340
Using Player Stats
API is so simple.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.380
You can call
loadPlayerStats method

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.750
and get the data in the
result [? callback. ?]

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.640
The prediction
starts working soon,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.720
within just a couple of
days after first sign-in.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.980
The more he plays and leaves the
trace in Play Games, the better

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.100
prediction you will get.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.550
So please try to use as many
features of Play Games as

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.140
possible.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.865
It will help you get more
accurate data and predictions.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.390
And last not but the
least, In-App Promotion

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:06.230
is another powerful tool you
can use from Google Play.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.880
With the In-App Promotion,
you can reward your loyal user

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.420
and the newcomers.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.360
Think about a game
community event in which you

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.240
can introduce your new game
and share some promo codes

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.170
to the attendees with
a special in-app item.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:28.003
As long as your game is using
In-App Billing Version 3,

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:29.890
the integration
costs very little.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.920
Let me show you how
the process works.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.360
First, you can go to
the developer console

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.760
and generate promo
code connected

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.420
to a specific in-app item.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.370
Then, distribute the codes to
the users' marketing channels,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.730
such as social network,
or blogs, or Messenger.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:57.515
Once users get the code, they
can redeem it within game

00:26:57.515 --> 00:27:00.370
or within Play Store.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.590
Your game client can
handle this redemption

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.340
as part of In-App
Billing Version 3.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.690
Finally, the user
gets the reward,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.315
and you can successfully
cultivate the loyal users.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.660
This is a screen of
Play Developer Console.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.380
You can create a promotion.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.250
You can define a promotion
with the start and end dates.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.880
You can link it
to an in-app item,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.070
and also specify the number
of codes you generate.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.120
Let me tell you how to
handle this within your game.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.670
When the code is redeemed
during the user in-app purchase

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.450
process inside the
game, by choosing

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.980
redeem option of the payment
UI, this is almost identical to

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.020
with normal In-App
Billing Version 3,

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:58.680
except that there is no
orderId in the purchase data,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.250
since there are no
actual transactions.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:07.570
When the code is redeemed in
Play Store, outside of game,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.950
the thing will be a
little bit different.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.875
You can redeem the
code before installing,

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:14.050
or while running the app.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.840
In that case, you
can handle redemption

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.390
when the game starts.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.470
When the code is
redeemed in Play Store

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.180
while your game
is up and running,

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.310
the store will
let your game know

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.760
that there is an update by
sending an intent called

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.560
PurchasesUpdate.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.820
So your game should listen
to this intent and handle it.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.820
Please note that there will be
no orderId or developer payload

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.670
when redeemed in Play Store.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.320
Let's quickly look at the
code snippets of the last case

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.040
I just mentioned.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.880
You should register a broadcast
receiver for the intent

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.790
when your activities
are resumed,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:00.880
and unregister it
when it's paused.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.660
On the same method
of the receiver,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:09.020
you can handle the
purchased item as user,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.690
but you will see neither a
orderId nor developer payload,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.700
since it was not real,
actual transaction,

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.150
and purchase didn't
happen within game.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:26.020
In many cases, I recommend to
create a separate in-app item

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.660
which is not visible inside the
game just for promo code only.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.870
It's way easier to sort out
the purchase-by-redemption

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:38.430
from those by actual payment.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.940
So far, I have explained
Google Play products

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.380
which was really useful
to our game partner.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.570
Now, I want to invite
and introduce to you

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:55.660
Duke from Netmarble, one of
our top game partners in Korea.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.450
Duke has been working
closely with Google

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:00.840
for last couple of
years, and he will

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.234
share the developer experience
from his point of view.

00:30:04.234 --> 00:30:06.054
Duke, please come on.

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:09.018
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.370
DUKE KIM: Hello.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.490
My name is Duke Kim.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.560
And yeah, I have
English name, but it

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.690
doesn't mean that I can
speak English very well.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:28.260
So just focusing on
the script and slide.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.960
I just want to introduce myself.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:36.110
I was a developer for 10 years,
and now I'm VP of marketing.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:41.840
So I can explain the
developer's viewpoint,

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.850
and also at the same time,
a marketing point, too.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.747
Before starting, I
just want to introduce

00:30:47.747 --> 00:30:52.820
Netmarble, because Netmarble
is not popular here.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.640
And Netmarble is
not young company.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.625
It's almost 16
years old company,

00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:02.324
and we just started
a game business

00:31:02.324 --> 00:31:05.470
as a PC online game publisher.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:10.570
And now, we are number one
mobile game publisher in Korea,

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.210
and our market share
in Korea is over 30%.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.500
It's amazing.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:22.520
And currently, we make
money in Korea, maybe 48%,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.978
and then the rest coming
from outside of Korea.

00:31:26.978 --> 00:31:30.580
And we are number eight
worldwide mobile revenue

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.716
in last year.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.230
I introduced MARVEL
Future Fight.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:42.080
We used [INAUDIBLE] for
promoting this title,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.580
and this title
launched in April 2015,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.550
last year, in the
top 10 grossing

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.860
in a major Asian country,
including Taiwan, Thailand,

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.980
Korea-- yeah, not
good result in Japan--

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.300
and the top 20 grossing in US.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:05.902
I prepared a video to spend
time. [CHUCKLES] Wait a minute.

00:32:05.902 --> 00:32:06.568
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:06.568 --> 00:32:09.520
-Relinquish all hope.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.948
There is no use in resisting.

00:32:13.948 --> 00:32:18.376
There is only pain.

00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:25.264
I, [INAUDIBLE], am your
new lord and master.

00:32:25.264 --> 00:32:28.740
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.366
DUKE KIM: Next time I
will prepare more longer

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:34.457
version. [LAUGHS] Yeah,
MARVEL Future Fight has

00:32:34.457 --> 00:32:38.300
had Google promotion
event for a week

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.410
at the launching
time of last year.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.390
And during this event,
the user received a reward

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.430
when they entered get
the game after clicking

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:52.750
the Google promote banner
at the Google Play top page.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:58.080
A total of 40,000 users
participate in that event

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.210
and used the promo code.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:06.870
From this, our new registered
users were increased by 15%.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.380
This number comparison
during the event week

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.000
and the previous
week of the event.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.330
At that time, our
goal was understanding

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.300
how to use Google promo code.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:25.280
Because in Korea,
in Asia, coupon

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.180
is a very popular marketing
method at offline,

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.020
and that is very important.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.900
And we want to expand that
experience outside of Korea,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.700
outside of Asia, but there
is no way to spread a coupon.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.000
But because of a
Google promo code,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.980
I think we can find the right
method to use our knowledge

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.010
about the coupon in Asia.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.940
And I want to introduce
the next game.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.400
The next game is Raven.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.520
Raven is a console-quality hack
and slash RPG, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.430
Raven.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.969
Raven was launched in
March of last year,

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:10.739
and maintained
number one grossing

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:14.050
is Google Play Korea for
more than six months.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.295
It's record.

00:34:15.295 --> 00:34:17.609
This game has broken
several market records

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:20.630
in download and sales,
and largely drove

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.340
Netmarble's revenue
in last year.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:31.320
During the last year,
Korea Game Awards Ceremony,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.460
Raven won the highest
honor, grand [? prize, ?]

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.670
and also a Top Developer prize.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:41.040
And is also scored award for
scenario, sound, graphics,

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.124
and domestic popularity.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.943
Here, the gameplay
clip of Raven.

00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:51.927
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:51.927 --> 00:34:54.915
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:12.843 --> 00:35:19.815
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:19.815 --> 00:35:21.164
DUKE KIM: OK, next slide.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.715
Raven has had a
Google promotion event

00:35:26.715 --> 00:35:32.570
for a week from 24 September
to 1 October of last year,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.422
during the Korean
Thanksgiving holidays.

00:35:35.422 --> 00:35:38.870
The event process was very
similar to MARVEL Future Fight,

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:43.490
and the user would receive a
reward when enter in the game

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:47.200
after clicking the promo banner
at the top page of Google Play.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.620
You can see the effect.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.650
DAU increasing.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.730
New registration increasing.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.270
Returning user increasing.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.220
Revenue increasing.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:03.800
But the most important
thing is, with this event,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.880
we improved our retention rate.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.220
Because every day, user
can get a different reward

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.730
from Google Play, so you
just continuously log in,

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.060
log in, log in, for a week.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.190
That is the most powerful
effect of a Google promo code.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.721
And EvilBane is the
global version of Raven.

00:36:31.721 --> 00:36:37.590
It's a blockbuster-quality
action RPG launched this year.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.774
In Taiwan, we are number two.

00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:40.940
Thailand, we're number four.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.062
Hong Kong is number seven.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.450
We did many things
for Western market.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.616
Left side is original
version, and the right side

00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:59.140
is the new version.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.520
We changed the UI, and
we developed new pictures

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.500
to meet the taste of Western.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.560
But we still try to
understand the Western gamers,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.640
because there are huge
difference between Asian gamers

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.140
and Western gamers.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:22.870
Asian gamers usually spend
four or five hours a day

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.050
to play games.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.500
Crazy, right?

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:32.930
But Western, it's just spend
maybe a half hour a day.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.805
A huge difference.

00:37:33.805 --> 00:37:38.370
So the same balance will
not work outside of Korea,

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.520
outside of Asia.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.370
So they get headache
over Netmarble.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.240
And we did pre-registration.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.030
Pre-registration is
really important in Asia,

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:57.880
because every Asia gamer want to
be a number one among players.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.620
That means the easiest way is,
start game earlier than others.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.620
So pre-registration is the
best way to start game earlier.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.810
So that means, for
Netmarble, that

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:18.080
is best way to collect loyal
user before launching the game.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.290
So our pre-registration result
is really, really important

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.260
for us.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.200
And in Korea, in Asia, we
can collect phone number

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.440
without any limitation.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.770
But outside Korea,
that is not normal.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.670
And we tried
collecting email, we

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:39.060
tried collecting [INAUDIBLE]
ID, and every time, we failed.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:44.100
But with a Google team, the
new future of pre-registration,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.290
finally, we find
out the best way

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:51.610
to do pre-registering
campaign outside of Korea.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.710
Here, the chart is
really hard to explain,

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.250
because of my English problem.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:02.690
Anyway, we accomplished a DAU
of 200,000 on the first day

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.540
of the launching, with the
help of pre-registration

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.295
and the Google
[? pre-training. ?] And

00:39:07.295 --> 00:39:11.480
the Google [? pre-training ?]
very powerful, but problem is,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.160
it is really hard to
collecting core users.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.800
But with the
pre-registration, we

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:23.070
believe we succeeded to collect
loyal user or hard-core gamer

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.880
outside of Korea.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:33.780
And we also adopt a
video recording feature.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.113
Hopefully, with this
feature, we can make a sort

00:39:38.113 --> 00:39:41.880
of a user community at YouTube.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.280
And we try, now, and we
digging the possibility

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.277
of this picture.

00:39:49.277 --> 00:39:53.820
But currently, it has
just fundamental feature.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.360
Just user can recording
and uploading,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.710
and we need more feature to
meet the IP holder's needs,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.640
like Disney and
Marvel and Warner.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.590
And we're discussing about
that with Google continuously,

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.380
and I think, at
the launching time,

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:16.830
you can use this feature
more powerfully than us.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:24.220
And finally, I just want
to cover Player Stats API.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.560
You can predict spender,
and you can predict churn.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.730
It looks like cool.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.510
And Netmarble, Netmarble
is big company,

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.890
so we have our own
prediction model.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.074
We have our own churn
prediction model.

00:40:41.074 --> 00:40:43.950
But problem is, at
the launching time,

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.190
we don't have enough
data to-- how can

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.680
I say-- to use our own model.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:58.170
But Player Stats API looks
like give me meaningful result

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.490
at the launching time.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:05.640
So I think, after launching
one or two months,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.190
we can use our model.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.010
But at the starting time,
the Player Stats API

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.530
is very important to
predict what will happen.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.970
And we were thinking
about using that

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.250
for promoting some
of our in-app item,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:28.880
and also using that to
predict the marketing budget.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.910
Yeah.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.170
OK, thank you.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.810
And I just give it to Ben.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.260
