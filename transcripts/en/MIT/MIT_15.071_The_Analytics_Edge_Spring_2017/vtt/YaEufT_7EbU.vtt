00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.200
So can a CART model actually
predict Supreme Court case

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.220
outcomes better than
a group of experts?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.550
Martin and his colleagues used
628 previous Supreme Court

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.790
cases between 1994 and
2001 to build their model.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.470
They made predictions
for the 68 cases

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.840
that would be decided
in October, 2002,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.310
before the term started.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.340
Their model had two
stages of CART trees.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.160
The first stage involved
making predictions

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.900
using two CART trees.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.420
One to predict a unanimous
liberal decision and one

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.700
to predict a unanimous
conservative decision.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.060
If the trees gave conflicting
responses or both predicted no,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.600
then they moved on
to the next stage.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.220
It turns out that about
50% of Supreme Court cases

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.550
result in a unanimous decision.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.970
So this was a nice first step
to detect the easier cases.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.600
The second stage
consisted of predicting

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.760
the decision of each
individual justice.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.340
And then using the majority
decision of all nine justices

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.180
as a final prediction
for the case.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.610
In this lecture, we
constructed the CART tree

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.539
for Justice Stevens.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.320
Here's a different tree, this
one for Justice O'Connor.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170
The first split
is whether or not

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.390
the lower court
decision is liberal.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.250
If yes, then we predict that
she will reverse the case.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.360
This makes sense because
Justice O'Connor is generally

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170
viewed as a conservative judge.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.880
On the other hand, if the lower
court decision is conservative,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.009
we check for the
circuit court of origin.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.440
If it's the second, third,
DC, or federal court,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.660
we predict that she
will affirm the case.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.729
If it's not one of these courts,
we move on to the next split.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.170
The remaining two splits
are for the respondent

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.520
and the primary issue.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.100
Here's another tree, this
one for Justice Souter.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.830
This shows an unusual
property of the CART trees

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.509
that Martin and his
colleagues developed.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.970
They use predictions
for some trees

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.380
as independent variables
for other trees.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.120
In this tree, the first
split is whether or not

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.860
Justice Ginsburg predicted
decision is liberal.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.190
So we have to run Justice
Ginsburg's CART tree first.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.079
See what the prediction is.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.930
And then use that as input
for Justice Souter's tree.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.690
If Justice Ginsburg
predicted decision is liberal

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.329
and the lower court
decision is liberal,

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.610
then we predict that Justice
Souter will affirm the case.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.610
But if the lower court
decision is conservative,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.430
then we predict that Justice
Souter will reverse the case.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.530
On the other side of the
tree, if Justice Ginsburg

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.020
predicted decision
is conservative,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.660
but the lower court
decision is liberal,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.390
then we predict that Justice
Souter will reverse the case.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.770
But if the lower court
decision is conservative,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.520
then we predict that Justice
Souter will affirm the case.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.650
In summary, if we predict
that Justice Ginsburg will

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.460
make a liberal decision,
then Justice Souter

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.620
will probably make a
liberal decision too.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.930
But if we predict that
Justice Ginsburg will

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.320
make a conservative
decision, then we

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.270
predict that Justice
Souter will probably

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.329
make a conservative
decision too.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.520
Martin and his colleagues also
recruited 83 legal experts,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.210
71 academics, and 12 attorneys.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.430
38 had previously clerked
for a Supreme Court Justice,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.660
33 were chaired
professors, and five

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.340
were current or former
law school deans.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.840
So this was really a
dream team of experts.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.910
Additionally, the
experts were only

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.540
asked to predict within
their area of expertise.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.470
So not all experts
predicted all cases.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.010
But there was more than one
expert making predictions

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.220
for each case.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.460
When making their
predictions, the experts

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.620
were allowed to consider
any source of information.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.430
But they were not
allowed to communicate

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.140
with each other regarding
the predictions.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.579
For the 68 cases
in October, 2002,

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.890
the predictions were made,
and at the end of the month

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.010
the results were computed.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.890
For predicting the
overall decision that

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.430
was made by the Supreme
Court, the models

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.240
had an accuracy of 75%,
while the experts only

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.980
had an accuracy of 59%.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.120
So the models had a significant
edge over the experts

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.450
in predicting the
overall case outcomes.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.920
However, when the
predictions were

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.820
run for individual justices,
the model and the experts

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.950
performed very similarly.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.700
For some justices, the
model performed better.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.070
And for some justices, the
experts performed better.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.659
Being able to predict
Supreme Court decisions

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.840
is very valuable to
firms, politicians,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.830
and nongovernmental
organizations.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.180
We saw in this lecture
that a model that

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.720
predicts overall Supreme
Court decisions is both more

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.650
accurate than experts and can
be run much faster than experts

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.810
can make their predictions.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.420
The CART models
that we built were

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.060
based on very high level
components of the cases,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.880
compared to the
experts who can process

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.520
much more detailed and
complex information.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.660
This example really
shows the edge

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.170
that analytics can provide
in traditionally qualitative

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.520
applications.
