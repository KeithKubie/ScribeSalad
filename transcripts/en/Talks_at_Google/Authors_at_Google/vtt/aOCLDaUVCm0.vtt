RICH MINER: Hey, all.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.825
Rich Miner, Google Ventures.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm just going to
introduce David

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.780
because I've known him for, I
think, pretty close to 20 years

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.076
or so.

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:17.888
I'm excited to have
him here talking

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:20.210
about his book and
other projects.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.690
He's been a sort of innovator,
entrepreneur in the Boston area

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.720
for-- well, since the early 90's
and has a multitude of degrees,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.680
including, I think
most recently,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.655
he was sort of both
at MIT Media Lab

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:41.825
and also at Harvard
[INAUDIBLE] and got a masters.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.940
But he'll give you
more of his background.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240
From my perspective,
I think I first

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.422
started seeing David
around-- taking

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:54.180
real notice around the time of
Ambient-- welcome, come on in.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.450
For me, he really
caught my eye when

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.440
he was doing the work at
Ambient Devices, which

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.360
was, I don't know, his second
or third startup out of five

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.618
or six.

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:06.612
But his ability to
combine beautiful objects

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:10.604
and information in the
most unbelievably simplest

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:14.610
terms absolutely
caught my imagination

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.885
and started to make
me realize just how

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:19.870
you can cook down incredible
amounts of information

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.242
into common, everyday
objects that are around you.

00:01:24.242 --> 00:01:26.970
And I'm interested in hearing
what he has to tell us today

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.954
about his explorations
in [INAUDIBLE] and that

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.537
and other things
that he's been doing.

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:34.980
And so with that, I will
give you David Rose.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.146
DAVID ROSE: Thank you, Rich.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:40.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.220
Thanks for having
me this morning.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.590
I brought you all posters.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.714
There aren't enough books
to give out to everybody.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:49.460
But they're available on
Amazon, or ask your manager.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.270
They'll pay for them I've heard.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.900
But Rick Borovoy
just reminded me

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.060
that one of his objects,
the nTAG conference badge,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.114
which you wear, and it talks
to other conference badges

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:05.530
and seeds the conversation
with interesting things to say,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.919
is one of the things
on the periodic table

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.790
of enchanted objects.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.350
So have one of these.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.240
And the meat of the talk sort of
covers some of what these are.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.189
And so this is good
reference for later too.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.980
But there are more at
the back of the room.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.120
And for people that are back
in the lodge living room,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.150
could I ask you guys to come up?

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.070
It's more fun to have
you be part of the mix.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.900
So today, I'm going
to try to convince you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.780
that these black slabs, which
are doing so well for Google,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.650
may not be the future
of how we interact

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.670
with the internet
in five or 10 years.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.137
And to tee up the
conversation, I

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.720
want to show you a recent piece
that came out in the "New York

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.040
Times" last week-- or I guess it
was the week before now-- that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.720
features my cute son.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.360
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.370
-Enchanted objects
are ordinary things

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.210
that have the same functionality
that they had before,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.600
except now, they can talk.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.750
They're connected.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.226
These are ordinary
things that have

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:22.350
extraordinary capabilities.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.450
-When we're creating
technology for the home,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.630
really we want to
make something that's

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.620
seamless and transparent,
and as opposed to having

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.850
things sort of call out and
draw your attention to it,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.730
make it a more
ambient experience.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.220
-It will just continue to behave
with those everyday objects

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.200
as we do in the world.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.990
And we can remain
focused on connectivity

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.090
between two people.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.540
-What we're seeing now
is this proliferation

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.660
of different devices that are
moving out from the cellphone

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.671
and onto our bodies
and into the world.

00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.170
-So in the middle
of our living room

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.090
is a coffee table that
has Google Earth embedded

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.380
in the coffee table.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.410
And I just found
that having access

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.240
to this amazing,
zoomable map completely

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.800
changes how often
we talk about travel

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.390
and how often we
talk about the world

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.220
and how often we look up
places that are mentioned.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.770
And it's nice to have this
beautiful, large reference

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.080
object sitting in the
middle of our living space.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.760
Our devices can
be a lot simpler.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.890
And the interaction to
them can be a lot simpler.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.220
The internet-connected
umbrella can just

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.700
be an umbrella that only shows
whether it's going to rain.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.680
You don't need to tap on
an icon or do anything

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.460
that seems sort of artificial.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.650
-We come from a time
in which we need

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.640
to adapt to our homes, and
not the other way around.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.555
So what if our home
could be a platform

00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:55.320
that we personalize
and we customize?

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.570
The key is how do we create this
ecosystem, these technologies

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.180
that allow us to move
from one experience

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.990
to the other in the most
seamless, most magical way.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.740
-Some people might think that a
connected home is overwhelming,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.580
that there'll be so much
information in a connected home

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.370
that it's just a
cacophonous environment,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.869
and you wouldn't
want to live there.

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.310
But I think about how we
decorate our homes today.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.220
We put photographs everywhere.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.380
We put paintings up.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.030
We put Post-It notes up.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.240
There's a lot of decoration
and adornment in the home.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.230
And I think if
enchanted objects can

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.950
be designed in the
right way, we're

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.245
going to want hundreds
of them around us.

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:35.740
-I think what we're going to
see is a new Renaissance where

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.970
designers as well as
computer scientists

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.870
are going to really make a
really big impact in the type

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.120
of technology that
we see in the home.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.280
-The history of computers has
mostly been about efficiency.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.280
I think one of things
that's changing

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.210
is that enchanted objects
can be about adding motion

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.510
and add magic to the fabric
of our everyday lives

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.880
and experiences.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.297
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:58.297 --> 00:05:59.380
DAVID ROSE: Isn't he cute?

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:03.770
AUDIENCE: What is
with the watches?

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.770
DAVID ROSE: What's that?

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.240
AUDIENCE: You have two watches.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.010
DAVID ROSE: Oh, one is
called a Road-- what is it?

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.742
It's an identification band
that shows your blood type

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:14.700
and that sort of thing.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.950
Road ID, that's what's called.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.310
Road ID.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.439
So this can be interactive.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.480
You can ask me questions.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.450
I'm used to teaching, so if
you're controlling the room,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.960
I will intimidate you.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.140
The first enchanted objects
project that I worked on

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.420
was this project out of the
Media Lab, probably in 1994.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.700
And I had a company
called Interactive Factory

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.200
at the time.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:44.250
And we worked on the DVD part
of the LEGO robotics Mindstorms.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.840
The project was to take
computation and sensors

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.550
and put it in LEGO bricks.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.530
And I thought, even
then, boy, if you

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.487
can reduce the size--
this was the size

00:06:54.487 --> 00:06:55.570
of the brain of the thing.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.330
But now, it could probably
be done for about this size.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.840
And I just thought,
wow, if you look

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.580
at the trends in
computation and in sensors,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.730
and you can do it at
the cost of embedding it

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.490
in plastic like this,
it's going to change toys.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.090
But it's also going to change
everything and our interaction

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.510
with everything.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.170
So just so you don't
have to read the book,

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.750
here's the four parts.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.540
The first part of
the book is about-- I

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.260
try to draw a distinction
between four very different

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.060
futures and try to draw
sort of the brightest

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.260
line possible between what I
call the terminal world, which

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.060
is sort of what people
assume will be the future.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.260
This was a Microsoft vision
video you may have seen.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.790
What's interesting to me about
the vision that Microsoft

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.830
brings-- and to
some extent, Google

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.220
has made other investments.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.170
But the assumption is that
there will be more screens

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.550
and they will have more gesture,
but that our interaction

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.120
with them will be sort of the
same as what we have today.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.420
It will be a call and
response interaction.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.760
They will be waiting for
us to do something to them.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.300
And that requires a lot of our
attention and demands-- I mean,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.910
these are very seductive objects
that we can fiddle with all day

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.820
long and be blue-faced
as we walk down the road.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.620
And in some ways, that's sort
of the problem with these-- is

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.630
how much attention they demand.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.590
And to me, there are
market incentives

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.670
that keep this terminal
world in place,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.190
because there's a
wonderful advertising

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.790
mechanism that loves pixels.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.220
And so the more we
can sort of project

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.309
and cover the world
and our kitchens

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.980
and everything with
pixels, the sort

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.409
of more of a built-in
advertising model that is.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.990
Now, the second
future that I talk

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.340
about is to really, instead
of locating technology

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.200
and these convergence
devices, is

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.600
to locate technology
on and in ourselves.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.810
And this is the
fantasy of superpowers.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.430
The difference between
Superman and Iron Man

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.850
is that anybody can wear
one of these suits, right?

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.790
You don't have to be
born with superpowers.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.290
You can inherit them
by putting on the suit.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.190
And I think this is
obviously transformational

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.200
if you're an amputee or
getting a [INAUDIBLE] implant.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.700
It does seem to be
problematic as we

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.560
put these things on our faces.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.170
And how many people have
read "The Bubble Filter"?

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.790
It's a book about how the more
that we have personalisation

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.372
technology and the
more that we have

00:09:23.372 --> 00:09:24.830
collaborative
filtering technology,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.100
the more we'll all have our
own privatized view of media.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.200
And so there will be
no consensual news.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.011
There will be no consensual view
of what we see in the world.

00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.760
And that's what I feel
like is the biggest

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.870
problem with
wearables like Glass

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.720
is what happened with audio
in the '80s where we're

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.797
all sort of jamming
on our own Walkman,

00:09:44.797 --> 00:09:46.880
and you couldn't really
talk to anybody on the bus

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.930
because they were all in
their own audio space.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.510
Now, if everybody's in
their own visual space,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.020
it will limit
sociability in some ways.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.240
So I talk about that problem.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.020
Now, another very
distinct place that you

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.700
might locate technology
is not in and on yourself,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.400
but outsourced.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.020
So the outsource model is
the social robot model.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.150
And this has been the fantasy
forever of human computer

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.030
interaction, right?

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.630
Wouldn't it be awesome if
they just spoke our language

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.360
and gestured our gestures?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.370
And if God made us in
his image, or her image,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.680
shouldn't we be making
tech in our image?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.570
This is-- of course, right?

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.540
Now, I think of this as
sort of the Downton fantasy,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.504
which is you have your people.

00:10:31.504 --> 00:10:32.920
You've got somebody
for everybody.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.010
You've got the person
who cooks for you,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.140
who dresses you, who
teaches you all embedded

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.790
in different
agents, if you will.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:46.080
And the more that these
agents can look like us

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.850
and reflect our
emotional states and have

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.760
their own emotional state,
that will accelerate how much

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.034
we bond with them.

00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:54.950
So this will be much
more powerful than iPads,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.290
because they'll
have eyes, right?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.710
And they'll be maybe beautiful.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:05.330
And maybe they'll have what
psychologists call neoteny,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.730
which is the childlike
characteristics of cats

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.710
and dogs and Japanese anime
are really attractive to us.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.740
And we immediately glom on to
these big eyes and big head

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.920
proportions.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.290
And they will accelerate
how much we bond with them.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.130
One of our colleagues
at the Media Lab

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:31.530
has created this dieting robot
that sits next to your fridge

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.310
in your kitchen and has
you enter what you eat.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.290
And it would be an
iPad, except it's

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.820
sitting inside the Teletubby
belly of Autumn, which

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.370
has these beautiful,
big, giant blue eyes.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.810
And so you feel like
bonded with this thing.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.010
And you feel more guilty
the more [INAUDIBLE] you

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.940
have after 11:00.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.314
And just last week, Cynthia's
group announced this.

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:56.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.020
-This is your house.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.450
This is your car.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.550
This is your toothbrush.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.480
These are your things.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.930
But these are the
things that matter.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.370
And somewhere in
between is this guy.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.320
Introducing Geebo, the
world's first family robot.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.901
Say Hi, Geebo.

00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:13.400
-Hi, Geebo.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.510
DAVID ROSE: How many
people have seen this?

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.640
-Geebo helps everyone
out throughout the day.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.730
He's the world's
best camera man.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.060
By intelligently tracking
the action around him,

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.010
he can independently
take video and photos

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.830
so that you can put
down your camera

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.370
and be a part of the scene.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.240
-Geebo.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.655
Take the picture.

00:12:31.655 --> 00:12:34.630
[CAMERA SHUTTER]

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.530
-He's a hands-free helper.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.160
You can talk to him, and
he'll talk to you back.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.860
So you don't have
to skip a beat.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.340
-Excuse me, Ann.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.590
-Yes, Geebo.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.740
-Melissa just sent a reminder
that she's picking you up

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.570
in half an hour to
go grocery shopping.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.810
-Thanks, Geebo.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.070
-He's an entertainer
and educator.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.530
Through interactive
applications, Geebo can teach.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.680
-Let me in, or else I'll--

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.352
-Huff.

00:13:00.352 --> 00:13:01.740
-And I'll--

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.472
-Puff.

00:13:02.472 --> 00:13:06.432
-And I'll blow your house in.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.630
DAVID ROSE: So I guess I would
argue that he's cute, right?

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.320
He's getting there, right?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.900
And he is sort of a
convergence device, right?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.780
He reads to you.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.000
He talks to your mail.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.110
He orders pizza.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:24.790
He does everything, which sort
of is on the same path as her,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:30.470
which leads us right into the
uncanny valley of the more we

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.850
come closer to human-like
characteristics,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.690
the more we're creeped out by
the technology we just made.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.506
And it becomes this
gollum or something else

00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:40.130
that we don't want
to spend time around

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.900
because it threatens
our own humanity.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.590
It threatens our own
humaness the better we

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.970
are at making these
things, which takes us

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.320
into "Blade Runner" and
lots of other fictions

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.770
that have foretold of that
uncanny valley problem.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.270
So in the book, I argue
a fourth future, which

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:05.850
is neither convergence nor
on us nor personalitied,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.610
is enchanted objects.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.470
And these are things
like-- I don't know.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.570
My exemplar from the
cover of the book

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.710
is the Ambient Umbrella,
which was inspired by Frodo.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.220
Who knows what Frodo did?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.154
Todd?

00:14:19.154 --> 00:14:20.930
TODD: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.670
DAVID ROSE: Who knows
what Frodo's sword,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.730
what the capability was?

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.660
Adam?

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.985
ADAM: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:29.627
DAVID ROSE: No, this one.

00:14:29.627 --> 00:14:30.710
ADAM: Something with orcs.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.980
DAVID ROSE: Orcs, right.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.960
Orcs, right.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.340
So Sting was a sword
that was both sharp

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.470
and sort of the
perfect size for Frodo.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.690
But it also anticipated
its own use, right?

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.830
It knew when orcs were nearby
and it would warn you of that.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.060
So it had a personal affordance.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.840
It was a feed forward
affordance, right?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.810
It was like tool
tips, like you'd

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.817
roll over-- it
anticipates its use.

00:14:55.817 --> 00:14:57.650
So the Ambient Umbrella
does that with rain.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.880
So the little LED is
sprinkle because it

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.860
has a pager chip in the handle
that gets data from AccuWeather

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.580
and signals when you're
on your way out the door.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:14.060
So this is a dialectic
between a fictional story

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.880
and a real invention.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.240
And I'm really interested
in these dialectics

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.370
because it really answers
the question of how

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.540
are we inspired to
make what we make.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.690
And the book goes
through a series

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.660
of examples of
these stories that

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:36.630
run in all of our bloodstreams
about these different objects

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.620
or these different
play patterns.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.400
So I mean, one of
those from Grimm

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.040
is to look at the
surface of a mirror,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.347
and say, well, it's already
a narcissistic surface.

00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:51.180
But you could make it
even more narcissistic

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.350
if it has even
more capabilities,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.100
like this project.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:01.560
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.720
DAVID ROSE: So this
shows her recent self,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.370
the last thing she tried on.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.425
So she can do sort of a compare
and contrast at Nordstrom's.

00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:19.040
It also can slow
down the video so you

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.380
can see your ass as you spin.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.380
So another enchanted
object, which

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.940
is both a normal thing
that works as a thing

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.380
but then has this imbued
extra intelligence,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.150
is this Anoto pen.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.680
Has anybody tried an Anoto yet?

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.490
So it's a pen.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.620
And it writes on
anything, just has ink.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.580
But it also has a
microphone inside.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.126
And it will record the lecture.

00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:47.750
And then if you write
on special paper,

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.560
it has a camera that
looks at the dot

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.060
pattern of the special paper.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.030
So it will record every gesture.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.510
And the sort of magical thing is
that it associates the lecture

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.290
with the gesture.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.540
So if you want to get back
to the point in the lecture

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.350
where it was interesting
or confusing,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.250
you just tap your
notes there and it

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.401
starts playing the
audio right there,

00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:06.609
which is sort of cool, right?

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.690
But then it's also a pen, right?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.349
It doesn't have to be
this bizarre other thing.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:15.579
It can sort of start and
end with being itself.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.200
Or these trash
cans, which you all

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.010
know around Cambridge, which
are both trash cans physically.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.896
But then also, they
compact the trash.

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:24.520
And then they only
tell the trash truck

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.579
to come when they're
full, which reduces

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:33.250
a lot of high cost labor waste.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.870
So the poster you
have in your hand

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.970
goes through these
six aspirations

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.960
that we've had that are revealed
through fairy tales and stories

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.320
and pop culture that we've
had forever and sort of

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.362
tries to line up both
things we might imagine

00:17:49.362 --> 00:17:50.820
and also real things
that have been

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.030
built in the Internet of Things
according to this structure.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.900
Any questions so far?

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.020
Yeah?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.860
AUDIENCE: One interesting
thing with mobile devices

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:07.844
is someone recently published a
picture internally that said, I

00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:10.510
took the Android interface and I
took away all the anachronisms.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.950
And what he did was
he took the wall clock

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.250
and replaced it with
a picture of a phone.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.625
And he took a book and replaced
it with a picture of a phone.

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:16.580
He took the headphones
and replaced it

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.663
with a picture of a phone.

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.500
All these objects
that were designed

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.300
for a particular sensory motor
way of getting information

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.230
were replaced, because now
we don't use that thing.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.050
We use our phone for that.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.695
And so the set of
idioms that you

00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:33.496
could refer to to guide
people's expectations of what's

00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:35.212
going to happen are
actually shrinking.

00:18:35.212 --> 00:18:36.170
DAVID ROSE: Absolutely.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.050
AUDIENCE: We had
this [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.766
We launched a newstand product.

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.640
And there's supposed to
be a stylized picture

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.870
of a rolled-up newspaper.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.810
But a lot of people don't know
what a rolled-up newspaper

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.726
is because that's a way
of getting information

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:48.306
that's just not useful anymore.

00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:52.230
How do we add idioms
back so that there

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.920
is a space of
expectations rather than

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.260
just tracking all the time.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.510
DAVID ROSE: Right, like after
skeuomorphism goes away,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.780
and you don't have any
of these reference icon.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.696
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:01.696 --> 00:19:03.990
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, right.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.960
Well, in some ways, I'm railing
against the putting everything

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.590
in your phone and
sort of arguing

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.270
that if you spread information
and services thinly

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.840
throughout your
environment, that'll

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.780
be a more naturalistic
interface.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.620
AUDIENCE: Do you that there is
a way to actually still create

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.299
richness though and a learning
thing, like there's actually

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:24.757
something still to
teach your kids.

00:19:24.757 --> 00:19:28.030
It's not just that they come
with all their expectations.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.320
What does that light
on your umbrella mean,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.422
might still be a question
that needs an answer--

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:33.380
DAVID ROSE: Not really.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.760
I mean, the light
on the umbrella

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.300
is sort of-- what I
like about that example

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.680
is you don't really have to
ask the question of, well,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.990
which app are you in right now?

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.690
And which mode are you in?

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.980
It's modeless.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.760
And so it just does its thing.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.270
And it does it in the
perfect decisional moments

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.580
of when you're passing it.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.780
And so why tell you
about the weather

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.260
on the news or any other time?

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.760
Don't put the weather
in the mirror,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.714
because what are you going to do
about it when you're dressing?

00:19:57.714 --> 00:20:00.130
Put it right in the moment
where you need the information.

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:04.304
AUDIENCE: Is there enough
information though,

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:07.160
in that umbrella cap?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160
It's very simple, right?

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.642
DAVID ROSE: Right.

00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:10.350
AUDIENCE: What if it's
going be high wind

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.510
hurricane versus drizzle?

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.020
One would call for the umbrella.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.340
The other one wouldn't.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.090
DAVID ROSE: Right.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.798
Well, I do think you
can think about sort

00:20:17.798 --> 00:20:20.980
of the design of information
as this pyramid where

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.070
at the very highest level, you
have to answer the question of,

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.306
is it worth my attention?

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:27.930
Even as a manager,
you're sort of like,

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.060
what's worth my attention now?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.670
And then once you
answer that question,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.190
then you can get more
details about well,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.520
why is it worth my attention?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.360
And tell me more.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.510
But I think what's mostly
missing from interfaces

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.450
is just answering that very
high-level, most-summarized

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.630
question of where should I
be allocating my attention.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.530
Because just think about--
remember voice mail systems

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.040
when you had to go check and
see if you had any voicemail,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.950
and it took time to even
just answer that question,

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.340
much less the question of, are
any of them critical right now?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.807
So that's that.

00:21:02.807 --> 00:21:04.140
Let me offer some more examples.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.270
And these are both
really good questions.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.210
And I don't want a
short shrift them.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:13.426
But let me-- inspired by
"Dorthy and The Wizard of Oz"

00:21:13.426 --> 00:21:15.800
and the crystal balls and sort
of the ability for crystal

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.880
balls through fiction to show
not only information quickly

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.490
but also to foretell
the future, in 2001,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.070
I invented this
ambient orb device

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.930
which would show anything
you cared to track.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.940
So it really didn't have
the same affordances

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.070
of the umbrella, right?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.690
You didn't know what
it was tracking.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.260
It might be tracking weather.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.000
It might be tracking
pollen counts.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.510
You go to a website and set it.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.110
You may be tracking whether
it's too windy or too calm

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.960
to sail your boats,
wherever your boat is,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.370
or the first derivative
of barometric pressure,

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.240
or how your garden's
not growing or--

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.370
But all of those
were information

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.887
that could packed
into one pixel.

00:21:55.887 --> 00:21:57.720
Because you could sort
of one-dimensionalize

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.370
the information and be
able to really see it out

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.650
of the corner of your eye.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.210
And the magic of that device
was just how little attention

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.680
it required.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.120
It didn't ever feel like
you were overwhelmed

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.060
with information
around the house.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.050
And the company today,
Ambient Devices,

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.950
is doing this product, which
is the Energy Joule, which

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.300
is being sold into
power companies

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.110
to try to help people understand
how much energy they're

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.560
consuming in the house and
what the price of energy is.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.920
And as the price of energy
changes in more dynamic energy

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.730
priced markets, that helps
reduce brownouts and reduce

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.899
new plant construction
and spinning up

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:39.065
dirty diesel plants and all
kinds of other goodness.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.220
And this has two levels
of reading-- sort of back

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.110
to your question, Keith--
which is it both shows you,

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.925
at a glance, what the status is.

00:22:49.925 --> 00:22:51.600
And then you pick
it and it shows

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.235
you the details
of how many cents

00:22:54.235 --> 00:22:56.770
you're paying for
mid-peak power right now

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.700
and how much the--
so it sort of is

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.540
a drill-down device in
itself, although I think it

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.114
would be more elegant to just
make it an NFC or Bluetooth LE

00:23:05.114 --> 00:23:07.280
sort of thing so that you
just tap your phone on it,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.850
and then it gives you the
[INAUDIBLE] information

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.183
on your phone rather than
having to have a screen on it.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.170
So for telepathy, one
of my favorite examples

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.830
is this issue of
understanding where

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:25.180
your family is and their state,
or the state of your team,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.100
like who's where and
who's working on what.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.770
People have made
maps that allow you

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.120
to track the status
of your family

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.940
on a map, which always
feels completely intrusive.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.540
And even if you're
not having an affair

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.910
and you love them,
even then, you really

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.180
don't to be tracked on a map.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.120
So the Weasley Clock
is sort of cool,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.420
because it just shows
you the status of people.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.110
It doesn't show
you exactly where

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.400
mortal terror is-- mortal peril.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.150
It just shows you that
they are in mortal peril.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.930
And when I was a
kid, my parents would

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.120
play this LP of
"Peter and the Wolf"

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.150
where every character in the
story has a different ringtone.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.220
And it was sort of
a neat idea that I

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.090
took to generalize this
idea of a doorbell.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.730
So our location-based system
that we have in our house

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.880
is as each family
member is on their way

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.960
home at the end of the
day, the doorbell plays

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.150
a ringtone for her when she's
about that-- 10 miles out, one

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.870
mile out, or very close to
home, which just gives you

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.510
this sort of breeze of presence.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.080
It's audio only.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.320
And it's nice to know.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.160
It's reassuring and
calming and keeps me

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.620
from texting when
I'm on my bike.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.510
Objects for safekeeping
are the next category.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.690
This project I especially
like at the Media Lab

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.280
because it embedded the
sense of how close you

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.840
are to blowing through
your monthly budget-- which

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.160
is, I suppose, a way of
somebody taking care of you--

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.180
by changing the spring tension
on a hinge in your wallet.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.970
So as you get closer to blowing
through your monthly budget,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.310
your wallet's like [GROANS].

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.080
It's harder and harder to open
it, which is great, right?

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.710
Because there's no
screen in sight.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:12.010
It's an it's a gesture
you do 30, 10 times a day.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.780
And it's almost subconscious.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.300
It can communicate
this information to you

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.915
in a way that's almost below
the conscious threshold.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.270
There are other objects that
are obviously for safety

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.950
that are becoming
connected, which

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.750
I'm excited about because
they allow you to rent out

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.350
your house to other Airbnb
strangers more easily

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.602
without showing up.

00:25:34.602 --> 00:25:36.910
I want to talk a little
bit about the fantasy

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.925
of immortality given to
us by fountains of youth.

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:42.550
DAVID ROSE: There's
a beautiful project

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.814
by Hiroshi Ishii
at the Media Lab

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:48.360
called-- I think maybe
inspired by rubbing a bottle

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.240
and having a wizard come out.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.400
Or having-- who came out of--
the genie came out of the lamp,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:53.900
right?

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.580
So these are just these
beautiful glass bottles.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.980
And when you open them,
when you uncork them,

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.430
you unstop them,
the music emerges,

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.630
or at least that
instrument emerges.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.600
So it's a jazz trio,
and you can cork them.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.640
I don't know that you'd want one
of these to play with all day.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.875
But it's a great demo.

00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:17.620
And it's really evocative of
how you can bake information

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.430
into an ordinary,
everyday gesture.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.820
This inspired my
most recent company,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.620
which is called
Ambient Vitality, which

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.817
did an internet-connected
pill bottle cap.

00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:30.400
So we sort of assumed
we weren't going

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.790
to change pharmacy workflow,
and we just used the amber pill

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.980
vial that 3 and 1/2 billion
scripts are distributed

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.930
in these things in
the US every year.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:44.470
And then we just implemented a
little sensor LED and speaker

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.920
into the cap.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.940
And I think the key thing to
the success of this product

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.710
was actually its subtlety.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:27:00.140
So it lived most of its life
in the sort of barely nudging

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.170
you land of ambientness, right?

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.380
So it would, rather than beeping
like your microwave beeps,

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.110
which is totally
annoying-- I would

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.660
love to have all beeping
eliminated from my life.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.920
It would start out
by just pulsing

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.480
with light really subtly.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.540
And there was an
ambient puck on the wall

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.707
that also pulses with light.

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:24.623
It's almost like the
perfect butler, you know?

00:27:24.623 --> 00:27:26.130
Because he's like
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:26.950
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.382
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:27:28.382 --> 00:27:30.590
And then you realize it's
time for your next meeting,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.720
and you don't even credit
whoever the other person is.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.360
So there's a lot of
design space down here

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.040
in the sort of
pre-conscious-- like scent

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.280
and subliminal sound
effects like white noise,

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.700
or the change in
temperature of something--

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:51.440
that happens even before you get
through to ambiance or apparent

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.050
or obnoxious.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.850
But I think designing
objects that

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.160
have that sort of smooth
curve to them is good.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.240
So we did have a
trial with partners,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.600
with Mass General Hospital.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.430
And the control group-- this
is days, and this is people.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.800
And pink means they
didn't take their med day.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.080
So this is what normal
pill-taking behavior

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.930
looks like.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.970
And then we turned on
all these subtle prompts.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.136
And this is what the
intervention group looked like,

00:28:19.136 --> 00:28:21.220
so a huge change in
pill-taking behavior,

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.750
which is good for
pharmaceutical companies

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.570
because they sell a
shitload more pills.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.545
It's good for insurers
because people

00:28:28.545 --> 00:28:29.920
don't go to the
hospital as much.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.062
It's good for people too because
they don't reject livers.

00:28:33.062 --> 00:28:37.550
And AT&amp;T loves this, because
there are a lot more pill

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.630
caps sold than cars
or other things you

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.756
might put cell phones into.

00:28:40.756 --> 00:28:41.421
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:44.000
DAVID ROSE: This was a national
campaign that AT&amp;T did.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.445
-In here, video games are
not confined to screens.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.050
In here, medicine talks to you.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:03.620
DAVID ROSE: And dogs,
there are a lot of dogs.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.480
So it's a good
connectivity opportunity

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.880
for connectivity with dogs.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.820
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.361
DAVID ROSE: And then
we were parodied

00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:13.866
by Colbert, which
is a high point.

00:29:13.866 --> 00:29:15.240
As you've probably
noticed, there

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.560
are many, many objects that
are internet-connected that

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.630
attempt to track our
sleep and mood and stress

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.760
and food and activity.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.949
A couple of ones that you
may not have seen-- I'm

00:29:27.949 --> 00:29:29.490
an adviser to a
little company that's

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.660
doing this little button.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.500
It should be half the size,
but it's called the SunSprite.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.160
And it's for people that have
seasonal affective disorder.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.680
So it makes sure
you get enough sun.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.717
And it's remarkable
for only one reason.

00:29:41.717 --> 00:29:43.300
I mean, it's a little
Bluetooth device

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.716
and has a nice app
and everything,

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:45.790
but you'd expect that.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.800
But there are two
solar panels on it

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.520
so you never have
to charge it, which

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.140
just seems like it solves a
really important problem on all

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.020
these wearable gadgets
like the Jawbone UP.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.700
I'm always like,
oh, is it charged?

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.290
Is it not charged?

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.180
I end up feeling--

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:00.510
AUDIENCE: Unless--

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:00.780
DAVID ROSE: What?

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.340
AUDIENCE: Unless you
don't get enough sun.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.673
DAVID ROSE: Right, right, right.

00:30:03.673 --> 00:30:06.680
If you don't get enough
sun, then it dies, right.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.300
And then you're depressed too.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.170
But I feel like
these things need

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.130
to harness parasitic
power off of motion

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.810
or off of sun in order to care
for us rather than us always

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.930
caring for them.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.890
This other project also
from [INAUDIBLE] group

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.600
at the Media Lab was
a fork that tries

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.370
to make you eat less
quickly for people

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.060
who sort of shovel it down.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.505
And it was commercialized
through this other company

00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:32.810
called Happy Fork.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.680
And the feedback loop
here is interesting.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.790
Because as you eat
too quickly, it

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.090
introduces a little bit
of palsy so you sort of

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:46.590
don't hit your mouth as often,
which it's such a stupid idea.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.570
I can't believe anybody
would want this.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.120
But you know, I don't know.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.233
AUDIENCE: If they
got the opposite--

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:54.817
my mother-in-law has
Parkinson's and--

00:30:54.817 --> 00:30:55.732
DAVID ROSE: Oh, right.

00:30:55.732 --> 00:30:56.530
It would dampen.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.920
It would dampen her palsy.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.549
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:00.840
How many people have seen this?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.200
The Vessyl Cup.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.860
Do you do how they're doing
like the mass spectrometry

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.980
tech in the bottom of the cup?

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.057
I really don't get that.

00:31:10.057 --> 00:31:12.140
But apparently it
differentiates between Diet Coke

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.240
and Diet Pepsi.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.260
It knows exactly
what's in the cup

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.780
and then can measure how
much and how often you drink.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.230
So it really solves this very
hard, quantified self-problem

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.640
of what are you eating, right?

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.970
Because no one's willing to
log it on an app consistently.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.200
And so this is one approach.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.380
As long as you're going to
have your chardonnay out

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.593
of this cup, it's OK.

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:37.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:38.810
DAVID ROSE: I did, yeah.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.290
Colbert has a really good one.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.860
So this fantasy of
flying, of course,

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:49.170
is in the ninth century, "One
Thousand and One Nights,"

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.940
the fantasy of a magic
carpet, was imagined.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.930
We don't quite have flying
cars yet or self-driving

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.860
cars, at least for purchase yet.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.790
How many of you guys
have a self-driving car?

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.830
Don't you get them here?

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.650
No?

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.010
That's not a perk?

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.970
Should be a perk.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:08.762 --> 00:32:11.630
DAVID ROSE: Right, that's true.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.899
This project called
the Copenhagen Wheel

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.940
makes your commute at
least a little bit easier--

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.160
maybe less sweaty if
you're a biker-- by baking

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.640
in a battery and electric
motor into the wheel

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.950
so that as you pedal harder,
it gives you more power.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.250
I like the architecture
of this where

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.740
you can take your old bike
and just put a new wheel on.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.050
You don't have to
buy a whole new bike.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.950
It's sort of like the
parking meters in Brookline.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.020
They just took the tops off
and put the credit card machine

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.229
on the top of the old meters.

00:32:46.229 --> 00:32:48.144
I just thought that was
great that they didn't

00:32:48.144 --> 00:32:49.970
have to like redesign
the whole meter.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.690
It had to the
right architecture.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.180
I'm going to fly through
another one just quickly.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.280
So the last category
is expression.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.940
This is maybe the
most interesting.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.360
I talk in the book about
LEGO and about "Guitar Hero."

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.430
I really like scaffold
that supports creativity.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.835
And this magic paintbrush
is one of those things.

00:33:15.835 --> 00:33:18.066
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.980
DAVID ROSE: Nice, huh?

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.580
So another form of
expression is photography.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.350
And I've been a photographer
and taking photos forever.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.490
How many people have tried
a life-logging camera?

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:08.830
Anybody worn one?

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.790
So this is a product by
Narrative, a Swedish company,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.959
successful Kickstarter.

00:34:13.959 --> 00:34:16.500
I wore it for about three weeks
until I put it in the laundry

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.430
or lost it or whatever.

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:19.679
But I'll show you the results.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:24.250
So it's about an inch and a
half by an inch and a half.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.340
It takes a photo automatically
every 30 seconds.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:34.960
And it has a GPS also, so it
stamps where the photo's taken.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.929
And then you get this
digital portrait of your day,

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.639
like a little flip
book of your day.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.469
And I'll show you one.

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:44.584
This is a little bit
revealing, but let's see.

00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:46.850
Oh, here are two.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.469
So I sped it up about 300
times so you could see.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.980
This is one at MIT.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.540
This is one in Copenhagen
teaching a workshop.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.830
That's a magician that I
was able to teach with.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.510
Sorry, I didn't
mask out any faces.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.480
But I mean, obviously
this isn't designed

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.310
to be shared at a
conference or a talk.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.200
It's designed to help you
see things about your day.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.810
And I think it
does reveal things,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.950
like just as you scan
through, how many people

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.240
did you interact with?

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.970
How sociable where you today?

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.152
How many times did you snack?

00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:23.860
How many times did
you look at your phone

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.750
while you're at the
playground with your kids?

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.744
How often did you get outside?

00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:31.660
It's sort of if you could
look at the metadata

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.770
from all of these photos, it's
a pretty revealing picture

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.770
of how we live.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.610
So my most recent
company is just

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.060
about extracting
metadata from photos.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.360
And I know Google sort of has
an interest in this as well.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.470
But I just want to
give you a quick demo.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:51.460
We're training our system
on classifiers for patterns,

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.420
primarily because most
of the money's in brands.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.340
So brands want to know
how are people using

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.120
my products and where and
with what other things.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.700
So let's see.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.310
So this is a real time feed from
Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:11.860
I'm sorry.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.700
There might be porn.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.480
I don't control that.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.190
So we can select a category,
like faces or text extraction

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.780
or retailers.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.930
Or let's just do liquor.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.930
That's going to be fun.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:28.970
So we can find-- these are
the "in the wild" shots of how

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.320
people are portraying liquor
brands through photos.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.230
So liquor brands
obviously love this

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.360
because they want to
know what are the usage

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.900
occasions for the
product, who is using it.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.800
And then they can learn more
about building audiences

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.710
and targeting ads.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.870
They're coming
from public sources

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.370
from the biggest public feeds.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.510
So we have a deal
with-- we're processing

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:05.730
all of Tumblr photos,
which is 120 million a day,

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.220
about a third of Twitter
in the US and about 5%

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.590
worldwide, and then Instagram.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.577
So it's this huge trove
of photos and 300 servers

00:37:14.577 --> 00:37:16.410
that we're paying Amazon
a lot of money for.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.330
I mean, I just think it's
interesting from an Internet

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.140
of Things perspective
because cameras are ending up

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.671
being such a cheap way
of sensing things, right,

00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:29.420
like probably the next
version of the Nest

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.030
will have a camera in it,
not just to do motion,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.850
but to figure out who's home,
if people would tolerate it.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:39.310
So in the third part
of the book, again,

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.590
I sort of try to pick
a fight with a phone

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:46.040
and talk about what are the
sort of inherent abilities

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.100
that's spreading services and
information thinly around us

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.970
have as opposed to on
convergence devices.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.380
So we talked about
glance ability,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.440
gesture, things can be maybe
more affordable, more wearable,

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.180
more indestructible-- like the
Facebook coffee table-- more

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:09.700
usable because the interaction
be simpler and more lovable.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.970
I recently did a
workshop in Copenhagen

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.050
at the Copenhagen
Interaction Design institute.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:14.450
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.199
DAVID ROSE: And this
is one of the concept

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:19.060
videos for interactive shades.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.230
So they know that
you need masking

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:31.035
so they move by to
respect your privacy.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.970
And then they open
if you're not around

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.720
because you'd like
more light in the room.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.540
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.959
DAVID ROSE: So you get the idea.

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:50.500
So one of the projects
that I thought

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.900
would be especially
interesting to you is just

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.290
this question about if you
have internet of things

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.940
and the programmable world,
how might you control that?

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.480
How might you program that?

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.150
And I think AR is one of
these technologies that

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.870
allows us to see what is
programmable and interrogate

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.450
and manipulate what
is programmable.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.100
So this is a project where
you saw a light switch,

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.280
and here, a speaker,
where you can look through

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.330
with an augmented
reality interface

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.890
and pick the set of
stations that you

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.350
want to put on this
nine-switch dial.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.720
And then once you've done that,
you've picked the nine stations

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.460
that you like, and you don't
have to use AR ever again

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.710
on your radio.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.000
But you now have programmed
it, so those nine stations

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.280
are the nine stations that
you want to toggle between.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.425
So it's sort of answers
this question of-- oh,

00:39:43.425 --> 00:39:46.294
and this is drawing
a relationship

00:39:46.294 --> 00:39:47.960
between one speaker
and another speaker.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.780
And so you sort of get the idea.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:55.120
But I thought that would
be an interesting-- it

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.792
does require something else
of the devices in our life

00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.500
though, whether they're
enchanted or not,

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.710
which is they have to be
legible to the computer, right?

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.370
So the computer vision system,
as an industrial designer,

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.970
you're no longer designing
beautiful objects for people.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.630
But you're designing things
that have barcode-ness

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.500
so that they're
differentiated for the robots

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.010
to be able to see, right?

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.170
Like the speaker had to
have that unique pattern

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.200
so the system could
say, oh, that's David

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.620
speaker in his house.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.115
And then it becomes
addressable by the machine.

00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:32.240
So one last framework in
the part three of the book

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.680
is to think about
how does something

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.460
go in a stepwise fashion between
being inert, like a trash can,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.350
and being connected and then
personalized and then sort of

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.240
play a part in the social
web, maybe gamified,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.350
and then have a story
that engages you.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.190
And as I'll show you
in the last video,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.330
we hacked a trash can and
made it the Amazon Trash Can.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.730
And as you throw things out
in the Amazon Trash Can,

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.640
there's a camera that
recognizes what's thrown out

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.620
and proposes it onto
your Amazon Fresh list

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.767
because you might want
more of that thing.

00:41:05.767 --> 00:41:07.350
But as soon as we
built the prototype,

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.990
we realized what an
opportunity-- as you

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.700
throw something out, what
an opportunity to not just

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.840
have coconut water again
shipped all the way from Asia,

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.620
but to have the
trash can propose

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.970
like a more
locally-sourced thing

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.120
or give you shit about
like third box of cookies

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.680
this week, like, are you sure?

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.055
Are you sure you
want to do that?

00:41:27.055 --> 00:41:29.000
So our fiction was
like it's Oscar

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.980
who's living in the trash
can who's giving you feedback

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.760
or a hard time about what he
might be reordering for you.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.010
Or out of season strawberries,
why not try something else?

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.100
So the last part of the
book talks more about

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.610
what happens when you have
many of these things that

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:52.450
can talk together, and they
can all collude on your behalf.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.560
And I've been recently
wearing the Jawbone UP.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.470
Have other people
tried this one?

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.110
Seems like the
Brookline social network

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.710
is all into Fitbits
rather than Jawbone.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.750
But anyway, my UP
connects to If This

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:11.340
Than That, which allows me to
write these one sentence rules.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.160
How many people know IFTTT?

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.900
Most people IFTTT.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.977
So I can set my
lights to-- recently

00:42:19.977 --> 00:42:21.810
what I've done with the
lighting in my house

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.880
is it glows that sort of
Virgin Airlines purple

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.640
if I reach 10,000.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.820
So like my home looks cool
if I've done the right thing.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.830
But it's nice because it sort
of is a feedback device that's

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:35.980
social that my family sees.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:41.810
But you can start to associate
one sensor with another sensor.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.490
And I want to show
you one other concept

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:48.920
video from the Copenhagen
Interaction Design project

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.900
that we just did a
couple weeks ago, which

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.120
is to move the
enchantment out of the,

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.880
let's say, umbrella,
and move it into more

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.940
of the infrastructure around
us, like this was a set of hooks

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.390
that we're smarter and
knew what was on them.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:10.003
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:10.003 --> 00:43:11.836
DAVID ROSE: Sort of If
This Then That hooks.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.780
So this friend is online,
because the system

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.469
knows that picture is
being hung from that hook.

00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:26.760
And the system knows that
those running shoes are being

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.720
hung from that hook, and
it's good weather for running

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:36.100
outside and that it's going to
rain so that-- see what I mean?

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.545
So the location
of the technology

00:43:37.545 --> 00:43:39.670
doesn't need to be in the
umbrella or in the shoes.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.910
It can be on the infrastructure
around that's guiding them.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.000
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.960
So we've talked about
lots of different scale

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.770
of different scales of
these things-- jewelry

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.020
scale, toy scale,
pill caps scale.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.690
I just want to talk about a
bigger project, apartment scale

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.100
enchantment.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.660
I just looked this up.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.400
The median price per square
foot for a home in Manhattan

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:20.450
is $1,300 per square foot, which
means that for a $1,000 flat,

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.650
it's $1.3 million, right?

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.970
So it's a big price tag, even
if you're working here, right,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:28.360
as a young person.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.990
So there's lots of
examples that are

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.710
inspiring of how do people
choose to live in smaller,

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:38.410
compact spaces, either
campers or sailboats.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.470
They do this on vacation.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.320
People choose.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.350
People go-- so we've
been decomposing

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.420
all of what people do at home--
like sleeping and working

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.140
and dining and lounging and
movie mode and yoga mode--

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.150
and trying to build apartments
that have transformer

00:44:55.150 --> 00:45:02.320
tech where a 1,000 square
feet apartment can be built

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.860
in 25% of the square footage.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.070
So rather than it
costing you $1.3 million,

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.910
it only costs you $330K
plus the money for tech.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.390
And that gives you big
budget for transformer tech.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.895
And so this is an apartment
that we've prototyped over

00:45:18.895 --> 00:45:21.300
at the Media Lab that
has thickened wall,

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.050
thickened ceiling, and
thickened floor that

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:29.400
can hide either exercise
equipment or tables or bed

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.550
or other things that give you
sort of this holodeck fantasy.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.087
You'd have to be
sort of neat though.

00:45:38.087 --> 00:45:40.420
You can't have a lot of other
stuff around the apartment

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.890
because then it gets hung up.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.620
So one other example
from part four

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:53.150
is this idea of embedding
feedback systems in furniture.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.420
And this one was
done for Salesforce

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.510
where Salesforce was
interested in having

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:03.030
more balanced
conversations on teams.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:07.200
A lot of introverts don't get
as much airtime as extroverts.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:13.630
And so this started off as
sort of this floral pie chart,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.280
if you will.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:22.060
Each side of that grows
more as that person talks.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.600
And so you get a
sense over time--

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.100
it's both something that's in
the middle of the table that's

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.140
sort of like a
decorative arrangement

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.820
but also gives you
feedback about who's

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.870
contributing more or less.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.810
And where the product
is now is rather

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.550
than doing the
centerpiece, we just

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:42.160
made the whole table into
a constellation of LEDs

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.940
that are underneath
the wood veneer.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:47.470
So as the person sitting
on one side speaks more,

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.520
very, very slowly over
the course of 10 minutes,

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.620
that wedge of the table
gradually illuminates.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.490
So you can see over
20 or 30 minutes, you

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.240
get these different scenarios--
you can't really see them

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.760
here-- of some
wedges are more lit

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.390
and other wedges are less lit.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.210
So that's mostly what
I wanted to show.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:05.390
And let's see.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.848
I don't actually
want to show this.

00:47:06.848 --> 00:47:10.480
But I guess I would hearken
back-- one of the first stories

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.560
that I write in the book is
about my grandfather, who

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.739
had a wood shop with this
huge diversity of tools.

00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:18.280
And when I was a
kid, he would always

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.630
say like, oh, hand me
the chisel over there.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.630
And I'd be like, the
chisel over there?

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.671
It's sort of the same as
the chisel you're using.

00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:26.240
And he'd be like, no,
it's very different.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.070
It's like the blade
is slightly curved.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.910
And the one I'm
using is straight.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:32.660
OK.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.200
So just as you--
Kevin Kelly talks

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.480
about this in "What
Technology Wants,"

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.690
which is a really good book.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.452
But he notes that if you
look at the diversification

00:47:43.452 --> 00:47:46.920
and complexity of
life on a coral reef

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.670
or of any mature tool set-- like
chisels or shoes or silverware

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:57.680
or drinking glasses-- as
these categories mature,

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.250
you have huge diversification
and specialization

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:02.711
and redundancy.

00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.210
And that's what I
would hope that we

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.840
have in terms of our tools,
that we don't have convergence

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.560
into one thing, but we have
this huge specialization

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.420
and divergence.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.900
And that will make our
interfaces more tangible,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.910
like the wallet, more
haptic, more incidental,

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.990
like the Facebook coffee table
you saw on the first video.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.580
It's there.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.746
You can pay attention to it.

00:48:21.746 --> 00:48:23.650
You don't have to
pay attention to it.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.060
It's embedded in natural things.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.540
And it's expressive and,
I think, more humanistic.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.130
I'm happy to take questions.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.852
Thanks.

00:48:31.852 --> 00:48:34.212
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.307
Hi, Todd.

00:48:39.307 --> 00:48:39.890
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:40.480
How's it going, David?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:40.860
DAVID ROSE: Good.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.495
AUDIENCE: So many of the
examples you gave, I love them.

00:48:43.495 --> 00:48:46.417
There's a great
design sense to them.

00:48:46.417 --> 00:48:49.265
There's a sense of
restraint among them, right?

00:48:49.265 --> 00:48:51.398
So they do one
thing really simply,

00:48:51.398 --> 00:48:53.374
and it's kind of
intuitive what it does.

00:48:53.374 --> 00:48:54.856
It's natural.

00:48:54.856 --> 00:48:57.820
Should we be confident
that that level of design

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.796
will win out in the future?

00:48:59.796 --> 00:49:01.980
Or are we going to get
a lot of annoying things

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.967
that try to be too smart?

00:49:04.967 --> 00:49:07.050
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, well, I
do think that the design

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.450
challenge is to make a set
of things that are doing very

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:15.740
little for us and not
count on one device

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.480
to have all of the services that
satisfy all of the questions

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.980
we might have about
whatever category it is.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.380
Yeah, and I mean, I think the
service that our phones can

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.930
play is for the drill-down
of the drill-down

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.010
of the drill-down.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:33.270
But they shouldn't handle
the other levels of questions

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.920
that we might ask about
most things, the more

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.027
sort of high-level stuff.

00:49:37.027 --> 00:49:38.001
AUDIENCE: So like
the umbrella case,

00:49:38.001 --> 00:49:40.417
how do you keep that from the
next company who comes along

00:49:40.417 --> 00:49:42.384
and has it do 15
different things and 10

00:49:42.384 --> 00:49:43.370
different companies--

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.786
DAVID ROSE: Well, I have control
over all these companies.

00:49:45.786 --> 00:49:47.620
So luckily, I can
just tell them not to.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.210
I don't know-- I
mean, it's going

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:56.710
to be messy and ugly and with
lots of instructive failures.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.960
And no, I think it
really will be ugly,

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.060
like the number
of companies that

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.252
get into providing services.

00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:06.460
I mean, if you think-- I
had a conversation yesterday

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.700
about somebody about
the luggage industry.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.210
And he was saying like,
what should Samsonite do?

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.350
How should Samsonite
differentiate their luggage?

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.630
They've tried to differentiate
with the form, the lightness

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.730
of the case, the
wheels, the colors.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.682
What should they do?

00:50:22.682 --> 00:50:24.390
Well, it's sort of a
no-brainer that they

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.060
should put a Bluetooth
LE chip in the luggage

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.550
so it can tell you when it's
close to, if you've picked up

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.190
the wrong one, when
the luggage is coming.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.340
Wouldn't that be useful?

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.820
Of course it would be useful.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.160
And so obviously, all
luggage companies,

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.250
over the next decade, are going
to experiment with services

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:47.091
that change the inert thing to
a smarter service-based thing,

00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:49.340
just because it's in their
business interest to do it.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.736
But yeah, I'm sure
lots of people

00:50:52.736 --> 00:50:53.860
will make lots of mistakes.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.210
That's why it's important
to have good designers.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:58.206
Hi, Elizabeth.

00:50:58.206 --> 00:51:00.920
AUDIENCE: I think one of
the things that I just worry

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.270
about-- and I think needs
a lot more emphasis--

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:10.447
is the failure mode of things,
like 37Signals put out years

00:51:10.447 --> 00:51:13.170
ago about error
messages on computers,

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.960
and I guess it's out of
print, but the same--

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.210
DAVID ROSE: 404, or 402, yeah.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:19.460
AUDIENCE: Well, the same idea.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.941
I mean, not to say-- this
is not particular to Google.

00:51:23.941 --> 00:51:27.280
But when I was coming here
today, I had some questions.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.880
And the person who answered
the phone would only give me

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.810
an email address which
spits out a boiler

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.270
plate which points
you to a forum.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:41.786
But not in Chrome and not in
IE would the forum appear.

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:45.610
There was a server error
or a 404 error or whatever.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.390
So I couldn't get to the forum.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:53.405
So I had to sort of go around
to try to get to a person.

00:51:53.405 --> 00:51:55.830
DAVID ROSE: What's an example
of how one of these things

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:56.320
might fail elegantly?

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:56.945
AUDIENCE: Well.

00:51:56.945 --> 00:52:00.280
I was just-- elegantly, yeah.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.238
Like if a pill bottle-- for
example, extending the pill

00:52:04.238 --> 00:52:08.486
bottle, if it wasn't going
to let you take too many

00:52:08.486 --> 00:52:12.076
and so one of its mechanisms
was to lock itself

00:52:12.076 --> 00:52:14.992
if you've already taken
the one for the day.

00:52:14.992 --> 00:52:17.200
But you've actually dropped
that one down the sink,

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.908
and you need it--

00:52:17.908 --> 00:52:18.394
DAVID ROSE: Right, right.

00:52:18.394 --> 00:52:20.227
AUDIENCE: --you know,
you need to have a way

00:52:20.227 --> 00:52:24.050
to tell it, er, don't do that.

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.050
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, I mean,
one of the reasons why

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.090
I show the Happy Fork
is that just seems

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:32.660
to be only paternalistic and
no positive feedback, right?

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.360
That is only about
slapping people's hands

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.400
and not about doing the thing
that we know, from Pavlov

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.280
and everybody else,
which is what works,

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:45.450
is to shower attention and
positive feedback on things

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:51.290
when they're going well
rather than just scold

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.308
when the wrong thing happens.

00:52:54.308 --> 00:52:57.724
AUDIENCE: I fear not being able
to get into my refrigerator

00:52:57.724 --> 00:53:01.640
because it's giving some error--

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.570
DAVID ROSE: Right, right.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.490
No, I do think designing for
more positive behavior is

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.380
better than trying
to lock things

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.340
that people shouldn't be doing.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.785
I mean, a lot of
people asked us,

00:53:11.785 --> 00:53:14.410
when we were designing this, if
we could do a locking mechanism

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.890
for medications that are
abused by babysitters

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.820
and other sort of use cases.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.830
And we said, no, no, no.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.829
Let's just try to get
people to take a daily med.

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:26.370
Let's solve that-- that problem
would be a big enough problem

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:29.270
to solve that we don't
have to solve the overuse

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:32.100
problem at the same time.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.140
So I think picking
the problem carefully

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.010
is a good design principle.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:36.878
Yeah?

00:53:36.878 --> 00:53:40.014
AUDIENCE: The things that I
find interesting that the tools

00:53:40.014 --> 00:53:44.645
that we use today are
largely interchangeable.

00:53:44.645 --> 00:53:46.505
If I'm looking for
a pen, it really

00:53:46.505 --> 00:53:50.280
doesn't matter what pen
I pick up, I can use it.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.350
If, on the other hand,
I need to now use

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.810
the pen which is
listening to the world

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.350
and also has what I've
written for the last week

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:09.640
or whenever stored on it, it
changes that dynamic a bit.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.400
Have you guys seen
something where

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.921
people are no longer willing
to dispose of things?

00:54:15.921 --> 00:54:18.577
Are people no longer caring
about the $5.00 umbrella

00:54:18.577 --> 00:54:22.240
because they now have their
$50.00 umbrella that lights up?

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.760
DAVID ROSE: Well, I think
your first question, which

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.800
is, I think, really
profound, is that I

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.330
do think one of the
trends is redundancy.

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.509
And one of the problems
with the Narrative clip

00:54:33.509 --> 00:54:34.800
is that I only had one of them.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.950
And then I put it in the
wash, like you would clothes.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.660
So of course I put
it in the wash.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:46.490
But I think, for the guys
who are doing the SunSprites,

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.850
I would want at least 10 of
them and to have them just

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:52.300
be built into
jackets and backpacks

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.040
so that if I wanted to take
this backpack today and this bag

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.930
tomorrow, I don't
have to remember

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.379
to put the SunSprite on
it, but they can just all

00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.170
talk to each other.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.290
And they can say, do
you have him today?

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.150
Or do I get him today?

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:10.220
So these sensors can
share data on our behalf.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:14.140
And we don't have to care for
them, and they aren't precious.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.235
And I think that will
happen, just like pens.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:19.900
Yeah?

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.090
You had-- Matt,
you had a question,

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:22.320
and then you had a question.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.910
MATT: Yeah, so you mentioned
that the goal is to kind of get

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.032
away from the feature-rich,
deep experience

00:55:28.032 --> 00:55:32.290
of a smartphone into more of a
thinly spread out experience.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.448
But the great thing
about a smartphone

00:55:34.448 --> 00:55:37.436
that is that it has all these
apps that do different things.

00:55:37.436 --> 00:55:40.150
But I can open up an app
and kind of instinctively

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.421
know what to do with
it, even if I've never

00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:44.290
used that type of app before.

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:46.770
And it seems like
one of the issues

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.310
with this is there's a bunch
of different companies making

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.250
a bunch of different products
with different experiences.

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:58.770
And is there anyone trying to
create a custom home operating

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.380
system that brings that
all together so I'm not

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.450
going to my smart mirror
and doing something

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:06.615
and then having to learn
a completely new interface

00:56:06.615 --> 00:56:08.449
for my smart refrigerator?

00:56:08.449 --> 00:56:09.490
DAVID ROSE: Right, right.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:11.010
That's a great question.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.090
Should there be--
obviously, the people

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:16.260
that are doing operating systems
are working on design standards

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.200
for the people that make
apps so that they're

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.557
easier to learn and
have consistency.

00:56:20.557 --> 00:56:22.140
I don't know of
anybody who's thinking

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.802
about other conventions.

00:56:24.802 --> 00:56:26.385
I guess there's
certain companies that

00:56:26.385 --> 00:56:28.104
are doing gesture recognition.

00:56:28.104 --> 00:56:29.520
And they're working
on conventions

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.060
for like, what's a
dismiss gesture and what's

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.400
click gesture and
other click gesture.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.990
But it's a great point about
standardizing the expectations

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:45.000
for the Internet
of Things, yeah.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.520
But I would question
what you first

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.230
said, which is
you go into an app

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:50.110
and you instinctively
know what to do.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.360
You may know to do because
you're sort of digital-native.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:59.040
But compare that to
knives, the complexity.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.460
When you pick up a knife,
that's instinctively

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.180
know what to do as opposed
to into an app and you

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.380
sort of-- yeah.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.880
Yeah?

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.884
Oh, you had a question
back there, and then you.

00:57:08.884 --> 00:57:10.275
AUDIENCE: I just have a
question about self-awareness

00:57:10.275 --> 00:57:11.670
you had mentioned.

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.180
It seems like a big theme is
making the individual more

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.614
self-aware, whether it
be what they're eating,

00:57:16.614 --> 00:57:18.030
which we agree is
something that's

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.140
very hard to do no matter how
much you pay attention to it.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:23.620
But then something like
the Salesforce example,

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.240
it just seems like, to some
degree, that should just

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.840
be something that you should
recognize-- that you talk too

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.120
much and you're not letting
other people talk instead.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.470
And why do you need something
to alert you to that?

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.970
And what's your
comment on that idea

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.420
of self-awareness
and technology?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.390
DAVID ROSE: Well, I think there
can be too much self-awareness.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.240
I mean, friends
have recently said,

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:52.080
the quantified life is not
worth living, which I like.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.130
And I think you can have
too much quantification.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:58.080
And I think you can also think
about quantified self more

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.550
in terms of sprints, and
less in terms of forever,

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:05.245
like the when I used the
sleep coach, the Zeo.

00:58:05.245 --> 00:58:06.870
I used it and I got
something out of it

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.987
for about 20 days or 30 days.

00:58:08.987 --> 00:58:10.820
And then I was really
happy to throw it away

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.153
because I felt like I had
learned what I needed to learn

00:58:13.153 --> 00:58:16.320
and I didn't have to wear
the headband anymore.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.970
So I do think that you don't
have to think about-- we're not

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:23.160
all going to quantify ourselves
in excruciating detail

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.750
forevermore.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:29.505
But what was your second--

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.380
AUDIENCE: Oh, just of
the interaction of that

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.657
and how do we actually continue
to engender innate instincts--

00:58:35.657 --> 00:58:37.240
like you said what
to do with a knife.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.220
If we're constantly
quantifying it, how do we,

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.360
at the same time, let
people learn instinctively

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.750
how to just shut up when
it's time to shut up.

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:49.640
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, I
mean, I sort of-- my wife

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.323
told me not to talk
about our relationship.

00:58:52.323 --> 00:58:53.250
Let's see.

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:57.930
But I would say that
with my mother, if I

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.710
wash the dishes
before I'm asked,

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.730
I get extra points, right?

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.795
I mean, we should all be
so lucky to live in a world

00:59:04.795 --> 00:59:06.170
where can read
each other's minds

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.240
and do the perfect thing for our
spouses and our parents, right?

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.060
But the truth is
most of the time,

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.004
somebody has to say,
like, you, rub the back.

00:59:16.004 --> 00:59:18.170
I'm not just going to know
that she wants a back rub

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.750
right then.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:21.230
I'm not going to
know that she needs

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.910
me to come to the mammogram.

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:26.560
I'm not going to know
all of her needs.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.990
And sometimes we need tools and
feedback to help us with that.

00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:33.650
And I think with
conversational balance

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:38.280
especially, that's one of those
things to people predicatively

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.810
get wrong.

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:43.720
Like you ask somebody who's a--
like maybe he's an extrovert.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.860
And you ask him,
after the meeting,

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.510
you say, what
percentage of the time

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:51.610
do you think you were
talking in the room?

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:58.340
And based on a count
of seconds, it was 82%.

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:02.970
And he will say,
eh, 55%, maybe 62%,

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.230
like that's about that range.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.960
And it's like doing dishes.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.690
It's like I do the dishes
all the time in my house.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:14.010
But I probably do it
like 40% of the time,

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.896
so I do think we do need
feedback for certain things.

01:00:17.896 --> 01:00:18.688
Yeah?

01:00:18.688 --> 01:00:20.854
AUDIENCE: I might be
misjudging the age of your son.

01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:23.812
Was able to use the homescreen
of the tablet first,

01:00:23.812 --> 01:00:26.048
or a dinner knife?

01:00:26.048 --> 01:00:27.756
DAVID ROSE: The
homescreen of the tablet?

01:00:27.756 --> 01:00:30.714
What do you-- well, dinner
knives are just dangerous.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:33.305
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:33.305 --> 01:00:34.930
AUDIENCE: My 11 and
nine year old maybe

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:36.471
could have used a
dinner knife first.

01:00:36.471 --> 01:00:38.890
My five and two year
old could definitely

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:42.890
launch their favorite app
on these non-intuitive slabs

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.127
before they could figure
out how to use a dinner

01:00:45.127 --> 01:00:48.600
knife to cut their own dinner.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.120
DAVID ROSE: Point taken, good.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.220
No, right.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.910
What did you think of
the Google Earth table

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:59.360
in the living room as sort of a
gesture-based interface that's

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.720
rich but doesn't have
a keyboard, can't look

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.230
at Facebook, can only
do one thing at a time,

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.670
but the one thing is
a much bigger screen

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:13.360
than an iPad and
not an app store?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.240
AUDIENCE: The Skype
Cabinet was the one

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.765
I wanted, having young children.

01:01:16.765 --> 01:01:19.480
Because terrible
thing about Skype

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.707
is that it's only
accessible in these devices

01:01:21.707 --> 01:01:23.146
that also do other things.

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:25.020
And the two year old is
constantly, oh, there

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:29.790
are so many buttons here that
are not talking to grandma.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:30.540
DAVID ROSE: Right.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.000
Me too, right?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.530
Like I can't write on a
computer for first drafts

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:36.974
because there are too
many other things to do.

01:01:36.974 --> 01:01:39.265
I have to do it on paper just
because I'm distractable.

01:01:39.265 --> 01:01:42.980
I'm like, oh, what's going
on on the internet now?

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.880
So I suffer from that too.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.310
Hi.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:49.997
Hi, Jonathan.

01:01:49.997 --> 01:01:52.919
AUDIENCE: So,
David, [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:52.919 --> 01:01:56.820
What is your assessment
of Google Glass?

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.640
DAVID ROSE: I think you came
in right after I showed it.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:07.460
But well, I wrote in the book
that I was disappointed by it.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.540
At first, I was
disappointed because it

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.670
didn't have a reference
to what I was looking at.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.436
And my expectation
was that it would

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:17.060
understand exactly
what I'm looking at,

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.560
and like an augmented
reality application,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.680
notice that that part of
the wall over there is free

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.260
and then put the
information right there, so

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.016
that it would have a sense--
or know that I'm talking to you

01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:30.390
and put the name
above your face.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:35.240
Or have a sense of what I'm
seeing right now as a base,

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.680
and then superimpose
information on that base, which

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.680
it didn't do and
still just floats

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.000
a screen sort of up here.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.820
But the more I thought
about it, the more

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.550
I thought about this
problem that once we're

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.410
all wearing that and the
better version of Google Glass

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:54.540
does work where it's more
immersive, that there will

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.309
be this almost sociological
problem that you'll

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:59.850
see different things
than what I see.

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:02.510
And it'll intrude
on our relationship

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.220
because we will no longer
have this consensual view

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.690
of reality, that you'll decide
to filter out certain things,

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.670
and I'll decide to
filter out other things.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.029
And then it'll be hard
to talk because you

01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:14.320
won't be listening to my music.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.986
And I won't be
listening to your music.

01:03:15.986 --> 01:03:17.360
And we won't see
the same things.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.047
AUDIENCE: Well, because I think
the whole concept of Google

01:03:19.047 --> 01:03:21.698
Glass is it's not supposed to
interfere with your reality.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:24.590
It's a stream that's off to the
side that you can look up to.

01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:28.450
But it's not supposed to--

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:33.150
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, just
because of the intrusiveness

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.560
of the size of the glasses
and how much they do shield,

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:42.750
I find that they are a little
bit of a pariah right now.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.866
They need to be smaller.

01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:46.699
AUDIENCE: So I think
that actually gets back

01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:49.157
to this conversation of this
sort of metaphors [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:55.181 --> 01:03:56.681
Like your example
with the umbrella,

01:03:56.681 --> 01:03:58.686
it makes sense that
the umbrella would

01:03:58.686 --> 01:04:00.408
say it's going to rain today.

01:04:00.408 --> 01:04:01.884
That association works.

01:04:01.884 --> 01:04:04.620
I think the problem that
maybe you had with Glass

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.838
is that because it's
a glasses form factor,

01:04:06.838 --> 01:04:10.247
you sort of have these
expectations based on that.

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:12.200
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.790
You think certain things
because they're glasses, right?

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:17.227
You expect it to
[INAUDIBLE] vision clearer.

01:04:17.227 --> 01:04:17.893
It sort of does.

01:04:17.893 --> 01:04:19.200
But it sort of doesn't.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.680
So I don't know.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.380
I was curious.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.728
Do you think at all in terms
of-- because these smarts,

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.728
anything could tell you
that it's going to rain.

01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:30.118
The pen could tell you
that it's going to rain.

01:04:30.118 --> 01:04:32.110
But it's more
logical and natural

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:35.407
to have that be associated
with the umbrella, right?

01:04:35.407 --> 01:04:36.880
And maybe you get
into that stuff--

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.921
DAVID ROSE: Yeah, a slide
I didn't I didn't show,

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:43.860
but I think-- it's a
little bit of a pie chart.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.110
When I did a bunch of
ambient furniture pieces

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.890
at the Media Lab, the
approach that I took

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:50.730
was to take all of the things
that we surround ourselves with

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:53.020
and touch everyday, and
then all of the apps

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.770
that I use everyday,
and try to sort of make

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.260
marriages between them.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.170
And the way that I drew the line
was to sort of interview them.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.190
And I put the couch on
the psychological couch,

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:09.240
and said, cabinetry, what
are you really about?

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.196
And it said, I store things.

01:05:12.196 --> 01:05:13.570
People just think
I store things,

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:15.000
but I'm really
about so much more.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I'm about discovery and surprise
and revealing things to people.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.530
And the coffee table said,
I'm not just a low table.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:27.110
But the fact that I'm low
changes the conversation.

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:30.470
It's more about communion
and sharing and informality.

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.550
So that becomes more
of a place for photos

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:36.840
rather than a work surface,
that sort of thing.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.130
I'm not saying-- this is just my
thinking for one day about it.

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:44.682
But you could make
a much better chart.

01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:46.140
Why don't you be
the last question?

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.264
Is that all right?

01:05:48.264 --> 01:05:52.168
AUDIENCE: I think that there's
a really fine line between very

01:05:52.168 --> 01:05:55.110
useful tools to
creepy tools, like--

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:56.704
DAVID ROSE: Useful versus what?

01:05:56.704 --> 01:05:57.490
AUDIENCE: Creepy.

01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:58.917
DAVID ROSE: Creepy, uh-huh.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.250
AUDIENCE: --intruding your life.

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.732
And how do you know?

01:06:01.732 --> 01:06:04.684
Because I talk to my friends,
and I get all the time,

01:06:04.684 --> 01:06:05.684
Google knows everything.

01:06:05.684 --> 01:06:07.166
It's kind of creepy.

01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:12.106
And it's OK maybe, for the
active user, for those tools.

01:06:12.106 --> 01:06:14.082
You're choosing to
use these tools,

01:06:14.082 --> 01:06:16.058
so you kind of
assume that you agree

01:06:16.058 --> 01:06:17.560
to all these terms of services.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.356
But then I'm wondering for
other people in your life,

01:06:22.356 --> 01:06:24.597
the more there are,
the tools, you never

01:06:24.597 --> 01:06:25.842
know what it's capturing.

01:06:25.842 --> 01:06:29.328
For example-- what is
it? [INAUDIBLE] pen?

01:06:29.328 --> 01:06:30.822
You never know who's recording.

01:06:30.822 --> 01:06:31.320
DAVID ROSE: Yes, right.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:31.820
Right.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.312
AUDIENCE: For
example, you'd never

01:06:33.312 --> 01:06:36.798
know who's recording
your lecture [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:36.798 --> 01:06:39.288
Somebody may be voice
recording everything, right?

01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:40.284
You'd never know.

01:06:40.284 --> 01:06:43.770
And there are so many
instances that I'm

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:48.750
wondering do you have any
sense of where the line is

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:52.734
between when it gets useful,
that people are like, you know,

01:06:52.734 --> 01:06:57.114
he's OK, and where it gets
to be that people freak out?

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:59.030
DAVID ROSE: I think
almost all of these things

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:02.220
cast enough data off that
they're almost all creepy,

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.350
even the ones that
wouldn't seem to be creepy,

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.680
like the Nest thermostat.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.320
It's changing your heat.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.830
Who cares what you
set your heat at?

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:12.594
And who would care about
the history of how warm

01:07:12.594 --> 01:07:14.010
you warm your house
in the winter?

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:15.910
But if you think
about it, that's

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:20.550
showing when you're
home for forever, right?

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.250
So I do think we need
privacy policies about who

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:24.160
can access the data.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.490
And also, mostly we
need forgiveness.

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.040
Mostly we need an
absolution button

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.750
that says, forget everything.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.060
So all of these
things need a button

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.830
where you can go to
the Nest website,

01:07:35.830 --> 01:07:38.620
or even not even on the
device, and say, lobotomize.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.890
Like you think you've
learned something about me,

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:45.272
and no, you haven't
learned-- I'm

01:07:45.272 --> 01:07:46.730
somebody who's
using the apartment.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.940
And no, you know
nothing about me.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.140
So I do think these things
need sort of big reset buttons

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.550
to solve that problem.

01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:58.380
And I'm actually surprised that
more people aren't creeped out

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:02.460
by Google reading your
email over the last decade.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.170
That seems to cross
much more of a line

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:07.950
than a lot of these, like
how many steps I've walked

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.601
or that sort of thing.

01:08:09.601 --> 01:08:11.600
So I think there's actually
a lot more potential

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.714
for being afraid
with mobile phones

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:15.630
than there is for a lot
of Internet of Things.

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:21.924
But it's spawning a new
conversation about that.

01:08:21.924 --> 01:08:24.090
Thank you so much for coming
and for your attention.

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:24.990
It's really fun.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:27.740
[APPLAUSE]
