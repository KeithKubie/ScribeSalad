00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.840
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:05.830
Just before Friday,

4
00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:09.960
Monday morning podcast and ahhh just checking in on you.

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.100
How was your week going?

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.880
Is that the way you planned it is 2080 turning out to be the year you wanted it

7
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:23.740
to be?
Um,
uh,
beginning my,

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.160
my transformation of my,
my new fucking wardrobe.

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.380
But you new clothes,
uh,
you know,
something I never took seriously with socks.

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.050
I'd go down to the fucking foot locker and I just grab a pair of,
you know,

11
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:41.410
a package of those things and I would wear them for like three years.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.620
I don't own any white socks.
They're all gray.
Um,

13
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.270
I dunno.
It's just something that I've never been into.
And then for Christmas,

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.780
somebody actually got me some new socks and they were great,

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.620
but they weren't like a,
you know,

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.080
like dress socks as some shit.
Like,
oh great,

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.230
I gotta wait till somebody dies against married before I wear these fucking

18
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.870
things.
They were just like,
you know,

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.530
they weren't athletic socks,
they would just sort of socks.

20
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.920
You could still wear it with sneakers.
They were a little thicker,
you know,

21
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.570
I'm an old man.
I was like,
keys fell real comfy on my feet.
So,

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.780
uh,
that was it.
I,
I,
you know,

23
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.800
and then I had him sitting in my sock drawer next to all these sad grey socks

24
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.480
that had been loyal for all these years and all the old socks were looking at me

25
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.400
like,
Bill,
you,
you're not going to move the company to another country are you?

26
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.920
Man,
you're not going to break up the union.

27
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.520
<v 1>We been there for you for a long time,
man.
I was like,
you will get nothing.</v>

29
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.500
And I owe the public nothing.
Whose quote was that?
I owe the public nothing.

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.850
It's one of those Robert Barron guys back in the day.
And who even knows if they,

31
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.360
if they robbed anybody,
maybe they were just better at business than most people.

32
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.260
Maybe they had it in him to tell some old lady they hit the brick.

33
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:06.260
She would done with them.
Let me see something who said,

34
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.460
was it Andrew Carnegie or Carnegie is,
they say in Pittsburgh.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.410
Um,
I owe the public

36
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.620
<v 0>nothing over</v>

37
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.930
<v 1>JP Morgan.
Oh
Ho JP JP,
the original heal.</v>

38
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.780
How great,
what are you bent?
You know,
I bet if he lived right now,
he'd be,

39
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.830
he'd be working for Vince Mcmahon,
crushing it on the mic.

40
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.040
I owe the public nothing

41
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.800
that is so fucking mean,
so wrong.
And so right.

42
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.230
All at the same time.
I've never quite felt,

43
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.210
I'd never really felt one way or another about that one.
First I was like,

44
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.220
what a fucking Dick.
You know?

45
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.640
And then what happens is you start doing a little well in life and then all of a

46
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.080
sudden some douche bag in your life starts giving you shit about it and it wants

47
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.980
you to give them fucking money just for being there,
you know?

48
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.260
And you start going,
well,
I,

49
00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:15.040
I guess I kind of understand what JP Morgan was saying.
Granted,

50
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:15.581
you know what I mean?

51
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.060
I didn't fucking create the Federal Reserve system that enslaves fucking people,

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.220
you know,
taken away from this car.
I want to get that.
I don't know.

53
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.600
I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
You know?

54
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.760
This has always been my rule as far as helping people out.
Okay.

55
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.220
If you laying in a ditch and you're reaching up,

56
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.320
I'll reach down and try to pull you out.
All right?

57
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.070
But if you face down in the ditch,
digging it deeper every day.
Yeah.

58
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:39.180
I'm not throwing money in that.

59
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.780
Get your shit together.
Okay.
Get a little streak going.

60
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.470
A little street.
Go on of doing the right fucking thing that,
uh,

61
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.440
you'll be surprised how much the world will help you on,
I would think.

62
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.950
But what do I know?
I am a privileged white male.

63
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.100
I remember what I was born and I was on my dad's yacht,
bye.

64
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.210
And we were talking to the next seven presidential candidates and uh,

65
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.920
they were letting me decide who was going to be presidents.

66
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.450
It's if you're not white,

67
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.090
I'm sorry to let you in on this unbelievable level of privilege.

68
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.510
But that's basically what my childhood was like.
It was incredible.

69
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.280
I remember when I,
um,
when I turned 14,
I was given my first yacht.

70
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.830
I remember that,
you know,

71
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.160
and I was in a bad mood because my chauffeur was just,

72
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.520
I don't know if I wanted to get fucking ice cream.
And he wouldn't take me there.

73
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:37.380
And I was very upset.
MMM.
And I was like,
you work for me,

74
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.380
you work for me.
And he just ignored me that day.
And I was like,

75
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.930
I'm going to tell daddy and you're going to be fired.

76
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.730
And what I didn't realize was he was under instructions from my father to take

77
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:49.620
me down to the,
the,
uh,

78
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.190
the wharf at than sound like a good rich word.
The,
uh,

79
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.180
the doc that President Roosevelt gave them,
my great grandfather.
And,
uh,

80
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.120
they gave me my first shot and I was like,
oh,
I feel so foolish.
Um,

81
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.300
but my dad's still fired my show for just for upsetting me,

82
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.620
even though it says idea what,

83
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.780
we'll revisit my privileged childhood later on in this podcast.

84
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.500
But let's get back to,
well,
let's get back to what went down this fucking week.

85
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.640
Damn God damn mother fuckers,

86
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.750
Alabama Crimson,

87
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.800
Tad one yet another fucking championship.

88
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.340
Ugh.
God dammit.
Georgia had a bad,

89
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.170
I'm on the fucking ropes and then the second half came along and what happened?

90
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:40.050
Georgia goes right out there and blocks a punt.
And I don't,

91
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.240
I can somebody tell me how that guy was off sites.

92
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.810
Can somebody tell me why a bigger deal was not made other than on the mad dog

93
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.464
show?

94
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.640
They blew too brutal fucking calls when Alabama was making a great comeback,

95
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.730
great coaching decision by Nick Saban to put that freshman kid in a quarterback

96
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.170
and just stick with them.
And how about the,
uh,

97
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:12.020
the start and not being a cunt about it?
That was all great.

98
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.890
And then they had that running back that came in and they started using in many

99
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.340
ways in the second half,
Alabama did and he was just killing Georgia.
But however,

100
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.840
I don't,
I don't use that fucking guy was not offsite.
They blocked the punt.

101
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.530
You looking at at least three points on that drive.
Granted,

102
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.700
people can miss field goals.

103
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.910
God knows Alabama knows about that come the end of the game.

104
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.530
Then they miss the face masks call and they call it ticky tack pass interference

105
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.030
on third nine.
Um,

106
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.320
those are the games.

107
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.710
When you're rooting for you and your team's getting fucked you,

108
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:48.350
you literally sit there going like,
this is literally,
it's just a t,

109
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:53.300
it's a TV show.
He can't have one team just beat the shit out of the other team.

110
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.350
Everybody's going to turn the channel
present real.

111
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.460
That football game was like watching an episode of the Super Friends back in the

112
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.390
day,
right.
Every fucking episode was the exact same with the super friends.
Okay.

113
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.910
Something would happen and then all of a sudden it just looked like,
you know,

114
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.510
whatever.
Superman had kryptonite around his neck,

115
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.280
a Batman and Robin would tied together and not like they think like they cared,

116
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:22.940
but you know time that are heading towards a buzzsaw and all that type of shit

117
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.920
and then something would happen.

118
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.170
That stupid fucking monkey from the wonder twins would do something and the

119
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:31.540
second they played that song.
Yeah.

120
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.220
[inaudible] I remember I would get a sense of relief every time I was watching

121
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:44.400
that cartoon.
I'm like,
Oh fuck,
is this the episode Superman dies.

122
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.230
I mean I was young,
I didn't know any better.

123
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.430
And the second they would start playing that song.
I knew that they will,

124
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.790
they were going to make that comeback.

125
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.020
That's what the Alabama fucking band should've been playing when they,

126
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.690
when Alabama came running out in the fucking second half,

127
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.940
or maybe when they called off sides in that block punt.
Uh,

128
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.690
you got to give it up to Alabama.
Even though I'm kind of being a cunt,

129
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.920
bringing those things up.
But Hey,
I mean,
that did happen.
That was bullshit.

130
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.940
The guy didn't even fucking move.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

131
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:19.050
Maybe the referee had a better angle.
I don't know.
I don't,

132
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.280
I don't get how you miss a face mask when it was done to the guy carrying the

133
00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:25.980
football.
I mean,
the whole fucking stadiums looking at the guy,

134
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.870
his head turns around.
We didn't say it.
We didn't see it.

135
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.870
Um,
here's what I want to know.

136
00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:37.230
Who's more hateable bill Belicheck or a Nick Saban.

137
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.360
And secondly,
why do you hate them?
Like everyone says,

138
00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:44.880
Nick Saban is the devil.
Why is he the devil?

139
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:49.200
Because he's so good at what he does.
You know?

140
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.271
I don't know.

141
00:08:51.271 --> 00:08:54.840
I think the media fucking hates bill Belicheck cause he makes that job so
fucking

142
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 3>because he knows that if he opens his mouth,</v>

143
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.610
the media is going to make his job more difficult by exaggerating anything that

144
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.400
he said given the other team.
Bolton board

145
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.590
<v 1>material.
Um,</v>

146
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.700
<v 3>masterful.
The way he handles the press,
he gives them nothing.</v>

147
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.060
He looks at them and he's like,
you people are not my fucking friends.

148
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.410
I am required by the NFL to stand here and answer your questions but I am not

149
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:22.220
required to give you anything more than two fucking syllables per question.

150
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.640
<v 4>All right.
I love it.</v>

151
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.680
<v 1>I wish more coaches would do that.
More players would do that.</v>

152
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.390
You know Shaq used to doing,

153
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.560
you ever seen Shaq like when I hour but he still went like on TBS or whatever,

154
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.850
t and t,
whoever does the fucking Nba,
just total

155
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.040
<v 3>nice guy.
Affable brick area stair.
I say right number.
What he would do.
Like a,</v>

156
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.880
he's talking joking around animated and all that,
but we used to do those,

157
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.560
those interviews at the end of the game and just be like,

158
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.250
<v 1>well Colby or get rid of ball</v>

159
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.750
[inaudible] he just went into like poker era.

160
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.380
You see on any other show,
it seems like a completely different guy.

161
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.780
That's what you learn after you get burned by those fucking nonathletic fat fuck

162
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.940
counts that are in the sports media.

163
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.100
<v 3>You know,
and this is what I can't stand about them is they choose themselves,</v>

164
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:23.990
their own self preservation over any sort of loyalty towards the home team.

165
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.893
<v 4>You know</v>

166
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.500
<v 3>the local Boston sports media sitting there fanning the flames of that fucking</v>

167
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.460
<v 1>or shit about Tom Brady's personal assistant,</v>

168
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.750
whatever.
Not Personal assistant is fucking personal trainer.

169
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.140
<v 3>Can you fucking believe they tried that?
That's all they could get.</v>

170
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.620
And then they were like,
well whatever man,
we got a spark blow on it

171
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.070
and what kills me is fucking patriots fans will continue to listen to those

172
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:58.010
sports shows at second.
I hear that.
I go fuck these guys.
Well Bell,
I mean,

173
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:02.420
we're at the Badaliya.
It is a story.
We have to address that.
Do you,

174
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.410
um,
do you just have to say what everybody else is saying?

175
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:09.530
Is that what you're required to do?
Wow.
Bill,
what happened?

176
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.710
You started off in such a good mood.
Um,

177
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.230
so Nick Saban now has,
uh,
he has six championships.

178
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.000
Never.
He was doing,
he has six championships.
He's 66 years old.
Six,
six,
six.

179
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:23.834
He's the devil.

180
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.110
<v 1>Well,
Denny just turned into the devil.
What was he at when it was,
you know,</v>

181
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.750
five championships and he was 65.

182
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.380
Well,
it's two to fives.
What does that mean?

183
00:11:36.381 --> 00:11:37.970
You're going to go play that on a scratch card?

184
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.873
<v 4>MMM.</v>

185
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.470
<v 3>I don't think either one of them and the devil.</v>

186
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:45.920
I just think they're really good at what they do.
And a,
at the end of the day,

187
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:50.030
the game is 60 minutes long.
You got to keep coaching and uh,

188
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.980
you know what's funny?
Nowhere.
No.
In all

189
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.160
<v 1>the top four can for sports.
All right.</v>

190
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.080
Nothing hurts you more than playing.
Not to lose in football.

191
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.010
I've seen more goddamn games,
more fucking games.
Lost that way.

192
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.250
I feel like Oklahoma lost the Rosebowl because of that.

193
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.090
They stopped going no huddle.
You know,
if you want to be a Douche,

194
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.640
she could say maybe Georgia,
you know,

195
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.560
kind of took the foot off the gas a little bit there.
I Dunno.

196
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.900
Once you start thinking about how to chew up the clock,

197
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.650
it fucks up everybody's rhythm.
I don't know.

198
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.990
Or maybe I just love when Alabama loses like my favorite part of that Gabe was

199
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:36.660
fucking Nick Saban's face at halftime.
Oh.

200
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.540
And he had to do that fucking
what are you going to do that interview,

201
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.490
that stupid fucking interview.

202
00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:48.020
Why they stopped those poor bastards and the most important game of that Goddamn

203
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.550
career and they got to sit there and talk to fucking Susie sweet shoes as they

204
00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:56.480
before they go in there.
Hey,
you know why I fucking really liked on Alabama?

205
00:12:56.481 --> 00:13:00.020
Was that number 14 guys a fucking maniac.

206
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:02.390
He was all over the field breaking up passes.

207
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.740
Anytime there was a sweet pea come out of nowhere and he was amazing.

208
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:09.380
And I also think Georgia's front forward and credible.

209
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.350
Like that interception that kid had.
I mean,

210
00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:17.140
usually defensive Lineman,
uh,
I dunno,

211
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.410
they're just not quick enough

212
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.410
record shade off the how many found it in the air and then caught it,
um,

213
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.660
in that close to the quarterback.
That usually does not happen.
And uh,

214
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.550
yeah,

215
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.060
they amazing front for and George's quarterback to the freshmen obviously kinda

216
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.070
sucks that they ended up losing the game.
I feel it.

217
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.030
I actually would tell you this,

218
00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:42.290
I felt bad for Nick Saban when that kid missed that field goal.
It's funny,

219
00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:47.270
for some reason I didn't feel bad for the kid.
I felt bad for nick say,
but

220
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.500
I forget what he did.
He just threw his fucking arms up.
Like,

221
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.430
what do I have to do?
How big a genius too.

222
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:00.040
I have to fucking be to fuck it.

223
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:04.490
Help you sons of bitches across the God damn gold line so he can win this thing

224
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.240
and go,
go home.
What more do I have to do?

225
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.290
I would love to interview coaches and be like,

226
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:15.280
what goes through your fucking brain?
All right.

227
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.150
Like an offensive coordinator,
whatever you call all the right place.

228
00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:23.620
You play in fucking
high stakes chess,

229
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:25.390
where you literally,
your house,

230
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.640
your family standard of living is on the line because if you suck,

231
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.490
you're going to get fired.
And then that way you're gonna go,

232
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.370
you're gonna have to fucking sell your house.
You Ain't know that deal pill.

233
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.940
We know that deal.
And you call all the right place.

234
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:44.410
60 minutes of play in chess on television where every fucking Douche in the

235
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:48.730
world like myself is going to second guess you who has never even coached the

236
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:52.790
game at a pop Warner level.
You get all the way down there.

237
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.590
It's a fucking chip shot.

238
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:57.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.040
<v 1>And this soccer style con goes in there and fucking Mrs said like,</v>

240
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:05.760
just like how do you sleep that night?
I,

241
00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:07.500
I can't,
I can't imagine.
You know what I mean?

242
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.250
Everybody talks about the field goal kickers when they miss it and what they

243
00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:15.150
have to deal with.
You know,
it's,
it's very simple.
Okay.

244
00:15:15.151 --> 00:15:18.150
Nobody knows what a field goal kicker looks like.
You move out of this state,

245
00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:23.010
you start selling cars,
you begin a new life,
egg,
noodles and ketchup somewhere,

246
00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:23.844
right?

247
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:25.510
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

248
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.810
<v 1>I can't imagine the coach.
So you got it.
Like how do you go to sleep at night?</v>

249
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.730
You know,
and you know,
your wife doesn't understand.
College is just a game.

250
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.770
Come back to bed.
I don't understand what is wrong with you.

251
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.170
You're scaring the children,
Michael.

252
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.093
<v 2>Okay</v>

253
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.190
<v 1>guys.
Just I would say,
you know what I would do?</v>

254
00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:52.191
I would just be standing up in my living room drinking with my headset still on

255
00:15:53.281 --> 00:15:57.290
staring at the fucking wall.
Okay.
Kids,

256
00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.130
we're going to go to bed early tonight.
Your father's had a tough day.

257
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.140
I Dunno.
That's what I see when I,
when Nick Saban's losing,

258
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.390
when I look at that guy's fucking face,
it's just like,
I would not,

259
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.360
it's just not a guy you'd want.
You would want to piss off.
Um,

260
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.520
I love those guys that are going bald and they still dye their hair and they

261
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:22.610
still keep it like long.
Like,
I don't know.
What is Nick Saban doing?

262
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.140
So he's got cotton candy on top of his head.
Um,

263
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.020
anyways,
let's plow ahead.
By the way,
Nhl fans,
did you happen to catch?

264
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:37.910
Did you happen to see the fucking best gay by the year?

265
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.120
At least the ones that I saw.
Do you watch the Bruins first of penguins?

266
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.670
That game?
It was like a game from the 80s,
except there was no fights,

267
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.640
which there should have been when the puck somehow got lost in a shower,

268
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.650
his Jersey and that guy came up and just sort of looked at him and then pushed

269
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:58.250
him down like a kid on the playground.
And I was like,
all right,

270
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:59.690
somebody's got to drop the gloves there.

271
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.870
Even though what he did was totally legal.
That doesn't make a difference.

272
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:05.920
This is hockey.
Can't just have him push your captain down like that.

273
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.510
Um,
then nobody did shit cause that's the new game because they're trying to get

274
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:14.390
everybody to fucking watch,
which they're not going to do.

275
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:18.220
Fighting is basically out of hockey and all of these fucking,
uh,

276
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.070
Olympic ice hockey watching cons are still not watching.
They're not,

277
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.680
they're not gonna Watch it.
All right?
Basketball.

278
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:27.440
They'll keep watching that fucking players going into the standards,

279
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.940
accidentally punched it.

280
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:31.680
A woman trying to get to some guy in a track suit that through a fucking

281
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.980
cocacola on your face,
right?
People keep watching.
They don't give a shit,
right?

282
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.530
Players fucking getting busted for shit and bring it up.
Other players names,

283
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.220
nobody gives a fuck.
They keep fucking watch it and then they say,
Oh,

284
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.410
you got to get the fighting out of hockey.
Really?
Oh,
tell you what?

285
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.800
Why don't you get the fighting out of boxing first and then I'll actually

286
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:56.460
believe that you're against violence.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,

287
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.120
Bruins verse penguins.
This is how the scoring went.
One,
nothing Bruins.

288
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.730
Then it was one one than two.
One pens,
then three one pence.

289
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.590
Right now my GAF.
Fuck.
Here we go.
We just,
we keep,
we can,
what are we doing here?

290
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:15.820
Right then in the fucking second period it became,

291
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.180
it was three to two penguins,
three to three,

292
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:24.490
four to three Bruins,
five to three broads.
Okay,
so we scored the first goal,

293
00:18:24.491 --> 00:18:28.680
penguin scored the next three.
Then we scored the next four,

294
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.890
and this isn't even the end of the fucking second period yet.

295
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.230
All right.
Eight fucking goals.

296
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.220
This is back when like Gretzky would scoring a goal,
a game.

297
00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:42.310
I felt like I was watching this,

298
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.160
this game on the fucking USA network was amazing.
Um,

299
00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.760
and then right before the period ends,
you know,
I was thinking like,
don't let,

300
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:54.940
don't give up a goal to give them hope.
Don't fucking do that shit.

301
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.360
And what do they do?
They fucking give up a goddamn goal

302
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.400
and it ends up being five to four at the end of the second period.

303
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:06.660
Nine fucking goals,
right?
Third period starts at like,

304
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:09.210
we got to get the next one.
We've got to get the next one.

305
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.830
Penguin score the fucking next one.
Now it's five to five.

306
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.660
And it was just play off love,
play off,
play off level hockey,

307
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.350
the tire rest of the fucking game.
Unbelievable passes.
Unbelievable.

308
00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.770
I can't believe I'll fucking fast.
Abroads uh,
um,

309
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.770
got all these young kids out there.
It's amazing.
And ended the game.

310
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.460
Brad Marshawn comes down on sort of like a mini breakaway.

311
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.070
Sky's slashes him on his right hand,
right.

312
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.480
And it goes down and a,
the ref calls a fucking penalty shot.

313
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.670
What I loved is even after he called the penalty shot,

314
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.510
my show was still shaking his hand to make sure you know the ref.
You see,

315
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.190
look at east slash me this hand,
this hand,
right.
And uh,

316
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.020
am I going to,
Sean's going to score this fucking goal.

317
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.220
He's going to fucking score this goal.

318
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.150
It comes down and gets a pet fucking head of steam a little this way,

319
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:07.790
a little that way.
Fucking five hole opens up.

320
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:10.400
He goes to Tuck it in and that fucking penguins can.

321
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.040
Jess got the top of his pad on it to block it.

322
00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:17.360
We go into overtime and um,
unbelievable.

323
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:20.720
Three on three hockey and then fucking wasn't market.
Plus he the one who scored.

324
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.260
I mean penguins are tough and all the time,
you know,

325
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.800
they got Crosby on one line pant Malkin and another three on three.

326
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:29.660
All that open ice and Phil Kessel,

327
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.010
former Bruin farmer Brewen that we traded to Toronto because of that trade.

328
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:38.150
We want a cup.
So I don't want to fucking hear about it.
Um,
incredible game.

329
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.800
Unfortunately you didn't win,
but,
uh,

330
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:43.220
the Bruins are very excited to watch this year as exciting as the Celtics.

331
00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:47.090
Dare I say,
dare I say,
um,

332
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.030
have no advertising today.
Everybody,

333
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.450
people are slowly walking away from my podcast.
Evidentaly

334
00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.500
you know what I say?
I say that's their loss.
Uh,

335
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.580
admitting when you guys listen to other fucking podcast and they just do a

336
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:05.560
straight read,
you fucking,
you blow through it.

337
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.730
You blow through these assholes did not understand what I was doing.

338
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:12.700
I was misunderstood.
Would you like that guy?

339
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.300
Tucker used to make those cars except I was the advertising illiterate version

340
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:17.740
of it.
Right.

341
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.010
You know what's annoying as I tried to print something out before I started

342
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:23.290
doing this podcast and my printer's out of paper.

343
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:28.330
So the stupid fucking printer icon keeps jumping up and down.

344
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.063
<v 4>You know,</v>

345
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.800
<v 1>like when you have a big family and there's that one kid,</v>

346
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:34.810
you don't really like any kind of senses it,

347
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:38.650
so he tries to do extra shit to get attention.
That's what he's doing right now.

348
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.453
<v 4>MMM.</v>

349
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.381
<v 1>Anyways,</v>

350
00:21:43.381 --> 00:21:48.381
I'm going to be at a cobb's comedy club this Saturday night with Rosebowl

351
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.940
tailgate legend,
10 year vet

352
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.940
Joe,
nick,
10 years Tommy.
So it should say,
sorry,

353
00:21:58.941 --> 00:22:03.210
10 games in a row at the rose bowl.
Do you know we were there and the,

354
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.030
when they introduced it,
we thought we were bad ass.

355
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.060
What that 10 10 games in a row and they,

356
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.730
oh this fucking print or jumping up and down.
I get it.

357
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.503
<v 4>MMM.</v>

358
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.080
<v 1>Somebody was at the game and he was at his 70th Rosebowl in a row.</v>

359
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:25.220
Sky's been going since 1948 no,
1949

360
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.060
cause I was already thinking like the,
the,
the guys that we had seen.

361
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.813
<v 4>Okay.</v>

362
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.770
<v 1>Like the,
that have then gone,</v>

363
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.630
it'll either gone pro or one like the Heisman trophy or something like justice.

364
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.880
And the first like,
uh,
I don't know how many years

365
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.160
that kid on the titans who went to Stanford,
that white kid who's really fast,

366
00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:50.820
who scored that touchdown last week,
whatever his name is,
McCaffrey or some shit.

367
00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:55.380
We saw him saw Mark Sanchez Sanchez the first year.

368
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.560
Jamison Winston.
What's that?
Mary Yoda,

369
00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.210
Kit Macgyver for whatever his name is for the titans,

370
00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:04.800
up too old to remember the fucking names.

371
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.850
And then we saw that tech kid on Penn state,
the running back,
Shane courses,

372
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.670
whatever his name is.
We saw him last year

373
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.660
and this year we saw a Brewster baker in the six pack or whatever that fucking

374
00:23:20.151 --> 00:23:20.600
name is,

375
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.510
who's Bruceton Bank or how come on old people who remember cable when it first

376
00:23:23.511 --> 00:23:27.410
came out back when these entertainment industry was so amazing.

377
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.240
They let Kenny Rogers started movies.

378
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.210
Do you realize Kenny Rogers has all kinds of hit records?

379
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.140
He started a fucking movie and uh,

380
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.090
had fast food chicken restaurant.
I don't know if he still has all that,

381
00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.430
but they had to have been a point.
You know,

382
00:23:43.431 --> 00:23:47.000
at some point you had to looked at whoever was his manager of just be like,
dude,

383
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:51.300
I'm kind of spreading and spreading it a little thin.
I'd have,
fuck,

384
00:23:51.301 --> 00:23:54.680
can you keep putting out hit records and make sure you know,

385
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:59.360
nobody's putting their hands in the register at your 40 fucking Kenny Rogers

386
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:01.430
chicken places.

387
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.720
How much do you love Kenny Rogers?
That you like,
you know what,

388
00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:08.160
I bet he makes good chicken too.

389
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.210
Like how much do you believe in him as an artist?
And you're like,

390
00:24:12.211 --> 00:24:14.280
well cookings and art form too.
So you know,

391
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.760
I mean I love led Zeppelin,
but if John bought him,

392
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:21.910
started making fucking meat pies,
I mean I,
I think I'm going to pass,

393
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.270
I don't remember that being part of his fantasy during the song remains the
same.

394
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.140
Watching him,
making some sort of fucking,
you know,

395
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:37.600
fry up are a fucking fish and chips.

396
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.460
It was that he was out on a and in a drag race,
so that,
that makes sense.

397
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.610
Um,
he's such a horribly misunderstood musician.

398
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.470
Such a horribly misunderstood by myself.
Also,

399
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.810
you know,
I was talking to somebody the other day,
there's always been like this,

400
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.890
this myth about bond him that he used to play with these sticks that lonely like

401
00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:03.730
tree trunks.

402
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.660
And I remember like trying to get his sound and I went out and I bought like a

403
00:25:07.661 --> 00:25:12.370
pair of like two bs or something like that.
So if you don't know what those are,

404
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.990
I mean this thing is so big around that like,
you know,
80 years ago illegally,

405
00:25:16.991 --> 00:25:19.210
you probably couldn't beat your wife with it.
I mean that's,

406
00:25:19.211 --> 00:25:21.430
that's how big this fucking piece of wood was.
Right?

407
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:26.620
Thinking that you are going to get that sound.
And uh,

408
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.970
is it a couple of fucking pictures that I've looked up though.

409
00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:31.710
If you really look,

410
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.860
it looks like he's just using like almost like a five a or five B.

411
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.390
Just a regular sized stick.
It's just he just knew any,

412
00:25:39.391 --> 00:25:41.320
if you really look at him play,
he's like,

413
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.300
he never really brings his hands up and slams down on the drums.

414
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:51.730
He's kind of wrist and fingers.
He just knew how to fucking hit the drum.

415
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.980
I'll tell you another guy who was amazing.

416
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:58.981
I was talking to my drum teacher about this as I watched this clip of a James

417
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.440
Gadson who uh,
played with that,

418
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.960
that watts hundred third street band where the,
you know the one

419
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.600
express di Di di Di di Di [inaudible] people over that fucking song was bill

420
00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:17.980
withers basically took that rhythm section

421
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.860
and he went out on the road,

422
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:24.700
made albums with them and there's a live version of him,
uh,

423
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.160
James Gadson playing and he's playing like 16th notes and he's doing a little

424
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:35.190
ghost notes on the snare and whenever you would go to hit the backbeat I don't,

425
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.500
it didn't even look like he came like two inches up off the drum.

426
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.670
It's like his ghost notes would down about a half an inch and then he would just

427
00:26:42.671 --> 00:26:47.490
go
mean mathematically that works out cause he's like four times higher.

428
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.180
It should sound,

429
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.180
but how the crack he was getting off the snare drum is incredible.

430
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.000
Um,
anyways,
I have no idea what I'm,
do you know,
I'm trying to do,

431
00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.140
I'm just trying to fill up fucking 30 minutes talking about the intricacies of

432
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:05.600
different fucking drummers.
40 50 years ago.
Um,

433
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.860
yeah,
so that's it.
Billy new wardrobe.
All right.
And,
uh,

434
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.080
I got all these fucking clothes that fit me,
even if I'm a fat fuck,

435
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.960
uh,
opiate booze bag.
So when I'm doing is I am a,

436
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.490
I'm given all of that away and I'm not taking it over to the fucking,
um,

437
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.950
what do you call it?
Goodwill.
I don't believe in those guys.

438
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.680
You'd go over there and people do anything that they don't want.

439
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.510
They just drop off over there.
So they only have the guilt,
you know,
it's like,

440
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:42.270
let's let these people throw it in the fucking ocean.
Right?

441
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.780
Actually have a friend of mine that actually is,
uh,

442
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.080
works for this place.
You know,

443
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:51.510
people recovering addicts and all of that type of shit.

444
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:55.230
What I'm saying is this going to be some really well dressed x junkies out
there?

445
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.490
Not to say that I have the greatest taste.
I'm just say that the,
you know,

446
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.700
the homeless people in my neighborhood and we'll be looking at all right.
Um,

447
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.860
what do you do with socks?
So,
even if you wash them,

448
00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:08.850
I can't get my gray socks to people.
You know what I mean?
Underwear.

449
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:12.510
You definitely have to fucking throw out.
That goes without saying,

450
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.200
even though I just said it.
Um,
but uh,

451
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:20.450
I am in very happy with the shape I'm in right now and I'm going to just,

452
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.490
I'm going to buy clothes that just fit this fucking shape.
That's it.

453
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.480
So if I start getting out of shape,
all of a sudden my share,

454
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.640
it'll start creeping up.
My fucking white belly will be hanging out.

455
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.910
I'm just going to have to take it
because I'm not buying bigger clothes.

456
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.370
That's what I'm going to do,
you know,

457
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:47.070
it's all about not becoming a fat fuck,
you know?

458
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.980
And I finally turned the corner with my shoulder.

459
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.350
I didn't have to do any Coby Bryant,

460
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.880
fucking Peyton manning blood in the centrifuge and fucking Transylvania.

461
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.400
And I got blessed those two guys for doing that too,

462
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:02.280
because now like you can get that everybody's getting it done,

463
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.030
you know what I mean?
And uh,
you know,

464
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:08.970
pretty soon they'll level at stem cell research and all that shit.

465
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.770
I'm just waiting like,
uh,
I'm still too afraid to get lasik eye surgery.

466
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:15.990
I'm not going to do the stem cell shit.
What's his face?

467
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.390
Rogan was trying to hook me up with that.
I just,
I that's too,

468
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.860
I get a little nervous about that.
You know,
what does that,

469
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:25.980
they take up placenta out and they put it in one of those kitchen aid things and

470
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:29.370
then then,
uh,
dropped a little virgin blood in there.

471
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.140
It just seemed a little too fucking crazy to me.
Like,

472
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.810
and then you just get this brand new shoulder and it's like,

473
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:40.080
and then that's just it.
There's no price to pay.

474
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.200
I don't have like a slight fucking tick in my personality.
You know,

475
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:45.370
like those fucking movies,

476
00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.550
we get like a hand transplant and they took it off the cadaver or someone who

477
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:54.440
was a mass murderer and all of a sudden the hand wants to keep murdering.

478
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.560
You know,
you get your shoulder fixing.

479
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.600
All of a sudden you check your grandmother.
Yeah.
Boarding,
you know,

480
00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:06.090
she's bent down in a house coat to pick up a slipper.

481
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:10.200
You just send her into the fireplace you like,
man,
I don't know why it did that.

482
00:30:10.201 --> 00:30:14.370
It's not being mad.
It's my no shoulder.
Like,
you know,
whatever.

483
00:30:14.371 --> 00:30:17.280
I'm a fucking idiot.
All right.
That's the podcast.

484
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.120
Enjoy the music and now we're going to give you a little half hour of 'em.

485
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.760
Some a classic Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday.

486
00:30:25.761 --> 00:30:29.570
Monday morning podcast from the Thursday gone by in a year that already happened

487
00:30:29.571 --> 00:30:33.200
or possibly earlier this year.
Congratulations Alabama.

488
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.200
Uh,
you guys are the fucking Yankees.
You're the fucking Celtic shear.

489
00:30:39.201 --> 00:30:40.760
The Montreal Canadian.
Yeah.

490
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.930
Via the Green Bay packers of the,
of,

491
00:30:44.931 --> 00:30:49.910
of college football.
You can't debate it.
You guys are the best.
All right.

492
00:30:49.911 --> 00:30:54.890
Congratulations.
You fucking cunts.
All right,
that's it.
I'll,
uh,

493
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.070
I'll,
I'll have to have a great weekend.
Your counselor talk to you on Monday.

494
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.780
<v 5>[inaudible]
you</v>

495
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.240
were smelly.
Luvo was she loud to get sent

496
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.160
out
to

497
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.480
[inaudible] what's

498
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.100
<v 3>going on?
It's built burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

499
00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:00.640
January 11th,
2010.
You know,

500
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.320
I was going to try to start this podcast just by saying hello,

501
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.360
but now it's like such like a a uh,
it's a tick.
It's like I have to say it,

502
00:32:08.361 --> 00:32:11.480
I got to say,
Hey,
what's going on again?
She'd be like,
hello,

503
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.640
this is bill Burke.
You know,
I can't switch it up.
That's my catch phrase.

504
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:21.440
What's going on?
Um,
you know,
I figured out what this cough is.

505
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:22.131
Did I tell you about it?

506
00:32:22.131 --> 00:32:25.980
I'm coughing up what tastes like lighter fluid and it's actually the,

507
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:28.040
the chemical that they put on the outside of those,

508
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.990
those kinks first or whatever the fuck they are.

509
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:33.020
Those bricks have been grilling a lot and every,
you know,

510
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.040
when you grill on a Hibachi,
I dunno what it is.
Um,

511
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.360
somehow no matter you stand,
it's always blown in your face.

512
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.130
So,
uh,
anyway,
so let's get down to business here this week.

513
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:49.550
I won't be whispering this week because,
uh,
you know,

514
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.450
if that was just like a one day vigil for,
for old people,
you know,

515
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.100
I flew the flag at half mast and a,
I also was doing that doing the podcast,

516
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:00.200
by the way.
I was doing it last last week.

517
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:02.210
I did it Sunday night at 11 o'clock at night.

518
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:06.040
So are you fucking morons who sent me emails going to bleed?

519
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.080
We spoodle you wrote a book.
The book is,
I mean,

520
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.160
didn't you see the comedy in that,
that a 41 year old guy was whispering?

521
00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.070
You got to take everything at face fucking value.

522
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.010
Like I was gonna Whisper for the rest of my podcast.

523
00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.210
You're dumb fucks like five emails about that,

524
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.620
you know?
And it's not even like I don't like these people.

525
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:31.610
It just reminds me of how fucking stupid I am and you know,
as a human being,

526
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:35.720
if this is what I attract and believe me,
I got a lot of shit this week.

527
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.820
The Jesus freaks came out and force this week.

528
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:46.100
Um,
I'll be reading those later and uh,
I have some questions for you people.

529
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.580
Okay.
So all right.
Um,

530
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.710
evidently is come to my attention that g cast,
which is the server,

531
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.080
is that the correct computer word?
Um,

532
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.000
why is the same as 46 degrees out here?
It's not 46 degrees.

533
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.140
Just sat on my fucking Hoodie was dying out there anyways.

534
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.300
It's kind of my attention that a g cast,

535
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.660
the server that I post all my podcasts on is not going to be accepting any new

536
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:20.391
podcasters or any new podcasts as of February 1st.

537
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:25.680
So what that means is,

538
00:34:25.681 --> 00:34:30.681
I'm sad to say that the Monday morning podcast is coming to a close.

539
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.070
All right?
It's a,
you know,
everything has a beginning,

540
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.370
everything has a middle and everything has an end.

541
00:34:38.371 --> 00:34:42.240
So say it be shared should say it'd be done.
All right,

542
00:34:42.241 --> 00:34:47.241
so I'm riding this fucker out till January 31st and then that is it.

543
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:52.680
No more.
And Nada,
you guys are on your own on Mondays.
Okay.

544
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:57.000
Cause I'm not playing this fucking Internet game anymore.
You know,

545
00:34:57.001 --> 00:35:00.810
I already went from fucking my space over to Facebook and now I've got to go to

546
00:35:00.811 --> 00:35:05.730
g cast to fucking age cast.
Fuck all of them.

547
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.600
All right.
You want to hear my jokes?
You come out and you see me,

548
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.200
you put money in my pocket,
then I'll dance for you.

549
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.540
I'm just fucking with you.
I need some help on that.

550
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:21.120
I just said that cause you know you're like someone who's not going to kill

551
00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:24.240
themselves but they just say they're going to so they can just find out how much

552
00:35:24.241 --> 00:35:29.080
people care.
No,
no true though.
We love you.
You have so much to live for.

553
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.930
You have a Monte Carlo,
you have for Laura seats,

554
00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.920
you're going to get the air conditioning six.
And even if you don't,

555
00:35:35.921 --> 00:35:39.720
you still have the tee.
Um,

556
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.530
no I'm not gonna I'm not going to quit.
What?
Just cause g cast is tapping out,

557
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.260
you know,
and you know why they're tapping out is because of guys like me.

558
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.270
You know what I mean?
It's this whole fucking free entertainment thing.

559
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.780
I don't try to charge for the podcast.
They don't charge me for uploaded.

560
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.490
Nobody's making any fucking money.
We're just,
we're,
we're,

561
00:35:58.491 --> 00:36:02.940
we're dancing for free and we're getting sweaty and our shiny shirts a stick

562
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:05.850
into our chest and we're starting to go,
what the fuck are we doing here?

563
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.890
We want to get paid.
So I think that that's what's going on.
Um,
I dunno,

564
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:14.550
I consider the podcast more of a hobby,
but I got to tell you,
um,

565
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:19.170
when I get into my fifties,

568
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.140

569
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.620
shouldn't have in my fifties,

You know?

583
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.830

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.620
I'm going to be up in Seattle this week at uh,

You Go,
wow,
that was really funny.

589
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.510
And then you go home to your life and I go back to the hotel and I stare at the

590
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:08.280
ceiling.
Um,
all right,
let's stay on course here.
Um,

591
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.770
yeah,
so I need to know what the next g cast is.
All right.

592
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:18.771
You guys gradually helped me go from my space onto Facebook and a,

593
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:22.830
which I'm doing,
which sucks,
by the way.
Thanks a lot for the advice.

594
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.940
You know,
Facebook sucks.

595
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.360
All these fucking people can find you out of nowhere and they start talking to

596
00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:33.930
you.
Then I also found out that I can only add 5,000 people.

597
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:37.270
I got to start my own page.
There's already a fan page.

598
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:41.280
Now I've got to figure out how to take the fucking thing over.
Yeah,
I don't,

599
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:46.180
I don't know.
It's,
it's uh,
you know,
it's fucking weird.

600
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.170
Then all of a sudden somebody kicked in the balls and third grade find you.

601
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.360
It's just weird.
It's just a weird,
I don't know.

602
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.960
I don't fucking,
I don't know.
My space was better.
My space is better.

603
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.450
I could just say this is me and I could start my own page.

604
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.130
I didn't have to fucking say,
oh,

605
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:06.730
this is just a fan page and pretend like it's not me,
but it really is me.

606
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.820
You know,
there was a truth in my space that I liked.

607
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.200
This is me whoring myself out.
How are you as opposed to now?

608
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.010
Gee,
Bill,
why don't you explain it 15 different fucking ways.

609
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:22.480
We've been on Facebook for three years.
You'd think we don't know what it is.
Um,

610
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:26.740
so anyways,
if you guys know what the new,
uh,
the new g cast is going to be,

611
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:31.360
if you could help me out.
Um,
I'm also going to call up other comedians,

612
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.970
um,
such as Mark Marin.
All right.
Mark Marin,
who does,

613
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.240
uh,
the WTF as in what the fuck podcast every weekend.

614
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:46.960
I actually was on his show last week and had an,
I had a great time,

615
00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.940
just had a great time.
And uh,
these podcasts are fucking unbelievable.

616
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.650
I'm really like a,

617
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:58.390
a huge fan of these and how like a bunch of comedians are doing them now and

618
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:00.210
then you get like different Comedians,
uh,

619
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.520
can go on together and shoot the shit.
I think it's a,

620
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.191
it's tremendous.

621
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:09.190
I wish they had these back in the day when I was coming up and I was listening

622
00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:10.810
to my favorite comedians.
You know,

623
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.450
I would love to hear them shoot the shit with each other,
but you know,

624
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.330
they didn't have computers back then.
We'll they did.

625
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:19.690
They had those ones that were the size of a fucking elementary school,
you know,

626
00:40:19.691 --> 00:40:22.840
and they had those big reel to reel tapes.
Remember that?

627
00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.870
I used to love how like on like the $6 million man,

628
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:29.650
they just had all those fake computers in the background was just like Christmas

629
00:40:29.651 --> 00:40:33.060
tree lights that were just blinking on and off.
Then there was always like,

630
00:40:33.061 --> 00:40:38.060
like the big,
yeah,
the big reel to reel three quarter inch tape.
Um,
anyways,

631
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.500
so I'm going to be on that as of today.
Um,

632
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.630
I got to find God dammit.
I gotta look that up.
I think it's,
what the fuck.

633
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.430
I hope Marin doesn't listen to this cause I told him I was going to hype it and

634
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.230
then I did.
And let me look it up.

Go on that and you'll listen to me talking to,
you know,

639
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.150
I actually covered some of the material,
not material,

640
00:41:13.151 --> 00:41:14.530
just sort of riffing from last week.

641
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:19.520
I did tell him the story of the old man yelling at me.
And uh,

642
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.210

Yeah.

644
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:28.330
Kind of like you do when something happens to you,

645
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:31.540
when you retell the story becomes a story and you tell it.

646
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.630
Listen to that here,
that lighter fluid sound like fucking Lucille Ball.

647
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:40.221
Do you remember how,

648
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:43.160
how fucking old I was talking with the fuck was I talking to this about,

649
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:47.120
about how quickly people got old back in the day.
Like celebrities,

650
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.120
like Lucille ball is unbelief.
She looks,

655
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.220

I think that's cause yeah,

656
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:12.530
back then they smoke kind of unfiltered cigarettes.

657
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.160
And I'm being Tan was really big for a celebrity and she was a redhead.

658
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.920
I don't fucking know.
I don't know what happened.
So anyways,
is that,

659
00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:28.700
that that is where I'm at.
I need some help here as far as,
um,

660
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.860
where I'm going,
where I'm going to post these,
uh,

661
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.810
these latest podcasts and a,
and that's it.
Now we're into the podcast.

662
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:40.340
I just bullshitted for 10 minutes.
All right.
Um,

663
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.820
last week I talked about the old guy downstairs and how I was having a problem

664
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:50.270
with him and I,
I gotta tell you,

665
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:55.040
I was really surprised at the feedback that I got from that.
Um,

666
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.650
some of your suggestions,
I know a lot of you were joking,

667
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:03.230
but nobody really gave me any good advice that I really saw other than,
you know,

668
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:07.720
he's all just fucking let them be and whatever people go to do,

669
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:08.690
you know what I would do?

670
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.830
I fucking turned my TV up as loud as they fucking Kludge Jode I'd put this Gel.

671
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.350
I buy a fucking Tuba,
right?
I buy a toolbox.

672
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.840
I had hired new fucking porches in a second.
He came out,

673
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.320
I just fucking blow into it and the guy would think,
did he shit his pants right.

674
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:24.770
You just keep fucking doing it till he really does does shit and his paying what

675
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.800
idiots.
I love that whole,
you know,
I would be loud as humanly possible.

676
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.630
Whatso I can actually piss off the same neighbors in my complex who are actually

677
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:38.240
paying a decent amount of rent.

678
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.860
When they start complaining then I'm in fucking trouble.
Okay,
I'll let fucking,

679
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:47.540
uh,
you know,
this one guy was just like,
you know,
I think,
Oh God,

680
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.920
I got to find this fucking email.

681
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:53.921
This guy tried to suggest that because the guy downstairs use the term hip that

682
00:43:56.361 --> 00:43:58.010
he was actually a racist

683
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:04.370
because any used the definition of hip from way back in the day and zoot suits

684
00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:08.000
and I didn't even know what the fuck he was talking about.

685
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:09.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

686
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.620
<v 3>I was just like,
you're projecting this on him.
It's like,
okay,</v>

687
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:16.850
so you can project what you want to project on them.
I Dunno.

688
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.790
Why am I taking this shit seriously?
Alright,

689
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:22.400
You guys were here.

695
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:51.660
shit.
It's fucking great.
Um,

something that made me feel better about America when I saw that because it

703
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.620
looked that looked like an American story and the newscaster look,
you know,

704
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.810
it's just nice to see that those stories about nothing that don't even matter

705
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.850
exist in other countries.
And if you,

706
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:33.450
if you are in another country and uh,

707
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.960
you have some shit like that because people always trash in America about how

708
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:41.370
fat and fucking stupid we are.
And I'll,
you know,
we're just being fed bullshit.

709
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.900
This is a classic,

710
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:47.760
classic kind of store that you see on the news here in the states as they call

711
00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:52.620
them.
So it's just great to see that down under,
you know,
by the way,

712
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:56.520
speaking of Australia,
what is the deal?
What's the deal with that?

713
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:01.410
Foster's lager with that depth charge size beer can,

714
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.430
that's why I've never drank one.
I never understood like the 40 ounce either.

715
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.440
It's like,
let me hold this in my hand until it gets pissed,
warm.
You know?

716
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:11.970
Why wouldn't you just,
Oh,

717
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:16.971
you get those big Oktoberfest beer steins and they pour like 19 beers in there.

718
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:20.160
It's like,
why don't you just have a beer,

719
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.320
finish it and then move on to the next one.

720
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.340
It can be nice and cold and you see that little frosty smoke coming out the top.

721
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:30.300
Oh my God,
I'm getting fucking thirsty
by the way.

722
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:34.950
I'm 10 days into my sobriety.
And um,

723
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.430
I gotta say I,
uh,
I miss it.

724
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.230
I really miss it and I don't crave it.
I like it.

725
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:48.570
Did I already talk about this last week?
I can't even fucking remember.
And,
uh,

726
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.550
if I told you guys what I did this week,

727
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.550
I went to that guitar center drum off friend of mine hooked me up with some

728
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:58.660
tickets and,
um,

729
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.710
I saw these fucking unbelievably talented drummers.

730
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:07.040
I got to be backstage and it was just like every fucking famous drummer you

731
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:10.860
could.
Kenny Aronoff,
Tommy Lee,

732
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.230
Allen White,
uh,
Taylor Hawkins,

733
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:21.810
who fuck else was there.
Uh,
Danny Carry,

734
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.360
Chad Smith was fucking everybody.
Jason bottom,
everybody was,

735
00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.030
it was fucking unreal.
I want to get pictures with all of them,
but I didn't,

736
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.290
I was just like,
cause I could tell they were all fucking,
you know,

737
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.640
cause they're all on the road all the time.
They never get to see each other.

738
00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.500
Now they're all just hanging there talking drums.
And I didn't want to be like,

739
00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:45.640
you know,
like that fat guy in animal house.
Like,
hey you guys playing cards.

740
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.070
I didn't want to do it.
So I just,
you know,
I was just like,
all right,

741
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:51.430
just remember everything that's here and this is what sucks is I was on the

742
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:56.431
wagon and I have done a shot of Yeager was somebody's fucking super famous and I

743
00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:59.140
fucking turned it down just because I was on the fucking wagon.

744
00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:02.200
So I don't know if that means I'm smart or I'm fucking stupid.

745
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:06.610
But at the bottom line it was,
it was Diego,
which I've never understood.

746
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:11.620
It's like,
it's like motor oil and syrup and you know something that,

747
00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:14.290
that does become an age we,
you don't drink Yeager anymore.

748
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:20.110
Do you want to do a Yeager bump?
No,
I don't.
I'll drink some fucking drink,

749
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:24.430
some vodka,
maybe a little scotch.
And I'll pretend like I'm a fucking man,

750
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.440
you know?
And I'm shaving designs into my chest hair.
Um,
all right.

751
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.540
So anyways,
uh,
yeah,

752
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.590
I gotta admit I fucking miss it and there is no god damn way I'm going to make

753
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:39.250
it until March.
I know I'm not,
but I'm just taking it a,
you know,

754
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:42.043
<v 2>yeah.</v>

755
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.850
<v 3>I'm not an alcoholic.</v>

756
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.300
I just really enjoy it.
You know,
this is this like for me,

757
00:48:50.301 --> 00:48:55.040
quitting alcohol forever is the same as just being like a,

758
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.370
just saying like,
I'm never going to have ice cream again.
It's like,
why?

759
00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:02.380
Why wouldn't you,
why ice cream is awesome.
You know,

760
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:04.870
you don't have it every day and you've,
so you've become a fat fuck.

761
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:09.020
I'm not saying to do that,
but to never have it again.
You know,
to never have a,

762
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.970
you know,
a beer or a glass of wine,
you know,
I don't know.

763
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:17.500
There's no fucking way I'm making it.
This is really making me thirsty.

764
00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.740
And you know what else sucks is I got all these great beer glasses,

765
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:23.680
like those glasses they have on the commercials,
you know,

766
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:27.670
even got those Sam Adam ones for Christmas.
And uh,

767
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:31.030
I've just been filling them up with water drinking.

768
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:37.150
It's fucking sacrilegious,
dude.

769
00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:41.890
I don't know if this cop's going to go away.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

770
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.290
oh yeah,
somebody wrote me who was at the rose bowl,

771
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:46.710
evidently cheap trick was playing there and they,

772
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:51.010
she was giving me shit for drinking,
which she should have.
And she goes,

773
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:54.180
I feel bad for you.
And one of the reasons why she goes is you,

774
00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:59.080
you missed the greatest band in the world.
Cheap trick.
And uh,
you know,

775
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.070
come on,
really at this point,
cheap trick is still the greatest band ever.

776
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.100
Do you really want to see people who are pushing 60 singing?

777
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:09.400
I want you to want me.
That really goes back to Oprah.

778
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:14.590
Say and VJ Jay or Madonna walking around with one of her pussy lips hanging out.

779
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.610
It's like,
you know,

780
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.090
at some point you got to put your genitals away and just realize it's over.
Okay.

781
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:22.603
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

782
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.590
<v 3>I dunno,
but what are you supposed to do?
You've got to make money.</v>

783
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.660
You've got to sing the hits,
right.
That's okay.

784
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.880
What is lady Gaga going to sing about?

785
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:33.470
And she really gonna walk around with no fucking pants that I just bring up lady

786
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:38.380
Gaga.
I look at me,
look at me bringing up the new shit music.
Um,

787
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:42.880
is it me or is this like the worst music of all time with that auto tune?
Um,

788
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.960
I don't even give a shit about that of topic.

789
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:49.880
I'm just a fucking scrolling around here.
Okay.
Another youtube thing.

790
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.050
I actually,
somebody sent me this great link that I,
of course I lost.

791
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.660
There's been a couple of people who um,

792
00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.100
have been taking clips from my podcast and adding pictures to them.

793
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.590
Um,
I guess if you just search my name,
somebody did one where I was talking to,

794
00:51:05.591 --> 00:51:06.800
somebody asked me the question,

795
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.530
if you were in a gymnasium full of eight year olds,

796
00:51:09.531 --> 00:51:14.330
how many of them do you think you could kill before they overpowered you?
And,
uh,

797
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.600
somebody put pictures to the answer to my story and I actually really enjoyed it

798
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:20.930
because,
uh,
I kind of forgot that question.
You know,

799
00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.410
it's been long enough where I actually got to listen to it like it was somebody

800
00:51:24.411 --> 00:51:26.330
else and they did a great job with it.

801
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.780
So whoever it did that or is doing those,

802
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:33.950
I really appreciate that because they're fucking funny.

803
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.210
They're really cool looking and maybe I'll sell a couple extra tickets at the

804
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.220
uncle fucky Shit Shack,
whatever the hell on performing.
Um,

805
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.990
so thank you for whoever the hell is doing those.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

806
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.011
Yeah.
Okay.

807
00:51:49.011 --> 00:51:53.990
Next topic since really fucking is just really just I need to booze again

808
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.100
tonight,
you know,
to make it flow more.
Um,

809
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:01.910
somebody asked me this question or actually told me a story of a friend of his,

810
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:07.230
this is sort of a reoccurring story that I've heard over the years.
Okay.
Uh,

811
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:07.661
do it.

812
00:52:07.661 --> 00:52:12.661
A friend of mine was hanging out and this famous athlete was there and uh,

813
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.640
they had a couple of drinks and next thing you know,

814
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:20.930
it's like the guys kind of hitting on him,
you know,
what the fuck,
blah,
blah,
blah,

815
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:21.764
blah,
blah,
blah.

816
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.940
So this guy was telling this story about this professional athlete,
I guess,
who,

817
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:31.490
uh,
allegedly was hitting on a friend of his.
And in the end he's like,

818
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:36.410
dude,
you know,
I don't,
I don't really,
uh,
you know,
it doesn't bother me anyways,

819
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.910
but he said,
so what do you think,

820
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:40.430
what do you think about gay people in Pro Sports?
I mean,

821
00:52:40.431 --> 00:52:42.710
the amount of people who play in the various pro sports,

822
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:48.020
there has to be more than a couple.
Um,
what do you think about it?

823
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.010
Um,

824
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:53.630
I think it's fucking hilarious and I hope somebody comes out at some point

825
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:58.310
because it,
and I hope it's a football player because it's such a,

826
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:01.700
you know,
they're always fucking thumping their chest and shit and screaming.

827
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.020
And it would just be funny,

828
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.410
especially if it was somebody really dominant.
You know what I mean?

829
00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:14.430
Like just some psycho middle linebacker who's just fucking a drill at night.

830
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.333
And that's a bad word,

831
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.300
who's just fucking stick and everything about it is gay drilling,
sticking,

832
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:25.590
you know,
football is a really gay sport.
When you look at it,
you know,

833
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:29.820
this is really hacky material,
but you know,
you don't like me.

834
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:32.340
What if it was the quarterback?

835
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:35.370
And then the center's got a bend over in front of me that the whole fucking

836
00:53:35.371 --> 00:53:39.180
thing,
just the uncomfortableness alone in the locker room.

837
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.430
And then what's even better is,
you know,

838
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:46.170
those people who show up at sports bars and they have the name of their favorite

839
00:53:46.171 --> 00:53:47.730
player on the back,

840
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:51.000
which I always thought was hilarious because it's always this sort of an element

841
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:54.810
of like,
and I always reminded me of,
uh,
of high school,

842
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.870
like when the cheerleader would be dating the quarterback Keats sheet,

843
00:53:57.871 --> 00:54:00.630
where is Letterman jacket?
Jesus Christ built.

844
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:04.020
What'd you go to high school in the fifties you know what I mean?

845
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.480
<v 1>She'd fucking wear his jacket.
So I always thought it was a,</v>

846
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.290
I was with some buddies yesterday in the sports bar and they were talking about

847
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:17.850
that,
that the only Jersey you can wear as like the Jersey of a guy who was like,

848
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.560
who is this shit when you were a kid?

849
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.800
Cause then then it was okay to wear like a Roger Staubach Back Jersey or

850
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:23.191
something.

851
00:54:23.191 --> 00:54:27.540
But when you're an adult and you're wearing the Jersey of a guy who's like just,

852
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:32.280
it's,
it's Kinda Gay,
the whole fucking thing is kind of gay.

853
00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:35.910
So when it makes sense,
you know,
they always patting each other on the,

854
00:54:35.911 --> 00:54:39.210
I think it would be fucking hilarious.

855
00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.370
But the problem is,
is I don't think a lot of other people with that,

856
00:54:43.371 --> 00:54:46.950
that's like one of the certain times there's certain stories that come out and I

857
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:50.760
just kind of stay off the Internet for like four days because I just don't want

858
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:54.510
to see the fucking,
the hate in all the,
the shit that,
you know,

859
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:58.950
it would start with that and then it would eventually go over to TV and then

860
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:02.970
they would get caught up in the air.
Quote,
hysteria.
Um,

861
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.540
and then the Bible people would come out and they would start talking about the

862
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:10.680
Lord says that it's a man should never lay with another man and all that fucking

863
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:12.790
shit.
And,
um,

864
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.840
then they would say role models that the classic hysteria over absolutely

865
00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:24.360
nothing that like literally 8% of the population would be freaking out about.

866
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.720
And the other 92% would he be watching and just,

867
00:55:27.721 --> 00:55:30.210
or would just completely not even give a shit.
So,
uh,

868
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.750
I don't know if that's what I feel.
I don't think,
I don't think it's,
look,

869
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:38.430
if you can fucking catch the ball and make my tape when,
uh,
I don't give a fuck,

870
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:41.250
I'll take a whole team of fags

871
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:47.580
to not have what happened to my team yesterday against the fucking ravens.

872
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:49.740
I don't give a shit.
They can all skip onto the field.

873
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:53.970
I could give a fuck just when the Goddamn game.
Um,
wow.

874
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.430
Hats off to the fucking ravens.

875
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.360
<v 3>That's fucking a,
that was total domination.
And I gotta tell you,</v>

876
00:56:01.361 --> 00:56:06.361
I'm really disappointed in patriots fans with the amount of fans that fucking

877
00:56:06.581 --> 00:56:08.830
left.
But I got to tell you,
I'm not surprised.

878
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:14.050
I'm really not surprised because that is a through line through all the fucking

879
00:56:14.051 --> 00:56:17.500
sports,
the amount of people who show up when you're winning,

880
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:18.910
everybody shows up when they're

881
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:24.130
<v 1>good morning,
you know,
and then all of a sudden you go through some rough waters.</v>

882
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.580
Right.
And then where does everybody go?
They all fucking leave.
Oh,

883
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:32.350
I'm not watch new shirt and everybody fucking storms out.
Eh,
that that was,

884
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.570
that was embarrassing.
He stayed at the end.

885
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.740
I stayed at the end of the sports bar taking shit from people I'll do,

886
00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.740
speaking of which,
I went to this sports bar and this fucking ravens fan.

887
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:46.210
It was almost like performance art.
Like you know,

888
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.830
like when you go to a sports bar,

889
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.670
the one thing that sucks is going to be the people who are rooting for the other

890
00:56:51.671 --> 00:56:55.480
team.
You know,
people are going to break balls like as a patriots fan,
you know,

891
00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:57.820
you go in there,
if you're going to wear any sort of patriots,
you know,

892
00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.650
tee shirt or a hat,
you know,

893
00:56:59.651 --> 00:57:03.790
somebody is going to be like a you fucking cheaters or uh,
you know,

894
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:08.530
fuck the Patriots and you know what I,
whatever the fuck they gonna say,
um,

895
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.920
you know,
break time,
breathe Brady's other knee,
the usual bullshit.

896
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.160
But then there's always those people who take it too far and it starts to get to

897
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:21.410
the point of,
uh,
you know,
there's going to be a fight.
All right,

898
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:22.263
this guy,

899
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:27.430
I've never seen anything like this gate when the Ravens,

900
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.250
the Ravens scored a touchdown on their first play,

901
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:34.960
literally handed the ball off and ray rice just runs right up the gut and then

902
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:38.260
breaks it to the left and just goes right.
Okay.
And as they're doing it right.

903
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:43.290
This guy who everyone was saying look like it was like Kevin James Sort of build

904
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:51.930
with the head of Shrek and I'm not even joking and he just starts going like,

905
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.830
is the guys when he scored the touchdown,
this guy did like this.

906
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:01.210
I can't even just,
I can't,
I wish I was doing a video podcast and no,

907
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:04.270
I'm not going to start doing those.
Um,
he just started going,

908
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:09.040
he started doing like if just met,
if you exaggerated like walking,

909
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.790
like if he just were bringing your knees up really high and you will like

910
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:15.220
bringing your fucking arms up almost like you are power walking,

911
00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:17.700
but you're doing it in slow motion and he just was gone.

912
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:20.720
<v 0>Ah,</v>

913
00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.970
<v 1>like as long as you could do it until you out of breath.</v>

914
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:26.240
And then the funniest thing ever was winning at the end of it.

915
00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:28.070
He yelled out super bowl.

916
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.730
I almost fucking fell down into my breakfast burrito when he yelled at Super

917
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.220
Bowl.
It's fucking a wildcard game.

918
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.540
You just went up seven and nothing on the first play in this guy.
He's,

919
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.530
he's calling Superbowl already and dude,
I'm telling you,

920
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.240
and this was the thing when he was doing okay and,
and immediately I'm like,

921
00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:55.120
all right,
he is going to be this loud,
the whole game.

922
00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.350
I am going into the other room.
So this is where it gets bad.

923
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:02.380
Now I'm in the other room.
You want to be that fucking loud,
be that fucking lab.

924
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:05.860
But now when he starts doing is anytime the ravens make a great play,

925
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:08.470
he comes in.
Oh,
I notice,
you know,

926
00:59:08.471 --> 00:59:13.030
like when Kevin Garnett fucking dunks the ball and you just see him screaming.

927
00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.230
That's what he was doing.
Anytime the ravens were doing anything,

928
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.410
he was doing that.
Like he was doing it.
So what we started doing,

929
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:25.050
because he was fat,
we started yelling out appetizers.
Like

930
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.970
<v 7>you'd be like,
Rah ray bands.
We like potato skins,</v>

931
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:30.890
fucking buffalo wing.

932
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.250
<v 1>It's gray.
And it just,</v>

933
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:37.360
it started off funny and then by the end it just started getting really ugly and

934
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:43.650
it almost was like escalating into a,
I dunno dude,

935
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.130
he's just,
it was just one of those classic situations where,
um,

936
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.660
you know what I kept thinking of,
I just was wishing Joe pass,
she was there,

937
00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:56.580
you know what casino or he stabs the person in the neck with the pen and then a

938
00:59:56.581 --> 01:00:00.030
down in the ground.
Like he goes,
who's that?
Is that a little girl?

939
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.580
How are you a little here.
A little girl crying down there like the lily.

940
01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:06.230
That's what I wanted to do by the end of it.
And um,

941
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:08.061
I don't know man like that.

942
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:10.740
That's why I don't like going to sports bars cause I literally look at,

943
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:15.090
I love talking Shit and you know,
you show up and your team gets your ass,

944
01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.190
gets her ass kick you,
you got to take the shit.

945
01:00:17.191 --> 01:00:21.960
But like it gets to a certain point where now you're like yelling at me or in my

946
01:00:21.961 --> 01:00:22.591
direction,

947
01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:25.620
like I'm going to be intimidated by you and now you're making me feel like I'm

948
01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:30.000
some sort of bitch and now I gotta Yell Shit Back at you.
And it just like,

949
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:33.600
I kind of left it with like a headache and it like,
it wasn't

950
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.870
<v 3>I and I gotta admit like,
I even hate like the,
there's a,</v>

951
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:40.340
there's a particular person down at that bar who's a patriots fan who's,

952
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:43.580
it's just a fucking asshole.
Um,
I was just wondering,

953
01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:45.710
you guys have any stories like that?
Like you go to the sports bar,

954
01:00:45.711 --> 01:00:47.030
the guy who like takes it too far.

955
01:00:47.031 --> 01:00:49.400
Have you ever seen it actually escalate into a fight?

956
01:00:49.401 --> 01:00:53.560
Because I always want to see those guys get punched in the face.
And a,

957
01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.840
I'm not going to do it because a,
I don't want to get my ass kicked and be,

958
01:00:56.841 --> 01:01:00.740
I don't want to,
you know,
you know,
you know the option a,
you get your ass kicked,

959
01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.180
<v 1>which is of me on the ground.
You know,
when you get your ass kicked out,</v>

960
01:01:06.181 --> 01:01:07.600
you how messed up your hair gets

961
01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.980
you breathing really hard and you're trying not to cry.
Ah,

962
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.330
it just always feels like the playground.
It was mine was up.

963
01:01:19.331 --> 01:01:20.980
Just be like grass in your hair.

964
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:24.670
Remember that Shit when you got your ass kicked in the playground,

965
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:27.610
how just alive you were at afterwards where you could just fucking feel

966
01:01:27.611 --> 01:01:31.240
everything in your ears were always hot.
You know,
it's just fucking weird.

967
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:32.463
Anyways,

968
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:36.340
<v 3>um,
the fuck am I talking about?
Yeah.</v>

969
01:01:36.341 --> 01:01:40.720
That's just sort of the option now in public where it's like,

970
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:45.670
if,
uh,
that's,
that's the situation now when you get into a fight,

971
01:01:45.671 --> 01:01:49.840
either you fight new,
lose or you win and you get sued.
Dude,

972
01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:52.030
I'm really sorry about my throat this week around.
What the fuck's going on here?

973
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.600
Like,
did you guys see a,
did I talk about,

974
01:01:55.601 --> 01:01:59.330
I am so fucking out of the Jersey shore.
Was that last two weeks ago?

975
01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.400
Up this past week.
This fucking guy starts talking to one of the castmates.

976
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:07.480
Alright.
And he at,
at a bar and he's trying to cause a fight.

977
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.820
He's just begging for a fight and the kid keeps tone.
Do you know,

978
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:14.710
I don't want to talk to you,
leave,
leave,
go away.

979
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:18.850
And it finally escalates into a fight and the kid from the Jersey shore fucking

980
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:21.510
kit gets onto a couple of knees,

981
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:26.130
you know the classic bar fight and ends up on the ground and the other guy's

982
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.060
getting noogies to the back of their head.
Right?
You guys,

983
01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:30.690
I want noogies ours at an east coast thing.

984
01:02:30.691 --> 01:02:33.330
Those are those short little quick punches that are just pretty much a knuckle

985
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:36.690
based.
It's like the Bruce Lee one inch punch without the power.

986
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.020
He's just sort of wrapping on your head like it's a door.
Um,

987
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.080
and now I evidently that kid's getting sued.
It's like for what?

988
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.520
Cause he won the fight.
The other kid wanted to fight.
I Dunno.

989
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.960
I think it's fucking stupid.

990
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.340
And then of course his girlfriend was really the one provoking it because the

991
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:57.390
guy was ignoring them in the girlfriend kept talking shit.
Of course she does.

992
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:01.830
Of course she talks shit because she doesn't have to fight him.
It was hilarious.

993
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:03.420
So then when they go to square off,

994
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:06.660
the other guy's girlfriend actually starts walking up to the Jersey shore kit

995
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.770
and it's just trying to just standing there scratching his face.

996
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.821
And what's funny,

997
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:15.150
she's doing it with one hand and there are other hand is just hanging down at

998
01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:18.150
her side.
She doesn't have it up blocking that side of her head.

999
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:21.120
She doesn't need to cause he,
she knows she's not,
he's not going to hit her.

1000
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:23.340
So the other girl causes the fight,

1001
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.010
escalates into a fight and then the other girl gets to walk up and just sort of

1002
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:30.570
take swipes at this kid's face.
Then the two guys fight the fight ends,

1003
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:33.330
the Jersey shore kid gets up and then the girl or the other,
the,

1004
01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.410
the fucking Jersey shore girls going,
oh my God,
Oh my God,

1005
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:41.250
the kids go and get the fuck away from me.
You caused that.
And um,

1006
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:45.030
at one point I got to back up here at one point during the fight he was going,

1007
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.380
he's going,
honey,
stop it.
Stop.
Just stop talking to the guy.
And she wouldn't.

1008
01:03:49.381 --> 01:03:51.980
So he pushed her not hard,
just pushing away.

1009
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.840
You kind of go over a step and a half and I swear to God,

1010
01:03:54.841 --> 01:03:58.050
she goes back to the house and who ends up feeling like the,
like the victim.

1011
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:03.210
She does.
And she starts crying and I was sitting at to my girlfriend,
you watch,

1012
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:04.980
you watch,
she caused this fight.

1013
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.310
This guy just rolled around on the ground with this guy and for all,
you know,

1014
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.061
he did.

1015
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:12.420
The guy's like a black belt in Jujitsu and he's going to fucking rip his ear off

1016
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.770
or stab them.
Oh God knows what he's rolling around on this,
you know,

1017
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:21.450
he actually gets punched in the fucking face and now I sweat the girls crying

1018
01:04:21.451 --> 01:04:24.150
about it.
The girl who caused it as crying.
And I said to my girl,
I said,

1019
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:28.800
you watch,
he's going to end up apologizing.
And of course he does.
And she said,

1020
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.510
they're going,
you traumatize me.
Would you pushed me?
Ugh,

1021
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:38.710
fucking I,
I just,
you know,
I don't understand it.

1022
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.750
I guess I'll give the guy a pass because he's young.
I was just,
you know,

1023
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:46.170
I was just waiting.
I traumatize you.
Really.
You just caused the fucking fight.

1024
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.540
And not only that is I'm fighting a guy,

1025
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:52.140
the other girl's chick is coming in fucking hit me in the head and you did

1026
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:55.740
nothing.
You know what?

1027
01:04:55.741 --> 01:04:59.640
I lost interest in that story halfway through it.
Um,
all right,
let's,

1028
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.550
let's plow through here.
What the fuck can we wrap this podcast up with?

1029
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:05.310
This is actually a really short one.
Um,

1030
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:09.680
and I always say I'm going to wrap this up and then I never fucking do.
Um,

1031
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.420
all right.
Why don't we end with this segment?

1032
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:16.680
I'm sure I can do another 10 minutes on this to give you at least 45 minutes for

1033
01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:20.790
the week.
Let's end with this.
This segment.
Oh Jesus.

1034
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:24.700
Which is really taking on a life of its own.

1035
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:28.210
I thought it was going to die,
but it is somehow risen.

1036
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.810
Um,
okay.
Here we go.
And get ready for bill is the dumbest person on the planet.

1037
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.130
All right,
Bill,
for what it's worth,

1038
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.910
I think you're fucking crazy and irresponsible explanation point.

1039
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.100
I can never say the x,
x skull.
Exclaim exclamation.
There we go.

1040
01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:50.170
Exclamation point.
That's one of the,
you know,

1041
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.770
those words that you kind of know how to say,

1042
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:55.150
but you just sort of fly through them.
Escalation point.
Uh,

1043
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:59.500
what kind of person talks about God like that?
And I love this shit.

1044
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:04.090
This is what they all do.
You should.
And I believe deep down inside you are,

1045
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.070
be ashamed of yourself.
Dude.

1046
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:11.020
This is what I love about these fucking maniacs is they are so wrapped up into

1047
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:14.200
what they believe that they listen to,

1048
01:06:14.201 --> 01:06:18.970
how much this person just keeps fucking including other invisible people.

1049
01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:23.200
And then super imposing what he believes into what you know.
He thinks.

1050
01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:24.250
I truly believe,

1051
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:29.310
because he's so wrapped up in his own fucking world that he can't possibly even

1052
01:06:29.681 --> 01:06:34.270
fathom that somebody has a difference of opinion on this subject.
So he goes,

1053
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:39.040
uh,
you should,
and I believe deep down inside you are,
be ashamed of yourself.

1054
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:42.130
Dude.
Are Your mom and dad's still alive?

1055
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.690
What exactly does that have to do with any,

1056
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.880
your shtick with respect to God is hurtful,
offensive,
offensive,

1057
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:53.320
and despicable.
Um,
three things that always has to be three things.

1058
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:56.590
It can't be hurtful.
And despicable or offensive and hurtful.

1059
01:06:56.591 --> 01:06:59.680
It has to be hurtful,
offensive and despicable.

1060
01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.020
Just like comedy has to come in threes.
Um,

1061
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:07.770
how difficult it must be to spew hatred and vulgarities for shock value.

1062
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:11.080
Laughs,
no talent in that my friend.

1063
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.030
That's the classic place that people go.
Um,
whenever you,

1064
01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:16.864
whenever you,

1065
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.760
this is the classic guy where everything is funny until it comes around to the

1066
01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:26.260
subject that they take seriously 100% and no one can even joke it,

1067
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.780
joke about it or even questioned it on any level.

1068
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.740
And then they always say that you're just doing it for shock because they find

1069
01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:37.450
it shocking.
It's like really my views on women,
women haven't been,
you know,

1070
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.740
that didn't offend you.
All this shit that I've said over the two fucking years.

1071
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:45.310
None of that is offended you and Al of a sudden this does anyway,
so he goes,

1072
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.930
enjoy your success,

1073
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:51.640
air quotes and all the money you were making on the backs of hardworking,

1074
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:56.641
decent people that understand what it means to follow the rules and be the best

1075
01:07:56.741 --> 01:08:00.340
they can be without putting other people and god down.

1076
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.810
The rest of us are watching and we are not laughing.

1077
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.110
Dude.
How many people are in your bedroom as your,

1078
01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:14.590
do you ever group podcast listening party every week?
All right,

1079
01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:15.470
let's get back that.
Oh,

1080
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:19.670
evidently I am making a money on the backs of hardworking,
decent people.

1081
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:22.460
So let me get this straight because I'm standing on a stage.

1082
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:26.030
Evidently what I'm doing is not hard work and if people are sitting in the

1083
01:08:26.031 --> 01:08:29.990
audience automatically,
they're all decent,
hardworking people.

1084
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:33.920
And not only that,
I'm making money on the backs of them,

1085
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:37.520
really do I have some sort of comedy sweatshop like,
you know,

1086
01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.860
comedy factory was sweatshop Labor.

1087
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.820
What I do is actually takes advantage of no one.

1088
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:49.430
I stand on a stage and I,
I tell jokes and if you like what I say,

1089
01:08:49.431 --> 01:08:52.010
you,
you sit and listen.
And if you don't,
you walk out

1090
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:58.040
right where,
where,
you know,
and I love how just because you're in the crowd,

1091
01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:59.510
that means you're a decent human being.

1092
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.710
Do you know the amount of fucking freaks and scumbags that come up to me?

1093
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:08.090
This is what I found at a comedy show for the most part.
Decent people.

1094
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.720
They leave after the show that I didn't want to bug him and then they walk out

1095
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.130
and then mania come up to me.
You know,

1096
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.790
let's do some Yeager and they fucking spitting in your face and shit.
You know,

1097
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:24.720
believe me.
All right?
But I know I made fun of God.
So now,
uh,
you know on,

1098
01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.920
now all of a sudden I'm now all of a sudden you want to talk about people
making,

1099
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.320
making money off of decent,
hardworking people.

1100
01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:34.010
Take a look at fucking organized religion.
All right,
those guys,

1101
01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:37.190
those guys are live in pretty good.
Scaring the fucking shit out of you.

1102
01:09:37.191 --> 01:09:39.290
Every God damn week.
All right.

1103
01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:43.040
And I'm entitled to an opinion and I never was cramming my opinion down your

1104
01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:46.610
throat.
I wasn't okay.
You believe in what you believe in,

1105
01:09:46.611 --> 01:09:50.720
and I 100% respect that,
but I have the right to question it.

1106
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.540
You know,
and you shouldn't find it shocking that I questioned it.

1107
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.290
You should do and shouldn't you just be what Jesus would do when Jesus just

1108
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.810
start praying for me.
Anyways,
let's,

1109
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.810
let's continue this just in case you're interested.
I was raised Catholic,

1110
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.860
married and raised my children Catholic and definitely have my doubts about the

1111
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:12.830
whole organized religion thing.
Great.
So you agree with me?

1112
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.610
Not even sure that I believe in God.
Once again,
there's another that we,

1113
01:10:17.611 --> 01:10:18.444
that we agree on.

1114
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:22.580
I lost my father three years ago and never would have uttered these words in his

1115
01:10:22.581 --> 01:10:26.300
presence.
Neither would I.
What am I voice?
Go Up.

1116
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.890
So you know what dude,
I did it on a podcast.

1117
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.820
All right,
I'm sorry your father passed away.
But you know,

1118
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:37.340
that has nothing to do with me.
Do you understand what you're doing here?

1119
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.220
Now all of a sudden you're making it seem like I'm walking in with my Mr

1120
01:10:40.221 --> 01:10:45.200
microphone into the intensive care saying there's no god,
you know,

1121
01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:49.160
whispering into somebodies ear in a coma.
You just go into the ground.

1122
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.260
We're all like,
dear,
I'm not doing that.

1123
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.590
I'm doing a podcast and I'm fucking around.
Alright,

1124
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.410
if you want to take it seriously,
that's your problem.
Okay.

1125
01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:59.480
And if you want to bring up your father,

1126
01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:03.410
passing away is some way to try to guilt me in to feeling like,
I mean,

1127
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:06.850
you know what I'm saying?
In a hateful,
hurtful,
fucking way.
Dude,

1128
01:11:06.851 --> 01:11:10.630
those are all your issues.
They have nothing to do with me.
All right?

1129
01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:14.700
Then he goes on to say that his dad believed that there is something out there

1130
01:11:14.701 --> 01:11:17.150
responsible for all the beauty in the world,
uh,

1131
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:21.090
in our world and for our lives as human beings.
I don't even disagree with that.

1132
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.010
I just know human beings have no idea what it is until they fucking die.

1133
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.160
So I'm not going to sit there and listen to another human being who tries to

1134
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:30.360
scare the shit out of me.

1135
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:34.560
And who was living in a fucking palace telling me that if I become rich,

1136
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.610
I'm not going to heaven.

1137
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.540
I'm not out of my mind to think that that reeks of a fucking scam.

1138
01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.860
The same way late at night when they have those fucking gold coins that

1139
01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:48.540
evidently are with 50 bucks and they're selling them for 1999 that that doesn't

1140
01:11:48.541 --> 01:11:52.710
reek of a scam.
Somebody actually sent me a a,
an email.
Of course,

1141
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:55.320
I didn't save it.
Evidently it's sprayed with like a dollar,

1142
01:11:55.321 --> 01:11:59.470
something worth a gold.
Okay,
so they're making,
what is that?

1143
01:11:59.471 --> 01:12:04.290
A 2000% profit.
All right.

1144
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.611
Believe it or not,

1145
01:12:05.611 --> 01:12:09.950
just because you're walking around talking about religion and the afterlife and

1146
01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:13.080
and doing unto others,
and you're talking this great game,

1147
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:16.110
it doesn't mean that you can't be full of shit.

1148
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:22.160
All right?
Okay.
And I'm not saying that I'm right about what I feel,

1149
01:12:22.161 --> 01:12:27.050
but this is just,
it reeks of,
of,
of,
of a scam.

1150
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:32.060
I really believe that there is some sort of thing out there and I wouldn't be

1151
01:12:32.061 --> 01:12:34.670
surprised if there is something after this.

1152
01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:38.090
I wouldn't be surprised if you just go into the ground and you decay and you

1153
01:12:38.091 --> 01:12:39.740
give life to the next fucking thing.

1154
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:45.140
I wouldn't be surprised if earth is punishment for something that I did in an a

1155
01:12:45.141 --> 01:12:46.370
different solar system.

1156
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.390
That's another thing about religion and forget about the dinosaurs is it doesn't

1157
01:12:50.391 --> 01:12:53.630
even bring up space.
Okay.

1158
01:12:53.631 --> 01:12:57.560
Let's say there is this all powerful being okay.
Okay.

1159
01:12:57.561 --> 01:12:59.240
And I'm just trying to question this right now.

1160
01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:01.820
So I'm not trying to be shocking or I'm just questioning this.

1161
01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:04.710
Let's say there is this all powerful being,
being there,

1162
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:08.330
created the everything that there is.
Okay.

1163
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:10.250
The entire solar system.

1164
01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:16.040
Why would you do all of that and just put people on this one planet that's like

1165
01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:18.470
you created an in uh,

1166
01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:23.650
he built this house that has in an infinity basically amount of rooms,

1167
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:29.810
bedrooms and you just put everybody,
you're only using one room in the house.

1168
01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.020
It doesn't make any fucking sense whatsoever.

1169
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.960
And that's one thing about Scientology for as much shit as people give

1170
01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.400
Scientology,
at least it has the brains to incorporate out or space,

1171
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:48.480
you know?
I don't know if that's a really good point,

1172
01:13:48.481 --> 01:13:52.910
if that's really fucking stupid,
but you know,
I don't fucking know.

1173
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:57.710
So anyways,
yeah,
dude,
I wasn't trying to offend you or anything that you fucking,

1174
01:13:57.711 --> 01:14:01.220
I was just trying to be funny and I'm just fucking around and if you want to

1175
01:14:01.221 --> 01:14:05.870
take this shit seriously,
that,
that is totally your fucking choice.
Um,

1176
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:10.040
you know,
that's it.
All right.
I'm fucking done with that.
All right,

1177
01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:13.510
let's move on to the next trashing me.
Um,

1178
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.390
oh,
what the fuck?
Where the fuck is it?

1179
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:23.790
Jesus Christ.
I think I only,
I only put one of my thought.
I had another one.

1180
01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.440
I'm really just organized this week.

1181
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:28.620
That's because you don't have changes in your life.
You don't have Jason,

1182
01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.840
another guy said,
I love how you pick on a,
on a,
on a,
on a,
uh,
uh,

1183
01:14:32.841 --> 01:14:35.040
a punching bag of religion,
basically saying like,

1184
01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:36.750
it's very easy to make fun of Christians,

1185
01:14:36.751 --> 01:14:41.730
but I don't dare make fun of Muslims because if you make fun of them,
Oh Shit,

1186
01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:43.100
look what's going to happen,
you know?
And,

1187
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:46.200
which I thought was fucking hilarious because the person was sitting there

1188
01:14:46.201 --> 01:14:49.590
talking about how insensitive I am.
And that basically,
in a roundabout way,

1189
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:53.840
we're alluding to the fact that people who are Muslim means that you're a,

1190
01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.940
you're a fucking,
uh,
uh,
you know,
you're going to blow up.

1191
01:14:57.930 --> 01:15:00.900
Like they're all gonna blow up planes and that type of shit.
You know,

1192
01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.250
I went to a wedding one time,

1193
01:15:02.251 --> 01:15:04.200
this girl was Pakistani and they actually addressed that.

1194
01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.140
That's what they fucking hated was that all,
you know,

1195
01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:10.230
Christians thought that all of them just wanted to walk around blowing up shit.

1196
01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.000
And uh,
and I also,

1197
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:14.940
it was funny that this guy's fucking sitting there suggesting that,
uh,

1198
01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:18.510
people just because they're Christian,
that they're peaceful way.
And you know,

1199
01:15:18.511 --> 01:15:20.010
what does it,
once every 18 months,

1200
01:15:20.011 --> 01:15:23.040
some Jesus freaks fucking kills an abortion doctor.

1201
01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:28.060
That's pretty much par for the course,
isn't it?
Um,
no,
and it's,
it,

1202
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:30.660
it's not safe to make fun of Jesus freaks.
It really isn't.

1203
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.160
It really fucking isn't.

1204
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:37.210
I think Bill Maher is out of his fucking mind to say what he says and like are

1205
01:15:37.381 --> 01:15:42.000
actually has balls the size of the Grand Canyon to say what the fuck he says and

1206
01:15:42.001 --> 01:15:46.130
then just walk out and wade into those people and just a,

1207
01:15:46.131 --> 01:15:51.131
I would never do that shit anyways and I got to admit the level of which that

1208
01:15:51.181 --> 01:15:53.850
people take this shit seriously.
It actually kind of creeps me out to,

1209
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:56.880
to continue talking about this shit.
So,
uh,

1210
01:15:56.881 --> 01:15:59.790
this might be the last fucking week of it because I've definitely made my

1211
01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:03.270
fucking points and at this point we're just going to go around in circles and

1212
01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:06.780
I'm just going to piss people off.
So,
uh,

1213
01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.770
let's move on to this last guy who actually brought up some great points.
Um,

1214
01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.600
all right,
set a bunch of Nice stuff and then he said,
all right,

1215
01:16:15.601 --> 01:16:19.590
enough with the Dick Sucking.
I was gonna I was going to criticize religion,

1216
01:16:19.591 --> 01:16:24.170
but to describe those belief is,
is to mock them.
Beth.
And you know what dude?

1217
01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:28.920
That's what I learned.
Um,
yeah,
if you could describe them,

1218
01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:31.620
then you start making fun of them and then everybody gets mad.

1219
01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.800
Or as you're saying,
they're just so ridiculous.
You just have to,
you know.

1220
01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:38.940
Anyways,
let's fly ahead here.
Yeah.
You said,

1221
01:16:38.941 --> 01:16:42.870
you mentioned needing a code in the absence of religion to live by.
Um,

1222
01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:47.310
I'm not sure how much,
um,
of the,
I don't read things as a Shtick,

1223
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:52.440
but I recommend an excellent text used in an intro to Undergrad and Undergrad

1224
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:57.240
ethics course called the elements of moral philosophy by James.

1225
01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.270
I don't know if that's rock hills or Rachael's,
um,

1226
01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.910
everybody goes on and on about cheeses,

1227
01:17:02.911 --> 01:17:06.330
but Socrates who define morality is how we ought to live.

1228
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:10.070
Let a compelling life,
as you probably know.
Actually,
I don't,

1229
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:15.020
I just know him as a party reference.
Um,
what do you fucking Socrates,

1230
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.130
you know,

1231
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:19.160
that's one of those references that even morons can use and get away with.

1232
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:23.090
And I'm sad to say I'm one of those people.
Um,
he said,
I didn't know this shit.

1233
01:17:23.091 --> 01:17:27.650
He was found guilty of corrupting the youth.
He thought Zeus,
Venus,

1234
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:33.080
Aries,
etc.
Smacked of bullshit.
All right.
Think about that.
Right?

1235
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:37.160
They're corrupting the youth now.
Every why Christians,

1236
01:17:37.161 --> 01:17:40.720
Muslims and everybody today would say that.
Yeah,
that is bullshit.

1237
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:43.700
That those people do not exist because now we've evolved to,

1238
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:47.210
there's only one God.
There's only one bank.

1239
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:52.070
There's one world power.
Um,
and let's see.
And as punishment,

1240
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.510
he was forced to take his own life by drinking hemlock poison.

1241
01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:01.580
Once again another death because of organized religion.
You know,

1242
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.060
these Jesus freaks,
these,
these people who are into fucking,
I didn't,

1243
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.980
we don't want the reason why I don't make fun of,
uh,

1244
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.950
the Muslim religion is really because I don't know anything about it.

1245
01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.560
And the reason why I make fun of Christianity's because that's what I was

1246
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:15.890
brought up.
And those are the stories that,
that I,

1247
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:20.780
that I hear and all I know about Muslims is basically,
uh,
you know,

1248
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:23.510
the couple of wars with Iraq.
So I basically don't know shit.

1249
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.090
I just think what you wrap your,

1250
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.640
wrap your women up in bounty paper towels and then cut their clips off in,

1251
01:18:29.641 --> 01:18:32.040
am I wrong?
Am I wrong on that one?
Either.

1252
01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.930
They're not allowed to show their fucking thongs because,
uh,

1253
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.350
you're going to get an erection.
And because you were that bed sheet,

1254
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.480
everybody's going to fucking see it.
I don't,
I don't really think about it,

1255
01:18:41.481 --> 01:18:44.240
but I would definitely make fun of it if I knew something about it,
but I don't.

1256
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.870
All right.

1257
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:47.720
And I reserve the right to make fun of the fucker religion that I was brought
up.

1258
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:50.640
And,
um,
so anyways,
he says I'm,

1259
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:56.630
Socrates was a humble man,
famously announcing all I know is my ignorance.

1260
01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:01.750
Um,
he sought the one that I love,
people who would take that at face value.
See,

1261
01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:04.820
he said he was you fucking moron right there,
right there.
You know,

1262
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:08.720
Jesus is the solution.
Um,
he sought answers to questions.

1263
01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:14.010
Where is religions prohibits questioning answers a fucking brilliant,

1264
01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.090
this guy is really smart.
You should do a podcast instead of me.

1265
01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:20.600
I'm a fucking idiot.
Listen to,
he sought answers to questions,

1266
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:26.020
whereas religion prohibits questioning answers and if anything fucking proves

1267
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:29.480
that it's the 50 emails I got this week.
Ah,

1268
01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:32.960
I like how I'm actually asking like I'm questioning religion on any sort of

1269
01:19:32.961 --> 01:19:34.850
intelligent level.
Um,

1270
01:19:34.851 --> 01:19:37.640
I think actually I think I am just because I say cut and fuck doesn't mean I'm

1271
01:19:37.641 --> 01:19:41.780
not,
uh,
bringing up some good questions.
All right.
Let's finish this for,
uh,

1272
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:46.520
for Socrates.
The unexamined life is not worth living.
Um,

1273
01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:50.250
his sentiments on marriage and nagging women are remarkably Marmar,

1274
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:55.070
probably similar to your own,
so underrated Socrates,
overrated.

1275
01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:59.940
Jesus.
Uh,
yeah,
I,

1276
01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:02.660
I,
that's,
you know,
that's dead.
That is the one thing,

1277
01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:06.680
and I'm not being a dick here that I don't understand about people who,

1278
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.160
like I respect

1279
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.270
<v 1>people who,
who,
you know,
are raised in religion or,</v>

1280
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:16.320
or find a religion that speaks to them and then they decide to commit their

1281
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:18.930
lives to what,
and what I don't understand is,
you know,

1282
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:23.490
and it brings you this piece,
right?
Am I wrong there?
All right.

1283
01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:28.080
So it brings you this piece.
But then if anybody questions

1284
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.500
that belief that you have,
how quickly it turns violent,

1285
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.480
like the amount of people who die because they question these a holy people is

1286
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.213
this.

1287
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You don't find that fucking like hilarious and ridiculous on any level

1288
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:54.180
like this sitting there calling the other person the devil,

1289
01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:58.860
because they're questioning their beliefs and they're saying that that other

1290
01:20:58.861 --> 01:21:00.120
person is going to hell.

1291
01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:04.530
And then they turn around and kill the person because they don't believe in the

1292
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:08.370
holy pure way that they lived their life.
I mean,
I just,
I can't get behind that.

1293
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.330
I can't get behind that the same way.
Is that the same way?

1294
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.910
It's just because you're a red sox fan.

1295
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:18.390
You can't recognize the talent of Derek Jeter.
And I gotta be like,

1296
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:22.560
do full cubies you fig.
Now he's the shit.

1297
01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:30.090
I don't fucking know why.
Why do I continue with this shit?
Um,
anyways,

1298
01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.980
so that's the podcast for the week.
Uh,

1299
01:21:31.981 --> 01:21:35.970
this person actually goes on to recommend a movie.
Um,
he says,

1300
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:39.510
I heard you mentioned the departed a few times.
Um,
if you haven't already,

1301
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:44.250
you might want to check out state of grace and overlook mobster flipped from

1302
01:21:44.251 --> 01:21:48.400
1990 that was unfortunately released around the same time as good fellers

1303
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.520
Goodfellas and a Miller's crossing it as Sean Penn,
Ed Harris,
Burgess,

1304
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:57.360
Meredith,
Robin white topless.
All right.
That made it a little creepy.

1305
01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:01.560
And Gary Oldman,
who gives an Oscar caliber performance.

1306
01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.550
All right.
Yeah,
if you guys haven't seen state of grace,
I've seen that.
Uh,

1307
01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.990
I'm actually due to watch that again.
Um,
Gary Oldman is,

1308
01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:11.550
you know what,

1309
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:16.550
if you just saw him play commissioner Gordon in Batman and the reserve

1310
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:20.760
performance that he did and then you see them in state of grace,

1311
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:22.040
you'll realize why that guy is.

1312
01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:27.210
Even though people recognize him as an incredible actor,

1313
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.060
he still,
I think one of the most underrated actors of all time.

1314
01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:31.260
He's fucking unbelievable.

1315
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:36.540
And you have to see the face Ed Harris makes,

1316
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.320
um,
without ruining the movie.

1317
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:45.210
He gets betrayed and when he realizes that he's portrayed the fucking,

1318
01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:48.900
the way he twists up his face at Harris is another one.

1319
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.220
Dude that movie is like,
um,

1320
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.750
the guys that are in that movie for me are the modern day.

1321
01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.240
Like,
uh,
I didn't,

1322
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.630
and this is a big statement because you can never replace those guys,

1323
01:23:03.631 --> 01:23:06.220
but it was my generation's

1324
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:10.660
<v 3>Bronson,
Lee Marvin,
you know,
just the Guy Guy,</v>

1325
01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.830
the guys guys like you just wanted to be those guys and they always had guns and

1326
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:19.540
they never took any shit.
It's just,
it's just fuck,
you know,
Gary Oldman,
uh,

1327
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.660
and uh,
um,
ed Harris.

1328
01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:23.870
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1329
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:25.190
<v 3>Who else do I put in that?</v>

1330
01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:26.040
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1331
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.060
<v 3>It's a very short fucking list.
It's very hard the way.
Um,</v>

1332
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:31.420
<v 2>okay.</v>

1333
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:36.340
<v 3>Nowadays in movies I think to be the guy,
you know,
that,
that classic,
you know,</v>

1334
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.560
women want to get with them and guys want to be him.

1335
01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.230
And I think a lot of it is because,

1336
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.280
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1337
01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.610
<v 3>back in the day,
like those being in shape,
you just,</v>

1338
01:23:46.611 --> 01:23:49.940
you were just in sort of regular shape and then it was the way you carried

1339
01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:54.580
yourself kind of like what's his face and Ben Kingsley and sexy piece.

1340
01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:57.080
Do you guys ever seen that movie?
I know I brought it up a bunch of times,

1341
01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.710
but I remember he was in an inside the actor's studio one time and they asked

1342
01:24:00.711 --> 01:24:04.960
him if he worked out before he played a four.

1343
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:08.870
He played that character and um,
he said no,

1344
01:24:08.871 --> 01:24:10.280
it was all the way I held my body.

1345
01:24:10.281 --> 01:24:14.150
He just stood more like erect and he had like perfect posture and he just looked

1346
01:24:14.151 --> 01:24:17.480
like this tough as nails guy even though it was Ben Kingsley.

1347
01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:20.780
And I think there was something about those older guys like Steve Mcqueen and

1348
01:24:20.781 --> 01:24:24.050
those guys that just the way they held themselves because you look at them,

1349
01:24:24.051 --> 01:24:28.970
they all like Yule Brenner.
I mean all those guys,
they were like 140 pounds,

1350
01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:32.570
but somehow you just look at him like,
dude,
I wouldn't fuck with those guys.

1351
01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.470
And then like all the star to many of the stars nowadays,

1352
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:38.990
they got like highlights in their hair and they got abs and they got 'em all

1353
01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:41.420
oiled up and shit.
You're looking at black guys effect,

1354
01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:43.543
<v 2>you know,</v>

1355
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:47.350
<v 3>I dunno.
Did Stars back in the day?
Did they,</v>

1356
01:24:47.351 --> 01:24:51.610
did they fucking shave their chest hair and landscaped their eyebrows?

1357
01:24:51.611 --> 01:24:55.810
I think there's just something about it,
man.
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

1358
01:24:55.811 --> 01:24:58.030
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.
And once again,

1359
01:24:58.031 --> 01:25:01.390
I'm not disrespecting your religions.
Okay?
But this is my podcast.

1360
01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:05.110
And when I bring shit up,
I fucking go off on it.
And I,

1361
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:10.170
and I definitely go over the top saying that somebody was playing the upright

1362
01:25:12.021 --> 01:25:16.520
bass with Jesus's Juggler is fucking hilarious because it's over the top.

1363
01:25:16.521 --> 01:25:19.520
And I believe the God in my world thinks it's funny.

1364
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:23.630
He's God.
Why would he be intimidated?
I,
that's another thing too.

1365
01:25:23.631 --> 01:25:27.530
I don't understand why God would make all this stuff.
Okay.

1366
01:25:27.531 --> 01:25:30.950
And then just be so doe angry all the time.
Jesus Christ here.

1367
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:35.450
I'd gone back in and again,
I've got a lot of questions.
Fuck you.
It's my podcast.

1368
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.550
I,
that's why I don't understand.

1369
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:43.020
You know,
I is,
it was more like,
you know,
when you,

1370
01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:46.020
when you build a bookshelf and you just stand back a Meijer in your work and

1371
01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:49.230
then it falls down on the floor and you're like God damn fucking piece of Shit

1372
01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.650
and you start blaming the bookshelf even though you made it,

1373
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.240
you're the one who put it up there.

1374
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.053
<v 2>You know,</v>

1375
01:25:57.170 --> 01:25:59.810
<v 3>I guess technically God didn't make a,</v>

1376
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.850
he didn't make titty bars.
I guess those are manmade,
but uh,

1377
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:09.000
you know the broad cinema ma or are,
wow.

1378
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:12.120
I'm really fucking,
I was just gonna say maintenance image isn't that,

1379
01:26:12.121 --> 01:26:17.040
isn't that what you guys say?
They found a devil.
That's the devil.

1380
01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:20.700
They got the devil in them.
Um,
all right.
What have,

1381
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:23.010
all I'm saying is because it really got serious,
this sweet people,

1382
01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.260
people really got fucking,
they took it a little too seriously.
All right,

1383
01:26:25.261 --> 01:26:29.310
so back the fuck off.
Stop taking it so God damn seriously.
And you know,

1384
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:33.210
why don't you actually practice what your preacher preaches and why don't you go

1385
01:26:33.211 --> 01:26:37.710
pray for me?
Why don't you do that?
Instead of coming on here telling me,
you know,

1386
01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.160
giving me your wrath.
Isn't that one of the seven deadly sins?

1387
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:42.660
You fucking maniacs.

1388
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.700
You just as fucked up as I am and you don't know shit either.
All right?

1389
01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:53.640
All right.
I'm sorry.
God bless all of you.
Okay.

1390
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.540
I hope you find what works for you and a seriously,
if I'm bugging you,

1391
01:26:57.541 --> 01:27:00.180
don't listen to the podcast.
God knows I'm not making any money off it.

1392
01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:03.650
I don't give a fuck.
And that's it.
You guys all have a great weekend.
A,

I tell you where I was going to be this week,

1394
01:27:05.341 --> 01:27:10.260
but I'm worried some Jesus freak is going to show up.
So,
uh,
that's it.
That's it.

1395
01:27:10.261 --> 01:27:12.660
Have a great week and I'll talk to you next month.

1396
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.673
