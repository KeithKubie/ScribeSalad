Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we continue our discussion

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.709
of “Frankenstein”.
Oh, Me From the Past didn’t even come to

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.070
school today. Isn’t that fantastic? Well
we’re going to learn something without him.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.060
Last time we talked a little bit about the
Romantics, “Frankenstein” is often cited

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.760
as the definitive Romantic novel, but ehh…
let’s get a little bit deeper into it.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.680
Capital “R” Romantics don’t have a lot
to do with lower case ‘r’ romantics, unless

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.180
your idea of romance involves like ecstatic
descriptions of nature and a revolutionary

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.300
spirit that often ends in bloodshed.
And if that’s your idea of romance, don’t

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.239
put it in your OK Cupid profile. However,
pro tip, do say that you’re 6’3”.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.439
Knowing more about the capital “R” Romantics will help you be better at lower case “r” romance so stick with me here.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.319
So Romanticism was a movement originating
in the late 18th century and it’s typically

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.109
understood as a reaction against both the
Industrial Revolution’s devaluing of the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.619
individual human spirit and embracing of like the soulless assembly line. And also the Enlightenment’s

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.780
claims of scientific certainty.
Romanticism prizes intuition over rationalism,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.640
and nature and wildness over classical harmony,
and emotions—especially difficult emotions

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.840
like horror and awe and terror and passion—are
preferred over intellect.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.340
And there’s an emphasis on the unconscious
and irrational part of humans. There’s a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729
lot of talk of dreams and stuff.
So is “Frankenstein” a Romantic novel?

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.429
Well, if you take a course in Romantic lit
in college then you will almost definitely

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.929
read it. So, yes.
“Frankenstein” is interested in difficult,

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.369
uncomfortable emotions the wonder and awe
and horror of encountering the radically other.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.060
And it’s certainly in many ways also a response to the
Enlightenment’s emphasis on scientific rationality.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.260
I mean people at the time really thought
that we would eventually be able to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.760
reanimate the dead and other people
were rightly troubled by that.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.080
Then again, you can also read the book as
a critique -- and a pretty stern one --

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.560
of the kind of thinking and acting that
Romanticism encourages, right?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.200
I mean Romanticism preaches a radical
self-involvement that privileges the individual’s pursuit

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
of knowledge and glory but for all of Victor
and Walton’s encountering nature and going

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.280
with their gut it’s pretty disastrous. .
Another popular reading is to interpret “Frankenstein”

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.510
autobiographically, a reading that was encouraged
via 1970s feminist criticism of the novel.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.910
Earlier readings along these lines situates
“Frankenstein” as a tale of monstrous

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.960
birth and look to Mary Shelley’s own experiences
with birth, which were pretty terrible..

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.870
I mean Mary Shelley’s mother died while
giving birth to her and Mary and Percy’s

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.390
own first child, a daughter, died when she
was just a few weeks old.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.240
And in her journal, Mary recounted an incredibly
sad dream about this daughter: “Dream that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.100
my little baby came to life again; that it
had only been cold &amp; that we rubbed it before

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.370
the fire &amp; it lived.”
So, of course, the idea of bringing the dead

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.710
back to life had occurred to her even before
she listened in on Percy Shelley and Byron

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.710
discussing new developments in electricity.
Mary Shelley even refers to the book itself

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.480
as a child. In her intro to the 1831 edition,
she wrote, “I bid my hideous progeny go

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.630
forth and prosper. I have an affection for
it, for it was the offspring of happy days.”

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.910
That’s a very tempting reading, but it’s
also really literal and reductive.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.340
First off, and I’m saying this partly defensively
as a novelist, novelist don’t write exclusively

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.110
from their own experience.
More importantly, I’m not at all convinced

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.540
that making an author the central character
of a novel is a particularly helpful way to

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.230
read it.
So if you read “Frankenstein” as merely

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.900
as Mary Shelley working out her own personal
issues you miss the great and terrible questions

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.420
at the center of the book. The questions that
really can change you.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.200
There’s in fact a term for trying to do
this kind of reading—“intentional fallacy”—in

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.710
which we believe we can know exactly what
the author was thinking when they wrote a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.440
book.
But putting aside those biographical readings

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.390
there are still some pretty interesting feminist
critiques of “Frankenstein.”

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.850
For instance, the novel clearly shows what
harm comes to women (and families and relationships)

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.590
when men pursue single-minded goals.
In fact, thanks to Victor’s lack of work-life

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.490
balance, pretty much all the women in this
novel die. I mean Victor’s creation of the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.350
monster leads to the hanging of the servant
Justine, the murder of Victor’s bride Elizabeth

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.010
on their wedding night.
And occasionally in the novel Mary Shelley

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.490
refers to nature itself as female, suggesting
that Victor is violating it, as when Victor

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.430
discusses how with “unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.”

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.530
I mean you can say I’m reading sex into
that if you want but “unrelaxed and breathless

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.710
eagerness.”?
And there are also plenty of suggestions that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.590
Victor might not like women very much. The
creature says that he will leave Victor and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.530
all mankind alone forever if Victor just creates
a mate for him and Victor begins work, but

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.250
then he gets freaked out over what it will
mean to create a lady monster.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.990
Now admittedly that’s partly because it
might mean monster progeny but just look at

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.100
the text, “She might become ten thousand
times more malignant than her mate,” thinks

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.040
Victor, “and delight, for its own sake,
in murder and wretchedness.”

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.060
He worries, “a race of devils would be propagated
upon the earth who might make the very existence

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.350
of the species of man a condition precarious
and full of terror.”

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.690
So Victor destroys the female creature while
the monster watches. He recalls, how “trembling

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.020
with passion, [I] tore to pieces the thing
on which I was engaged.”

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.070
I don’t think I’m being too weird to point
out the sexy stuff there: “trembling with

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.160
passion.” Anyway, Victor claims to love
his cousin, Elizabeth, but he deserts her

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.860
for years at a time and even though the creature
says—really, really, really clearly—“I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.510
will be with you on your wedding-night,”
he leaves her alone on his wedding night.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.570
Now we can all wonder why Mary Shelley didn’t
create any strong female characters here and

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.310
instead a collection of suffering, passive,
doomed ones, but we can certainly read the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.880
novel as an exploration of what happens when
men fear, distrust, or devalue women so much

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.280
that they attempt to reproduce without them.
I mean in some ways Victor is trying to bypass

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.830
the feminine altogether. He’s creating life
without recourse to egg or womb. Now you could

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.389
counter this by saying that Mary Shelley’s
original Creator—God—did the same thing.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.440
But that’s precisely the point. Victor is
not God.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.580
And perhaps this is where “Frankenstein”
is still most relevant, in its discussion

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.480
of “playing God,” of the single-minded
pursuit of science without an accompanying

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.740
concern about you know, morality.
Now, obviously, the experiments that Victor

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.600
undertakes are extreme, but Mary Shelley was
basing them on some of the scientific debates

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.880
and discoveries of her day. And even if the
book is largely science fiction, there’s

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.320
a certain amount of scientific fact in it,
and a lot of scientific questioning.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.720
And part of why this book has survived is
because the questions she was asking were

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.700
important in her day, but they’re also
pretty important now.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.630
I mean there was a recent book on genetic
modifications in animals called “Frankenstein’s

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.540
Cat”, those who object to GMO foods often
label them Frankenfoods, which only makes

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.400
them sound like Franken-berry cereal - which
is delicious!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.560
So Mary Shelley was influenced… oh… it
must be time for The Open Letter.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.760
Oh look, it’s Frankenstein’s monster.
No, wait, it’s the Hulk. It actually occurs

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.680
to me that they’re quite similar.
Both monsters created by failed scientific

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.380
experiments who only really become monstrous
when they’re rejected by society.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.000
Anyway, an Open Letter to scientists: Dear
Scientists, here’s a little rule of thumb.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.580
Anytime you’re doing any kind of experiment,
ask yourself the question, “Could this create

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.060
a monster?” Even if the chances are relatively
low, I’m going to advise against that experiment,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.680
because what I have seen from the movies and from
books is that if it can become a monster it will!

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.880
But I will say scientists that I think you’ve been a bit unfairly maligned by poor readings of “Frankenstein.”

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.780
Frankenstein is not like the Hulk because
his story isn’t, at least not simply, about

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.580
about science run amok.
It’s an oversimplification scientists.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.240
You are doing good work with you lab coats and
your chemicals and I thank you. Don’t turn

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.290
anyone into a monster. Best wishes, John Green.
Right, but anyway, Mary Shelley was influenced

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.419
by several scientists, but chief among them
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather to Charles, and

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:54.830
Luigi Galvani.
Darwin published a long poem called “The

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.320
Temple of Nature,” because back then poetry
was a totally reasonable way to share scientific

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.990
ideas.
He had an idea that life—at least on the

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:08.040
microscopic level—could be restored to seemingly
dead matter or created out of inert matter,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.920
a phenomenon he called “spontaneous generation.”

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.900
And Galvani, became famous for conducting
experiments with electricity, in which he

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.639
showed that electrical impulses could animate
the muscles of dead creatures like the legs

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.330
of a deceased frog.
Did you get it? “.. conducting experiments

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.400
in electricity”, anyone? Conducting electricity?
No? OK.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.490
Galvani’s followers did even more macabre
experiments, like in 1803 test in which several

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.459
scientists attached electrodes to the body
of an executed murderer in the hope of restoring

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:39.819
it to life.
Because they were like, “Oh, man. Who should

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:44.430
we bring back from the dead? I know, a murderer!”
Anyway, they,of course, didn’t succeed,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.959
but they did succeed in making a few of the
murder’s muscles convulse.

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:52.990
These experiments clearly influence Victor’s
attempt to reanimate dead flesh and in fact

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.329
Victor’s experiments weren’t that much
radical than ones that were actually happening

00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:59.899
at the time.
That said, the novel itself is clearly pretty

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.300
skeptical about these pursuits. I mean even
before he animates the monster, it’s clear

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.760
that his studies are exacting a tremendous
toll on Victor’s health, and his well being,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.880
also that of his friends and family.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:17.490
Victor describes how “My cheek had grown
pale with study, and my person had become

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.420
emaciated with confinement,” which is a
pretty good passage to show your parents when

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.459
they’re pushing you to go pre-med.
And things only went downhill once he began

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:31.199
to assemble the creature. Victor, “dabbled
among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:36.519
tortured the living animal…collected bones
from charnel-houses; and disturbed, with profane

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:40.039
fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame,”

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.959
But Victor thinks that this digging around
in slaughterhouses and graveyards will be

00:09:43.959 --> 00:09:48.959
worth it; he says “I might in process of
time…renew life where death had apparently

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:53.769
devoted the body to corruption.” And that’s
an amazing and laudable goal (unless you’ve

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:57.670
ever seen any zombie movie ever, in which
case you would know that it’s a TERRIBLE

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.110
idea).
But in that same passage, Victor says that

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.490
the creatures he makes “would bless me as
its creator and source…. No father could

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.429
claim the gratitude of his child so completely
as I should deserve theirs.”

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:13.249
So it’s clear that his desire is actually
selfish and that he’s pursuing this knowledge

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:18.289
not for universal good, or so that the dead
may live again, but for his own gratification.

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:21.839
And then of course there’s his reaction
when his experiment does succeed. I mean,

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.980
even though he’s assembled every facet of
the creature and made him huge on purpose

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.350
so that all these fiddly bits like veins and
eyelashes will be easier to work with, he

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.350
responds to his creature with utter horror.
And what is Victor’s mature, responsible,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.819
heroic reaction to this situation? He runs
away, making all the dads on “Teen Mom”

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:43.660
look amazing by comparison.
Thanks Thought Bubble

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.730
So, the monster blames this initial abandonment
for all the murders that result, right?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.809
And Percy Shelley agreed, writing that while
the creature was initially affectionate and

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:57.089
moral “the circumstances of his existence
were so monstrous and uncommon, that… his

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:02.679
original goodness was gradually turned into
the fuel of an inextinguishable misanthropy

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.490
and revenge.”
But is the tragedy inherent in the creation

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.530
of the monster or is there a way to pursue
knowledge without responding in horror?

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.439
Frankenstein is more than a little relevant
today as we struggle to figure out where technologies

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:19.809
like stem cell therapy, or genetically modified
foods, or cloning land on the ethical and

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:23.509
moral scales of the social order.
The pursuit of knowledge is good, right, because

00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:27.149
that’s how I’m even able to talk to you
through like the magic of the Internet. That’s

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:30.929
why we aren’t hunger/gathers anymore.
But we don’t actually know the outcome yet.

00:11:30.929 --> 00:11:33.500
Sometimes we forget that we’re still in
the middle of history.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.240
I don’t think Mary Shelley condemned science
outright, or explicitly discourages learning

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.509
the secrets of life and nature.
Now the experiment definitely fails. The question

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:45.470
is why?
Is it because Victor’s aims are just unnatural

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.499
and evil? Is it because he can’t love the
creature he’s created? Or is it because

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:54.360
he let’s his ego run amok dictate his motivations?
That’s a non-rhetorical question by the

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.769
way. I look forward to reading your answers
in comments. Thank you for watching. I’ll

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:00.449
see you next week.
