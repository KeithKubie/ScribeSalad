00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.380
- For a while,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.150
I had to take the ear
pads out of my helmet

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.880
to get my helmet on,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.870
and then would have to clip them in

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.611
once I had my helmet on.

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:11.819
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.030
(fire crackling)

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.913
- Ooh, ooh, wee.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.850
- Short and weak, but we're back.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.470
It's The Bonfire, Comedy
Central Radio Series, XM 95,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm Dan Soder.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.263
That just slice of delight
is Big Jay Oakerson.

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:28.140
- Are you saying that while you watch me

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.653
dive into our, now, weekly,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.960
studio munchkins?

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.910
- Studio munchkins!

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.290
And we're not talking about
cruel terms for little people.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.600
We're talking about tiny doughnuts.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.440
- Little doughnut holes.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.220
- Little doughnut holes are fucking,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.440
I go and buy an iced coffee

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.730
and Jay and I have
fallen into the tradition

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.730
of buying a box of munchkins,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.260
but now we know the 25 one, not the 50.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.640
- Yeah, the 50 was just.
- It was a lot.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.473
That was painful.

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:57.660
- I ate five doughnuts worth of munchkins.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090
- Here's the thing, I probably ate, yeah.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.350
I was gonna say, all the jelly filled,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.530
I'm pretty proud of myself for getting

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.310
all of the jelly filled out of the 50 box.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.143
- You nailed it.

00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:08.810
- They said that walking
into the building though,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.200
I'm carrying a little briefcase

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.780
like I'm a child going
to visit his dad at work.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190
Like, oh look, Dan's got a
little briefcase of doughnuts.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.197
- Oh, this one had a
little hint of jelly in it.

00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:19.397
- What did you just say?

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.090
- This one.
- Dude.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.840
As quickly as the
munchkins brought us apart.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.410
- You think you took the box
and found all the jellies?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.130
- I did on the 50, I didn't on this one.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.110
- You bought this box, so.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.290
- [Dan] I'm the jelly king
doughnut of the Bonfire.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.720
Let it be known.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.140
I'll state my dominance in
the jelly doughnut world.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.450
- I wish you'd try to grab one.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.260
- Dude, upsert my power,
watch what happens.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.270
I will strike you down like Lou Witzki.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.420
I murdered him, that's
why he's not here today.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.730
He took a jelly doughnut.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.890
- What's the cake one?

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.723
It's unbelievable.

00:01:48.723 --> 00:01:49.660
- It's unbelievable.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.780
This whole box is great.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.940
Just, you know what,
they're not giving us money.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.183
Just go buy a Dunkin
Doughnut's box of munchkins.

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:56.190
- Get some munchkins and come back

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.040
and remember what you
love about munchkins.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.873
- Yeah.

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.500
- It's not just cub scout
parties of your sad moms anymore.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.860
- Yeah, this isn't A.A. meetings

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.937
where they're trying to
spruce things up on a Tuesday.

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:09.250
- Just, in an enjoyable
moment in your life,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.010
get a box of munchkins.
- Buy some munchkins.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.040
Fucking pretty good.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.930
- Get a ten-zo box for yourself.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.840
- Just down 10, who cares,
no one's watching you.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.870
Live your life.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.960
- Realistically, I don't
think I had 10 munchkins

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.260
out of the 50 box, for sure,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.250
but, that said, I probably
did eat, you know,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.920
two doughnuts worth of munchkins.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.910
You could easily do that.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.910
- Well, you know, you just keep going.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.240
- If you bite a munchkin in
half, I'll just fight you.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.180
- Oh, yeah. I mean, what about
if you do it in a shark way,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.370
which Jacob can respect,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.650
which you bite then a toss back?

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.340
Like, a bite, like a T-Rex.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.933
- Oh like, tear at it and then
get it back in your chops.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:43.945
- A bite, throw it into your mouth.

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:44.778
- That's still one bite,

00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:45.824
I'm counting that.
- Okay, cool.

00:02:45.824 --> 00:02:46.925
You're a reasonable man.

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.260
- I'm still counting that as one bite.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.080
- DJ Lou Witzki, not murdered.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.950
He is in Boston, Massachusetts.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.920
Is that where he is, Boston?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.152
'Cause I know Pearl Jam
was there last night.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.479
♪ Even ♪

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.090
(Dan scatting)

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.440
- Oh, see, oh, I'm happy to see
that Lou Witzki is out here.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.810
- Hey, guys, yeah, I see
that New York Mets hat again.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.640
Didn't we talk about not
letting him in the building?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.460
- Oh, shit, there he is again.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.690
Oh my God, there's two of him.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.320
Holy shit, there's two of him.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.470
- They don't die, they multiply.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.840
It's the prestige, oh.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.020
- There's two of him.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.710
- Oh no, they're like Spy
versus Spy, but the same person.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.450
- I thought you were in prison.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.630
- Yeah, if you guys ever wondered,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.770
DJ Jacob Battat running the boards.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.720
- [Big Jay] Jakey Jake.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.360
- Ole' dry Jake

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.400
Ole' Hayhaw.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:37.679
- [Big Jay] You know
what I love about, Jacob?

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.010
He's all eye contact
while he plays a tune.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.980
- He's real proud of it.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.813
- He really has a

00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:42.898
"Check this shit out"
- Real proud.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:45.077
- "You guys wanna see
me grip it and rip it?"

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:47.357
"You know what I'm doing?

00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:48.517
"You wanna know what I'm doing

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:51.007
"while Lou's humming
along to some old wino?"

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.310
Yeah, live.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.143
A couple times.

00:03:56.143 --> 00:03:57.790
I've done too many drugs every
time I've seen Pearl Jam.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.890
Never seen Pearl, never seen
a good show out of Pearl Jam.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.890
All my fault.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.740
- [Big Jay] Really?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.573
- Every time.

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:03.700
- You did not enjoy it both times?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.010
- I was too fucked up.
- I thought the one though,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.790
you ended up enjoying.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.783
- Couple songs, but I'm
talking about the whole show.

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:09.744
- No, I thought in Bonnaroo.

00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:12.570
- No, I didn't even know
that concert happened.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.403
- [Big Jay] Oh shit.

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:14.236
- The lights kicked on and I was like--

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:15.230
- That was the molly, wasn't it?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.140
- And mushrooms.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.720
- That was a lot.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.910
- You were candy splazzin'.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.680
- Dude, whatever they call it, yeah.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.672
I was nipple slippin'.

00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:23.308
- You were flugel dorkin'?

00:04:23.308 --> 00:04:24.943
- I was fucking cloud sucking.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.013
It was terrible.

00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:28.390
They kicked on like the main like,

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.010
you know the big lights, or whatever?

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.710
When they tell everyone
to go home and I was like.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.490
- Dan starts sucking
on his candy bracelets.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.872
(both groaning)

00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:37.087
(imitating chewing)
- Yeah, Ari was like,

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:37.920
"Let's get out of here".

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.187
I was like, "Yeah, need
to get out of here."

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:42.467
- "No, we really should get out of here.

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.520
"The Great Tree wants to talk to us."

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.800
- Yeah dude, I was fucking,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.470
it's like, you can hear light
when you're that fucked up.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.946
Like, it was like, the light was loud.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:53.779
It was like, (imitates buzzing),

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.060
I was like, "Uh, I need to leave".

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.030
So yeah, I've never
enjoyed a Pearl Jam show,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.000
but again, all my fault
taking too many drugs.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.833
I'm an idiot.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:05.130
Next time, I'm just gonna
see them a little stoned.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.894
Like a reasonable man in his mid-thirties.

00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:09.690
Yeah.
- I was just at a

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.800
this weekend, where you were in?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.480
- I did Governor's.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.313
- [Big Jay] Right.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.070
- Brokerage. Bellomore, Long Island.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.820
Lotta campers out, had a great time.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.040
- Lotta good food.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.858
- Yeah, it was actually fun.
I had a really good time.

00:05:20.858 --> 00:05:22.410
And it's always fun to
sleep in your own bed,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.470
and do shows.
- Yeah, that is nice

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.130
I can home Saturday
night after Providence.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.010
Providence was great.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.050
- Yeah, I love Providence.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.440
- Great, Falcony came out

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.273
- Hey!

00:05:29.273 --> 00:05:30.106
- O.G. camper.

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:30.939
- Wedding's coming up.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:33.333
- Getting married, DJ Lou Witzky is going?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.620
- [Christine] I don't know.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.700
- Do we not know?

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.533
He should go.
- Yeah,

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:38.366
Christine just said that like

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:39.790
a mom that's mad at a family member,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.140
but you don't know why.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.807
She went, "I, I don't know.

00:05:42.807 --> 00:05:43.640
"That's what,"

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.357
"Lou does what Lou wants to do.

00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.037
"and we all have to be okay with that."

00:05:47.037 --> 00:05:49.440
- "I guess that's just gonna
be a Lou Witzki decision,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.357
when Lou Witzki decides to make it."

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:53.787
- "But if you wanna know
what Lou Witzki's doing,

00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:55.410
"why don't you just call up Lou Witzki?"

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.559
Do you want another munchkin?

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.920
Would that ease the tension in the room?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.880
Another munchkin?

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.470
Okay, I'll pass you over the briefcase.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.440
- Thank god, someone wore
drawstring pants today.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.480
- Whoa dude, do not knock her

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.530
when everyone's on Team Munchkin's.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.527
I go, "Why are you wearing warm-ups,

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:12.450
"like you're about to play in the NBA?"

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.510
- Buddy, I'm juggling
these things into my face.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.381
- Yeah, you're going to
Philly this Thursday.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:19.517
- (Both) Yeah!

00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:21.110
- You had one, Jacob.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.943
- Oh, you fat shit.
- Now, you're on.

00:06:21.943 --> 00:06:23.441
- Oh God.
- Oh I see it

00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:24.274
going down your whole body.

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:25.107
- You tub of shit.

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:25.940
We're gonna have to open the walls

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.110
to get you out of the studio.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.943
- [Big Jay] Ew, dude.

00:06:27.943 --> 00:06:29.650
- Hey, My 600 Pound Life.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.020
- [Big Jay] Nobody's gonna want you.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.417
- Yeah, you're gross.

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:34.890
- I'm your friend, so me and
Dan will come over on weekend,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.390
and wash you with rags
on sticks, but still.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.490
- I will only do it for
the Instagram pictures.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.718
- Oh my god, what does it
smell like in your folds.

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:44.153
- Oh gross.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:44.986
You just eat munchkin's
- [Big Jay] Can't believe

00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:46.319
he pounded that

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.290
- You just assaulted that munchkin.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.370
- What if he was just chewing it up

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.658
and he spits it into Christine's mouth?

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:53.890
- No, I just get the taste
- He goes, "Baby bird"

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.495
He goes, "Christine, baby bird it."

00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:58.840
(both laughing)
- Or Black Lou comes in,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.550
and eats it out of Jacob's mouth.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.550
He goes in for the nip
- He just takes it

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.403
like a hawk.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.070
I like him goin' in for the nip.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.760
- One of my favorite
Will Ferrell sketches is

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.700
the chewed up food.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.533
- Is it?

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:11.274
It's so gross. I have
a hard time with that.

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:12.477
- It's just really funny
where he just like,

00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:14.480
and he goes, "Apple pie!"

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.137
Chris Kattan, "Will
you chew it up for me?"

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.810
- I can't believe they did it.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.690
- That's crazy, that's what
makes me laugh so hard,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.990
is that they actually fucking did it.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.040
You can't fake that.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.910
- It's so gross.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.260
- So gross, so gross!

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.680
And its not, they're not a real,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.470
I mean, I don't know if you
know this about sketch comedy,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.460
not a real family.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.293
- Wait, what?

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:34.950
- They're not a real family.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.783
- What?

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:36.663
- What?

00:07:36.663 --> 00:07:37.960
(Dan laughs)

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.490
- That's stuck in my
fucking normal lexicon now.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.830
The Chris Farley "what"
from the decaf commercial.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.950
Yeah, we'll post that at

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.240
The Bonfire SXM on Twitter, Instagram.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.380
Oh, it's Gwenyth Paltrow.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.213
No, that's not it.

00:07:49.213 --> 00:07:50.470
That's I work at,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.850
this is with Chris Kattan.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.993
Is it Will Ferrell?

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.200
It's Andie MacDowell.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.100
Is that the right name of her?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.980
Andie MacDowell?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.863
- No, Julianna Margeliese.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.050
- [Dan] Is that who it is?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.240
- I think so.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.100
- Andie MacDowell's a person, right?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.740
- Yeah, she's a human being for sure.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.106
(Dan laughs)

00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:10.430
- No, I mean Andie MacDowell could be,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.263
it's probably multiple human beings,

00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:13.120
but I mean the actress.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.953
- [Christine] What about Bob?

00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:14.786
- What about Bob, right?

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:15.619
Yeah, E.R.?

00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:16.452
- [Big Jay] Groundhog's Day.
- [Jake] Groundhog's day.

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:17.670
- Groundhog's day.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.503
- [Big Jay] Yeah.

00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:19.336
- That's not her, that's
the girl you said.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:21.297
- It looks like it's
always winter on her nose?

00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:22.900
- Yeah, I go, "are you--"

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.090
- She always has the shiny red nose.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.210
- Yeah, "Are you always cold, Miss?"

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.870
She's like, "No, I'm
actually feeling quite--"

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.830
- Family Guy's so good
at taking celebrities

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.340
you don't think of going at so much,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.820
and going at them.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.710
Just jokes.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.727
They have one cut-away like,

00:08:37.727 --> 00:08:40.447
"Well fine, we'll get a shot
big enough," or you know,

00:08:40.447 --> 00:08:42.497
"a frame big enough in the shot to get

00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:44.170
"Penelope Cruz's head the whole way,"

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.560
or "Minnie Driver's head the whole way"

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.620
- Yeah, and then you go, "Yeah,
she does have a giant head."

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.453
- Yeah, you look, and you're like,

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:49.942
"yeah there's a big ass
head on a skinny body."

00:08:49.942 --> 00:08:51.620
- I'll tell ya, as a guy with a big head,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.130
it felt kinda nice to
land into the same field

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.253
where everyone with big head's goes.

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:57.170
- Can I tell you something
as a friend, right now?

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.003
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:08:58.003 --> 00:08:58.960
- I want you to understand this,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.380
I know what you're saying about the size,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.330
circumference wise, and the
whole hat thing with your head.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.840
- Wear a size eight, just got
a new Niner's hat, Go Niner's

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.270
- You're tall.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.910
- Best O and O team in the NFL right now

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.630
- Size eight's a big hat.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.700
- Yeah.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.590
- That said, proportion of your body,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.880
you're tall, you're broad,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.080
it doesn't look like you have a big head.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.620
That is, and I have
all these problems too.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.070
You are carrying over child insecurity,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.750
because when you were younger,

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.660
really young.
- Oh, it did not match up.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.157
- You were Popsicle.

00:09:25.157 --> 00:09:26.265
- Yeah, I mean I was a bobble head.

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.490
- I mean, you know, what are they called?

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.460
Like one those big lollipops
that someone skips and licks.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.590
- [Dan] Yeah, I was a fucking--

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.580
- A Pippi Longstocking lollipop.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.680
- Yeah, I was a lollipop guild.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.513
- Yeah, yeah.

00:09:35.513 --> 00:09:36.440
- Like, "We represent."

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.410
Don't they hold those giant--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.930
- And you skip to your Nanna's house?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.107
- Yeah, "Oh, I'm a little
boy with a big head!"

00:09:43.107 --> 00:09:45.147
- "Hey everyone, I'm passing through"

00:09:45.147 --> 00:09:45.980
- [Dan] "Excuse me."

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.017
- "Just me and my giant lollipop."

00:09:48.017 --> 00:09:49.097
- "Excuse me"

00:09:49.097 --> 00:09:51.307
- "Don't look at my bloomers."

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:52.906
(both laughing)

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:56.117
- [Dan] "Hey everybody,
I'm wearing bloomers"

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:59.367
- "I'm just licking a
lollipop wearing bloomers

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:01.002
"running through the Forrest"

00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:03.160
- "I'm in my pajamas with a butt flap

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.251
"and my giant lollipop."

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:09.880
(imitates licking)

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.850
Yeah, but it really is,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.140
I mean, we're all like that as adults.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.090
You always carry over the thing.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.080
It is one of those things where, yeah,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.050
of course you carry it,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.960
'cause I was called "Big
Head", middle school.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.810
Whatever effects you in middle school,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.350
will effect you as an adult.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.160
- Yeah, it's true, for sure.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.930
'Cause when you were younger,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.763
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:28.030
- it looked, bigger.
- Crazy!

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.390
- Your body was growing into it.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.665
- But it really was like a thing

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:32.140
where you're like...
- Your head matured first.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.030
- My head, yeah.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.070
Instead of like being--

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.280
- I developed very young.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.897
- Which got me a lot of
male attention, sure, sure.

00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:42.510
But I don't know if I was
ready for it at that age.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.950
- A large head, and I honestly didn't know

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.000
how to deal with it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.310
I was getting a lot of whistles.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.143
A lot of.

00:10:48.143 --> 00:10:50.050
- I mean, I'm just a kid.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.420
- I remember playing Pop Warner football,

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.238
and having to buy a helmet
at Play It Again Sports,

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.470
and they were like
- And you were over sexualized

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.510
by the guy who worked there?

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.050
- He fucked me,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.940
in the face.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.120
- He goes, "You need a jock."

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.612
He's like, "what do you mean?"

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:07.937
"What do I mean, I mean, let me show you."

00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:09.027
"Okay!"

00:11:09.027 --> 00:11:12.057
"Oh, alright, do I
leave my lollipop here?"

00:11:12.057 --> 00:11:13.637
- "Let me put my lollipop down,

00:11:13.637 --> 00:11:15.370
"it might stick to the leather bench."

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.954
- "Hang on, let me put my lollipop down.

00:11:17.954 --> 00:11:19.517
"Do you have like a plastic plate?"

00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:20.350
- "Do you have,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.800
"what's the biggest helmet you have?"

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.637
Dude like, when I went in, he was like,

00:11:23.637 --> 00:11:25.169
"I think we might need to
special order a helmet."

00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:26.480
and I was like, "This hurts."

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.120
I was fucking 11.
- Oh yeah, you said that.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.300
- I was 11 years old.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.060
I was like, "Wait, for a child
you have to special order?"

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.733
- Buddy, when I joined basketball leagues,

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:37.583
and they just, you know,
everyone grab a shirt.

00:11:38.422 --> 00:11:41.520
And I would just grab,
the same shirt that,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.690
they're giving me the same size

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.250
as the kid who's six foot seven.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.083
- Yeah.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:47.343
- And like 160 pounds.

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:48.444
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:11:48.444 --> 00:11:49.277
- Do you know what I mean?"
- [Dan] yeah yeah yeah.

00:11:49.277 --> 00:11:52.158
- So it would pull down like
squeezing a tube of toothpaste.

00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:53.042
- Oh no.

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.102
- It looked like I was gonna birth,

00:11:54.102 --> 00:11:55.820
I looked like a sausage
that no one slit a hole in.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.130
- Oh no, so you're just like
all beefed up inside of it?

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.460
- And it just sucked,

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.720
and I would try to stretch them out,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.830
and make them sleeveless shirts.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.230
I'd wear another sleeveless
shirt under it that was longer.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.963
They weren't long enough.

00:12:07.963 --> 00:12:10.650
And then, when I played
with a comics league,

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.023
years and years ago,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.030
Talent and all these
Boston Comedy Club comics.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.863
They did the same thing,

00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:19.030
everybody grab a shirt,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.780
and I cut mine, this is so
embarrassing to have had to do.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.613
I cut it.

00:12:24.613 --> 00:12:25.446
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.760
- The first night, I
had to just play in it,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.593
- Yeah.

00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:30.030
- Like, looking ridiculous.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.680
And then I went home
and cut it so much up,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.090
to make it work,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.890
that iI ended up cutting it
straight down the sleeves

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.420
- So just like down
the sides where it just

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.464
hung over your head.

00:12:39.464 --> 00:12:40.730
- Which you can't do,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.261
when you run it's gonna
flap up and everything,

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.094
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.940
- I had to safety pin it to
the shirt I wore underneath it.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.773
- [Dan] Oh man.

00:12:47.773 --> 00:12:48.660
- It looked insane.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.578
It looked like I was wearing a
runners number in a marathon.

00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:51.411
- That's crazy.

00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:52.290
- What a moron.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.410
- Did you do it up here and up here?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.090
Like up here and down here?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.640
- No, I put it over my head,

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.360
like the neck hole was still there.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.193
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:01.400
Just picture a sleeveless shirt

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.630
with like, where the armpit is,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.760
just cut straight down.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.593
- Got it.

00:13:04.593 --> 00:13:07.110
- So it was like, you know, a poncho.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.160
- Am I wrong that back in

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.400
City League...
- A Gunslinger.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.898
- Yeah you just has a fucking (whistle)

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:15.302
like, "Here he comes, he just--"

00:13:15.302 --> 00:13:17.980
- Throw down that gun.
- "Watch his three."

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.230
- Am I wrong, or when,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.230
I remember in City League's
when you're younger,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.630
the larger the kid you were,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.200
the higher the number you had to take?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.700
So it was always like, the
kids in like the 90 jersey,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.440
you were like, "yikes!"

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.410
and then like, I wanted like
a 12, and it was too small.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.810
I was like, I gotta wear like a 34.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.687
- Like "what's my number, coach?

00:13:35.687 --> 00:13:37.247
"300?"

00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:39.117
- "I don't know, we ran out,

00:13:39.117 --> 00:13:39.950
"we ran out of jerseys."

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.833
- "I'm just saying, guys,
I never seen a jersey

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:44.840
"that's got three numbers on it before,"

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.340
he goes, "Yeah yeah, no,
its special for you."

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.230
- When we played AYL football,

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.270
that's what I played in Aurora,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.460
it was like Aurora Youth League,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.360
it was patch league for football,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.380
which I know a lot of
guys are like, "Pussy,"

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.410
but I don't know, that was the
only football league around,

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.243
- What's patch league?

00:13:58.243 --> 00:14:00.650
- If you weighed a certain
amount you had to have a patch

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.500
on your jersey,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.170
which meant you had to
play offensive line.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.740
You could play a skill position.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.020
And if you were a double patch,
if you were a real fat shit,

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.330
you had to be a double patch,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.560
which means you can only
play center or guard.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.640
You weren't allowed to play tackle.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.980
- They couldn't hit anybody?

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.909
- Well you were huge.

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:17.520
They were basically
doing it for the brains

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.600
of the giant headed kids
like me with no bodies.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.800
They're like, yeah this
fat kid's just gonna fuck,

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.149
dude, I would get demolished
by two-patch kids.

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:25.982
- Then its great being the fat kid,

00:14:25.982 --> 00:14:27.950
that you have a set
position in a lot of sports.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.783
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:29.616
- I never did patch league anything,

00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:34.616
but like I was in neighborhood
games in football,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.440
just pretty obviously quarterback,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.520
'cause I could throw a little bit,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.300
but more than that even,

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.520
just like, you know,
tight end-ish things or.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.840
- You couldn't be a tight
end though if you're--

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.123
- Or you're short distance
running back stuff,

00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:47.380
but there was no point

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.510
in me playing deep coverage or anything,

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.710
I would get burnt immediately

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.543
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:14:51.543 --> 00:14:52.380
- There was many flaws in that game,

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.730
and in basketball, same thing.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.563
- Four or five.

00:14:55.563 --> 00:14:58.630
- I was never the fastest, but
I was always just down low.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.550
- A coach ever believe in you,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.700
and put you in three in basketball?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.050
- No.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.716
- Fucked up.
- But I only played with the,

00:15:04.716 --> 00:15:06.040
the most I ever played was like Rec league

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.350
was where we had coaches and stuff.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.506
- [Dan] Yeah.

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:09.500
- We won the championship, though

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.333
- Really?

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:12.160
- [Big Jay] The year I played, yeah.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.070
- Our little league
football team was so bad,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.903
we we one and 23.

00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:17.300
I used to do a bit about it.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.100
We lost to a team 116 to zero.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.031
- [Big Jay] Yeah, you told me that.

00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:21.864
That's crazy.

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:22.920
- They put skinny kids on the yellow line,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.850
and these double patch kids
were just eating out lunch.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.167
He was like, "Move out of
the way," and you're like,

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:30.210
"Why do you think tall
is good for the line?"

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.073
Coach Sheets, what an idiot.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.766
- Is that one strike
against Sheets Nation?

00:15:35.766 --> 00:15:38.110
- That is one strike, you know what?

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.943
I'll count it.

00:15:38.943 --> 00:15:41.200
That's a strike against Sheet Nation.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.209
- I haven't had a pepperoni
roll since that day.

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:44.042
- Dude, I'll never forget.

00:15:44.042 --> 00:15:47.310
I called my dad at his
bar, at the bowling alley,

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.105
to be like, "Yo, I'm starting football."

00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:50.567
'cause he was at work
and my grandma was like,

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.137
"you're dads at work,"
but its during the day,

00:15:52.137 --> 00:15:53.120
"call him, he'll be there".

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.760
And I called him, and
he was telling me about,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.287
it was a Saturday, and he was like,

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:57.490
"You got practice this afternoon?"

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.323
I was like, "Yeah,"

00:15:58.323 --> 00:16:00.647
he was like, "Tell the coach
you want to play tight end.

00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:02.910
"You're tall and skinny,
and you can catch."

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.887
He's like, "Tell the coach
you want to play tight end,

00:16:04.887 --> 00:16:06.268
"make sure you tell him that."

00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:07.580
and I was like, "You got it."

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.830
and you know, it was like, the 49ers,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.710
so I was like, "Like Brent Jones?"

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:11.827
and he's like, "Yeah, you're
gonna be like Brent Jones,

00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:12.660
"just go there."

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.060
So I went and the guy,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.953
this fucking coach that
had never coached before,

00:16:15.953 --> 00:16:17.330
was like, "Oh no,"

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.060
and I was like, "I wanted to
play quarterback or tight end,"

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.787
and he's like, "Well,
we got our quarterback,

00:16:21.787 --> 00:16:24.180
"you're not a tight end,
you're more of a center."

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.590
And I was like, "What?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.730
I'm the tallest,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.757
one of the two tallest kids on the team"

00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.077
- "Plus, you get me a three-point stance,

00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:32.460
"I'm gonna topple over, man."

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.160
- Yeah, I'm a baby deer.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.270
This is crazy.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.750
I do not know how to support.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.130
Man, I blame--

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.927
- He was like, "I go
four, and I'm going over."

00:16:41.927 --> 00:16:43.057
"You better not step that box,

00:16:43.057 --> 00:16:44.327
"I'm somersaulting as soon as it happens.

00:16:44.327 --> 00:16:46.267
"I'm gonna do a tumble-sault"

00:16:46.267 --> 00:16:48.114
- "I'm gonna roll kick that nose tackle."

00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:51.730
- You go, "Blue forty-two,
blue forty-seven."

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.563
Tumble sauce.

00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:55.757
- I go, "Call it, call it, call it."

00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:57.770
My butt's just going higher in the air,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.947
I go, "Call it, it's happening."

00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:00.340
"It's happening."
- Tumble sauce."

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.030
- Tumble sauce. Tumble-sault, Oh god.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.560
Yeah dude, and then we just got,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.160
like all these fat kids would
just like, push me aside,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.080
they'd be like, "Move!"
And I'd be like, "Ah!"

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.030
- And you're going,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.027
your heads just leading
you into thin air, "Ah!"

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:16.934
- You know the cartoons

00:17:16.934 --> 00:17:18.060
where they're carrying the large plates

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.990
- [Big Jay] Yeah yeah,
back and forth each way.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.823
Are you bringing up the thing first?

00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:23.300
Steve, funny American Dad,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.880
I know you're thinking of Roger?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.070
- Oh yeah, man, it was a--

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.847
- He's like, "I got it,
yup, I'm goin over,"

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:31.622
with his head.

00:17:31.622 --> 00:17:32.950
- Dude, it's almost every Saturday

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.010
with my mom and her boyfriend,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.920
just drinking a thermos
full of rum and coke,

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.561
watching me just get hammered.

00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:39.447
- "Put your head down, homo!

00:17:39.447 --> 00:17:40.942
"I'm not his real dad."

00:17:40.942 --> 00:17:43.640
He goes, "No, don't worry,
I'm not his real dad."

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.884
- I don't believe in sports on dry land.

00:17:45.884 --> 00:17:48.477
I'm a pool guy myself.

00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:51.600
I like swimming.
- He goes,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.050
"I'll beat any of these
fucking queers in a pool."

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.877
- He goes, "Shave 'em
down, throw 'em in a pool,

00:17:54.877 --> 00:17:56.870
"see who gets there first."

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.200
Yeah man, it was fucking rough.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.250
That coach, and then the next year,

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.590
we had this like, cool old
black guy was our coach,

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.110
and I was like, "Hey, I
wanna play tight end."

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.370
and he was like, "Yeah,
what were you playing?"

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.067
and I was like, "Center" and
he was like, "Goddammit."

00:18:07.067 --> 00:18:08.570
'Cause he got the whole team,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.144
and he was like, "you guys are awful."

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:12.860
His nephew, Hakim was our running back,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.693
awesome!

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.900
Breaks his arm in the first
scrimmage of the season,

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.733
we go O and 8.

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.050
It just fucking,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.200
Hakim was awesome!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.100
And he breaks his arm and
like, "Hakim's out the season."

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.450
and you're like, "Goddammit!"

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.320
And then we just got lit the fuck up.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.020
We didn't lose as bad, but we got lit.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.340
Coach Oscar was so awesome,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.660
this old black dude named Oscar,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.709
and he's like, "Man, I
want you in the center,"

00:18:33.709 --> 00:18:34.770
and he's like, "Oh goddammit!"

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.194
Because he was tryna
re-correct everything.

00:18:37.194 --> 00:18:38.860
Oh man, that was brutal.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.920
- I like having a bad coach,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.250
doesn't know anything
about the game at all,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.118
he goes, "Dan, what do
you play on the team?"

00:18:43.118 --> 00:18:45.220
"He told me I play Goblin?"

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.287
- Yeah, "I play go-getter.

00:18:47.287 --> 00:18:49.500
"I don't think he knows what defense is."

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.550
- "Ball Smack-y Down-y
guy is what he said."

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.383
- He was just like,

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:55.750
he looked like the perfect football coach,

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.420
he was like a big fat dude
with monstrous calves,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.640
and he wore glasses and a hat
really well at the same time.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.930
- And his pants zipped, but then hooked.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.763
- Nice try,

00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:06.970
Yes, they did!

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.950
He has those gray gym,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.460
the fucking coach shorts.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.320
- Of course he did, Dan, they all do.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.280
And they make those in every size.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.540
- He was the nicest guy in the world.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.060
Now I'm realizing he was like 28,

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.230
and just didn't know football.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.347
- I'm starting to think
he may have molested me.

00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:24.400
- I'm thinking he had all
of us fuck each other.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.950
Yeah he, that was when
we lost 160 to zero.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:28.783
My mom was like,

00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:31.790
"I don't think your coach
knows what he's doing."

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:32.790
You're like, "Yeah we got lit up."

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.070
Yeah, those shorts,
from Dazed and Confused.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.770
Those are the exact one's he wore.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.600
Yeah, he would just be like--

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.433
- [Big Jay] Oh yeah.

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:40.970
- He was huge too, he was a big dude.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.803
You would think he would know--

00:19:41.803 --> 00:19:44.830
- The guy who yelled at me,
the guys who yelled at me at,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.683
was that fucking,

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.620
the guy was wearing those pants

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.360
that yelled at me, if I don't
get the light out of my ass,

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.430
he was gonna bite it out.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.300
- [Dan] Oh, alright.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.880
- Yeah that's when I quit.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.940
I faked an injury and left.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.773
I told you about when we were

00:19:55.773 --> 00:19:57.020
at football camp in high school

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.010
and we had this guy that
used to play football

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.560
at our high school come back as a coach,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.180
and he was an assistant coach or whatever,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.870
and we were playing at this football camp

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.930
in Kearney, Nebraska, and he got hammered

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.940
with all the coaches,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.850
and showed up for the morning
session still hammered.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.280
And he was like trying to motivate us,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.160
but it was just severely inappropriate.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.897
He's like, "If you guys don't love this,

00:20:15.897 --> 00:20:17.497
"if this shit aint making your dick hard,

00:20:17.497 --> 00:20:18.720
"I don't know what's wrong with you."

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.569
And everyone's like, "What?"

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:22.740
The whole time, he had chew in his mouth,

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.267
and he's like, "If your guys' dicks

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:27.031
"aren't rock hard right now to
go out and play these guys."

00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:29.157
And you're like, "Yeah no,
no, it's a different emotion.

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:31.377
"I think we're more angry
and ready to tackle.

00:20:31.377 --> 00:20:34.500
"I don't think we want
to fuck these guys."

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.781
It was a really weird thing.

00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:37.737
- "When you're on top of him,

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.470
"you want him looking up
at you letting him know

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.217
"that he's staring right into your eyes"

00:20:41.217 --> 00:20:43.240
- "I bet you want to--"
- "Y'all both won!"

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.717
- He goes, "I bet you guys
are just looking over there,

00:20:44.717 --> 00:20:47.347
"wanting to kiss their sweaty
neck under those helmets."

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:49.557
- "Just rubbing' those cups together,

00:20:49.557 --> 00:20:51.528
"feeling your ball hairs
get between the holes."

00:20:51.528 --> 00:20:54.528
(upbeat rock music)
