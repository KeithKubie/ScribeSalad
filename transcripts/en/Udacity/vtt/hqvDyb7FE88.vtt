00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.340
Well done.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.830
That's another practice
session in the books.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.950
Hopefully you're beginning to see how
everything you've learned fits together.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.350
Variables, structs, methods,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.020
all of these concepts are necessary to
solve problems and build great apps.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.390
We hope you're building confidence too.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.490
See you in the next session.
