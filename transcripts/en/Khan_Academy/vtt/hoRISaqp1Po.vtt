00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.930
With the graph of the
function f as an aid,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.960
evaluate the following limits.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.109
So the first one is the
limit as x approaches

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.440
3 of f of x minus f
of 3 over x minus 3.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.300
So let's think about x minus--
x equals 3 is right over here.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.920
This right over here is f
of 3, or we could say f of 3

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.410
is 1 right over here.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.580
That's the point 3 comma f of 3.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.200
And they're essentially
trying to find

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.790
the slope between an
arbitrary x and that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.210
point as that x gets
closer and closer to 3.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200
So we can imagine an
x that is above 3,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.490
that is, say, right over here.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.120
Well, if we're trying to find
the slope between this x comma

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.000
f of x and 3 comma
f of 3, we see

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.350
that it gets this
exact same form.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.730
Your end point is f of x.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.930
So it's f of x minus
f of 3 is your change

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.470
in the vertical axis.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.350
That's this distance
right over here.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.660
And we would divide
by your change

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.810
in the horizontal axis,
which is your change in x.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.850
And that's going
to be x minus 3.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.380
So that's the exact expression
that we have up here when

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.150
I picked this as an arbitrary x.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.680
And we see that that
slope, just by looking

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.890
at the line between
those two intervals,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.420
seems to be negative 2.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080
And the slope was the same
thing if we go the other side.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.420
If x was less than
3, then we also

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.090
would have a slope
of negative 2.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.890
Either way, we have a
slope of negative 2.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.720
And that's important
because this limit

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.550
is just the limit
as x approaches 3.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.540
So it can be as x approaches
3 from the positive direction

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.780
or from the negative direction.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
But in either case, the slope,
as we get closer and closer

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.027
to this point right over
here, is negative 2.

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.110
Now let's think about what
they're asking us here.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.626
So we have 8, f of 8.

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:55.280
So let's think.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.370
We have 8.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.240
This is 8 comma f of 8.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.380
So that's 8 comma f
of 8 right over there.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.480
And they have f of 8 plus h.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.165
So our temptation
might be to say, hey,

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.680
8 plus h is going to
be someplace out here.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.710
It's going to be
something larger than 8.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.950
But notice, they
have the limit as h

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.767
approaches 0 from the
negative direction.

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:19.600
So approaching 0 from
the negative direction

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.460
means you're coming
to 0 from below.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.380
You're at negative 1,
negative 0.5, negative 0.1,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.690
negative 0.0001.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.920
So h is actually going
to be a negative number.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.040
So 8 plus h would actually
be-- we could just

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.150
pick an arbitrary point.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.630
It could be something
like this right over here.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.120
So this might be the
value of 8 plus h.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.660
And this would be the
value of f of 8 plus h.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.870
So once again, they're
finding-- or this expression

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.550
is the slope between
these two points.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.680
And then we are taking the
limit as h approaches 0

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.980
from the negative direction.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.760
So as h gets closer
and closer to 0,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.920
this down here moves further
and further to the right.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.950
And these points move closer
and closer and closer together.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.450
So this is really
just an expression

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.930
of the slope of
the line, roughly--

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.210
and we see that it's constant.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.490
So what's the slope of the
line over this interval?

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.573
Well, you can just eyeball
it and see, well, look.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:24.390
Every time x changes by 1,
our f of x changes by 1.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.680
So the slope of the
line there is 1.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.640
It would have been a
completely different thing

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.050
if this said limit
as h approaches 0

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.570
from the positive direction.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.400
Then we would be looking
at points over here.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.190
And we would see that we would
slowly approach, essentially,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.058
a vertical slope, kind
of an infinite slope.
