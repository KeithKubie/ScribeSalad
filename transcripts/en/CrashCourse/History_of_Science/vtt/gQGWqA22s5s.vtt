00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.120
Who’s ready for more World War Two science?
No? No one?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.849
Well, this story is about all kinds of badness,
yes—but also a lot of incredible goodness.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.199
The history of science up until the Cold War
is often overshadowed by the Manhattan Project.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.320
But today we are going to talk about advances
in biomedicine, or healthcare based on a biological

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.180
understanding of human bodies and diseases.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.880
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.380
Many biomedical breakthroughs, like antibiotics,
were developed in the twentieth century, but

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.730
a few are much older.
The original wonder drug is a natural pain-relief

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.570
compound of the opiate class that is still
widely used today—morphine.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.260
A German pharmacist’s assistant named Friedrich
Sertürner isolated it around 1804.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.210
Morphine induces relaxation and sleepiness,
and too much can kill you. Aaaaand it’s

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.300
super addictive. But very effective and relatively
cheap!

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.450
Soon, a German company called Merck began
selling it. And in the 1850s, the hypodermic

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.880
needle was introduced.
Now, the last time we talked about medicine,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
exciting things were happening: namely, germs!
Most diseases are caused by germs.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.200
So, with a germ theory—not to mention a
cell theory, and vaccines, and beer—the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.820
life sciences in the late 1800s looked pretty
great.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.039
But… vaccines are slow, so if you’re dying
right now—maybe due to an infected war-wound—they

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.219
don’t work well.
And, they only work on certain diseases. Also,

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.900
there just weren’t that many vaccines, and
there were a lot of diseases. In fact, even

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.289
reliable diagnoses were a problem.
So what the life sciences had gained in theories

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.679
and models, they still lacked in applications.
Advances came in the form of chemical compounds

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.259
that had specific effects on specific physiological
systems.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.210
In 1907, the lab of German chemist Paul Ehrlich
created an arsenic compound sold under the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.439
name Salvarsan that was antimicrobial but
not toxic to humans.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.889
Ehrlich used Salvarsan to effectively treat
syphilis, which was a huge deal: the first

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:10.710
modern chemical therapeutic could treat one
of the biggest public health problems!

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.420
But Salvarsan didn’t work on late-stage
syphilis patients who suffered from general

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.950
paresis of the insane, or GPI. Which had very
serious symptoms, including delusions, and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.720
was fatal.
But in 1917, Austrian physician Julius Wagner-Jauregg

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.800
developed an effective therapy… which involved
infecting them with malaria. While weird,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.930
malaria-fever treatment for GPI gave hope
to people suffering terribly, and Wagner-Jauregg

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.490
won a Nobel for his efforts.
Another psychiatric discovery, in 1933, was

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.200
insulin shock therapy to treat schizophrenia
and other mental disorders: patients were

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.520
dosed with the hormone insulin, causing them
to go into shock and then a coma. It became

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.340
common in the 1940s and 50s. But this method
of inducing shock wasn’t alone; there were

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.240
several.
The most famous, invented in the 1930s, was

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.160
electroconvulsive treatment or ECT. Many people
have objected to ECT over the years, and the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.990
exact way it’s been used has changed. But
today, as a treatment for severe depression,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.010
it’s considered safe.
One pre-World War Two treatment that is no

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.040
longer used is lobotomy, or surgically cutting
connections in the brain’s prefrontal cortex.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.260
This left patients with reduced responsiveness
and awareness. They had literal brain damage,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.740
which could help control severe symptoms of
mental disorder.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.270
Lobotomies became common around 1935, first
in Europe, then in the United States. Initially,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.360
they were typical psychosurgeries, performed
in hospitals.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.030
But in 1945, neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman
figured out how to perform lobotomies using

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.900
an icepick. He practiced on a grapefruit at
home. And then he went on the road, popularizing

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.870
his much faster transorbital technique.
In the United States, 40,000 people were lobotomized.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.740
Were they all suffering from severe mental
disorders, and did they enjoy better lives

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.471
after the surgery? Some probably did.
But, unfortunately, in many cases, lobotomies

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:08.510
were used to make patients easier to manage,
or for even worse reasons. In 1977, Congress

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.620
investigated the history of the lobotomy,
concluding that it had often been used to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.400
harm minorities.
The biggest advancement in biomedicine at

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.499
the time was the development of antimicrobial
compounds, like Salvarsan.

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.020
In 1931, German chemists developed an effective
anti-malaria drug, mepacrine.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.509
Allowing medics to treat soldiers with malaria
helped open up much of the world’s equatorial

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.610
regions to combat during World War Two.
Even more revolutionary, Gerhard Domagk

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.289
—a researcher working in the
same lab that synthesized mepacrine—discovered

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.880
sulfanilamide,
the first drug that broadly treated a whole

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.180
bunch of diseases caused by bacteria. He was
awarded the Nobel in 1939… which he was

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.680
forced to give back, because Nazis.
Sulfanilamide was only the first of a whole

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.830
class of antibacterial drugs, the sulfonamides,
or sulfas. These were the first antibiotics.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.340
With them, doctors could quickly and cheaply
help thousands of patients—treating everything

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.860
from meningitis to gonorrhea to burns.
But most people today don’t go to the doctor

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.229
and ask for sulfas.
Because in 1928, in the basement laboratory

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.349
of St. Mary’s hospital in London, Scottish
physician and microbiologist Alexander Fleming

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.800
noticed, quite by accident, that some mold
growing in his lab seemed to kill some harmful

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.099
bacteria.
He cultured it and started experimenting.

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.349
Fleming discovered a whole new class of antibiotic
drugs—the penicillins—derived from that

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.530
mold, penicillium.
Alas—at first, his colleagues didn’t understand.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.379
Fleming wasn’t great at explaining his work,
and it took him years to convince them. A

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.219
few doctors used penicillin in the 1930s.
But it wasn’t until nearly ten years later

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.469
that penicillin became a “wonder drug.”
Again, Merck scaled up production, followed

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.759
by Pfizer. And again, World War Two drove
demand.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.159
The penicillins pretty much replaced the sulfas
during World War two, treating sexually transmitted

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.949
diseases, burns, heart infections, scarlet
fever, pneumonia, and infections of the skin,

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.100
mouth, and throat. Whole categories of disease
that had once been deadly became manageable.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.020
This is good news for me by the way because I am allergic to sulfas as I found out

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.660
when I took one and became a giant puff.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.920
Later drugs created based on the penicillins,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.639
starting with ampicillin in 1961, were even
more effective against more diseases.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.199
Fleming won the Nobel in 1945, sharing it
with two other scientists who had figured

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.909
out how to scale up production of the mold
to industrial levels—English pharmacologist

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.629
Howard Florey and German biochemist Ernst
Chain. They were all knighted.

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:39.190
So yay, more treatments for more diseases,
and doctors being knights. Unfortunately,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.639
one medical pioneer was definitely not treated
with this respect. Introduce us, ThoughtBubble:

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.650
African-American surgeon Charles Drew showed

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.699
enormous promise. He graduated from medical
school at McGill University in Montreal, Canada,

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:57.629
in 1933 and became an instructor at Howard
University in Washington, D.C., in 1935. A

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:00.849
year later, he became a surgical resident
at Freedmen’s Hospital.

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.819
And in 1938, Drew earned a Rockefeller Fellowship
to study at Columbia University and work at

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:12.330
Presbyterian Hospital. There, he became the
first African-American doctor of medical science.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.539
His doctoral thesis, “Banked Blood,” revolutionized
medicine.

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:21.559
Drew realized that blood plasma—the clear
part, without cells—lasts a lot longer than

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:27.140
whole blood. He worked out how to bank, or
store plasma for longer periods of time. He

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.039
also discovered that plasma can be dried and
rehydrated as needed.

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.840
Anticipating terrible casualties, and drawing

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.780
on lessons from the first World War, New York’s
Blood Transfusion Betterment Association met

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.271
with British physician John Scudder to formulate
a plan. Scudder had heard of Drew’s work

00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.779
on plasma and hired him as soon as he earned
his doctorate, in 1940.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:52.819
Drew’s new job was to coordinate Blood for
Britain. His team collected and processed

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:57.999
blood plasma from different hospitals in New
York, shipping it overseas to save Allied

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:01.009
lives.
A year later, Drew led another large-scale

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:05.400
blood project, this time for the American
Red Cross and the U.S. military. But there

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.380
was a catch: the military wanted Drew to segregate
the blood donated by African Americans from

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.860
that donated by whites. Understandably outraged,
Drew resigned after only a few months.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.699
By the end of 1941, when Drew returned to
Howard, he had created two of the first large

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.759
blood banks. But he was not a knight, and
his country was still so deeply racist that

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.740
even its official supply of lifesaving biomaterials
was segregated.====

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.120
In 1950, Drew died in a car accident. He was
only forty five years old.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.100
Thanks, Thoughtbubble. But this was far from
the worst offense in World War Two. The Nazis

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.690
also undertook systematic research on human
biology and medicine—all within the paradigm

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.139
of Rassenhygiene, or racial hygiene.
This was German eugenics: the application

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:54.310
of a distorted understanding of Darwinian
evolution to human society.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.560
The Nazis believed that certain human groups
were better than others, and that biology—not

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.709
nurture—determined everything. But they
wanted proof.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:07.750
In the 1920s, the racial hygienists had to
wait around. But with the Nazi takeover in

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.620
1933, they had the research material they
needed to understand the human body at a deep

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.970
level, in the form of Jewish people and others
whom the Nazi state didn’t consider fully

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.269
human.
During World War Two, Nazi scientists such

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:25.810
as Josef Mengele performed experiments on
humans in concentration camps. Among other

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:31.009
atrocities, Mengele conducted studies of genetics,
including twin studies, but killed subjects

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:35.210
afterwards, sending tissue samples back to
Berlin for further analysis.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.410
Like the Allies, the Nazis developed drugs.
But the Nazis weren’t sure if they should

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.250
focus on antibiotics, which kill bacteria,
or on homeopathic remedies, which are based

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.649
on the idea that a substance that causes disease
in a healthy person can cure similar symptoms

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:50.680
in a sick person.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.350
To conduct their tests, the Nazis simulated
brutal war injuries on concentration camp

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.160
prisoners and then tried to prevent infections
using different agents.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.700
Finally, the Nazis developed a robust euthanasia
program, or way of testing the cheapest, fastest

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.029
ways to kill the most people without causing
them to riot.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:12.490
Meanwhile, in occupied China, an infamous
group of biologists and chemists within the

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.759
Imperial Japanese Army called Unit 731 carried
out some similarly horrifying research.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.000
They cut patients open while they were still
alive, without anesthesia. They tested new

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.149
biological weapons. They tested the limits
of human resistance to hypothermia, or frostbite.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.480
It gets worse, but you get the idea.
When the war ended, the United States government

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.180
discovered the atrocities committed by the
Imperial Japanese doctors… And they cut

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.530
a deal: the U.S. would grant certain war criminals
immunity in exchange for their data.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:46.680
So where’s the goodness I talked about at the beginning of the episode? Well, after
World War Two, more drugs, medical technologies,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.170
and novel procedures emerged. For example,
in the 1950s, Jonas Salk and A. B. Sabin created

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.300
a polio vaccine, which was very good!
But the deeper point is that medicine—now

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.100
a global institution—had a long look at
itself. The vast majority of doctors and government

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.709
officials were absolutely sickened by the
revelations of the Doctors’ Trial of the

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:07.829
Nazis.
Doctors convened and created a new way of

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:13.160
handling medical research with human subjects,
the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. In fact,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.440
a whole new branch of philosophy, bioethics
was born.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.480
On the policy side, all human subjects research
in the U.S. now has to be approved by institutional

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.399
review boards or IRBs. It’s a long process
in which scientists and regulators scrutinize

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:32.980
what will or won’t be done in the name of
medicine, to whom, for what purpose. And it’s

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.949
one of the greatest, quietest moral wins in
the history of science.

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:41.660
Next time—we finally bring together Darwin
and Mendel in an intellectual super-group

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.860
called the Modern Synthesis. Don’t miss
it!

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.500
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:52.690
