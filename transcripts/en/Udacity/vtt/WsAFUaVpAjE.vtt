00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:03.784
The first thing we want to do, is what's called "procedural abstraction."

00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:05.585
This is a really powerful idea--

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:09.692
this is--one of the ways we avoid having to do things over and over again by hand,

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:11.338
is that we can write the code--

00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:13.658
write it once, and use it many times--

00:00:13.658 --> 00:00:16.817
changing the inputs to get different behaviors.

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.990
If you look at each segment of code here,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.874
these lines were copied exactly the same way.

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.037
We did the same thing, over and over again--

00:00:25.037 --> 00:00:27.173
the same five lines of code--

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:29.525
to find the start of a link in "page,"

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.356
to find the start and end quote

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:32.776
and then to extract the URL,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.975
and then to print the URL.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.019
The only thing that was different was the value of "page."

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.923
We kept updating the value of "page"--

00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:42.604
we did that as we went through the code--

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:45.116
we updated the value of "page" with this assignment

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:47.793
and, before this one, we updated the value of "page"

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:51.736
with this assignment.

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:54.693
So, the idea behind procedural abstraction, is that

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:56.885
anything that we're doing over and over again

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.709
we want to abstract--

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.176
we want to make it a procedure--

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.259
and we want to make the things that change, inputs.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:06.442
That means, instead of having to type in this code over and over again,

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:08.427
we want to make "page" an input--

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.540
"page" is the input; that's something that changes--

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.008
and we want to make the URL--

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.218
that's the result we want--

00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:18.871
an output.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.493
That's our goal, to turn this into a procedure,

00:01:20.493 --> 00:01:22.391
where "page" is the input--

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.842
we can do the same code, over and over again,

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.086
and every time we do it,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.708
we want to get this URL value as the output.
