00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.140
In rT traffic shaping, traffic is divided into T-bit

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.970
frames. And a flow can inject less than or

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.120
equal to r bits in any T-bit frame. If

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.090
the sender wants to send more than one packet

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.410
of r bits, it simply has to wait until

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.100
the next T-bit frame. A flow that obeys this

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.800
rule has what is known as an rT smooth

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.210
traffic shape. In the case of rT smooth traffic

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.030
shaping, one cannot send a packet that's larger

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.460
than r bits long. Unless T is very long,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.380
the maximum packet size may be very small.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.110
So the range of behaviors is typically limited to

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.930
fixed rate flows. Variable flows have to request

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.730
data rates that are equal to the peak rate,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.020
which is incredibly wasteful. If you have to

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.600
configure the shaper such that the average must support

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.510
whatever peak rate the variable rate flow may send.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.670
The rT traffic shaper is slightly relaxed from a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.620
simple leaky bucket because rather than sending one packet

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.543
every time unit, the flow can send a certain

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.820
number of bits every time unit. Now there's a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.750
question of what to do when a flow exceeds

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.960
a a particular rate. And typically what's done is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.890
that if a flow exceeds it's rate, the excess

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.580
packets in that flow are given a lower

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.430
priority. And if the network is heavily loaded or

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.160
congested, the packets from a flow that exceeds a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.890
rate may be preferentially dropped. Priorities might be assigned

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550
at the sender, or at the network. At the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.640
sender, the application may mark its own packet, since

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.720
the application knows best which packets may be less

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.850
important. In the network, the routers may mark packets

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.200
with a lower priority, which is sometimes called policing.
