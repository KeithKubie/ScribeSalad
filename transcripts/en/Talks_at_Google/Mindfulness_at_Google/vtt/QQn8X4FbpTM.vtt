[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:10.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.660
JONATHAN BERENT: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.310
My name is Jonathan Berent,
and I'll be your host today.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.800
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.830
Thanks to those that are on
the livestream today as well.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.530
We live in dynamic times.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.760
Never before has a generation
been so assaulted by the images

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.310
from the media, stories
from the internet

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.960
that seem to touch a
nerve in us personally.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.230
Seems like every week, whether
you are black or white,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.030
straight or gay, from
a rich background

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.110
or a poor background,
there's a story

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.820
that elicits a reaction in us.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.120
But there is hope.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.590
As long as the human spirit
is alive on this planet,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.390
there will always be hope.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.100
We only have to think of names
like Mahatma Gandhi or Mother

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.570
Teresa, now Saint Teresa, Anne
Frank or Martin Luther King,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.250
to know that it just takes a
single, passionate individual

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.270
who has the courage to
risk it all to bring

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.190
the light into this world.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.990
If you would, picture one of
their iconic faces in your mind

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.780
right now.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.940
Just take a moment.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.470
Bring one to mind.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.810
What do you notice inside?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.580
Is it courage,
inspiration, love?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.230
Before them, there had been
numerous beacons of change

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.250
that have walked from
all walks of life.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.070
Milarepa was a Tibetan monk
who was very revengeful

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.060
in his youth, but
then he became one

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.860
of Tibet's most loved and
cherished figures of history.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.930
Saint Francis of Assisi was
a rich, disillusion young man

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.470
who left it all to pursue a life
of compassion and generosity

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.900
towards everyone.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.220
The prophet Muhammad was
also born into a noble family

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.620
and grew up to be rich but
then turned contemplative.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.080
What these three individuals
have in common is they

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.520
all had the courage to
do the inner work first

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.000
before they brought
outer change.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.890
Let's stop there for a minute.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.710
Speaking of inner
work, how many of you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.150
might have had a little
twinge of emotion

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.430
when I said one of these names?

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.362
Why?

00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:26.070
Well, these names,
these last three ones,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.048
are associated with
world religions.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:30.672
And some of these religions have
been associated with violence.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.710
We're not talking
about religion today.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.770
We're not talking about
spirituality today.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.340
You can all breathe
a sigh of relief.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.790
We are talking about taking a
moment to reflect on the times

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.190
that we live in and what
they require of us, what they

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.460
require of us as an individuals
and what they require

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.730
of us as a company, one of
the most influential companies

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.730
on the planet.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.230
If you felt a twinge
of emotion when

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.280
I mentioned one of these names
or even the word "religion,"

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.630
that's normal.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.310
If you feel outraged by
the things you see on TV

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.936
or read in the
newspaper, that's normal.

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:11.310
If you have passionate feelings
about the election that's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.219
coming up in a
month, that's normal.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.760
In fact, if you don't have some
of those passionate feelings,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.843
I'd say that's not normal.

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:18.118
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.910
However, we have to learn
to deal with these emotions.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400
We have to learn
to find ways that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.640
integrate our thoughts and our
emotions more constructively

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.090
so we can more skillfully
navigate these dynamic times

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.870
so we can have impact.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.250
Today we hope to give you both
the permission and the tools

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.900
to do just that.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.740
Sadhguru is a realized
yogi and mystic.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.380
He's a man whose passion spills
into everything he touches,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.250
including, I learned
yesterday, golf.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.390
With a keen mind and
an unbounded heart,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.239
his presence alone
gives you a taste

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.780
of what the natural
state of the mind

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.394
can experience in terms of
love and joy and freedom.

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:03.060
Sadhguru's vision to
transform the world

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.567
has been unfolding
over the last 30 years.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.150
The Isha Foundation,
which he started,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.480
has numerous programs to
promote inclusive culture

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.640
and establish global harmony.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.880
Named one of India's 50 most
influential individuals,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.300
he has deeply touched the
lives of millions worldwide.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.570
He has spoken at forums
like the United Nations

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.370
and humble villages
throughout India.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.510
He's equally known for his
transformational yoga programs,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.910
as well as his large-scale
social projects.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.290
The projects address things
like quality education

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.730
for the poor, environmental
stewardship, holistic health,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.210
peace, and well-being.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.030
Sadhguru says joy is our
nature, misery our own making.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.720
This is a provocative
statement that he addresses

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.240
in his new book, "Inner
Engineering, a Yogi's Guide

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.400
to Joy," which there will
be a few copies for sale

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.551
in the back.

00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.051
Sadhguru.

00:04:55.051 --> 00:05:01.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.354
SADHGURU: You don't
mind if I cross my legs?

00:05:05.354 --> 00:05:06.520
JONATHAN BERENT: No, please.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.472
SADHGURU: My brains don't
work if I don't cross my legs.

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:11.180
JONATHAN BERENT: Your
brain doesn't work?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.780
SADHGURU: Yeah. [CHUCKLING]

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.280
JONATHAN BERENT:
Yeah, all right.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.780
SADHGURU: [CHUCKLING]

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:28.780
JONATHAN BERENT: Thank you
so much for joining us today,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.300
Sadhguru.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.050
I think the audience is
very interested in what

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.650
you have to say.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.690
I guess to start, they define
inclusive consciousness.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.760
I'd love to hear
your thoughts on--

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.260
SADHGURU: They
did not define it.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.720
JONATHAN BERENT: They did not.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.370
OK, well I was just going
to ask you what's missing.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.030
So you can start.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:55.800
SADHGURU: With all due respect,
they spoke about intent,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.760
right intent.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.290
They spoke about the
right kind of thoughts,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.340
Emotions, attitudes, and
to some extent actions.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.040
There is no
consciousness in this.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.040
If we are understanding
that the way we think,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.690
feel, and act is of
a consciousness, no.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.920
It is lie.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.990
We are mistaking a plant.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.090
We are mistaking the
flower for the soil.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.183
We are mistaking
expressions for the source.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.730
This is something that's
happening everywhere,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.570
not just here.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.270
People think by
changing attitudes,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.670
their consciousness will change.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.340
No.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.400
By changing attitudes,
certain actions

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.550
will change-- yes,
positive, beneficial.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.100
But it is not truly
transformative.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.500
Change will happen.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.450
Transformation will not happen.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.330
If I have to define a
distinction between change

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.780
and transformation, change
means the residue of the past

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.760
will still remain.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.480
A transformation means
nothing of the past

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.280
will remain, which is
what is needed today

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.390
if you want to
create a new world,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.790
if you want a new generation
to have a fresh life.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.550
It's been expressed
in so many ways.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.930
Being in this part of the world,
what their family are with,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.347
generally, someone said,
leave the dead to the dead.

00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:35.263
It's very significant.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.740
This is not coming
out of recklessness.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.700
This is not coming
out of unconcern.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.410
But this is coming
with the concern

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.300
that you must be a fresh life.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.080
You can learn many
things from the past

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.290
about how to conduct yourself.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.610
But there is nothing to learn
from the past about how to be.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.060
Because you are a
complete life by yourself.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.200
You don't have to learn how
to be a life from the past.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.730
Maybe you have to learn
how to be a good engineer.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.480
Maybe you have to learn
how to be something else

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.160
in the society from the past.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.680
But you don't have to learn
how to be a life from the past,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.410
because past has
nothing to do with this.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.250
This is a fresh life, and
this is a complete life.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.640
Consciousness is that
dimension, which is

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.100
the very source of who we are.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.650
Our intentions, our actions,
our thoughts, and our attitudes

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.970
are a consequence of that.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.400
Or in other words, we are
trying to fix the consequence

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.830
without fixing the source.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.240
Now all these distinctions
of variety of things

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.860
that they said, gender
discriminations,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:04.060
racial discriminations,
every kind, OK?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.326
Somebody is Hindu,
somebody is a Muslim,

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:09.200
somebody is a Googler--
it becomes a religion

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.576
after some time, believe me.

00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:12.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.710
Second generation, they
will become a religion

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.910
by themselves.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.810
Yes.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.850
I'm saying you will see a
football match going on.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.870
It's like a religion,
two different clubs.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.610
They're willing to fight
and kill each other.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:34.800
Just a game. [CHUCKLING] So
where does this come from?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.830
See, the nature of
being human is this.

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.240
If you give me two minutes.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.760
There are four
dimensions of our mind.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.160
In modern societies, the
nature of our education

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.500
has constipated our
mind in such a way

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.310
because we are just largely
using just one dimension,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.850
which we call as the intellect.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.140
The other dimensions
of mind, if I

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.530
have to use Indian
terminology, it

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:18.750
means buddhi, ahankara,
manas, and chitta.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.820
What buddhi means
is the intellect.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.940
You do what you want.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:28.810
The nature of the intellect is
to slice things open and see.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.180
If you leave the world in
the hands of your intellect,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.870
your intellect will chop
it into a million pieces

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.630
and will want to chop it
into further micro pieces

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.330
and want to chop it into
further micro-micro pieces,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.760
depending upon how
sharp your intellect is.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.660
The sharper your intellect,
the more you dissect the world.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.050
You cannot stop it, because that
is the nature of the intellect.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.870
And it's good.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.520
So you must apply
intellect only to know

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.860
the material aspects of life.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.900
You can't know life this way.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.617
If I want to know you,
can I dissect you?

00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:04.450
JONATHAN BERENT: No.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:11.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:17.795
SADHGURU: But if a doctor wants
to know some aspect of you,

00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:20.530
materially what's wrong with
you, he will take a biopsy.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.910
And in a way, he opens
it up and looks at it.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.250
It's OK on that level.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.180
But I can't know you as a
person by dissecting you.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.930
I can't know you as a
life by dissecting you.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.540
I can know a part
of your body maybe.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.050
Similarly, I can know parts of
the world to make use of it.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.180
But I can't know life as such.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.490
So intellect has
been over-energized

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.880
in the last 100, 150 years.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.710
This is a European impact on
the rest of the world, where we

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.110
think our thought is supreme.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.320
Someone went to the extent
of saying, I think so I exist

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.860
or whatever.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.318
I want to ask all of
you a simple question.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.360
Tell me, is it because
we exist we may think?

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.240
Or is it because
we think we exist?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.280
Which way is it?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.610
Hello?

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.090
Because we exist, we may
think, because people

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.630
are in such a state of
mental diarrhea all the time.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.120
Nonstop it's going on.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.810
They think it's more of an
existence than existence.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.620
But my head is
all the time empty

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.970
unless I want to
think about something.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.520
So I know a thought
is not necessary.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.550
I can just live here
without a thought.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.750
When I want, I will think.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.370
Otherwise, I'll keep quiet.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.740
Just like my hand--
if I want to use it,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.220
otherwise I keep it here.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.690
Similarly, you must be able
to do this with your mind.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.929
Just because you lost control
over your mind and you think

00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:54.470
it's everything
because it's entering

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.803
into every aspect of your
life where it has no business.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.700
Thought has been
over-energized by people.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.750
And the very nature of the
thought is such that if you

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.170
think it must be logical,
it cannot be any other way.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.660
Well, what somebody is thinking
may look illogical to you,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.460
but they have found
their own logic.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.100
The most extreme person
that you have met,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.040
within himself or herself,
they have their own logic.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.460
Isn't it so?

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.740
They're not speaking illogically
as far as they're concerned.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.010
They have found their
own kind of logic.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.950
Logic means it needs two.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.300
Logic means it needs division.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.930
Now logically you're
trying to arrive

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.320
at inclusive consciousness.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.620
It's not going to happen.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.025
Because you're using
a knife to stitch.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.100
This is not going to work.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.890
If you use a knife to
cut, it's efficient.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.230
You use a knife to
stitch things together,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.630
you will only tear
it up further.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.110
So my thought and
your thought, I

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.870
am telling you, whatever
great meetings you have-- I've

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.380
been to every kind of peace
conference on the planet.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.102
What happens there?

00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:09.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.888
It's just short of war.

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:14.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.000
After some time, it heats up.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.720
But on the second day
anyway, it's all over.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.886
They all get drunk in the
evening, and they go home.

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:21.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.910
If you make them stay
there for a week,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.920
I'm telling you right there,
there will be a battle.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.120
Yes, it is true.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.050
I'm not saying this
with any disdain.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.310
I made a sincere
effort to participate

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.080
in all these
conferences at one time,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.360
believing they're
going to lead to peace.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.420
But eight years ago, I decided
I will again go to these events,

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.608
because people are professional
conference attendees.

00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:45.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.250
They're making a
living out of it.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.530
It's not about peace.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.700
So the next dimension
of intelligence

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.500
is called as ahankara.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.660
Ahankara means identity.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.820
This is important.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.430
In modern societies, we have
not cultured our children

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.070
to culture their identity.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.310
When I say identity, the
fundamental identity for you

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.200
is always your body.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.070
There's a racial thing that
concerns him and concerns

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.620
all of us.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.128
I'm darker than him, you know.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.900
I face it all the
time, joyfully.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.200
But I face it everywhere I go.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.030
I have extra features which
make me further discriminated.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.700
But our first identity
is with the body.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.840
When we identify with the
body, the color of the skin

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.580
also becomes part of it.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.370
Why do we identify
with the body?

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.370
Because our experience
is limited to this.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.130
If you say me, you
mean this, isn't it?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.760
Because you experience of
life is limited to this,

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.620
naturally you are identified
with this, and this is you,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.980
and this is how you look.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.970
Somebody looks so
different, whether in gender

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:15.160
or because of race or because of
maybe just fashion-- who knows

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.260
what makes them different?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.350
But suddenly, this
is me, that's you.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.200
It's established.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.420
But we sit here in this hall.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.440
Whatever the color of our
skin, whatever our religion,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.680
whatever our agenda, we
are inhaling and exhaling

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.730
the same air.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.820
But we have no issue.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.510
Body has no problem.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.310
But the identity has a problem.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.970
You are identified
with something.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.720
We have not cultured
our children

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.360
right from an early
age that your identity

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.665
should be universal.

00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:55.220
This is something in
India traditionally.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.500
Before you start
education for a child,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.270
there is something
called [INAUDIBLE],

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.830
where the first chant
that they must do

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:07.079
is that my identification
is with the entire cosmos.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.700
Without this, you should not
give education to a child.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.550
That is the understanding.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.190
Because education is
seen as an empowerment.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.079
You should not
empower a person who

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.700
has limited identifications.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.089
Because it doesn't
matter whether it's

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.770
of individual nature or
of family or of community

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.970
or race, religion, nation.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.030
It doesn't matter.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.370
Once you have limited identity,
you will cause disharmony.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.290
You will cause cruel
things thinking

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.990
you're doing the right thing.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:44.350
I know the debate always goes
to ISIS and things like this.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.881
I want you to understand this.

00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.600
These people, looking
at their actions,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.730
you may be sitting here-- I know
I'm getting into a minefield.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.100
Sitting here, all of us think,
these are horrible people.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.750
But you must understand this.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.170
They believe they're
doing the greatest thing

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.840
that a human being can do.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.540
They're working for God.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.412
There can be no better employer.

00:18:06.412 --> 00:18:07.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.336
Not Google-- God.

00:18:09.336 --> 00:18:11.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.294
JONATHAN BERENT: Who
you've never prayed to.

00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:14.960
SADHGURU: [CHUCKLING]
That's my problem.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.140
What I'm saying, you
should have seen this.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.310
I'm sure you guys
can Google anything.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:28.170
You must see there is a press
meet that the Afghan Taliban is

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.410
conducting with the
international media

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.180
just before the United
States invaded Afghanistan.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.320
All these young guys with long
beards and big, big turbans,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.910
they're all sitting like this.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.290
And they're asking questions.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.820
Just then they bomb
that Buddha statue,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.770
and they made this thing
that girls should not

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.660
go to school and
many other things.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.860
So these kind of
questions are coming.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:59.310
Whatever you ask them, they say,
in our holy book, our prophet,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.860
our God said this, this, this.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.370
We're just doing that.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.950
I was just watching those
guys, I had tears in my eyes.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.250
These are wonderful guys.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.690
These are guys who
are willing to die

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.410
for what they believe in.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.690
But they've been screwed
up by the scriptures.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.900
Yes, these are
wonderful people who

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.810
are willing to die for what they
think is that right, all right?

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.120
A man who is willing to
die for what he thinks

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.520
is right is a great man.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.130
But look at the
consequence, simply

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.240
because of limited identity.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.100
So there's ahankara.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.330
This identity is what
wills the intellect.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.390
If you hold the right
identity, from an early age

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.540
if it's brought into us
that your identity is

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.960
with the entire
cosmos-- because nothing

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.270
happens here without
everything's involvement

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.360
in you.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.230
We are sitting on this
round planet, which

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.320
is spinning and moving
at a great speed

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.490
in the middle of nowhere.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.510
You don't know where it begins,
where it ends, this thing.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.870
And look at us sitting
here and talking.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:05.820
How many forces-- how many
forces in the existence

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.110
are keeping you and me
in place on this chair?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.440
So there is no way we can exist
without the involvement of all

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.550
this.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.920
But talking about
this intellectually

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.070
is not going to
help, because you

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.110
try to understand
intellectually,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.390
you're using a knife.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.170
Further you will divide.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.220
So there is another dimension
of intelligence within you,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.050
which can make you come
to an experience of this.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.570
The next dimension
of intelligence

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.440
is called as manas.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.120
Manas means a huge
silo of memory.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.640
There are eight types
of memory in this.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.470
I will just name them.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.425
I'm not going through this.

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:45.810
There's eight types
of memory are referred

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:53.170
to as elemental memory, atomic
memory, evolutionary memory,

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:59.940
karmic memory, sensory memory,
and in the karmic memory

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.800
there are two types.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.740
One is called [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.670
That is a bank of memory,
which determines the very shape

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.010
and size of your body.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.990
There's another one which
is right now in play, so two

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.920
dimensions of karmic memory.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.590
Inarticulate memory,
that there is

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.180
a memory but you
can never articulate

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.717
but it's finding expression.

00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:19.550
When you see a chair,
you know this is where

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.914
you should sit, not there.

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:22.580
You didn't think about
it, because there

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.020
is a memory in you that
this is where you must sit.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.480
When you see a glass, you know
this is how you must hold.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.510
This is not simple.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.300
Without this knowledge,
you cannot build this.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.010
There is an enormous
memory which

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.720
allows you to do almost
everything automatically.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.140
Because an inarticulate memory
is constantly in action.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.930
And that is articulate
memory, which

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.530
is a very minuscule
part of your memory.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.280
The next dimension of
intelligence is most important.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.830
This is called as chitta.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.340
This is an intelligence
without an iota of memory

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.170
in it, unsullied by memory.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.890
See, memory means a boundary.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.260
You guys are always
dealing with information.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.740
Today you're in technology.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.040
I think memory does
not mean what's here.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.940
Memory means-- chh--
all over the place.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.125
Memory is a boundary.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.890
What I know is
always a boundary.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.590
What I do not know is a
limitless possibility,

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.670
isn't it?

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.600
We have misunderstood
the power of ignorance.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.620
[CHUCKLING]

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.630
Our knowledge is always
bound within boundaries.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.040
Our ignorance is boundless.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.000
So always in the
yogic system, we

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.560
identify with our ignorance,
never with our knowledge.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.520
This is something we must
do in a technology company.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.760
Because that's where
the possibility is.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.380
That is where the new terrain
is, in your ignorance,

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.760
not in your knowledge.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.680
So chitta is
unsullied by memory.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.640
It's just pure intelligence.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.310
Right now, if you eat an apple,
it turns into a human being.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.300
You cannot do it
with your brains.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.520
Even your brains were created
by what you eat, isn't it?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.750
There is an
intelligence here, which

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.790
is capable of transforming
anything to this, because it

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.880
is making use of the
memory and the manas

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.220
and making this happen.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.370
But the most important dimension
of your intelligence is chitta.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.100
In today's education systems,
in today's social conditions,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.060
there is no effort
to dip into deeper

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.970
dimensions of our intelligence.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.630
We're just too enamored
with our own intellect

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.414
and now using this knife
to stitch everything.

00:23:33.414 --> 00:23:35.830
JONATHAN BERENT: Well, you
should know that even at Google

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.610
when we interview people,
we have something called GCA

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.700
that we look for, which is
General Cognitive Ability.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.230
I suppose that that would fall
into that intellect dimension.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.940
Most of us weren't raised where
we were told from an early age

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.460
to identify with the cosmos.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.700
So is there any hope for us?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.680
Or are we lost?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.660
SADHGURU: See, identifying
with the cosmos is just

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.770
another thought.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.100
As a thought, it
doesn't do much.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.900
It makes people a
little airy brained

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.480
and they'll start acting funny.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.110
You become New Agey.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.047
You know, I love the cosmos.

00:24:10.047 --> 00:24:11.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.420
It's very easy to
love the cosmos

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.770
because it's not here with you.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:17.160
If you've got to love
somebody next to you,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.201
there's lots of problems.

00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:20.276
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.190
See, this wanting to
set up boundaries,

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.140
the instinct of wanting to
set up boundaries, is so deep.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.320
You see a dog peeing
all over the place

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.460
not because he has
some urinary problem.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.046
He's building a kingdom.

00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:38.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.190
It's a pee kingdom, but
it's a kingdom, all right?

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.570
He's building a kingdom.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.980
Every human being is
also doing the same thing

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.110
because there are two
dimensions of your intelligence.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:53.390
One is designed to
create self-preservation.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.700
One aspect of your
intelligence is

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.980
designed for self-preservation,
which is your intellect.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.410
The chitta, that dimension
of the intelligence

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.770
is designed to make you expand.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.520
Once you have come
as a human being,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.760
this is your issue
fundamentally.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.450
Whoever you are, whatever you
are right now in your life,

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.947
you want to be something more.

00:25:16.947 --> 00:25:19.530
If that something more happens,
you want to be something more.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.113
If that something more happens,
you want to be something more.

00:25:22.113 --> 00:25:25.100
I'm sure you guys want to
set up Google Maps for Mars.

00:25:27.837 --> 00:25:29.670
Yes, if that happens
for the entire universe

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.980
if it's possible.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.660
Because this is the
nature of being human.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.070
There is one dimension which
always wants to expand.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.300
Another dimension always
wants to build walls.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.300
You build a wall.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.720
You feel safe.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.950
After two days, you
feel you understand

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.220
the walls of
self-preservation are also

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.190
the walls of self-imprisonment.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.810
You want to break
it, you break it,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.450
and you put a new wall there,
and you think this is great,

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:56.220
this is freedom.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.280
After some time, you
feel that's not it,

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.850
and you want to expand it.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.590
These two dimensions are
not opposing each other.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.380
They're are not diametrically
opposite to each other.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.650
They are complementary.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.480
There is only one thing about
you which needs preservation.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.780
That's your physicality.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.020
This body must be preserved,
because if you break it,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.960
you can't fix it.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.680
Everything else
in you right now--

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.770
suppose I take out all your
thoughts, all your emotions,

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.290
all your ideas, all your
philosophies, all your belief

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:29.220
systems, and trashed them right
here, break them into pieces.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.660
You can come up with a
fresh start, fresh emotions,

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.740
fresh belief systems, fresh
philosophies just like that.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.410
So all those must
be every day put

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.610
into the-- what you call
them-- the shredder.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.090
You must have a pulverizer,
because shredder

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.410
means they'll go again,
pick it up, and fix it.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.960
You must have a pulverizer for
yourself before you go to bed.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.570
Today's ideas, today's
thoughts, today's

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.890
belief systems,
today's experiences,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.589
you must leave the
dead to the dead.

00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:00.005
JONATHAN BERENT:
Let me challenge.

00:27:00.005 --> 00:27:00.800
Let me challenge that.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.240
Because I thought something
that [INAUDIBLE] said

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.620
was very interesting.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.760
And she said almost the
wound becomes the healer.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.269
Or sometimes you hear the
wounded become the healer.

00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:12.060
So you can take some
of that, can't you not

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.590
transform some of those things
that have been difficult

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.370
and use that energy,
use your intellect

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.221
to do something for good.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.510
SADHGURU: So the experience
of life can cause two things.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.130
All this is nice when
things, small things happen.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.190
When really major
things happen to you,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.260
the wounds of so big
for people that they

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.770
don't heal in a lifetime,
many of them, OK?

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.050
So the choice is just this.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.280
The experience of life,
whatever happens to us,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.360
you can either make it into
your wound or into wisdom.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.680
You can either become wise
or you can become wounded.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.080
If you become wise, you
will become a solution.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.490
If you become wounded, you will
also become one more problem.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.720
It's a choice we have.

00:28:11.822 --> 00:28:14.030
JONATHAN BERENT: So where
does this wisdom come from?

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.180
How do we access--
if we're so used

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.966
to using one of these
four, and probably

00:28:18.966 --> 00:28:20.340
like most people
in the audience,

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.541
I wasn't even aware that there
are these other dimensions,

00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:24.540
what's a starting point?

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.820
What's a way to access
beyond the intellect?

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.840
SADHGURU: See, it's like this.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.230
Right now there is
water in this glass.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.450
This is definitely not you.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.290
Yes?

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.960
But if you drink
it, it becomes you.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.280
What is it that you
did with this water

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.970
that something that's
not you became you?

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.840
When you say inclusiveness, this
is all you're talking about,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.310
something that is not you.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.660
You want to make it a part
of you in some way, isn't it?

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.280
So this is right now not you.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.330
But if you drink
it, it becomes you.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.950
So what is it that
happened technically

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.470
for you, peace, justice?

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:08.850
Right now I'm asking you--
you take your right hand,

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.790
all of you.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.540
Take your right hand and
touch your left hand.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.170
Is that you?

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:15.900
Hello?

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.110
Touch the chair on
which you're sitting.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.710
Is that you?

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.910
How do you know this?

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.010
What is the basis of this?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.825
How do you know this is
me and this is not me?

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.100
Here there are sensations.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.790
Here there are no sensations.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.600
Or in other words,
what you are saying

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.620
is, whatever is in the
boundaries of my sensation

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.140
is me, whatever it is outside
the boundaries of my sensation

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.650
is not me, isn't it?

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.180
Right now this is not me.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.650
If I drink it and include
it into the boundaries

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:53.100
of my sensation, this
becomes me, isn't it?

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.230
Now, the boundaries
of your sensations

00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:00.390
are such that if you make your
life energies very exuberant,

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.720
you will see they will expand.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.760
If it happened, you suppose--
it should have happened

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.170
to many of you-- there
was a moment in your life

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:13.200
when you felt so joyful
tears came to you.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.216
Has it happened to you?

00:30:15.216 --> 00:30:18.640
You were so joyful or
loving tears came to you.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.980
At such a moment, if
you take your hand

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.170
and just put it six to eight
inches away from your body

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.470
right here, you will
feel sensations.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.340
If such things did
not happen to you,

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.850
I can do something
horrible to you

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.576
so that you
experience something.

00:30:32.576 --> 00:30:36.900
[CHUCKLING] We can chop
off your right leg.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.610
If you chop off your right
leg, the leg is gone,

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.100
but still the sense of
the leg may remain intact

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.580
for a period of time.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.700
You've heard of
this phantom leg.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.450
Leg is physical.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.360
Leg is gone.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.080
But the sensory
leg is still there.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.120
This means sensory body
has a structure of its own.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.220
If your energies become
very vibrant and exuberant

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.380
within you, your
sensory body expands.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.890
Suppose my sensory body
became as big as this.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.910
Now you'll become a part
of me and my experience.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.080
If it became as
big as this hall,

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.400
all these people become a
part of me and my experience.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.900
Because my sensory
body has stretched.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.430
We can do a small experiment.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.350
You OK to be a Guinea?

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.510
Hello?

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.094
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:24.094 --> 00:31:26.218
SADHGURU: What we will do
is-- with you eyes closed

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:28.160
you have to do this, but
right now observe me.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.340
What do you do is
with your eyes closed,

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.460
just rub this briskly like this
for two minutes, let me say,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.585
one minute-- briskly.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.540
OK, keep your eyes closed,
and just hold your thumbs

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.939
three to four inches away
from each other with your eyes

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:06.438
closed.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.800
Something happening
between your hands?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.830
Hello?

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.090
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.970
SADHGURU: OK, please
open your eyes.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.900
So just a little
bit of rubbing-- you

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.520
didn't do it for a minute,
either, just 20 seconds.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.720
You rub it, and suddenly
something happening

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.210
between these two hands, simply
because of vigorous movement

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.400
the sensory body has expanded.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.070
You can feel something
happening right here.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.622
You know why people are rubbing
each other all the time?

00:32:39.622 --> 00:32:40.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.040
It's an effort.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.050
It's an effort to include
someone who is not

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.040
a part of you as yourself.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.730
If this happens--
[LAUGHING] If this

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.110
happens in a very
basic, physical level,

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.550
we call this sexuality.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.200
If it happens emotionally,
we call this love.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.680
If it happens mentally, it gets
labeled as greed and ambition

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.120
and conquest.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.440
If it happens on the level
of your sensory body,

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.430
we call this yoga.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:17.240
Now, yoga means union.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.350
Union does not mean
you cause the union.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.330
Anyway, this happening is one.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.950
You are allowed yourself
to experience it.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.070
That means the walls
of self-preservation

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.760
you loosened up a
little bit, that's all.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.640
Why you want somebody
close to you,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.950
why you want a loud one
in your life is somewhere

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.640
you want to loosen the
walls of self-preservation

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.490
where you don't have to worry
about protecting yourself.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.680
Suddenly you feel one with them.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.190
And once you feel one
with them, in some way

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.270
you want to be in
touch with them.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.360
Because you're trying to loosen
up your sensory body in such

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.230
a way that you can experience
that which is not a part of you

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:00.950
as a part of yourself.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:04.770
Now, this need not limit it
to be one person or anything

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.640
like that.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.080
This need not be
biologically connected.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.560
If you can sit here with your
life at its peak of exuberance,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.929
you will experience the
whole universe as yourself.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.270
Then we say you are a yogi.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.150
JONATHAN BERENT: And you had
that experience 34 years ago.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.409
You talked about it a
little bit yesterday.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.870
I'm just curious
for those of us that

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.380
haven't had a peak
experience where we've

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:38.030
had this sense of union, what
advice, what step would you

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.834
take if we are of the place
where we think, all right,

00:34:40.834 --> 00:34:42.000
I'm willing to try this out.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.060
I'm a skeptic.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.370
I don't know what
the sensory body is.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.230
I had a little taste of it here.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.830
What would be the next step if
we wanted to try for ourselves?

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:56.070
SADHGURU: Let's describe
what is being skeptic.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:35:01.530
Being a skeptic means you don't
believe anything unless it

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.290
truly makes sense to you.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.535
Most people are just
downright suspicious.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.340
But they think they're skeptics.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.110
They don't qualify as skeptics.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.260
They're just suspicious
about everything.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.320
This comes from a
certain fear within you

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.870
that everything around
you can be wrong.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.700
Suspicion means you made a
conclusion about something

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.220
that you do not know.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.260
Believing something positively
or believing something

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.350
negatively is not different.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.350
They're the same things.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.570
You believe something
that you do not know.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:39.270
Skeptic means whatever I
do not know, I do not know.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.190
I don't assume
things in my life.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.490
What I know, I know.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.780
I think everybody should
come to this much sense

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.190
and straightness in our life,
that what I know, I know,

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.720
what I do not know,
I do not know.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.560
It's perfectly fine.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.210
"I do not know" is a
tremendous possibility.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.980
Only if you see "I do
not know," the longing

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.530
to know, seeking to know, and
the possibility of knowing

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.590
arises.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.640
So if you are a skeptic,
you are an ideal candidate.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.547
If you're a believer,
we have to debrief you.

00:36:10.547 --> 00:36:12.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.737
JONATHAN BERENT: Get
the shredder out.

00:36:14.737 --> 00:36:16.570
SADHGURU: Because you
assume too many things

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:17.680
that you do not know.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.280
You know the
geography of heaven,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.310
though you can't operate
the local Google map.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.677
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:26.002 --> 00:36:28.210
JONATHAN BERENT: OK, well,
we'll be taking questions,

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.584
so be thinking
about the question

00:36:29.584 --> 00:36:30.710
you might want to have.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.260
I think one more
question I want to ask

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:38.320
is, how do we-- we've been
talking about some things that

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:38.880
are very big.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.360
I think they're promising.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.660
But yet think about the
conversation we had earlier.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.870
And how do we tie these
two things together?

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.290
How do they relate in your mind?

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.790
SADHGURU: Those of you
who are interested,

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.060
because right now we
must understand this.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.140
Your intellect needs data
to function-- yes or no?

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:56.915
Hello?

00:36:56.915 --> 00:36:58.280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.540
Without data, your
intellect is useless.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.380
It needs data.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.290
That's why you guys
are in the business.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.520
Everybody knows
everything in the universe

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.150
right now, not because
they went there and saw it.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.860
Because they googled it up.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.840
Because intellect feels
stupid without data.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:24.160
Now, the nature of the
intellect is like this only,

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.110
that it feeds upon the data.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.240
Where does the data come to you?

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.620
What you see, what you hear,
what your smell, what you

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.540
taste, what you touch.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.370
In the video nature of things,
these five sense organs,

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.660
which are the main agents of
gathering information for you,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.810
are all outward bound.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.842
You can see what's around you.

00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:49.820
You can't roll your eyeballs
inward and scan yourself.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.070
You can hear this.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.440
So much activity here.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.480
You cannot hear this.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.660
If an ant crawls upon your
hand, you can feel it.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.070
So much blood flowing.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:00.500
You cannot feel it.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.290
Because in the very
nature of things,

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.870
your sense organs
are outward bound.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.180
You cannot use these
to turn inward.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.330
There is another
dimension of perception,

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.660
which needs to be activated.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.020
Why is it not active in me?

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.940
Because the sense organs
are instruments of survival.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.730
They come on when you're born.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.280
Whatever kind you are.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.260
Anyway, it comes on.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.910
It comes on for a dog, pig,
cat, elephant-- for everybody.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.240
Similarly, it comes on for us.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.600
Whatever is needed for survival
for any biological creature,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.610
it turns on at the time of
birth because it's needed.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.540
Otherwise you wouldn't survive.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.050
But anything beyond
survival process,

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.800
without striving it would not
have ended your life, isn't it?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.185
Anything that you know from
an alphabet to whatever else

00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:47.060
you know-- I'm sorry.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.915
I'm not talking
about your brand.

00:38:48.915 --> 00:38:50.290
I'm talking of
the real alphabet.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.200
Anything that you
know, from reading

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.410
to writing to using a computer
or singing a song or whatever,

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.190
you know these things
with certain striving.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.600
I want you to remember when you
were three, four years of age,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:11.420
that damn A, how complicated it
was, as if it were not enough,

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.700
there were two versions of
it, which freaked the hell out

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.700
of you.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.060
Today you can write
with your eyes closed.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.060
Still, there are others
in the world who did not

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.770
strive in that direction.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.420
Even today, you
ask them to write,

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.330
they will struggle [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.060
Without striving,
anything beyond survival

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.010
would not enter your life
and will not enter your life.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.390
So turning inward is
not a survival process.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.710
So there are two fundamental
dimensions within you,

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.920
instinct of self-preservation,
longing to expand limitlessly.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.880
Both true for a human being.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.740
This is essentially a human
problem on the planet.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.370
No other creator wants
to expand limitlessly.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.330
They are only
thinking of survival.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.270
Their stomach
full, life settled.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.850
For you, stomach empty,
only one problem.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.346
Stomach full, 100 problems.

00:40:00.346 --> 00:40:02.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:07.560
Yes, so all your trouble
begins after stomach gets full,

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.400
isn't it?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.240
Because this is longing
to expand limitlessly.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.130
In the evolutionary
process, we can say this.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.860
But every other creature,
nature has drawn two lines

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.120
within which they live and die.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.550
They're quite final.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.570
But once you become human,
there is only a bottom line.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.310
There is no top line.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.850
So what humanity is
suffering and confused

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:31.820
about is not their bondage.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.850
They're suffering their freedom.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.636
What do you do with that?

00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:39.600
[CHUCKLING]

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600
JONATHAN BERENT: Wow.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.650
All right, well, I'm
going to invite anyone--

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.060
SADHGURU: All these identities
of religion, race, caste,

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.020
creed, nationality
is they're trying

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.300
to set their own bondage.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.900
Because no bondage has been
given to you by nature.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.860
You're trying to set
your own bondage so

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.310
that you feel secure somehow.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.810
JONATHAN BERENT: And so that's
part of the motivation that's

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.300
driving the attacks.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.900
SADHGURU: All these
identities, being identified

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.370
with the color of your
skin, with whatever nonsense

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.690
you believe in and nationality--
just a cloth, a flag.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:19.190
People will stand there and
tears will come to them.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.510
Just look at that.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.590
It really amazes me.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.110
And on one level,
it's beautiful.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.840
On another level,
it's super ugly

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.380
that you get identified with
all these kind of things.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.740
People get identified with
a symbol, with a word,

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.540
with just about
anything, all right?

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.600
So you are trying to create
some artificial boundary

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.450
of your own.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.680
Once you create this boundary
and you have another boundary,

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.180
I have my boundary, when
they meet, we clash.

00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:55.850
JONATHAN BERENT: So if
you have a question,

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.730
please go ahead and
come to the mic.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.800
And again, we're trying
to think about this topic

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.390
of inclusive consciousness.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.590
You've heard a lot of
things shared from our VPs

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.630
and also from this conversation.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.390
So let's hear what's on
your mind based on all this.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.844
Over here.

00:42:11.844 --> 00:42:12.510
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:19.230
So I'm involved in organizing
a peace conference in India.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.770
And it's a very
grassroots-led effort,

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:25.010
so no politicians, thank God.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.310
And I found it interesting
that you said you stopped

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.900
attending peace conferences.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.000
So I'd love to hear from you
any advice on what we should do

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.090
or what we should avoid
to make this small effort

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.980
a success for the people
who are attending.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.840
SADHGURU: See, when you say,
no politicians, thank God,

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.820
you're just not attending
to the source of problems.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:56.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.825
Politicians are not
another breed of people.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.960
A democratic society
means tomorrow you

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.730
may become the president
of this nation.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.820
That's what it means, yes?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.770
If you're willing to
stick your neck out,

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.990
you may become the
president of this country

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.180
or a prime minister
of another country.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.550
So a politician did
not drop from the sky.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.850
He is not some other creature.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.600
He is just like you and me.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.760
He stuck his neck out, which you
and me are not willing to do.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.710
Let's admit this.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.700
It's not an easy thing.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.780
It's easy to sit
down and comment,

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:39.350
but it's not an easy thing
to try to run a nation.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:43.780
It's complex, believe me.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.740
So you must have politicians.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.310
But you must have
am atmosphere where

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.330
it's not political in
nature, where they will also

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.210
let their hair down and
talk like common citizens

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.070
or human beings.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.110
But without them, what
are you going to change?

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.690
So peace conferences, if
it's just an entertainment,

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:06.760
you can gather your friends
and have a peace conference.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.550
But if you want peace on the
planet, the most important

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.860
politicians, the most powerful
politicians in this world

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.720
must be there.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.280
Only then there is a
possibility of peace, isn't it?

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.890
Otherwise it's
just entertainment.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.520
I'll tell you.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.960
I was in a very important
peace conference.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:29.110
There were 42 Nobel laureates,
each one of them pulling out

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:35.130
10, 20, one of them 44, 45 pages
of printed sheets without even

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.480
looking up at anybody, just went
on reading their paid speeches

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.470
from morning to evening.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.820
And slowly, the hall
was becoming peaceful.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.816
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.350
In one afternoon, the
second day afternoon,

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.340
I'm sitting right here in the
front row, and I look around.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.500
Literally everybody has fallen
asleep except the security

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.790
man who was standing there
and me, the idiot, who

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.314
is sitting up
there and believing

00:45:06.314 --> 00:45:08.730
there's going to be world peace
because of this conference

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.640
and sitting up there, alert,
listening to every word.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.670
Then I looked around.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.910
Everybody's become
very peaceful.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.740
They've been having
late-night parties,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.580
and they're all very peaceful.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.320
Then when my turn to
speak came, I said, see,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.700
I've heard so much
peace [INAUDIBLE] today.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.740
I want to ask you, can
all of you or any of you

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.890
put your hand on
your heart and say

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:40.077
you are genuinely
peaceful in your life?

00:45:40.077 --> 00:45:41.160
They were straight enough.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.480
They said, no, we
are not peaceful.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.740
I said, if you cannot
make your mind peaceful,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.170
how the hell are you going
to make the world peaceful?

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.340
What's happening in
the world is just

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.190
a larger manifestation of
the nonsense that's happening

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.730
in our heads, isn't it?

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.680
If you and me were truly
peaceful human beings,

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.650
do we have to worry about
you and me fighting someday?

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:06.610
Hello?

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.600
Whatever the issues, we'll
sit down and handle it, right?

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.670
Because there is violence in us,
now we have to have a boundary.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:18.065
Here there's a barricade
just in case I get violent

00:46:18.065 --> 00:46:19.270
or you get violent.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:23.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.806
JONATHAN BERENT: How about
from this side over there.

00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:34.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.200
Just a very basic
question-- you mentioned

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.120
that before we start
educational of our children,

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.990
we should try and make sure that
their identity is the cosmos.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.960
But how do you do
that then we ourselves

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.350
are so hard-wired--
I mean, how do we

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.050
tell our children that
their identity is more

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.490
when my own thinking
is so limited, when

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.630
in my own identity
is so limited?

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.610
How do I pass something
like that to a child

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.000
when I am not capable
of doing that myself?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.194
SADHGURU: Anyway, whatever
you tell your children,

00:47:03.194 --> 00:47:05.110
your children don't
listen to you [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:07.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.790
If you have them on the way, I'm
telling you, forewarning you.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.090
They don't listen to a
damn thing that you say.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.310
But they observe you.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:23.800
They pick up things from
the way you are behaving.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.930
If you don't show
that in your life,

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:31.250
your teachings will be
hated after some time.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.660
Yes.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.180
See, this is most unfortunate.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.320
I just see this happening
to so many people.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.800
When they have a
child, these parents,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.660
they did everything
possible to the child.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.900
They thought this
is their life, not

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.420
just changing diapers, so many
things, everything possible.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.440
They taught they're
living for this person.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.320
As this person becomes bigger
and in their over-concern

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.145
about how this child
should be, trying

00:48:00.145 --> 00:48:03.640
to teach him the best things
in the universe, which is not

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:07.390
true in their lives, slowly
you will see by the time

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:12.260
he becomes a teenager,
he avoids them.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.200
If he wants to share
something, if he

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.850
wants to listen to some
sense, he goes to his friends,

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.390
never to his parents.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.350
Not everybody, I'm saying,
but largely it is happening.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.670
Because they don't make sense.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.700
They talk things that
doesn't make sense.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.610
People keep asking me, Sadhguru,
how did you become like this?

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.680
What is this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.010
Did you display your life
and you are like this?

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:38.530
This is all I did.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.850
I strived to remain uneducated.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:43.500
It's not easy, believe me.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.180
From the day you are born,
just everybody around you

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.170
is trying to teach
you something that

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.669
did not work in their life.

00:48:50.669 --> 00:48:55.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.859
You can clearly see it's
not worked in their life.

00:48:57.859 --> 00:48:59.400
Because if it had
worked, they should

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.950
have been joyful and ecstatic.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.860
It's not worked.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.310
They've become long-faced.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.140
But they're teaching you
all kinds of best things,

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.140
louder universe.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.670
It's not going to work.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.164
You don't have to say a word.

00:49:13.164 --> 00:49:15.330
I will tell you-- is it OK
if I can share something?

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.246
JONATHAN BERENT: Sure.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.870
SADHGURU: I brought
up my girl alone.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.850
At the age of seven,
she lost her mother.

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:29.510
So one rule I put-- she's been
traveling with me since she's

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.400
4 and 1/2 years of age, OK?

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.170
I'm sorry since she is 4
and 1/2 months, not years.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.880
4 and 1/2, I sent her to school.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.220
But as a little infant,
she traveled with me.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.462
And I made one rule.

00:49:44.462 --> 00:49:46.920
Where ever I went, I always
stayed with many, many families

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.310
all over the country.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.150
I always told
everybody, never teach

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:56.390
her anything, no ABC, no 1,
2, 3, no rhyme, nor nonsense.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.904
I don't want anybody
to teach her anything.

00:49:58.904 --> 00:50:00.820
People thought this is
strange or [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.730
And I said, just leave her.

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:04.710
By the time she
was 18 months, she

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.839
was speaking three
languages fluently

00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:08.130
because nobody messed with her.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.740
And she grew up joyfully,
went to school, everything.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.672
At the age of 13, something
she was disturbed at school,

00:50:16.672 --> 00:50:17.630
and she came back home.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:20.420
And one day she said,
you're teaching everybody

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.150
so many things.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.450
You're not telling me anything.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.292
I said, well, I don't
do anything unsolicited.

00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:28.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:29.895
I've been waiting.

00:50:29.895 --> 00:50:30.520
It's all right.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.820
Now you come.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.680
There's only one thing
you need to know.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.542
I said, never to
look up to anybody.

00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:38.000
She looked at me,
"what about you?"

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.750
kind of thing in her face.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.580
I said, not even me.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.310
Never look up to anybody.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.700
Never look down on anybody.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.100
That's how you have
to do with life.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.690
Never look up to
anything or anybody.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.250
Never look down on
anything or anybody.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:56.480
Suddenly you will see
life just the way it is.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.640
Right now, something is
high, something is low,

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.450
something is God, something
is devil, something is virtue,

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:03.510
something is sin.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.040
You divided the universe in
a million different ways,

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.560
and then you're
trying to fix it.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.150
It's not going to work.

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:13.430
The instrument which broke
the world into pieces

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.950
is your intellect.

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.590
With that, you're trying
to fix everything.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:20.260
It's not going to work.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.730
Now, this racism
thing, it's disastrous

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:27.475
that in 21st century, every
day there's a shooting.

00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:29.350
I think this has been
happening all the time.

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:33.040
Only now because of cell phones
and Facebook it's out there

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.880
and everybody knows.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.690
I think it's been happening
right through, all right?

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:39.680
At one time, it was
happening legally.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.430
Now it's been
happening illegally.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.870
Now, these kind of
things are happening

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:50.570
because we're using our
intellect to fix the problem.

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.990
You're using a knife to stitch.

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.220
This is not going to work.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.720
You just live that way.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.930
Whichever way you live,
your children will grasp it,

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:03.650
and they'll make a sense out
of that in their own way.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.980
And maybe they'll fall
this way or that way

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.076
because you are not the
only influence upon them.

00:52:08.076 --> 00:52:08.950
You better know that.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.850
You're going to be a mother.

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:11.700
You must know this.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.290
You are not the only influence.

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.992
There are all kinds of
people, and there's Google.

00:52:16.992 --> 00:52:20.928
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.610
AUDIENCE: Saghguru, you talked
about identity and inclusive

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.760
consciousness.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.730
So I want to know, let's
say like you talked

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.100
about the sensory
body and feeling

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.750
that everyone is part
of you kind of thing.

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:38.480
So where does the role
of action come in?

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.320
So if I do something, do
I identify myself with it

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.230
what I did?

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.160
And let's say if I
feel that you are

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.770
or everyone is part of like
me or the whole cosmos,

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.150
and you do something.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:52.490
Is you doing something,
cosmos doing something,

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.340
me doing something?

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.165
Where does the action
come in the picture?

00:52:57.472 --> 00:52:59.596
SADHGURU: See, this is the
beauty of our existence.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.530
In this existence,
in this cosmos,

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.760
we are not even a speck of dust.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.500
That small we are.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.200
But still, creation has
given as an individuality,

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.940
an individual nature that we
can experience these things.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.810
But countless number of people
who lived on this planet

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.430
before you and me came.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:24.270
Where are they?

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:25.810
They're all topsoil.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.230
They've become part of
the Earth, isn't it?

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.980
So if you get it
from me today, you

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.805
can transform your life,
that really everything

00:53:33.805 --> 00:53:35.930
is a part of you, and you
are a part of everything,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.900
not as a thought,
but experientially.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.110
If you can experience
everything around you

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:44.560
as you experience the 5,
10 fingers of your hands,

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.820
then you will see life becomes
tremendously beautiful.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:52.170
Otherwise, anyway one day you
will get it from the maggots.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:54.570
But it will be a
bit too late lesson.

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.110
But everybody will get
it one day, isn't it?

00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.650
Hello?

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.200
When people bury
us, we are going

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.420
to get the point that we
are part of the Earth.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.450
Right now, we forget it.

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:07.240
We can live sensibly.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.780
So this must come
from an experience.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.100
If you come from a
thought, again you're

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.780
thinking how is inclusiveness
and individuality existing

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.930
at the same time?

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:20.500
That is the beauty
of this existence.

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:24.000
It is the filth which has
become the flower, isn't it?

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.830
Yes or no?

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.330
It is the filth which
has become the flower.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.260
In your mind filth is
different, flower is different,

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.210
but in existence filth
and flower are same.

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:41.220
They are not different, just
different ways of existing.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.930
For you nose, filth
doesn't feel good.

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:48.390
But if you were a pig,
you would like the filth.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.100
Nothing wrong with that.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.510
Because it's the same thing.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:54.550
It's the same thing or no?

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:56.310
Hello?

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:58.280
It's the same thing, isn't it?

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.180
It is just that in our mind
and with our intellect,

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.430
we are breaking everything.

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.290
This breaking is only a
psychological reality.

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.510
This is not existentially true.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:11.360
See, we started a huge movement
called Project GreenHands.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.275
I think something a little
bit was there in this.

00:55:15.275 --> 00:55:17.080
This happened like this.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.970
When I saw that entire southern
India was turning into desert

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.710
very rapidly, rivers
were drying up,

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:27.310
ground water went from
like 100, 150 feet

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:31.270
to almost 1,500
feet and palm trees,

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:35.030
the crowns were falling off, we
thought we must do something.

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:37.000
Then I did this to them.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.020
One day I called-- I
went to a small village

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.400
and called for people.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.890
About 5,000 people turned up.

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:46.880
So I made them-- this is around
11 o'clock in the morning.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.370
The weather is not like
this in southern India.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:53.050
It's hot, summer sun.

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:54.280
I made them sit there.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.040
Close by, there were
about five rain trees,

00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.810
three of them really large ones.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.460
You've see rain trees?

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.290
Some of them can be
as large as an acre.

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.985
It's shade.

00:56:05.985 --> 00:56:08.260
So three of them are
really large ones.

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.559
Two of them were medium-sized
ones, very attractive.

00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:13.100
I would love to be
under those trees.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.330
But I made them sit
here in hot sun.

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.770
And I went on talking,
stretching the talk,

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.649
telling them stories,
telling them jokes.

00:56:22.649 --> 00:56:24.690
They were all very
enthusiastic in the beginning.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:30.750
Slowly-- if you're walking
around, you won't feel the sun.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:35.040
If you just sit under the
sun, it just really gets you.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.034
About 1 and 1/4,
1 and 1/2 hours,

00:56:37.034 --> 00:56:38.200
they were really going away.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.880
They're thinking, what's
wrong with this Sadhguru?

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.050
He's just frying us in the sun.

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.760
Then I said, come, and I
took them under the tree.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.580
Ah!

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.220
Everybody.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:56.290
Suddenly, you know
what is a tree.

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:57.910
Otherwise you were
thinking of how

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.190
to make furniture out of this.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:03.430
Now suddenly you
know what's a tree.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.280
I made them sit
down there and read.

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.190
It's a certain spiritual
process that I set up,

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:13.145
a process for them where I
told them, what you exhale,

00:57:13.145 --> 00:57:14.580
trees are inhaling.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.670
What they exhale,
you are inhaling.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.020
Once they experienced
it, now you

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.860
can't stop them
from planting trees.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.580
They planted over
28 million trees.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.680
And you can't stop them.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.280
They changed the entire culture.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:33.840
But when this happened to
me about 9, 10 years ago,

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.290
I went back to my [INAUDIBLE]
city, which I had not

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:38.740
gone and done any work there,
I had never spoken there,

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.160
I avoided this because
my family lives there.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.370
I wanted to be anonymous in
that town, not recognized.

00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:46.630
But because of the
Google and stuff,

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.820
I got recognized everywhere.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.670
So when I went there, they
insisted I must do something.

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:53.150
I called for a program.

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:59.170
All kinds of people turned up,
my kindergarten school friends,

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:03.050
teachers, my college teachers,
school teachers, everybody.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:04.930
When I spoke and
all this happened,

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.860
and my English teacher came up
to me from school and she said,

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.150
now I understand
why you wouldn't

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.360
let me teach Robert Frost.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.050
I said, ma'am, why would
I not let you teach Frost?

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:17.450
I like Frost.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.600
I have some poetry
in his own voice.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.770
I said I like Frost.

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.320
Why would I not let you teach?

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.220
Don't you remember?

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.650
You didn't let me teach Frost.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:26.490
Then I remembered.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:28.750
One day she came up,
and we were always

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:32.080
studying English poems
and English literature.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.320
Suddenly she introduced
this American poet and said,

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.210
this is Robert Frost.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:36.920
He's a great guy.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.475
And she started out
the poem. "Woods

00:58:38.475 --> 00:58:40.220
are lovely, dark and deep."

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.543
I said stop.

00:58:41.543 --> 00:58:43.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.200
I said, a man who
calls a tree a wood,

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.480
I'm not going to have
anything to do with this guy.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.010
She said, no, no,
Robert Frost is

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.700
a great-- I don't care
who the hell he is.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.211
He calls tree a wood.

00:58:57.211 --> 00:58:58.710
I'm not going to
listen to that guy.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:00.640
I didn't let her teach.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.070
We chose Longfellow instead of
Frost because I didn't let her

00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:07.020
teach Frost that year/

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:12.750
So I'm saying if you call a
tree a wood, it's a commodity.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.500
This water, this Earth
that you walk upon,

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.780
the people that you see,
these are not commodities.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.130
This is life, isn't it?

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:22.740
The air that you breathe,
the water that you drink,

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.940
the soil that you walk upon,
the trees that you sit under,

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.510
everything else in this world
is life and life-making material

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:32.420
for you.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.520
If you forget this, you
will treat it as commodity.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.290
If you experience this,
that this is actually

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.360
what is making
your life, then you

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.890
will see the most fantastic
thing about this universe.

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:46.400
Everything is one,
but everything

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.100
is separate at the same time.

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.270
That's what gives
us an experience.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:52.020
That's why I can sit
here and talk to you.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.400
Otherwise, how to talk to you?

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.672
JONATHAN BERENT: Maybe
one more question.

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:01.630
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sadhguru.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.000
Thank you for coming.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.980
So for me, one way to
achieve inclusiveness

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:10.290
is to see other
people as ourselves.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.080
For example, right
now I know for sure

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.310
that you exist within me,
because your voice happens

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.333
within my head, your image.

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:19.200
SADHGURU: No, no no.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.940
If voices are happening
within your head,

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.550
it means something else.

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:26.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.510
AUDIENCE: So your image
happens within me,

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.530
because it reflects
through my eyes and--

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.863
SADHGURU: You mean to say you
have nightmares every day?

01:00:33.863 --> 01:00:36.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:42.350
AUDIENCE: Well, so my point
is, I see you within me.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:44.690
That I know for sure.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:49.500
But I wonder whether you
see me within you as well.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.480
And if you answer
yes or no, then that

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.590
may be a belief, because
how do I know it's true?

01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:00.950
SADHGURU: See, there are
two levels of reality here.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.240
There is a
psychological reality,

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.660
and there's an
existential reality.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.590
Existential reality
is not your making.

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.800
Psychological reality
is entirely your making.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.120
But a large part of it
is unconsciously made,

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.700
so you believe it is real.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.400
Whatever is true in your
psychological reality

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.100
may have some social
relevance but has

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.420
no existential relevance.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.750
Right now, if I say you are
within me, you will feel good.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.912
If I say I love you,
you'll feel good.

01:01:33.912 --> 01:01:34.870
Maybe it's true for me.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.990
Maybe it's true for you.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.170
But it's not floating
around anywhere here, OK?

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.720
It's just my emotion
and your emotion.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.060
Yes, it is nice that
our emotions are sweet,

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.390
our thoughts are sweet,
our actions are sweet.

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.810
It's wonderful if it is so.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:54.840
But it has only psychological
and social relevance.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.430
It has no existential relevance.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.780
If you want to
know life, you have

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.620
to step out of this bubble
called psychological reality

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.250
and step into
existential reality.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.850
Then only you have
a taste of life.

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:14.150
Otherwise, you are just a bundle
of thoughts, emotions, ideas,

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:20.940
opinions, and now I'm there in
there in all that. [CHUCKLING]

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.070
So what I would tell
all of you is instead

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:29.120
of thinking about it,
instead of analyzing it,

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.060
an experiential
dimension has to happen.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:38.020
If you're willing to dedicate
28 to 30 hours of focused time,

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.700
we will give you tools
with which you can

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.860
make this happen for yourself.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.310
This is not some empty talk.

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:49.200
This has happened to
millions of people.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.180
This has worked.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:54.510
And I must tell you,
first 21 years of my work,

01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:57.770
as a rule I never
appeared in the media.

01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:59.510
Of course, I didn't
have a website.

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:03.860
I never put up one poster or
banner or even a brochure.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.740
Only by word of mouth
millions of people came.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.630
Obviously it must
have worked for them

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:10.540
to bring their
family and friends.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.490
And now I'm not
promising any miracle.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.300
I'm not taking you to heaven.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.730
I'm telling you the source
of all your problems is you,

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.910
not somebody else.

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:22.860
I'm saying it's hard talk.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.306
It is not some miraculous
promise of going to heaven,

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.930
some La-La land is
there and everything

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.000
will be fine for you.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:29.810
No.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:33.860
In spite of that, people
came, because they

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.080
saw the transformation
within themselves.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.140
And people around
them had to come.

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.560
There was no other way.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.870
So I'm saying this is the
technology of well-being.

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:48.110
We are handling our external
well-being in a scientific way

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.600
through many means
of technology.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.470
Why is it that we
are so crippled when

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:55.260
it comes to our interiority?

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:57.880
We are trying to handle
it through our emotions.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.350
We are trying to handle it
through our philosophies.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.710
We are trying to handle
it through our ideologies

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:04.480
and belief systems.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.730
No, it's time you approach
this human mechanism

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:11.730
in a scientific manner,
how to make this

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.260
into a full-fledged possibility.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.490
See, every life in
this world is only

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:20.550
trying to become a
full-fledged life,

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.890
whether it's a worm
or an insect or a bird

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:24.450
or an animal or a tree.

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:28.530
All they're striving for
is to become full-fledged.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:30.650
But we know what is
a full-fledged worm.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:32.350
We know what is a
full-fledged insect.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:34.150
We know what is
full-fledged everything.

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:37.450
But we do not know what is
a full-fledged human being.

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:40.540
Because even if I make you the
king or queen of this planet

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:44.830
tomorrow, still you will ask
[INAUDIBLE] for the stars.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.770
Because there is
something within you

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.360
which is longing to
become in finite.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.370
If you are longing
for the infinite,

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:53.760
you can't go about
conquering space.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.620
It's not going to get you there.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.985
The finiteness to you has
come to you only because

01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:01.890
of your identification
with your physicality.

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:03.710
Because the nature
of physicality

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.640
is a defined boundary.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.230
Without a defined boundary,
there is no physical nature.

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:12.140
But is it true that
this physical body

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.090
you slowly accumulated?

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:15.090
Is it true?

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.470
Or were you born like this?

01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:18.760
You accumulated this.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.140
What you accumulate
can be yours.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.520
It can never, ever be you.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.160
Or in other words, you
are living your life

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.900
without experiencing the life
that you are even for a moment.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.890
Your entire involvement is with
your physiology and psychology.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:37.610
It's time it changes,
that you experience

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:39.180
the life that you are.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.480
This life that you are
doesn't come with boundaries.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.070
It's only the body.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:48.117
It is boundaries, and you
must stick to the boundaries.

01:05:48.117 --> 01:05:48.950
It's very important.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.740
Don't expand it too much.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.610
Thank you very much.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:54.485
JONATHAN BERENT: Thank
you so much, Sadhguru.

01:05:54.485 --> 01:05:55.240
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.660
Thank you.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.550
Thank you all.
