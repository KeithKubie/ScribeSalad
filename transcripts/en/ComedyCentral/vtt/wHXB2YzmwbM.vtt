00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.311
I wish I had more sage wisdom.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.213
In fact, I wish I knew

- It just didn't make me laugh.

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:24.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think it's a joke.
(dinging)

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.893
- They say you hurt
the ones you love,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.295 line:0%
but I didn't love the
kids I hit with my car

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.830 line:0%
and they got hurt so bad.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.831 line:0%

children is funny,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.942
according to the Young Turks. '

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.178 line:0%

think it's funny, personally.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.012 line:0%
- Okay, great.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.113 line:0%

- And we're not
getting under that bus.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.220

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.922
did you know Microsoft
is also how Bill Gates

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.223
describes his penis?

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.459
- Are you micropenis
shaming Bill Gates?

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.693
- I'm not body shaming anyone.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:01.694 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's just a joke.
- No, I mean that's,

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.829 line:0%
I mean, everyone
heard it, right?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.730 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%

- Yo, what's up, man?
(laughing)

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.872
Nothing wrong with that,
just gotta be good at head.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.807
- Rubbing snake.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.708
- Let's check out Windows 95.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.410
(laughing)

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.878
It's his testes.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Fun to do, run up to someone
about to enter their home

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.415
and yell, hey hold that door!

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.117 align:start size:84% position:16%

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:24.984
(laughing)

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:25.952
You got a funny face.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:26.853
- I don't think so.

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:27.954 align:start size:75% position:25%
I think it's a--
- I'll say

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.155 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's a perfect joke.
(dinging)

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.356 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, it's a good
face and a perfect joke.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.758
- It would be better
if you didn't read 'em,

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.992
which is how it works.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:33.827
Which is great.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.700
(buzzing)

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.336
(dinging)

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.737
See, it's better (laughs).

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.806
- My sleeve just came off.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:47.640 align:start size:69% position:31%
- What?
(laughing)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.441
Oh my God.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.878

I came out of my,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.046
(grunting)

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.481
I hulked out of my outfit.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.315
(laughing)

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.549
That was hilarious.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.717 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.552
I'm doing the, oh, okay.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.888
Wow, outfit change (gasps).

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start size:97% position:3%
How's it look?
- Where's my leather jacket?

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.190 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thank you.
- And it matches yours.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.125
(laughing)

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.359
This is a really good set,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.027
can I make sure to
get y'all's number?

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.629
- My number is 508801 (beeping).

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.867 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Is it actually?
- Please text me compliments.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:15.535
This one you gotta
do a little voice.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:16.736
- Oh.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.905
- People always talkin'
'bout jumpin' jacks,

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.508
but no one ever talkin'
'bout push up Phils.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.746
(buzzing)
Alright.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.515
I'd say the closets
I ever was to my mom

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.749
was when I was in her pussy.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.551 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, God, that
was, sorry (laughs).

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.356 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Perfect joke.
(dinging)

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.457
- Oh, okay.
(buzzing)

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.758 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That is, that is...
- Oh, okay.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:39.726
Okay.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.760 align:start size:72% position:28%
- That's true.
(dinging)

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.195
- A perfect joke.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:43.463
It's true.
- It's true.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.397
- It's the same for
all of us, I think.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.232 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Oh yeah.
- You turned me.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.101 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This was, I wrote
this last week.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.068
- But it's really when you're--

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.770
- When I had sex with my mom.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.071
- Oh, gosh.

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start size:69% position:31%
(buzzing)
- Oh.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.774
I didn't take it like that.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And so, if there
was one that you might

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.480
retweet, if I were to post it.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.714
- Throw them in the sky,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.516
and then I would
pick any of them.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.350
- [Jordan] Okay.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.791
- Yep, I wish I had some more
sage wisdom, it's so good.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.660
Can I tweet this one?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.494
- Can you tweet it?

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.695
- Yeah.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.996 align:start size:81% position:19%
I mean, I know
you've written it.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:17.664 align:start size:97% position:3%
I can give you some credit.
- I wrote it.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.199
I spent...

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.133
- It's not like, you know,
- Are you gonna credit me?

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.334
- Hollywood where like I change,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.603 align:start size:84% position:16%
erase the name and
say I wrote Magnum PI.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.837
- How are you gonna do it?

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.973
Are you gonna tweet it
and say, jordypizza,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.175 align:start size:97% position:3%
which is my URL?
- What would you, jordypizza?

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:30.109
- Yeah, do that.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.578
You can do that right now.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:35.148
- [Both] A very good joke.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.317
- [Flula] Nice one, Jordy!

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.318
- Should we hit the paddles?

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.285
- [Jordan] Yeah.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.620
- I got.
(dinging)

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.755 align:start size:97% position:3%

- Micropenis boys, wait, one,

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.590
- [Both] Two, three.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.225
Micropenis boys.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.493
- Can we actually cut that?

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.028
I don't want that to...
