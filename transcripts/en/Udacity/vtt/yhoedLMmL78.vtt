00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.320
Typically, the modules in a system are responsible for maintaining invariants.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.394
That is, they have to make sure they are in a consistent state before and

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:10.352
after executing each service they provide.

00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:14.726
The same holds true for components, which are just third-party modules.

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:18.016
However, the presence of callbacks makes invariant maintenance much

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:18.848
more difficult.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.816
In particular, during the time when the client is handling the callback request,

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:24.880
the component is vulnerable.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.940
Because it has given up control to the client,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.010
there's a danger that the client may do something that breaks the invariant,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.460
like make another call to the component.
