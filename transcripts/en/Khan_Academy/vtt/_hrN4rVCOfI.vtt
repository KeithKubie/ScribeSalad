00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:01.813
Voiceover:What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.813 --> 00:00:03.370
is hopefully give more intuition

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.457
as to why the binomial theorem

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:09.399
or the binomial formula
involves combinatorics.

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:11.830
Let's just think about what
this expansion would be.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.312
I'm just using a particular example

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.265
that's pretty simple,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:15.687
x plus y to the third power

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.117
which is x plus y, times
x plus y, times x plus y.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.662
We already know what the terms look like,

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:25.630
we could pick an x from each of these.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.500
If we pick exactly an x from each of these

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.695
that's going to be our
x to the third term,

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.998
and we essentially picked no y [zen]

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:35.729
because we picked an x from each of this

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.608
when we multiplied out to get this term.

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:40.704
How many ways are there to construct that?

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.900
How many ways are there,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.923
if we're picking from three things.

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:47.261
We're picking from three things,

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.988
how many ways can we
choose exactly zero y's

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.409
of not picking a y?

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.129
There's only one way to do that,

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.566
there's only one possible
way of doing that.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.399
By not picking a y from each of them

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.659
or you can say by picking
an x from each of them.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.727
The coefficient right over here

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:07.698
is one x to the third.

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:08.742
There's only one way,

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:10.100
when you take this product out,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.666
only one of the terms
initially is going to have

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.806
an x to the third in it.

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:17.318
Now, what about the next term?

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:18.543
So plus.

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:22.709
Now we're going to pick from three buckets

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.645
but we want to pick one y.

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:25.857
Another way of thinking about it

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:27.710
you have three people

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.962
or we have three people,

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.706
this person, this person, and this person.

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:34.919
One of them you're going to choose to be

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:37.663
I guess be your friend

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.461
that's another way of
saying which of these

00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:40.943
are you going to pick the y from?

00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:44.989
This is the exact same thing

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:46.516
as a combinatorics problem,

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:50.114
from three things

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.308
you are choosing one of them to be y.

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:54.713
Of course three choose one,

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.593
this is equal to three.

00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:59.720
If you're picking one y

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.630
that means you're picking two x's,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.446
and you're taking the
product of everything

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:07.350
so it's x squared times y to the one

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.148
and we could keep doing
that logic, so plus.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:12.391
Now we're going to think
about the situation

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:16.950
where we are picking two
y's out of three things.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.657
It's x to the first, y squared.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:23.240
We're starting with three things

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.121
and we're going to pick
two to two of this y's

00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.971
so it could be this y and this y

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.577
to construct the product y.

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:34.830
It could be y times y times that x

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.213
or it could be y times y, times that x

00:02:39.213 --> 00:02:42.641
or it could be y times x, times y.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:44.954
This is three choose two,

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:47.510
out of three things what
are the different ways,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.959
what are the combinations
of picking two things.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.342
If you have three friends

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:53.476
how many combinations
can you put two of them

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:55.464
in your two seater car
where you don't care

00:02:55.464 --> 00:02:57.640
about who sits in which seat.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.447
You're just thinking about

00:02:58.447 --> 00:02:59.363
how many different combinations

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:00.524
can you pick from that

00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:03.461
and once again this evaluates to three

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:08.363
and then finally, how many different ways

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.371
from a set of three things,

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:12.973
from three different things,

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:14.593
so from each of these expressions,

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:17.668
how many ways can you
pick exactly three y's?

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:18.921
Well there's only one way to do it,

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:22.420
you pick this y, this y and that y.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.858
If you're picking three y's

00:03:23.858 --> 00:03:26.640
that means you picked zero x's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.600
and you have picked three y's.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200
That's why we're dealing
with combinatorics here.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.408
Three choose three.

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:35.472
From three expressions,

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:37.585
your three binomials, right over here

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:39.257
that you are taking the product from

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:42.792
you need to choose three y's,

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:44.971
so you have to pick the
second term in all of them.

00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:46.283
There's only one way to do that,

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:48.803
here you want to pick the
second term, the y term,

00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:51.313
in two of them, exactly two of them.

00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:52.825
Here you want to pick the y term

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:54.390
in exactly one of them,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.990
there's one way to do this,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.978
three ways to do this,

00:03:55.978 --> 00:03:57.358
so there's three ways to do this,

00:03:57.358 --> 00:03:58.174
three ways to do this,

00:03:58.174 --> 00:03:58.938
one way to do that,

00:03:58.938 --> 00:03:59.869
one way to do that.

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.860
This is one,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.834
this is three,

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:06.957
when you evaluate, when
you apply the formula

00:04:06.957 --> 00:04:09.980
for three choose and choose k,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.310
three and this is one.
