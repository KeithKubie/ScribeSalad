00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.920
 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.980
Helloooo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.180
Yeah, I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.140
A while ago, an article appeared online,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.200
making the very grim claim that in the last episode of Tom and Jerry,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.460
they apparently commited suicide.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.340
If you search the Internet even more, you'd find there's actually a lot of articles claiming the same thing.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.040
That in the last animated short by Hanna-Barbera,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.180
the episode grimly ends with them sitting on the railroad tracks waiting for death to take them.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.800
This couldn't possibly be true, could it?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.000
But upon more research, you'd find that some channels have banned the episode and,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.060
even to this day, it gets few, if any, showings on American TV.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.860
Holy shit! This might actually be legit!

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.600
Did the world's most hilariously violent team-up end their days in the most disturbing way possible?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.280
I mean, we all know we'd see them in other projects

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.600
and even some where we *wish* they were dead,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.260
but did the original creators, Hanna-Barbera, really do this to them?

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.100
Did Hanna-Barbera really do something so terrible to two of their most famous icons?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.200
Sort of.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.740
There's a bit more to the story.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.160
The episode in question is called "Blue Cat Blues".

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.520
And yes, it does open up with Tom sitting on the railroad tracks, waiting to be run over.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.520
Jerry watches, shaking his head, and, through inner monologue, gives us the story.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.360
Apparently, Tom and Jerry used to be the best of friends

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.340
- but don't worry, they still get smashed up pretty good -

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.300
until a female comes into their lives and ruins everything.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
Tom falls in love, pushing Jerry aside,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.920
but then she falls in love with another cat.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.880
Tom does everything to try and win her back -

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.600
even selling an arm and a leg for her

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.260
- but absolutely nothing works.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600
Eventually, she ends up getting married to the other cat,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.880
resulting in Tom being so beaten and torn that he lays himself on the tracks.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.360
Jerry, of course, justifies what a perfect relationship he's got,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.500
only to find out his girlfriend as well ran off with someone else.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.020
Resulting in him asking Tom if he can scoot over a bit.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.460
Uhm...

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.060
dem dames, eh?!

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.460
Bros before... animalised, kind of humanistic hoes?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.260
Okay, so there's a few angles to come at this from.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.140
One:

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.800
Tom and Jerry have been squashed, smashed, beaten, hit with every object you can imagine.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.200
I think it's more than likely they would survive the train.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440
But then again, a flexible reality can go both ways.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.980
The Addams Family, for example, have done a lot that would obviously kill them

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.840
but a bullet from the gun or threat of electrocution apparently are fatal blows.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.880
You could also make the argument

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.880
that their acceptance of their doom is what suddenly launches them into reality.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.680
Grey area, to be sure,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.520
but there's also the fact that Tom and Jerry's timeline doesn't follow that much continuity.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.740
Every episode is a little different.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.000
The house looks a little different,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.360
the owner is a little different...

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.180
Hell, Jerry's adopted son Nibbles is left on his doorstep God knows how many times.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.700
What, does he just keep sending him back after every adventure?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.720
That's kinda douchey.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.020
So, again, kind of a flexible reality.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.500
Most importantly, though, well, this is one of the final episodes.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.620
It's not THE final episode.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.020
The final episode is actually called "Tot Watchers".

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.800
And they don't commit suicide, they look after a baby.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.640
A fucking baby!

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.620
A touch less depressing, don't you think?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.640
In fact, Hanna-Barbera still had two years of cartoons that came out after the supposed last episode.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.780
So it's pretty obvious this was meant not to be the end for our depressed duo.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.320
So, then, why the controversy of their banning from other channels?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.700
Well, because Tom and Jerry ending their lives is kind of a f**king downer.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.760
People's sensitivities have changed over time to race, gender,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.900
and yes, even some forms of violence.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.140
Now, that's not to say people haven't also died from shootings and falling off high places and so forth,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.540
but the tone is still kept pretty upbeat, and in a different reality.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.040
This, though still the punchline of the joke,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.640
is pretty heavy to watch for two main characters we know and love so much.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.840
Though again, I argue not quite as hard to watch as this.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.940
Rated G, by ass!

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.660
It should be NC-17!

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.300
I remember seeing this episode when I was a little kid and I wasn't at all disturbed by it.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.420
I got the joke.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.040
Jerry thinks he's being above it all, and that could never happen to him,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.640
and when it does happen to him, he comedically does the exact same thing.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.460
But, as much as I love grim humour,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.660
not every little kid is going to get it and could easily take it too seriously.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.200
Hell, if the Internet has shown us anything is that even *adults* can take it too seriously!

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.380
So, did Tom and Jerry commit suicide in the last episode?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.200
Not really.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.700
We never see them get axed off, they survive much worse,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.880
it's obviously the punchline of the joke

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.620
and, most importantly, they had about a dozen cartoons after this one!

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.340
If this demonstrates anything is that we've grown more sensitive to certain jokes

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.020
in connection with certain characters.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.040
A suicide joke in an episode of Louie wouldn't be that big of a deal,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.440
but in Tom and Jerry, eehh, many people can get uncomfortable.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.760
But, in turns of any grand shocking ending people are looking for, it's certainly not here.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.300
It's a funny little episode with what they thought at the time was a funny little ending.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.080
In the end, it's not as epic or gothic as many would suspect,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.200
it's just a silly joke about obsessing over romance.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.100
And really, when is anything related to romance in the media ever caused anybody to commit suicide?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.380
 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.220
Don't you believe it!
