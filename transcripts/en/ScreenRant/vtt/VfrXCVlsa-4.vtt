00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.360
These days, movie fans know that the credits
rolling doesn’t always mean the movie is

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360
truly over.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.180
Even before Marvel Studios was using scenes
during and after the credits to tease their

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.490
upcoming films, studios and directors were
relying on small scenes to bookend their entire

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.460
story, or just offer audiences another laugh.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.789
But some of the best after-credits scenes
hit theaters long before audiences knew to

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:29.789
find them.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.850

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.730
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Hidden Movie Scenes
You’ve Never Seen.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.149
Pirates of the Caribbean

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.469
Disney's swashbuckling series used post-credits
scenes for small gags, including a ghostly

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.010
Monkey and a worshipped dog.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.290
But for the third movie, series star Will
Turner made a serious sacrifice, choosing

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.519
to take over as captain of Davy Jones’ ship
- which meant setting foot on land just one

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.780
day every decade.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.321
Will still got to marry the love of his life,
Elizabeth, but it was the post-credits scene

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.549
that delivered the real happy ending.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.330
With the pair's son now ten years old, he
and Elizabeth watch as Will's ship returns

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.549
in a flash of green light, with the wayward
sailor set to meet his son for the first time

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.840
- teasing an obvious adventure starring the
Turner family, if Disney ever decides to tell

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.340
it.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.340
Harry Potter

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.580
He may not be what comes to mind when you
picture a magical con man, but the magical

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.119
celebrity Gilderoy Lockhart lied, exaggerated,
and charmed his way into the Harry Potter

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.119
series.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.270
But his swagger cost him his memory in the
second film, when a spell backfired and wiped

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.409
his mind.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.770
A post-credits scene proved his talent for
fame wasn't affected, already out promoting

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.250
his new biography, "Who Am I?"

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
The Grey

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.770
The story of a plane load of oil workers forced
to survive in an Alaskan winter wasn't a happy

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.420
one - as one by one, the men are picked off
by a pack of grey wolves.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.109
The film ended with Star Liam Neeson strapping
broken glass to his hands and taking on the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.140
pack's alpha, but cutting to black before
audiences could know who came out on top.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.020
The ending fit the endless struggle between
man and nature, but director Joe Carnahan

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900
offered one more hint.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.120
A post-credits scene shows both the wolf and
man wounded and wheezing, and even if fans

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.950
can't really tell who won the fight, it's
an even more powerful image to drive home

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.230
the movie's message.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.099
The A-Team

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.209
The big screen reboot of the classic TV series
wasn't the hit that the studio hoped for,

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.070
but that didn't mean members of the original
cast had any hard feelings.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.459
Although their cameo appearances were cut
from the film, the scenes were spliced back

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.739
into the movie's end credits.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.769
Fans of the TV series can watch as actor Dirk
Benedict, the original "Face" gives some advice

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.940
to Bradley Cooper, and a white coat-wearing
Dwight Schultz finds out just how much crazier

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.500
the new version of "Howling Mad" Murdock is
compared to his original performance.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.750
Zombieland

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.760
There’s no question that the surprise cameo
from Bill Murray in this zombie killfest is

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.069
among the best in years, appearing as himself,
just trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.650
The actor winds up being killed by the stars
of the movie, followed by a memorable final

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.650
scene.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.409
But following the film’s credits, audiences
got an added bonus that didn’t make the

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.569
cut of the movie.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.360
Rather than using his last breaths for a deadpan
gag, the scene shows Murray reciting one of

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:45.310
his best-known lines from the classic golf
comedy, Caddyshack.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.790
Hancock

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.320
Will Smith was anything but your typical superhero
in this action/dramedy, but by the end of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.939
the movie, Hancock had accepted the role of
a superpowered do-gooder.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.080
Of course, he still had a bit of an edge.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.500
Those who stayed through the credits got to
see that for themselves, when an armed hostage

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.010
taker decided to disrespect the movie’s
star.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.720
It was a fitting joke to end the movie on,
but comic book fans will appreciate that the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.879
criticized black leather suits of the X-Men
movies made its way into another superhero

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.560
story.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.329
Lethal Weapon 3

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.110
Post credits scenes are usually used to tease
a sequel these days, but they can also be

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.600
used for one last gag.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190
But no end credits joke is more staggering
than Lethal Weapon 3.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.410
The movie opens with stars Riggs and Murtaugh
trying, and failing to defuse a bomb.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.470
The studio had actually paid for the demolition
of the building so it would be even more convincing

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.510
in the movie – and when director Richard
Donner found out the Soreno Hotel nearby was

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.130
going to be demolished, he had to take advantage.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.560
The post-credits scene put the partners in
harm’s way one last time, even though that

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.810
explosion wasn’t technically their fault.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.310
Baseketball

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.300
This sports comedy from the minds behind South
Park has become a cult hit since its release,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.950
but it boasted some truly impressive talent.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.720
Outside of the main cast, famous sports commentators
Bob Costas and Al Michaels showed a sense

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.060
of humor, appearing as the go-to play-by-play
men for the movie’s strange baseball/basketball

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.390
hybrid league.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.860
But those who sat through to the end credits
were treated to even more of the pair’s

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.830
comradery, with a post-credits scene that
shows the two broadcasters working their way

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.450
to a passionate kiss, before playing coy to
the camera.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.130
Green Lantern

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.570
Post-credits scenes don’t always make a
movie better.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.130
Since DC’s first Green Lantern movie was
less than a hit with fans and critics, most

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.290
viewers left the theater as quickly as they
could.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.310
But to make things worse, the post-credits
scene wasn’t meant to deliver a joke, or

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.200
even a bit more action.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.200
After Hal Jordan managed to wipe out the movie’s
villain, the bonus scene showed his mentor,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.100
Sinestro, slipping on a yellow ring to master
the power of fear.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.430
In the comics, it was the exact action that
created Hal’s greatest enemy, and the perfect

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.740
villain for a Green Lantern movie – and
fans were enraged.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.200
Choosing a silly, big-brained bad guy because
you don’t know any better is one thing.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.751
But when this scene showed the filmmakers
knew Sinestro was the real threat, and were

00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:15.000
just saving him for a sequel, fans took it
as the final straw.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.060
Super Mario Bros.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.630
OH YES WE DID!

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.550
It might be famously known as the worst video
game movie ever, but the makers of the Mario

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.170
Bros. movie definitely had an imagination.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.270
Fans of the video game were disappointed to
realize that the movie had almost nothing

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.740
in common with the actual games, but according
to the movie’s fiction, Nintendo is to blame

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.930
for the differences.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.340
In a post-credits scene, two Japanese men
are shown talking to the movie’s comedic

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.110
relief – Iggy and Spike – about developing
a video game based on their adventures.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.401
Every child of the 1980s saw the movie, but
few may realize that the games are based on

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:59.610
the movie… according to 
the writers, anyway.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.740
