PARRA:<i> Moving to New York can be
 lonely, like really lonely.</i>

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:08.541
<i> -The last man who touched me
 was... my dog.</i> -(bark)

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:10.576
<i> When I decided
 to try online dating,</i>

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.011
<i> I didn't anticipate</i>

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.881
<i> how many extremely specific
 Web sites there were.</i>

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.517
<i> When did dating
 become so segregated?</i>

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.519
<i> So I hit the streets
 to ask New Yorkers</i>

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.055
<i>if they have any discriminating
 dating preferences.</i>

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.923
-Now, you're an avid
online dater? -Yes.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:25.091
Okay, and have you found

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.659
that you have certain
racial preferences?

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.027
No, not at all.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.529
Okay, so,
when you go online, then,

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.697
-are you just (bleep) free
for all? -It's a free for all.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.199
I mean, I don't have
any preferences.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:35.134
Whatever color you are,
I'm swiping right.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:38.071
Are you at all inclined
towards certain races?

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.573
-No.
-No? -No.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:43.409
PARRA:<i> It seemed like everyone
was willing to bang each other,</i>

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.944
<i> but social psychologist
 Tessa West</i>

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:47.013
<i> had a different perspective.</i>

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.048 line:0%
What's tricky is, people often
aren't even aware

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.350 line:0%
that they sort of harbor
these more deep-down,

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.785 line:0%
under-the-skin
racist attitudes.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.054
So you get liberal whites
in New York, for example,

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.557
who are pretty much willing
to say that they'll date anyone,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.958
but they don't really mean it.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.361
What minorities are most
affected in the dating realm?

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.064
African-American women
and Asian men.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.033
When you guys go on these apps,
are there certain races

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.634
that you're just going
to say "no" to?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.504
It's bad. I usually say no
to Asian guys.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.906
My dad won't pay for the wedding
if I marry a black man.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.342
Like, you might... you might
just want a Labrador retriever,

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.412
-and, like, not
a golden retriever. -Yeah. Yeah.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.880
I don't, like, dislike
golden retrievers.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.181
I just... I just...

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:24.016
-You just don't want
to (bleep) 'em. -Yeah.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.785
-Have you dated a black women?
-I have not.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.720
-Have you actually dated
a black man? -No, I haven't.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.856
-No black pene in that
white "V"? -No. -(laughter)

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.557
Is there a race
that you haven't dated?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.227
Every race besides white,
but that's not my choice.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.063
That's just youth and
inexperience at this point.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.264
-Youth and inex...
-Circumstance.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:40.299
-I'm a little boy.
-But is...

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.768
<i> Because it's all about me,
 I needed to see</i>

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.238
<i> if this is something that
 I could be guilty of as well.</i>

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.173
<i> So I sat down
 with matchmaker Emma Tessler</i>

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.008
<i> to get to the heart
 of the matter.</i>

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.344
I tend to think of myself
as someone who's very open

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.412
to dating all sort...
Well, like all sorts of guys.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.081
I've dated white guys,
black guys, Asian guys.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.049
I mention I'm Latina,
I'm Mexican,

00:01:57.082 --> 00:01:59.118
I've never dated a Hispanic guy.

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.687 line:0%
-Okay. -Never,
and I tend not to be...

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.089 line:0%
attracted to Hispanic guys.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.158
-I'm not racist, right?
-No, you are. Did you say...

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.526
(bleep), Emma.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.394
-That's not the right answer.
-Of course you are.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.463
-Why... -Of course, of course,
you're a little bit racist.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:13.766
We're all a little bit racist.
Overwhelmingly, my clients,

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.235
personally, regardless
of their race,

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.904
would prefer
to date white people.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.372
That's (bleep), man.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.507
-Yeah, it's totally (bleep),
yes. -That's (bleep).

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.609
Now, you are the creator
of a dating Web site.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.878
-That is correct.
-Which is called...

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.048
WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.583
So...

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:31.851
Yeah.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.587
Because you feel like
white people

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.455
don't get to meet each other
often enough or...

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:37.990
-Uh, that's-that's not correct.
-Okay, okay.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:40.259
It's not just for white people
to meet other white people.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:41.561
-Anybody can join.
-Can I join?

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:44.030
Yeah, I think you'd have
a lot of... a lot of hits.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.098
Is that because I can
kind of pass as white?

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.167
Like, let's be
100% real right now.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.102
Um... yeah.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:51.704
White people--
what is it about them

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.005
that makes them so appealing?

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:54.907
They tend to just
have more clout,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.343
they have more money,
they have more opportunities.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.312
I'll be honest, they have some
great qualities.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.414
They-they like
artisanal cheeses,

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.683
they enjoy a good spin class
here and there.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.485
Because of that they
sort of check all the boxes

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:08.621
for what it looks like
to be a high-status person

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:09.855
that you potentially would date.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:11.824
Is there a little part of you...

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.559
a little part of you
wondering why

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:15.228
you've been mostly
inclined towards white women?

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.495
-Definitely.
-Okay.

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:17.964
I don't want
all this Whole Foods,

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.533
-matcha tea-drinking business.
-No,

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.269
you want Nabisco-eating
regular women.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.403
You know, yeah.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:25.705
Based on statistics,

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.139
who would be
most interested in me?

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.408
And let me just give you
some of my excellent qualities.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.444
I cook very well.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.813
I love Hanson.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:36.549
I floss every single day,
uh, sometimes twice.

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.517
Um, I have terrible eyesight

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.786
but I like wearing contacts,
so that's fine.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.321
I have huge teeth.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:43.889
I look great in jewel tones.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.524
I'm extremely close
to my family,

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:46.993
uh, except for one aunt.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.594
Um, my grandparents
are all dead,

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.529
so you don't ever
have to worry about, like,

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:52.198
weird interactions with them.
I'll eat chocolate

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.300
every day of my life,
um, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.969
I don't need an alarm. My body
naturally wakes up at 6:45

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.472
every morning 'cause I'm super
hyper and it's kind of a curse.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.141
Uh, I can fit into 5 1/2...
size 5 1/2 shoes,

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:03.676
that's a big deal.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.178
I can fit into small spaces
in general, I'm a tiny lady.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.414
Based on that,
who would be interested in me?

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:12.318
Probably Mexican men.

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.753
<i> All right, I admit it,</i>

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:17.690
<i> I'm a little racist.
 But so what?</i>

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.027
<i> Paid for by Donald Trump 2016.</i>
