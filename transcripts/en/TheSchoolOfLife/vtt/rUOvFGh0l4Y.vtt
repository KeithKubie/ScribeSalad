00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.840
Vicenza. 25 miles inland from Venice, is one of the leading sites of global architectural tourism- and for one reason.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.460
Many of the works of Andrea Palladio are located in and around that town.

00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:17.140
Andrea Palladio was born at the end of November in 1508 in Padua.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.400
He was an apprentice stonemason, and later a stone carver;

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.989
though it wasn't until he was about thirty years of age that he began designing buildings himself.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.790
Over the next forty years of his working life, Palladio designed 40 or so Villas, a couple of townhouses, and a handful of churches.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.989
Not a huge list, given the amount of building that was going on at the time.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.159
For most of his career, he had a mix of professional successes and setbacks.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.290
Though during his 60s,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.829
He finally emerged as the top architect of Venice-- about the richest and most powerful city in the world at that time.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.779
Palladio held views on architecture almost entirely opposite to those which are current today.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.600
One of these ideas is that architecture has a clear purpose; which is to help us be better people.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.000
Palladio thought we should build in order to encourage good states of mind, in ourselves and others.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.800
In particular, architecture could help us with three psychological virtues:

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.880
Calm, Harmony, and Dignity.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.420
To achieve calm, he reduces what's going on. All the elements in a room are centered; balanced, symmetrical.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340
He only uses simple geometrical shapes.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.980
Generally, the walls are plain, and there's little furniture.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.940
The serenity of the place is designed to calm us down,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
inviting us to focus, and be less distracted.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.580
For harmony, Palladio was obsessed with making sure that every element of a building fitted perfectly with every other.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.240
He wrote, "A fine building ought to appear as an entire and perfect body;

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.900
Wherein every member agrees with its fellow, and each so well with the whole, that it may seem absolutely necessary.

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:52.860
The design of a window is related to that of the door.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.249
Every opening is aligned with every other, every room is a clear, simple shape. The doors always line up.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.300
The building creates an environment in which we are provided with a limited, but real, sense of everything important coming together."

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.840
One of the ambitions of Palladio's architecture was to give greater dignity to parts of life,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.720
that had been unfairly regarded as unworthy.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.100
At the Villa Barbara, a farmhouse in the countryside about 40 miles north of Venice,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.800
the barns and stables and grain stores are just as grand as the owner's not especially large house.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.519
Rather than being hidden away, or set at a distance, these working buildings are presented as honorable and important.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.780
He wasn't disguising the utilitarian reality of the farm;

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.580
rather, he was demonstrating its genuine dignity.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.760
In giving with the long classical tradition, Palladio believed that buildings should help to compensate for our weaknesses.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.220
By encouraging us to be more collected, poised, and measured than we manage to be day to day.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.219
We need serene, harmonious, and confident buildings, precisely because we're not reliably like that.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.840
Ideally, architecture embodies our better selves; the ideal building is like the ideal person.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.340
In 1570, Palladio published his four books on architecture.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.410
It's an early and very distinguished example of the "How-To" genre:

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.734
It gives instructions on how to build.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.880
There's a practical guide to digging foundations,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.360
and how to judge the quality of cement, and the reliable ways of constructing walls and laying floors.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.970
He also develops rules of proportion, based on simple mathematical ratios, to achieve a kind of visual harmony.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.969
The "Fancy Surrounds" are not the crucial thing. Without them, the window opening will still look lovely.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.960
Because it is the proportions, and not the decoration, that make it harmonious.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.799
This meant that an equally beautiful building could be produced more cheaply,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.400
which was one of Palladio's chief concerns, because the same proportions are beautiful,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.507
irrespective of whether the building is made of marble, brick, concrete, or wood.

00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:53.340
He went on to provide a wide range of rules for making buildings attractive:

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.400
They should be symmetrical, there should be three, five, or seven openings on a side; not an even number.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.180
Room should have a simple, geometrical shape,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.160
the length should be 3/5 of the width, and the height 3/5 of the width.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.640
Palladio saw himself as a craftsman; he was simply following a set of rules which others could follow, too.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.980
He was working against the idea that architecture requires a special genius.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.040
The ideal of a pattern book is that visually elegant buildings can be put up as a standard,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.700
as happened in London,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.600
and in many cities in the 18th century-- in large part due to Palladio's influence.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.929
Palladio's ideas have resonated down the ages,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.799
but it isn't when buildings have columns, or make nods to ancient temples, that they are their most "authentically Palladian"

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.560
Buildings are Palladian when they are devoted to Calm, Harmony and Dignity,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.269
on the basis of rules which can, and should be, widely reused.

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:54.000
It's then that they display the same underlying ambition of which Palladio is a central advocate and exponent,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.540
that it should be normal for buildings to represent us for the seductive portrait of our calmest, and most dignified selves.
