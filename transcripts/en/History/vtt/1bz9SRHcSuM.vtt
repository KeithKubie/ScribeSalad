00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:02.869
FRANK: We're in the heart
of gas and oil.

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.938
We're heading to meet
Mr. More and his son Mike.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:08.241
The family ran a service
station from the early 1900s.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.410
They closed in the '90s,
and supposedly

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.711
they kept everything.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.013
MIKE: Look at this place!
FRANK: Wow, this is cool.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.149
Grab the flyer.
MIKE: Ah... Frankie!

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.450
FRANK: This place is cool, man.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.752
MIKE: Oh my gosh,
are you kiddin' me?

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.286
MIKE: Hello!
FRANK: Hello.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.354
FRANK: Whoa...
CARL: Mike!

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.789
FRANK: Got some
square footage up here.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.657
MIKE: No way.
FRANK: Mr. More, Frank.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.059
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.
MIKE MORE: Pleasure to meet you.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.394
FRANK: Nice to meet you, sir.
MIKE: Mike, nice to meet you.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.962
Hello, how are you?
Good to meet you guys.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.630
MIKE: I gotta say,
the curb appeal of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.365
this building is incredible.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.868
MR. MORE: It was a very
busy gas station.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.870
We're midway between Dallas

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.772
and Lubbock and Amarillo.
MIKE: Yeah.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.807
MR. MORE: So this was
the main route of traffic,

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.442
and they all
came by this station,

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.110
because there
was no freeway.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.378
FRANK: Oh.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.847
MIKE: This place was like
an oasis for the weary traveler.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.850
MR. MORE: They were open 7
days a week, 24 hours a day.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.118
MIKE: Wow!

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.787
So what did you guys use
this space for up here, then?

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:57.023
MR. MORE: They had an ordinance
back in the '30s and early '40s

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.325
against parking
overnight on the street.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.460
MIKE: Really?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.061
MR. MORE: So if people
stayed in the hotel,

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.631
you would come over here
and park your car

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.733
and we got 40 or 50
cents a night.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.801
MIKE: No way!
FRANK: Way to go.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.102
MIKE: Cars would pull up
right here, huh?

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.236
MIKE MORE: Yeah.
MR. MORE: Yes, uh-huh.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.638
MIKE: Look how narrow
that is, Frank.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.240
MR. MORE: This ramp
was made for Model Ts.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.508
MIKE: Oh, okay, okay.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.910
MIKE: Can we look
over here first?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.379
MIKE: This is like walking
through a petroliana

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.381
history museum.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.917
MIKE: So was this stuff left
over from the storage business?

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.618
MIKE MORE: A lot of this
I acquired.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:29.322
A few of them are family pieces
that we put up here,

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.423
you know, uh...

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.825
MIKE: Where'd that
come out of?

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.059
MIKE MORE: As far as I know,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.361
it was probably
in the oil refinery offices

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.063
that would have been back here.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.598
MIKE: Oh, this was
office space up here?

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.899
MIKE MORE: This originally was.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.101
It later became the VFW.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.605
I've heard stories that--
a guy that got drunk

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.107
and drove his motorcycle
up these back stairs...

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.409
MIKE: Uh-huh...
[laughs]

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.244
MIKE MORE: And didn't
figure out how to get it down.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.214
So they had to bust a hole in
the wall and take it down

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.815
the ramp for the cars...

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:56.983
MIKE: Oh my gosh.
MIKE MORE: ...through there.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.085
FRANK: It's cool seeing
a young guy like Mike

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.554
being so passionate about
his family's history.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.290
MIKE MORE: I feel a sense
of pride being able to carry

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.593
the family history on.
I take a lot of pride in that.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.461
MIKE: Hey, thanks for sharing
your family's history with us.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.929
FRANK: Thank you so much.
MIKE: Good luck with the museum.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.397
MIKE MORE: Thank you.
FRANK: You bet.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.732
MIKE: Alright, we appreciate it.
You come to Nashville,

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.067
you'll see that.
CARL: Be safe.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.101
FRANK: Alright guys.
Take care.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.236
MIKE: God bless you guys.
[honks horn]

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.504
FRANK: Later, guys!
Take care!

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:19.172
MIKE MORE: Later.
