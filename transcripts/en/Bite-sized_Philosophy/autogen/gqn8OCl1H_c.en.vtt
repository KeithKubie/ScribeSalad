00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
culture doesn't keep up very well and
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
culture doesn't keep up very well and
then<00:00:35.610><c> of</c><00:00:35.760><c> course</c><00:00:35.790><c> it</c><00:00:36.239><c> has</c><00:00:36.270><c> corrupt</c><00:00:36.840><c> elements</c>

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 align:start position:0%
then of course it has corrupt elements
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250 align:start position:0%
then of course it has corrupt elements
and<00:00:37.559><c> so</c><00:00:38.059><c> it's</c><00:00:39.059><c> an</c><00:00:39.270><c> enduring</c><00:00:39.660><c> eternal</c><00:00:40.050><c> story</c>

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
and so it's an enduring eternal story

relationship to a culture that's
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170 align:start position:0%
relationship to a culture that's
somewhat<00:00:45.899><c> corrupt</c><00:00:46.230><c> and</c><00:00:46.730><c> then</c><00:00:47.730><c> the</c><00:00:47.850><c> question</c>

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat corrupt and then the question
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat corrupt and then the question
is<00:00:48.300><c> well</c><00:00:48.620><c> what</c><00:00:49.620><c> you</c><00:00:49.710><c> do</c><00:00:49.829><c> about</c><00:00:50.039><c> it</c><00:00:50.219><c> and</c><00:00:50.449><c> if</c><00:00:51.449><c> the</c>

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 align:start position:0%
is well what you do about it and if the
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959 align:start position:0%
is well what you do about it and if the
answer<00:00:51.899><c> is</c><00:00:52.050><c> nothing</c><00:00:52.800><c> well</c><00:00:53.399><c> then</c><00:00:53.579><c> it'll</c><00:00:53.730><c> just</c>

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 align:start position:0%
answer is nothing well then it'll just
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569 align:start position:0%
answer is nothing well then it'll just
get<00:00:54.120><c> more</c><00:00:54.329><c> corrupt</c><00:00:54.690><c> and</c><00:00:54.960><c> if</c><00:00:55.350><c> the</c><00:00:55.469><c> answer</c><00:00:55.800><c> is</c><00:00:55.980><c> be</c>

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
get more corrupt and if the answer is be
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
get more corrupt and if the answer is be
corrupt<00:00:57.000><c> -</c><00:00:57.210><c> then</c><00:00:57.780><c> it</c><00:00:57.930><c> will</c><00:00:58.050><c> just</c><00:00:58.230><c> get</c><00:00:58.350><c> more</c>

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
corrupt - then it will just get more
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.349 align:start position:0%
corrupt - then it will just get more
corrupt<00:00:58.969><c> so</c><00:00:59.969><c> the</c><00:01:00.090><c> answer</c><00:01:00.390><c> has</c><00:01:00.570><c> to</c><00:01:00.600><c> be</c><00:01:01.010><c> to</c>

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
corrupt so the answer has to be to
 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.980 align:start position:0%
corrupt so the answer has to be to
oppose<00:01:03.359><c> the</c><00:01:03.660><c> corruption</c><00:01:04.170><c> because</c><00:01:05.869><c> that's</c><00:01:06.869><c> the</c>

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 align:start position:0%
oppose the corruption because that's the
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
oppose the corruption because that's the
only<00:01:07.140><c> way</c><00:01:07.229><c> it's</c><00:01:07.320><c> going</c><00:01:07.439><c> to</c><00:01:07.500><c> stop</c><00:01:07.740><c> now</c><00:01:09.170><c> god</c>
