00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.019
Superhero movies have produced some truly
iconic scenes throughout cinema history.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.520
Who can forget Christopher Reeve's Superman
kneeling before Terence Stamp's General Zod,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.800
prior to breaking his hand and dispatching
the villain?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.530
Or Heath Ledger's Joker asking "Why so serious?"?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.960
Or Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark proclaiming
"I am Iron Man!"?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.529
But, like anything else in life, with the
sublime comes the ridiculous - and the superhero

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
genre has certainly had its fair share of
ridiculous moments as well.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.320
In this video, we'll take a look at just some
of them.

Here are ten moments in superhero movies that
will make you scratch your head.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.160
Spider-Man 3
2007's Spider-Man 3 was pretty terrible - and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.910
the worst part in the movie was one that definitely
left viewers scratching their head.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.840
After being exposed to the Venom symbiote,
Peter Parker began behaving differently.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.710
His dance in the jazz club was one thing,
but his strut down a busy street en route

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.740
to buy a new suit was a different beast entirely.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.560
Parker walked in a rhythmic fashion, eyeing
up women, pointing at them in a suggestive

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.860
way, did a little spin, emerged from a store
wearing a new suit, did a little dance, then

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.280
went on his merry way.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.860
What on Earth were Sony thinking?!

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.730
Superman
In the iconic 1978 Superman movie, Lois Lane

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.940
met her demise when aftershocks caused by
Lex Luthor's attempts to create a new land

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.550
mass for his real estate resulted in her car
falling down a crevice.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.460
The subsequent actions of the titular superhero
caused fans around the world to scratch their

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.590
heads in confusion.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.900
Devastated at Lois' death, Superman flew around
the world at super-speed, rewinding time to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.619
bring her back to life and prevent her death
from happening again.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.490
Superman has been known to pull powers out
of his ass before, but that was just ridiculous.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.610
Superman II
If you thought that last entry was ridiculous,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.220
you haven't heard anything yet, as Superman
pulled yet another crazy power out of his

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.150
ass in the 1980 Superman sequel, Superman
II.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.090
It involved Lois Lane again, but the circumstances
were very different.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.380
Lois had discovered that Clark Kent and Superman
were one and the same, but Clark Kent couldn't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.620
have that, so he went to extreme measures
to ensure she forgot that information - he

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.200
delivered a big, wet memory-wiping kiss to
his long-time love interest!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.720
That's right, a kiss from Clark Kent wiped
Lois' memory, so she no longer knew he was

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720
Superman.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.610
Makes perfect sense, right?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.130
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance
Nicolas Cage is bat-shit crazy - everyone

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.980
knows that - and he's portrayed a number of
characters who are pretty damned nuts throughout

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.020
his acting career.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.129
Cage played Johnny Blaze AKA Ghost Rider in
two different movies based on the character

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.040
- and he had a trademark Cage crazy moment
in the second one; 2012's Ghost Rider: Spirit

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040
of Vengeance.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.300
It happened when Blaze was interrogating a
criminal and the Ghost Rider was trying to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.300
come out.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:11.510
Blaze went crazy and proclaimed that the "thing"
inside him was "SCRAPING AT THE DOOR", leaving

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.120
viewers totally puzzled as to what was going
on!

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.069
X-Men Origins: Wolverine
X-Men Origins: Wolverine is arguably the worst

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.340
movie in the X-Men franchise.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.890
The 2009 offering saw Hugh Jackman's character's
backstory explored and pitted him against

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.040
a new foe in the form of Wade Wilson - more
commonly known as Deadpool in the comic books.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.300
But this Deadpool was a far cry from the one
comic book fans know and love - and the moment

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.030
that left fans scratching their heads came
when he was unveiled, after having been taken

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.010
in by William Stryker and experimented on.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.760
The character - who is known for his smart
mouth - had been silenced, with his mouth

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.950
literally sealed shut.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.040
It was a genuinely inexplicable decision on
Fox's part.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.840
X-Men: Days of Future Past
2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past, unlike

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.990
the aforementioned Origins: Wolverine, was
one the X-Men franchise's better movies.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.950
It says a lot about Quicksilver, therefore,
that he was the best thing about the movie

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.110
- his super-speed scene was awesome, as he
helped the heroic mutants rescue Magneto from

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.160
a cell below the Pentgon.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.730
It was, therefore, a head-scratching realisation
when he was subsequently sidelined for the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.730
remainder of the movie.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.440
Not only could he have helped the titular
characters some more in their plight, but

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.410
he would also have made the movie so much
cooler with an extended presence.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.160
Iron Man 3
A big part of Tony Stark's character in the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.770
first two Iron Man movies and The Avengers
movie was that he was fated to live with an

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.530
arc reactor in his chest for the rest of his
life - a big point was made of the fact that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.840
it couldn't be removied.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.050
However, bizarrely, he had it removed on a
whim at the end of 2013's Iron Man 3.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.720
People will say he used Extremis to survive
the operation to remove the shrapnel from

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.530
his heart and the arc reactor itself, but
is Tony Stark really that stupid, given how

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.160
volatile he knew it was?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.650
And, more to the point, wouldn't it have been
mentioned in the movie that he had used Extremis,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.699
given that it would be key information?

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.500
Very confusing indeed!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.169
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.250
surprised almost everyone when it killed off
the titular Man of Steel in only Henry Cavill's

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.280
second outing as the iconic Kryptonian hero.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.280
It did, however, insinuate that he would return
- which we all know he will - but the manner

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.360
in which it did so was bizarre.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.360
Superman's funeral took place after Doomsday
had killed him, and he was placed in a coffin

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.880
and buried, but the camera zoomed in on his
coffin to show dirt rising from it, suggesting

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.990
he was still alive.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.860
Granted, we all "got" what it meant, but really?

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.880
Levitating dirt?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.940
Why was Superman's body causing that to happen?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.740
When you actually think about it, it's really
quite odd.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.070
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.680
was the slightly superior 2007 sequel to 2005's
Fantastic Four movie.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.821
That's not to say it was very good though,
because it really wasn't, and part of the

00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.840
reason for that was its terrible depiction
of the planet-devouring cosmic being known

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.930
as Galactus.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.310
When the gigantic antagonist first appeared
on screen in the movie, audiences were aghast

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.300
and filled with confusion - he was a gigantic
cloud!

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.610
The character's potential to look incredible
in live action was huge, but Fox opted to

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.030
turn him into a damn cloud.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.509
It was one of the silliest decisions in comic
book movie history.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.150
Deadpool
You may recall that, at the end of 2016's

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.740
brilliant Deadpool movie, the final battle
took place on a helicarrer that was clearly

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.930
a homage of sorts to the S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.710
helicarriers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.270
But there was one particular part of that
battle that really made no sense.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.960
When Negasonic Teenage Warhead accidentally
destroyed the equipment stabilising the helicarrier,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.550
in order to save his girlfriend Vanessa, Deadpool
threw her off the helicarrier inside a glass

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.550
chamber.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.639
She fell quite a distance to the ground in
the chamber, but emerged without so much as

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.870
a scratch or bruise.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.669
Frankly, she should have died or, at the very
least, been severely injured by the fall.

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.569
