00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.560
wanted to finish by saying that if I
were to characterize Keller's work and

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:05.570
were to characterize Keller's work and
 

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.660

so they were explicitly designed squares

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380
so they were explicitly designed squares
 

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.440
so they were explicitly designed squares
but each time you built a square

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:24.450
but each time you built a square
 

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.600

outside the city so it would grow it's
an active form it would grow and you

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000
an active form it would grow and you
 

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
an active form it would grow and you
knew explicitly how it would grow but

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.010
knew explicitly how it would grow but
 

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:39.800

you would you could never name it you
