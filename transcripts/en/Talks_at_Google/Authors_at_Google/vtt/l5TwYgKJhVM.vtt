[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:08.892
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:10.880
SPEAKER 1: Fantastic.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.520
So Felipe, thank you
very much for being here.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.990
FELIPE POMBO: Thank you very
much for this kind invitation.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.200
Good afternoon to everyone.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.245
Thank you for taking
time to come here.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:23.120
Thank you, Salvadore.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.060
Thank you, Geraldine, and
all your wonderful team.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.690
It's an honor to be here in
Google to see the great place

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.950
where you work.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.990
And yes, I'm very
happy to be here.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.200
And thank you for this
kind introduction.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.300
SPEAKER 1: So let's
dive right into it.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750
I think a lot of people were
interested about the work

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.110
that you've published around
the 16 eccentric portraits.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.080
And there are many
interesting angles to it,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.170
from the title you choose,
your decision of choosing

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.155
the eccentricity
theme around it.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:01.970
And for those of you that--

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.670
just to set the
baseline, the work

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.905
has interviews with the likes
of Clint Eastwood, Tim Burton,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:11.750
[INAUDIBLE] Garcia,
Alejandro [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.360
to Spencer Tunick,
[INAUDIBLE],, many others.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.180
So I'll let you
elaborate on the list.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.370
But let's start with what
led you to that project?

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.770
If you could tell us
what's the genesis?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.866
What was your motivation
for the project itself?

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.560
FELIPE POMBO: Yes.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.790
SPEAKER 1: And how did you
go about it, specifically

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.362
how to choose who to interview?

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:35.320
FELIPE POMBO: Well, OK.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.950
I started at a very young age.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.000
I started working, when
I was about 20 years old,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in different magazines
and media outlets.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.470
And I had the chance
to do interviews,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.630
to interview a lot of people.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.080
And at the beginning, I
felt that doing an interview

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.170
was just asking
someone questions

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.010
and getting an answer.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.720
But with the time and
with the experience,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.810
I started developing a new way
to interview-- new way for me,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.060
at least.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.980
And that is not just
asking questions

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.670
but looking at people,
understanding people.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.220
And I think journalism,
classic journalism, which

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.995
is based in news and in very--

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.470
very speed way of seeing
things doesn't give you time

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.890
to really understand people.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.350
You see interviews every day
in newspapers and television.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.680
But those are very fast
ways of interviewing.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.230
What I wanted to do and
what I started doing

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.150
was taking time to do really,
really, really long interviews.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.730
And not only, as I said,
asking things, but sharing time

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
with these characters
I decided to interview.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.060
So I had the chance to
meet a lot of creators--

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.440
writers, painters,
photographers, chefs,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.430
architects, people from
all over the world.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.080
And what I wanted to do actually
was meeting these eccentric

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.320
people-- and by eccentric, I
mean they're not only weird

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.690
people, but they're eccentric
in the fact that they're not--

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.630
that they leave the
center of things

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.270
and they start thinking
differently, doing

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.640
a different approach at
what they do for a living.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.120
SPEAKER 1: Obviously
the vast array

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
of people that you could have
interviewed is quite broad.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.360
How did you go about going
from a potential list that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.680
would have been very
exhaustive to narrow it down

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.020
at the 16 characters that you--

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.380
FELIPE POMBO: Well, I
really didn't have so much

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.760
the opportunity to choose.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.590
Basically, I was given
the task to do it.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.180
So obviously, I decided
to focus on people,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.940
as we're speaking about, who
are really, really different,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.960
and who think
differently from others.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.500
So I started to travel
all over the world

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.840
when I was putting all
this profiles in my book.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.200
I did a quick calculation.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.027
And I've been doing the two
times the world traveling.

00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:42.610
SPEAKER 1: Oh, twice
around the world.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.360
FELIPE POMBO: Doing
this twice the world.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:53.520
And I started to direct common
things in these characters.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.080
First of all, they all
wanted to do something

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.770
that no one had ever done
before in their fields.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.610
And they had to
struggle a lot with this

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.710
because they were outsiders.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.440
They were seen as too
eccentric, as like they

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.900
were doing something
so different

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.010
that maybe they didn't
understand them first.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.830
But they keep on going, keep
on going, keep on going.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.030
And they became
worldwide celebrities.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.290
They are all very well known.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.020
They're very famous.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.211
But I'm not centering on the
fact that they are just famous,

00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:34.710
you know?

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.960
I think we live in a world that
is obsessed with famous people.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.480
And we get a lot of
information from famous people.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.060
And we don't even know
why they are famous,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.660
like the Kardashians
or the Justin Bieber

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.740
or people like that.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.120
We know they do things.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.510
But they're famous
because they're famous.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.560
So I wanted to see
what was behind that.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.310
SPEAKER 1: And then touching
on the commonality theme,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.500
what can you tell us about--

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.470
did you find anything common
in terms of their background

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.120
and their stories?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.410
You hinted at some
struggle, some elements

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.420
in their character.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.900
You know, are they obstinate?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.580
Are they optimistic?

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.160
What can you tell us in terms
of background and character

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.074
that you found common,
perhaps, across--

00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:26.490
FELIPE POMBO: Well, certainly,
they're not very optimistic

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.180
because I think when
you're too optimistic,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.430
you're kind of
naive because when

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.890
you want to create
something new,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.480
you have to be very detached
from this commodity,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.650
and certainly from a
naive view of the world.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.830
So most of them started--

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.610
they knew what they wanted to
do from a very young age, also.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.440
And as I said before, they had
to come a long way to do it.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:11.410
And most of them are, I think,
very lonely, very lonely.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.130
And there you are in constant
discussion with themselves.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.080
They are always asking
themselves, what they are doing

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.020
and how can they improve
what they are doing.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.850
And they are really, really,
really focusing on details.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.600
I think that's one thing
that's common in all

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.880
the characters, all of
these people that I've met.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.300
They are absolutely passionate
about what they do every day.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.730
They don't see them as a job.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.562
They see it as a way of living.

00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:47.020
SPEAKER 1: And if
you could, like--

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.930
just to bring some of
these elements to reality,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.080
maybe illustrate with
a couple of stories.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.530
If you could go into
specific stories of people,

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.930
how are they lonely?

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.910
How those elements that
you mentioned-- loneliness,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.040
not being optimistic--
if you could just

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.570
share a little bit of
the specifics of people.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.330
FELIPE POMBO:
Well, I always love

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.825
to tell one story
about one interview.

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:16.270
It's with a photographer.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.670
He's not that famous
as the others,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.820
but he's very well
known in New York.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.660
He's a fashion photographer.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.880
His name is Ruven Afanador.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.520
He was born in
Colombia, as I was.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.560
And from a very
young age he left

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:35.110
Colombia and he started to
become a fashion photographer.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.809
And now he's doing
covers for Vanity Fair,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:42.429
for all the great magazines,
fashion magazines, for Vogue.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:47.520
And I started to
look at his work

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.720
and to try to understand it.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.020
And I was always seeing
what he was doing,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.550
his photography books,
his fashion books.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.140
And I said, one day I'm
going to interview him.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.190
So I started looking for him.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.730
I started calling his
agent, his friends,

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.170
someone who could
lead me to him.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.480
And I was always
getting this no answer.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.060
No, he doesn't want
to get interview.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.500
No, he doesn't want journalist.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.710
No, he doesn't want
to get questions.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.760
But I insisted.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.140
I insisted and insisted.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.620
And I think that's
also a common thing,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.050
not only for me with them,
but with all of them.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.000
They are always insisting
in what they want.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.960
So I keep on going.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.740
I keep on going.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.110
I keep on going, calling people.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.470
Finally one day I got a call
from someone in New York.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.720
I was living in Mexico City.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.640
And she told me, hello, Felipe.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.070
I am Ruven's assistant.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.070
He's very curious on why
you're following him.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.490
He is kind of scared.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.450
And he wants to meet you.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.640
Can you come
tomorrow to New York?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.620
So I got a ticket and
I flew to New York.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.000
So I was there with this lady.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.470
And she said, we're so
happy that you're here.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.230
Ruben is going to invite
you to three of his shoots.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.680
He shoots very famous people.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.740
So the first day
he's going to shoot

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.510
Courtney Love, the widow
from the Nirvana singer,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.340
from Kurt Cobain.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.850
Sarah Jessica Parker
from Sex and the City.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.790
And the actor you might
maybe know, Hugh Grant.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.480
So he said he wants
you to be there.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.970
But first I have to warn
you, he doesn't want

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.440
to talk about his private life.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.148
He doesn't want to
talk about his family.

00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:42.460
He doesn't want to
talk about his work.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.570
OK, well, I'm here.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.130
I'm going to do the
interview and I'm

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.050
going to see how it works.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:53.680
So I was there the other day at
his huge studio in Manhattan.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.880
And I arrive and
they say, hello.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.380
We went.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.570
He's a very tall man.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.460
He's always dressed in black.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.760
He has this long beard,
all these tattoos.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.380
He's very, very strange.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.410
And I approached him.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.030
And I said, thank you so much.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.520
I wanted to ask you
about this shoot.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.540
And he was-- OK.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.860
And he left.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.410
OK, well, he doesn't
want to speak with me.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.480
So I insisted,
Ruven, how are you?

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.980
OK.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.146
I don't want to talk to you.

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:23.990
And he left.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.420
So I said, if I keep
asking him questions,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.980
he's going to feel
uncomfortable.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.990
So what I have to do is I
will be like a photographer

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.870
doing the photos
of a photographer.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.070
And I wanted to
see how he works.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.670
I wanted to be almost
invisible so then he

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.130
won't feel like I'm there.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.160
He will feel like he's
just doing his work

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.610
and I'm someone who is just
interested in what he's doing,

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.820
not like regular journalist
who is always asking question

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.170
and always want to
get some information.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.570
I just want to see and to feel
what it is to be with him.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.240
So he started doing all these
shoots with all these stars.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.280
There were, like, drugs,
alcohol, pictures everywhere.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.720
There was a lot of people.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.600
And I was just like
taking little notes,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.690
taking little notes,
no talking to anyone.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.060
I think looked
strange at that time,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.800
but OK, that's what I was doing.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.900
And finally he got
what I was doing.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.040
And he started saying,
OK, I do like these shots.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.510
I do like this.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.170
And we started talking,
talking, talking, like friends.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.330
And finally he told
me all his life.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.960
He told me what he
was working, why

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.880
he wanted to be a
photographer, how

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.350
was it to come from
Colombia to America,

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.280
to become this very well-known
fashion photographer.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.550
So I stayed, like,
four days with him.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.230
And then I go back.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.180
I get back to my
office and I started

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.360
writing the piece I
was supposed to write.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.460
But something was
missing from that

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.060
because when I want
to know someone,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.870
I'm not only asking him
what he thinks about life.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.950
I want to ask everyone who knows
him-- his friends, his family,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.360
his enemies--

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.830
to get the complete idea
of who that person is.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.330
So I decided to call his mother.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.140
It's always a good idea
to ask someone's mother.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.850
And I presented myself.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.660
I'm a journalist.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.430
I want to ask you
a few questions.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.290
She said, OK, great.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.560
And she told me a lot of
things about his childhood,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.180
about growing up in a
very Catholic family

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.190
and how they took Ruven when
he was a child to the churches.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.090
And he was fascinated with
this religious imagery.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:56.160
So I started understanding
what he was aesthetically

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.930
looking at.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.880
So I started writing.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.560
And I got a call from his agent.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.180
And she said, listen, we know
you spoke to Ruven's mother.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.860
I said, yes, yes.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.170
He doesn't want you to
publish anything about him.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.700
We said we couldn't call her.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.070
You couldn't call anyone.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.550
You said-- but, I
mean, that's what I do.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.600
That is my job.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.880
So I wrote the piece.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.610
I sent it to him.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.030
He liked it.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.600
He said he wouldn't want to
see me again in his life.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.495
But when you're doing
this kind of job,

00:14:29.495 --> 00:14:31.620
you don't want to be friends
with the people you're

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.280
writing about.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.800
You want to know them
but not becoming friends.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.230
So doing that exercise and
all the others that followed,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.460
I learned that these
people is always,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.830
always thinking about
what their job is

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.940
and about the art they do.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.260
And they want to really
cross the frontiers.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.750
And what I try to
do when I write

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.850
about them is doing the same--

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.560
crossing these boundaries.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.370
I don't know if I
answered your question.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.880
SPEAKER 1: No, a very
interesting story,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.760
and insightful.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.257
I like the piece about
adapting to your subject.

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:13.340
FELIPE POMBO: You have to.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.370
SPEAKER 1: And perhaps
if that was a tough one,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:23.090
you had to go a long way to
get to understand the subject,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.720
can you talk to us
about perhaps which

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.990
other interview was at the
other end of the spectrum?

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.060
Was there anybody with whom you
had an instant click and you

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.242
really--

00:15:35.242 --> 00:15:35.950
FELIPE POMBO: Yes

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.033
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] on?

00:15:37.033 --> 00:15:39.070
FELIPE POMBO:
They're never easy.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.390
But some you get--
obviously, you

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.480
have a lot of feeling with
some other characters.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.420
For instance, Ferran Adria.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.430
He is, like, this great chef.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.220
He lives in Barcelona
and he changed

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.750
the way we thought
about food in the '90s.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.580
And he has written
a lot of books.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.170
He had the best restaurant
in the world, called elBulli.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.440
So I was with him
in his kitchen.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.220
He was cooking.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.739
He was talking about
how he saw food.

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:12.530
And we were eating the
food he was making--

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.790
SPEAKER 1: Did he cook for you?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.820
FELIPE POMBO: Yeah,
he cooked for me.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.390
And that was--

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.306
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:15.306 --> 00:16:18.290
FELIPE POMBO: Yeah,
interviewing chefs

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.960
is great because they
give you great food.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.810
And I also interviewed
René Redze.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.110
He is from Denmark.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.800
He has the best restaurant
in the world, called Noma.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.130
And he was in Mexico.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.080
And he did a pop-up restaurant
in the beaches of Tulum.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.110
And I was there with him for
three days eating and talking

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.170
about food.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.940
So yeah, there are easier
interviews, in that sense.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.350
SPEAKER 1: And it's--

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:54.800
I had questions before
the talk about women.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.940
Were you able to--

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.750
who did you interview?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.270
Was it difficult to keep?

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.440
Or was that a main concern
for you at the beginning

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.859
to interview as
many women as men?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.790
How did you approach that?

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.290
And--

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.310
FELIPE POMBO: I don't
think that in those terms.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.210
But obviously there are
very interesting woman.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.650
And I don't see if they're men.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.220
I see just an
interesting creator.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.109
One of my first
interviews, actually,

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.630
was with a woman writer.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.270
Her name is Susan Sontag.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.430
She was one of the best American
writers of the last century.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.750
And I was really, really young
when I was interviewing him.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.090
And her agent told
me, listen, Felipe.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.820
You're going to
interview Susan, who

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.140
is a very well-known author.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.110
And there's one thing
she really hates.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.430
She hates stupid questions.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.240
So please don't be stupid.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.800
So I was preparing
for a week, trying

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.210
not to do stupid questions.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.420
And he told me, listen,
last week a journalist

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.490
came and asked a
really stupid question.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.780
And she throw a book at his
head, so please don't do that.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.720
So it was kind of scary.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.870
And in fact, she was
an adorable woman,

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.880
and is one of the best
interviews I have had.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.730
And I think I did all the
stupid questions I could,

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.640
but she was so interesting.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:26.030
And I think when those very
famous and very experienced

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.200
people see that you want to
learn something from them,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.580
they forget they're
in an interview.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.855
And I think the interview is
not like, here's the character

00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:36.480
and here's you.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.170
It's an equilibrium.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.265
And you're giving.

00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:41.585
They're giving you.

00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:44.060
You are doing an exchange.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.020
And that's what I think
a good interview is.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.000
And if you want I can tell
another story from a woman that

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.140
was one of the best interviews
I've done in my life.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.820
Her name is Ingrid Betancourt.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.190
She's also from Colombia.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.500
And she's a politician.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.390
And she was-- maybe
you heard the story--

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.470
she was kidnapped by the
[INAUDIBLE] for seven years.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.540
She was in the jungle
and she was kept there

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.790
tied to a tree for many years.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.120
So I wanted to interview
her because she

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.280
wrote a book after
being kidnapped

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.680
that became a best seller.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:30.920
And I wanted to know
what was in her mind

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.330
because sometimes when you
think about other people,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.440
it's kind of comfortable.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.210
You say, oh, they're doing
that because they think that--

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.860
oh, they-- but if you
really want to know them,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.410
you have to put yourself
in the same situation.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.010
Obviously, she lived through
this absurd situation

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.590
that you could never
understand what

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.860
is happening to someone
mind while she's

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.550
living this kind of thing.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.190
So I also started following her,
following her, following her,

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.760
sending e-mails, calling people.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.000
And when she got
away from the kidnap,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.910
I got to interview her
in the French embassy.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.890
And I've prepared, like, these
complex questions, these very

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.950
insightful questions,
to know what

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:27.990
happened to her during these
seven years of being kidnapped.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.540
And when I arrived
there, she was, like,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.695
this very nice woman,
very relaxed, very--

00:20:34.695 --> 00:20:37.920
you would say,
like, enlightened.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.940
She was telling
these huge stories.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.660
And I forgot everything
I had prepared.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.110
And I just sat there
and listened to her.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.720
And I did, like, two
or three questions

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.835
because I think that is--

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.460
in some cases, you
just have to listen.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.490
SPEAKER 1: The best approach,
to be really mindful

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.010
of your subject.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.115
Very, very interesting.

00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:04.350
Yeah, I was familiar
with the case.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.650
Now, go into your
current work, just

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.580
if you can spend very briefly.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.880
A, what are you working on?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.640
But most importantly,
how do you feel

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.970
that this experience of talking
to these different people

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.080
and your approach influences
what you're doing?

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.430
FELIPE POMBO: Well, I work lot.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.420
I'm the editor in chief
for a magazine in Mexico.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.210
But I am also a fiction writer.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:39.970
And as you said earlier, I
was chosen in this list of 40

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.702
under 40 writers, the
best 40 under 40 writers

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:44.410
in Latin America.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.770
And I'm happy about that,
mainly because there's people

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.030
who think I'm still young.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.000
That's great.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:02.440
But I'm focusing on fiction
because you're writing,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.840
when you're writing
fiction, you get

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.380
to interview maybe the most
difficult character you have

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.770
to interview, and that's you.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.080
And getting to know you
and getting to see what's

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.310
inside your head,
what ideas are there

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.650
that you haven't
explored that you

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.460
want to know about yourself.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.190
So I wrote a novel.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.027
And I'm writing the next one.

00:22:26.027 --> 00:22:27.610
I don't know when
I'm going to finish.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.600
I hope soon.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.670
But I've learned
a lot from others.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.770
And all these long
interviews, these years

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.880
of interviewing, of traveling,
of meeting interesting people,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.560
certainly have changed me.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:48.130
And I think now I'm someone
who is more prepared to listen,

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.100
as I said, and to see,
and to see the world,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.910
and to understand that everyone
has a different reality.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.522
And that's what makes
the world great.

00:22:58.522 --> 00:22:59.980
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.610
Final question before I open
the floor for questions.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.010
And this is something
I have to answer.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.200
You're from Colombia, obviously.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.350
You live in Mexico and you
have traveled around the world.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.280
Something that
we're seeing now is

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.310
we need to be confronted with,
and continue to be confronted

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.810
with, the classic stereotypes--

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.870
violence, drug trafficking,
particularly now

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.287
the glorification
of drug dealers.

00:23:27.287 --> 00:23:28.411
FELIPE POMBO: Drug dealers.

00:23:28.411 --> 00:23:30.040
SPEAKER 1: All the
Narcos, Netflix,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.960
the new movie from Tom Cruise.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.730
A different type of
eccentricity, no?

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.686
In a way--

00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:40.060
FELIPE POMBO: Way
more dangerous.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.309
SPEAKER 1: Way more dangerous.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.660
Do you think throughout the
time that you have been work

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:52.230
that this perception
about Latin America

00:23:52.230 --> 00:24:00.500
is improving, is getting
worse, is the same?

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.831
I have a view and
that's very subjective.

00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:04.830
But you're a journalist.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.130
So hopefully you can be--

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.080
FELIPE POMBO: Perceptions
are a hard thing

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.610
to explain, obviously.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.140
But yes, it's where--

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.410
I always-- when I
travel, I always

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.420
get the same question,
if I have seen Narcos,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.710
if I have seen Pablo Escobar.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.291
Of course.

00:24:25.291 --> 00:24:25.790
Of course.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.280
But I don't really
get upset about that

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.370
because it's something that
happened and you cannot hide

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.570
it.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.730
You cannot say it didn't happen.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:38.480
Or you cannot say those
things don't keep on happening

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.750
in Mexico and in Latin America.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.240
As you know, Mexico is
the most dangerous place

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.890
to be a journalist in the world.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.750
Journalists are killed,
kidnapped, threatened

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.790
every day.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:57.860
In fact, I edited a book that
was published here in the UK

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.130
called "The Sorrows of
Mexico" about how hard it

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.280
is to be a journalist
in these kind of places.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.030
So I don't try to hide things.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.980
Of course they happen.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:13.040
But that's not the only
thing that happens.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.070
There's people doing art.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.020
There's people doing movies.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.870
There's people
doing architecture.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.920
And most of the fascinating
characters I've met

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.570
are from Latin America.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:31.310
And they're forced to work
and to create in a very

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.620
hostile ambience sometimes.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.570
And so I think it's not
a thing to be ashamed of.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.235
On the contrary,
you have to be proud

00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:43.250
that there are so many great
things coming from Latin

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.030
America despite all the
corruption, all the violence,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.760
and all the hard things
that happen there.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:56.510
So I don't know about the
glorification of drug dealers.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.860
I mean, if Netflix is getting
rich with it, let them do that.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.242
SPEAKER 1: So be it.

00:26:03.242 --> 00:26:05.450
So if there was one thing
that you would like anybody

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.270
to know or to take
away from Colombia,

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.680
your beautiful country,
what would that be?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.724
FELIPE POMBO: One thing--

00:26:12.724 --> 00:26:14.390
SPEAKER 1: What one
thing you would like

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.830
people to know about Colombia?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.760
FELIPE POMBO: Me?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.690
No, I don't know.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:25.460
I mean, obviously Colombia
and Mexico, which is also

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.080
a country I feel
very attached to

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.340
and all Latin America
is a place to discover.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.800
I don't want to sound
here like a travel agency.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.990
But you have to go
there and to see things

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.610
and to understand how
things happen differently

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:43.640
in other parts of the world
and not just stay there

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.660
with the stereotypes.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.320
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.360
So now we'll open the
floor to anybody who

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.390
would like to ask a question.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.090
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
when you are in interviews

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.650
it's partly an exchange.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.320
So I was curious about
what type of information

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.990
you share with the subjects
you're interviewing

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.052
and how that exchange works.

00:27:05.052 --> 00:27:07.010
FELIPE POMBO: Yeah, that's
a very good question

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.940
because when you go
to a journalist school

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.730
the first thing they tell you
is you can't share anything

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.620
with the person you
are interviewing.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.950
You can't say anything
about yourself.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:24.740
Being a journalist is
being absolutely objective.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.840
And of course, that's a lie,
because when you're deciding

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.620
to do an interview, when you're
choosing a person, when you're

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.100
choosing the questions you want
to do, you're doing a decision.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.900
And that's your decision.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.910
And that's called subjectivity.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:47.690
So if I'm doing an interview
and the person is asking me

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.110
some things, or if I'm
commenting on something,

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.130
it's me.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.670
It's me and I want that
person to know who I am.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.690
And that will make
him more human.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.420
Sometimes journalists
think doing an interview is

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:08.180
like doing a police thing.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.990
That's not at all like that.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.100
It's sharing.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.640
It's sharing and it's
getting that empathy

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.900
that will lead you to see
some things different.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.900
AUDIENCE: From your book,
which-- you've already

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.240
told one or two stories.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.990
So maybe you've already said it.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.341
But who surprised you the
most when you interviewed?

00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:30.590
Who gave you a story that
maybe you weren't expecting?

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.680
FELIPE POMBO: Well, it's
always hard to answer

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.280
that because I like to think
that every experience gives me

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.420
something.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.500
But I was very,
very moved to true

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.155
to know Clint Eastwood,
the actor, the director.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.340
He's one of the best
directors of the last years.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.350
And he gave me the chance to
interview him in Los Angeles

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:06.780
while he was presenting a
movie called "Gran Torino."

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.170
So I was there.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.130
And I was very, very
scared because I'm always

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.320
scared when I'm doing
these kind of things

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.165
because I don't want to be--

00:29:15.165 --> 00:29:16.290
I don't want to mess it up.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.170
And you know, meeting
these famous people needs

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.840
a lot of preparation,
a lot of coordination

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.130
from different teams
and everything.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.020
But I was there.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.480
And he was the only
journalist from Latin America

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.260
who he was going to talk with.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.360
The only one was me.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.820
So I arrived.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.620
And he was in, like, his
very beautiful office

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.460
in Los Angeles.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.380
And we started
talking and talking.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.830
And he said, listen,
there's something

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.060
I hate about interviews,
and that is that they never

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.650
give me anything to eat.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.600
So do you want to go and
get cookies and coffee?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.910
And I said, yeah, sure.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:04.590
And so we went to a coffee shop.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.310
And I was there.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.810
And he was-- do
you want chocolate?

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.750
I was-- whatever you want.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.420
I will eat whatever you want.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.960
So I was sitting there
with Clint Eastwood

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.050
for a whole afternoon
eating cookies and coffee

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.990
and getting to know
the person that I've

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.360
seen for years on the screen.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:29.256
And that obviously is a thing
that you will remember forever.

00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:31.232
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:31.232 --> 00:30:32.220
Hi.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.350
Being a book on eccentrics, my
favorite eccentrics of the list

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.400
is Tim Burton.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.900
And I follow him since forever.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.500
So do you want to maybe
share with us a little bit

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.020
about that experience?

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.700
FELIPE POMBO: Yeah,
he was very shy.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.430
He was super shy.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:53.420
And actually he is in the
category of interviewers

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.270
that don't speak.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.450
I was there sitting with
him in New York, I remember.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.240
And he wouldn't want to talk.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.350
He was, like, very shy.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.330
And he was, like, playing
with a little toy.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.850
And he was like--

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.890
but when he spoke, he
said brilliant things.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.890
He spoke little, but very,
very interesting things.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.290
And what I did there
was also to let him be.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:18.860
Let him be.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.350
And if an interviewee
doesn't speak,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.050
well, you have to tell
that in your piece,

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.179
that he doesn't speak.

00:31:33.739 --> 00:31:34.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.510
Something you've
said at the beginning

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.216
is that most of these
eccentric people you've met

00:31:39.216 --> 00:31:40.590
have a few things
in common which

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.290
show that they were
really dedicated

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.910
from early on in their lives.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.850
They had this goal in their
lives they wanted to pursue

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:51.650
and they were very
attentive to details.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.240
And, like, maybe a bit obsessed.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.823
I mean, you haven't said that,
but it sounded a bit like that.

00:31:55.823 --> 00:32:00.680
Do you think some people would
refer these guys as maybe

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.210
like having a bit of
a mental condition?

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.330
Have you felt that?

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.160
FELIPE POMBO: Yes, of course.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.920
AUDIENCE: Have you felt that?

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.420
FELIPE POMBO: And I
didn't say obsession.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.753
But of course, I said obsession.

00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:10.970
Of course, they're obsessive.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:14.030
And I like to think
I am obsessive, too.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.930
But I don't think it is
necessarily a bad thing.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but do
you think that's actually

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.450
because these people have been
maybe trusted and recognized

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.360
at some point and they
have been given the chance

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.390
to express their art
in this specific way

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.820
that they are being famous
and brilliant and everything,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.970
but actually maybe--

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.270
I mean, makes me think of
Kusama, the Japanese artist,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.860
as well, who's doing
this kind of stuff.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.100
Maybe more people-- you
think maybe more people who

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.900
have these mental
conditions could actually

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.950
become as brilliant?

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.782
Or there's something else to it?

00:32:46.782 --> 00:32:49.240
FELIPE POMBO: Well, I think
everyone has a mental condition

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.200
at some point.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.340
So I don't like to see the
world in black and white.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.720
I mean, this person is normal.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.030
This one is not.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:04.540
There's a lot of gray spaces
between those two things.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.010
And yes, of course,
if you become

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.770
the best in the
world in something,

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:16.900
there's a great degree
of obsession, of passion.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.900
But I don't know if they should
be medicated in a hospital

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.710
or creating what they
do or doing great films,

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.899
doing great books.

00:33:26.899 --> 00:33:27.940
I prefer them doing that.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.500
AUDIENCE: Do you think your
process was an eccentric one?

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.970
Or is it like kind of meticulous
preparation and longer-form

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.140
pieces?

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.020
Do you find yourself
identifying with your subjects?

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.770
FELIPE POMBO: Yes,
of course I do.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.570
And I don't know if I
invented this process

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.810
because a lot of journalists
do the same things.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.330
But I created my own process.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.880
I created my own
writing process.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.600
I created my own system
to do interviews.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.290
And of course I like
to be an eccentric.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.390
Of course, if I'm
interested in those people,

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.880
it's because I see things, and
I've learned from those things

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.190
that I feel attached to.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.719
And maybe that's a
degree of obsession.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.800
When I work on a piece,
I work for months.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.810
And for instance, for this
text on Ingrid Betancourt

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.170
that I told you about,
I worked for six months.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:32.489
And I interviewed not only her,
I interviewed 30 or 35 people

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.199
around her around the world.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.270
I make a lot of phone calls.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:40.050
I tape all these recordings.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:42.330
I transcribe them.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:46.880
And I don't want
to miss a detail.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.260
So yes, of course,
I don't know if I'm

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.210
such an eccentric as they are.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.493
But I like to think
a little bit, yes.

00:34:54.493 --> 00:34:55.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.310
Yes.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.170
I myself, I'm from
Curacao and I've

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.500
been living in the
UK for a while.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.890
I had a question about
what it's like to be

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.370
a Colombian in Mexico.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.190
I've been to Mexico
twice myself and I

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:18.440
know it's very different from
Colombia, where I've also been.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.570
What are your main
struggles there

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:27.660
when it comes to building
connections or adapting?

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.410
FELIPE POMBO: It's
always hard to adapt

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.190
from a different environment.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:39.210
And what I like to do is kind
of the same exercise I do when

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.530
I'm doing these interviews.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:44.250
And first of all, I'm I'm
watching and listening

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.420
and understanding how things
work in a different place.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.460
You know, it's like kind of
doing a profile on a place,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.740
on a new country
you're living in.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.250
And Mexico is a very
particular place.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.360
It's a very particular
country because it has such

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.910
an impressive cultural history.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.390
There are places there who--

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.100
I mean, there were people
there doing things long,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:21.840
long before there
was even other things

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.360
in other parts of the world.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:30.570
So you have to adapt
and to understand.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.610
I mean, I think it will
be the same to move

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.670
to any other country.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.700
I've lived in France.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.890
I've been in other places.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:46.260
And every time it's so
great to see how people

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.610
look at things differently.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.890
In Mexico, obviously,
there is a kind of a--

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.150
well, I don't want
to say a civil war.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.080
There's now a lot of violence.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.800
There are a lot of problems
because of the drug

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.010
trafficking.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.750
But it's also a place
that's very alive.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.580
And I like to think
that in places

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:11.918
where death is so present,
life becomes a celebration.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.900
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to
know who's next on your list

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.820
and why.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.290
FELIPE POMBO: That's the secret.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.240
I can't tell you, sorry.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.740
No, I don't know.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.630
I don't know.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.310
We'll see.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:38.320
Last January I was in Madrid.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.817
I was interviewing
Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:37:40.817 --> 00:37:41.900
Maybe you've heard of him.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.840
He's the Nobel Prize winner.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.760
And I stayed at his
home for two days

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:53.890
interviewing him and meeting
him and seeing how he wrote.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.740
And that was a
fantastic experience.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.869
I don't know who's next.

00:37:58.869 --> 00:37:59.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.430
Does being eccentric
always translate

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:11.890
into having difficult
personal relationships,

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:15.340
or is this just a stereotype
which has been propagated?

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.150
FELIPE POMBO: Relationships
you mean like--

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.830
like a girlfriend or boyfriend?

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean family.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.163
FELIPE POMBO: Or a family.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.980
Well, I haven't
thought about that.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.490
But maybe as I
told Salvadore, it

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.190
implies a little
bit of loneliness,

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:38.020
of solitude, and to
spend time with you.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.400
And I don't think
that that necessary

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.150
means you can't have a family
or a relationship or children.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:54.030
But it does mean you have to
spend a lot of time alone,

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:58.720
creating-- for me, a
least at the first stages,

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.020
it's a very, very lonely work.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.380
You have to be with
you and understanding.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.000
And all these eccentrics,
I think they have that.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.029
They've been alone
for a long time.

00:39:11.029 --> 00:39:12.570
Many of them have
a family, actually,

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:17.570
and they have children and
they have a normal life.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:21.720
But if you decide to go
that way, to have a family,

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.420
you have to have your
time to be alone thinking

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.830
about your ideas.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.110
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] I
think you had a question, no?

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:31.590
AUDIENCE: If there's time.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.070
SPEAKER 1: Huh?

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.030
AUDIENCE: If there's time.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.990
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, of course.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.270
FELIPE POMBO: Yes, we have
all the time in the world.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.610
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, in the modern world

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.400
of social media and so
much content and so much

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.060
what they call noise, it must
be so difficult to stand out

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.530
from the crowd, right?

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:50.070
So how do you walk the
balance between standing out

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.740
from the crowd but not
being sensational--

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:58.340
not sensationalize a subject,
to be fair to the subject

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.040
without doing that?

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.729
FELIPE POMBO: You
mean in general?

00:40:01.729 --> 00:40:03.270
AUDIENCE: It must
be important to you

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:07.680
not to focus on one particular
aspect of a subject's life

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.790
because it might--

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.371
because it risks
making sensationalists.

00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:13.620
FELIPE POMBO: Yeah, of course.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.520
AUDIENCE: Because
you want to be fair,

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.970
it seems to me from
what you've said.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:16.980
That you want to be
fair to the subjects.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.640
FELIPE POMBO: Not
necessarily fair.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.150
But I want to see everything
I can to give them the wider

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:28.380
approach to that person.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.050
And I agree with you.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.900
We live in a world where
there's information everywhere

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.220
all the time.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.240
You can find information
every second, new one.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.720
And I think we
live in a world now

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.460
and that's sometimes something
journalists like to do

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.730
is to see things, as I
said, in black and white.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.550
And there's good people
and there's bad people.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.830
And that's how the world works.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.320
I like to take the time to
see that's not always true,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.970
and that you can
find a lot of things

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:09.650
in a story, a lot of things.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.510
And if you show them, if
you show the whole story,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.750
then you will let other
people to decide if they

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.950
think it's black or white.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.640
But you as a
journalist, as a writer,

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.620
you don't have to tell them,
listen, this is like that.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.460
And you have to think
this about this person.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.770
And it's very effective.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.260
And we see it every time
in the social media.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.740
We do all this thing about
fake news and everything.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.866
It's very easy to sell you--

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:39.850
AUDIENCE: Extremes.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.320
FELIPE POMBO: Extremes.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:41.825
Yeah.

00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.450
And that's what
happening in the world.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.590
And that's why so
many bad things

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.510
are happening, because
you're not letting people

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.450
to see the whole picture,
to think about it,

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.600
and to decide what
they think about it.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.090
You're giving them
bad information.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.780
So yes, the kind of
journalism I want to do,

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.390
the kind of work
I want to do, is

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:10.900
one that gives you the
chance to see everything.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.500
And you have to take
time to read things

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.660
and to think about things.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.030
I think we're not thinking
a lot about many things.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.580
And that's why the
world is like that.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:27.060
SPEAKER 1: Felipe, thank
you very, very much for--

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.556
was there any other question?

00:42:28.556 --> 00:42:29.419
FELIPE POMBO: Yes.

00:42:29.419 --> 00:42:30.460
SPEAKER 1: There was one?

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.220
Sorry.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.870
FELIPE POMBO: Salvadore
has to go, that's why--

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.030
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about the eccentricities

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.050
that you mentioned.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:45.519
So you've mentioned
artists and photographers

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:46.560
and chefs and everything.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.540
So I'm just wondering if
you could share the most

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.790
kind of empowering
characteristic

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.100
that you've come across in
the form of whether it's

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.860
a practice or a mantra or
something that all of us

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.340
here at Google can imbibe,
regardless of a primary focus.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.584
FELIPE POMBO: Like, a main
characteristic of all this

00:43:09.584 --> 00:43:10.500
that you could apply--

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.309
AUDIENCE: The most
influential eccentricity

00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:15.760
that you've come across that
can be a universal thing

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.710
to take home?

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.490
FELIPE POMBO: Well,
I've maybe repeated it,

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:28.620
but not being afraid of breaking
the rules that are there.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.960
And if it means you
have to leave your job

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.460
and you have to start on
your own something and--

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.310
for instance, I get
all the time this idea

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.950
that journalism has to
be fast and that you

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.310
have to give information all
the time and that you have--

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.600
well, I don't want
to go with that.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.100
And if I have to start
everything and to do my work

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.030
and breaking these rules,
I'm not afraid to do that.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.760
And that's something I've
learned from these people.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.380
They're not afraid to be
called crazy, to be called--

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.950
and of course, we know
the success cases.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.720
We don't know many
of the failure cases.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.810
But that will be a
clear characteristic--

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.330
not being afraid of
being who you are

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.800
and standing for what you think.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.050
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much,
Felipe, and sorry to cut--
