1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,290
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,370
We're going to keep going with our show
on colors now with a story about, well,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,270
hey blue, the color of the
sky, most beautiful color. No

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,730
red. Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,410
It's a story that we find
really surprising frankly.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,610
And it comes from our producer Tim
Howard. Yes. Hello. Um, who, uh,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,720
heard it from [inaudible]
set up who this guy is. Uh,

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,910
so Guy Deutscher is a
linguist and a writer and uh,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,720
I came across his book or through the
language glass and he tells this one

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,220
particular story in it that, uh,

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,970
starts in I think 1858 with
this Guy William Gladstone,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,480
who was incredibly famous
politician in England.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,980
He was four times prime minister in
the second half of the 19th centuries.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,320
Every school kid knows who he is even now.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,500
But there's one thing that not many
people know about Gladstone, but he was a,

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,620
a home of fanatic. Those,
the soldiers marched.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,270
The gleam went dazzling
from the magnificent bronze
all about through the upper

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,710
air to the heavens. He was a
deeply religious man. And for him,

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,740
the Iliad and Odyssey were almost like
a second Bible sipping the black blood,

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,140
the tall shade, perceive
pain and cried out shot.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,320
He read them over and over
again throughout his life.
So he was in the homer.

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,870
Yes. And so early on in his career,

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,620
Gladstone decided to write the
definitive history of homer,

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,780
his huge book, actually three
books, thousands of pages way.

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,230
He discussed a whole range of issues
relating to home and his wallet.

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,580
And here's the thing, as he was reading,
doing his research and everything,

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,010
he made this very strange discovery.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,150
[inaudible]

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,600
that's the way home I talks
about [inaudible] in the Iliad.

30
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:54,010
And the Odyssey is extremely
odd. It's odd. Very, very odd.

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,480
How so? To start with uses
extremely strange times,

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,640
four colors of, of simple objects. The
most famous one perhaps is the wine,

33
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:08,110
dark sea, the wine, wine, dark wine,
dark seats eight. It looks like wine.

34
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,250
Looks like wine. It is, it possibly
like a, a poetic kind of thing.

35
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:15,850
And that's what you would naturally
think. But the other thing he calls, um,

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,310
wine color, uh, oxen,

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,400
but, but it's more than just
a wine take the color violet,

38
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,810
which to me and probably to universal
purple like purple. And homer uses it.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,790
He talks about the sheep
and the side clubs.

40
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:35,740
Rams were in the cyclops caves
is having a dark violent wool.

41
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,690
But that's just fantasy. I mean,

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,730
but the other thing that he also
says is violet is iron iron.

43
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,030
So chew on that or how about this one?

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,030
What is both the color of
honey and the color of, uh,

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,310
faces Pale with fear. I had
no idea. If you ask homer,

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,550
those are green, green honey.

47
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,180
He didn't call his green, he
didn't call his leaves green. Um,

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,760
it all seems to be wrong. And, um,
this was totally puzzling to Gladstone.

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,370
Hobo was Gladstone's absolute hero.

50
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,200
So he found it difficult to understand
and accept why someone who was so

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,640
perceptive would use such defective
terms as Gladston colleague.

52
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,420
So he starts going through the Iliad
and the Odyssey again and page by page,

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,760
and he counts how many
times each color appears.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,830
I mean like how many times he uses the
word black or blue or whatever. Yeah.

55
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,390
And um, it only takes a couple
pages for him to notice.

56
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Predominance of black and white that
the term black carrion flat black Bros,

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,180
black, black, black, black, black,

58
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:48,470
black occurred about 170
times in both books. White,

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,810
white arms, white club, the white

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,200
curd about 100 times.

61
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,540
But red blood,

62
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:02,541
red serpent only clocks in at about 13
times the red wine to the exotic Trump,

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,910
yellow in her yellow robe
row under 10 times Greens,

64
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,070
teeth chattering, green
fear also under 10 mm.

65
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,050
And then Gladstone realizes
something crazy, the color blue,

66
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,013
um,

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,100
zero times what there's just no word
that describes the color blue in any of

68
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:32,880
Homer's poems. He does not use
the word blue at all. No blue,

69
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,500
no blue. Not even once. Nope.
So Gladstone Thought, Huh?

70
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,660
Bazaar. And he started looking
in other classic Greek texts too.

71
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,890
And there he kept finding all
of these strange uses of color,

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,890
violet hat and things like that.

73
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,310
And after thinking about
this for a long time,

74
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,090
Gladstone concluded that
homo was kind of blind,

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,790
but also that all the Greeks
were kind of blind. We,

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,940
he thought all of them
were colorblind. Yes.

77
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,320
That they saw the world in black and
white, maybe with a touch of red.

78
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,730
His thought was that they were straining
to see these other colors that were

79
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,860
kind of just outside of their reach.

80
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,890
And then their kid would inherit that
effort or their kid would just be a little

81
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,560
bit better. Oh. So
that's how we got color.

82
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,440
So homer junior would be able
to see a little bit of yellow,

83
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,910
cause homer tried really hard to
see yellow and you then homer,

84
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,080
the third would be better than home or
the second and then this would happen

85
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,220
again. And again, every generation
down 3000 years to the present day,

86
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,300
it just seemed the only, you know,
the, the only possible explanation.

87
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,160
That's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
We know today of course,

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,660
seven that, that the color vision goes
back probably about 30 million years,

89
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:54,750
you know, to like when we were still
in the jungle climbing trees. Exactly.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,010
So I'm generally people Ma

91
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,910
[inaudible].

92
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,080
No one took him seriously.

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,760
So then how do people explain the
no blue and homer thing? Well, here,

94
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,930
the plot thickens. 10 years after
Gladstone's homered debacle.

95
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,370
This other guy and gentleman, Jewish
penologist called Lazarus guy again,

96
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,740
Lazarus Geiger, a German
Jewish, what did he say?

97
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,810
Philologists which I
thought was a linguist.

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,240
It basically means he
studies ancient texts.

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,470
He finds pretty much the same
kind of weird stuff Gladstone did,

100
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,480
but he finds it not just an ancient Greek
texts, but all over the place. Sorry,

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,140
this one, he looked at
the old Icelandic Sagas

102
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,930
[inaudible] ancient Chinese Joan
Susa. Young, ancient vedic hymns.

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
[inaudible] Stephie, the Bible

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,160
[inaudible] and surprise, surprise.
What did he find there? No blue.

105
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,580
Even the Bible had no blood
in the original Hebrew
[inaudible] Vinnie of Hahaha.

106
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,410
It has no blue. Huh? So where,
what's this? What's this room?

107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,420
Right now we're in the
public catalog room.

108
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,450
I actually went to the New York public
library and talked to this librarian and

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,950
to Vic [inaudible] can speak German,
so and fic long can shake the dementia.

110
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:21,060
And we got out Geiger's book development,
history of mankind. Wait a second.

111
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:25,080
I know this voice. Really? Yeah,
that's, that's my girlfriend. Oh,

112
00:07:25,081 --> 00:07:29,010
my name is Brooke Watkins and I'm a
librarian at the New York public library.

113
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,220
She is a librarian. Very cool
passenger. Does speak to daggers books.

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,360
See at first let's do it in German. Guy
Again has this amazing quotation. Okay.

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,420
It's fast. You hear about the Indian
vedic poems, these Alita [inaudible],

116
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,750
Jane towels and vans and
[inaudible]. What does that say?

117
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,760
She's hymns of more than 10,000 lines
are brimming with descriptions of the

118
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,720
heavens. Scarcely. Is there any
subject evoked more frequently?

119
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,460
The Sun and reddening. Don's play of
color, day and night. Cloud. Enlightening.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,990
The air in the ether and efs are
unfolded before us and over and over in

121
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,120
splendor. And did it fullness. Well,

122
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,600
there's only one thing that no one would
ever learn from those ancient songs who

123
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:13,050
do not already know it. And
that is that the sky is blue.

124
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,883
Who? Who?

125
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,450
It gets weirder. Hmm. You're ready? Yeah.

126
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,520
Ready for this and totally ready.
Alright. Cause Geiger then wondered,

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,550
all right, if there's no blue
in any of these old texts,

128
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,970
then when did blue come
into these languages? Yeah,

129
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,950
so he did this massive analysis to
trace when each color term was first

130
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,450
introduced to each language.

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,570
And what he found was that the order at
which languages seem to acquire these

132
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,520
kind of Thames is not entirely random.

133
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,820
[inaudible]

134
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,670
first black and white. Every
language has black and white.

135
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,990
Then when they get their first
color term, red always comes fast.

136
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,380
Always red after red. It's
always yellow. Really? Yeah.

137
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,090
And then green and blue only to
very end. So black, white, red,

138
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:06,570
green, yellow and then blue.
Yeah. And that's universal. Well,

139
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,560
as people discovered more and more
languages, they found some exceptions,

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
but a couple of things held even
from Geiger out of these colors.

141
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,520
Red Is always first and
blue is always last. Why?

142
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,740
Well, why would there be an order at
all and why would blue always be last?

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,150
Well, here's where you get
to the guessing part. Okay.

144
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,680
Thinks it might have to do with a couple
of things. First in Homer's world,

145
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,190
you wouldn't have actually been exposed
to a lot of blue things. Actually,

146
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:36,990
if you think about it, blue is
extremely rare in nature. Blue Foods,

147
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,510
no blue animals know. How about
plants? There's a few blue plants,

148
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,230
like what flowers it I really
blue eyes. Extremely rare.

149
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,490
A lot of flowers that we think of as
blue. They're actually artificial flowers.

150
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,120
We made them blue genetically
man. Yeah. What about Blue Eyes?

151
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,470
Blue Eyes at the time. Way In
short supply. I'm among the Greeks,

152
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,780
but here's where we get
to guy's main point.

153
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,510
He says you don't really need a word
for color until you can make that color

154
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,070
reliably and the reason they're red
might have been first is that red is

155
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,320
apparently one of the easiest to produce.

156
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,090
You can just take a dried piece of
red clay and you can use that as a

157
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:16,980
[inaudible],

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,690
which is why paints made out of oak or
go back something like 60,000 years and

159
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,220
blue. Blue is the hardest of
all. For thousands of years.

160
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,440
No one had it. One exception, the
Egyptians, the Egyptians, and they,

161
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:36,210
and only they had their own word for
blue. So that's it. That's your answer.

162
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,080
Yeah. Like no blue dyes. No blue words.

163
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,400
That's not interesting. I want more
than that. What do you mean more?

164
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,660
I don't know. Something more to
say than just it's about all right,

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,640
here you go.

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,473
As I was calling around,

167
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,310
I ran into something that made me think
a little differently about Gladstone's

168
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:02,720
whole theory of colorblindness
called this guy named Jules Davidoff,

169
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,510
professor of newest
psychology, London University,

170
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,310
and a few years back he got interested
in this particular tribe in Namibia

171
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,700
called the Himba Himba many
languages in the world.

172
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,710
They don't have a different word for blue.

173
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,250
You might think of them as like a very
poor stand in for homer. All right,

174
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,650
and to make a long story
short, Joseph went to Namibia.

175
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,170
He sat down with a bunch of
members of the Himba tribe,

176
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,740
whipped out a laptop and
showed them 12 colored squares,

177
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,420
or I didn't except for one.

178
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,960
And there's actually some really cool
video footage of his research assistant

179
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,780
doing this and they
asked them very simply,

180
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,580
which one is different now that you
look at this and you see the 11 of these

181
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:43,730
squares are green [inaudible]
we would call green, very green.

182
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,830
The other one is blue. This blue one,
it's, it's shouting. It's like, Hey,

183
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,740
I'm bayou over here. I'm blue.
It's easy enough for us to do.

184
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,510
It would be, yeah, it's a no brainer,

185
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,390
but the Himba who don't have a separate
word for blue in their language,

186
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,840
they find this distinction
and that are difficult.

187
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,460
When they stare at this screen,

188
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,880
they just stare and stare.
They don't see the difference.

189
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,330
They don't know was there something
wrong with their eyes. Now,

190
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:15,940
definitely not completely rule that out.

191
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,940
They don't see color and
individual colors differently,

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,120
but then it's so easy to say that they're
seeing different colors to us and then

193
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:29,110
not, well then how does he
explain it? Okay. When we,

194
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:34,111
when we decide to put colors together
in a group and then give those colors a

195
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:38,680
word like blue, something
happens. He says,

196
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,680
what happens is that now that
there's a category for that thing,

197
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,350
the thing in the category jumps out,

198
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,770
it gets louder and louder to your eyes.

199
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,570
The category actually feeds back on
your perception. So you notice it more.

200
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,500
You're saying that having the word for
blue unlocks your ability to see blue.

201
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,070
I mean it, that's how it feels
to me. And jewel says no,

202
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,410
it's not caught that he
says without the word,

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,170
you're still seeing the blue no
matter what. You're just not. Um,

204
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,630
noticing it.

205
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,740
Your eyes are just kind of glossing
right over it so you don't see it.

206
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,800
It's hard. It's, it's, it's harder
to spot. It says jewels, whatever.

207
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,180
I don't quite understand that difference.

208
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:25,740
But blue would not jump out and say
high five the way it does with us.

209
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,200
But if it doesn't jump out to that extent,

210
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,250
then this is starting to
sound very Gladstone to me.

211
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,900
I mean maybe he was a little right. Like,

212
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,900
cause if homer had no
word for blue in the word,

213
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,180
somehow enables the blueness of the blue,

214
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,900
then maybe his world was less
blue than it would be for us.

215
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,300
I mean maybe the blue went
through his eyes in the same way,

216
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,990
but perhaps didn't get into
his mind in the same way. Yeah.

217
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,020
Blue didn't matter.

218
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,480
Wait a second. Do you know
where this breaks down?

219
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,020
Where deaf sky.

220
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,040
I mean you look up and there's the bluest
blue in the world and it's right there

221
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,260
above our head. It's been
there since the dawn of time.

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,650
So why wouldn't blue matter more? I mean,

223
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:12,550
why wouldn't it be the first
color instead of the last? Well,

224
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,140
that's what I thought too. And
I asked guy about that. Yeah.

225
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:19,550
Why is the sky blue? Is, is the, the,
the first question is that you allegedly,

226
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,700
the first question that
all children ask. Yeah,

227
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,660
but I wanted to see how obvious or
striking this blueness of the skies.

228
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,190
So I decided to make an experiment.

229
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,173
Uh,

230
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,940
guy has a very young daughter, 18
months. She was learning to speak.

231
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,610
What's her name? Um,

232
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,880
I talked a lot about colors with
Emma and taught her all the colors,

233
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:41,720
including blue.

234
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,410
And we would play all these games
there that dads play with the children,

235
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,280
you know, pointing at objects. I would
point it to a blue object and ask him,

236
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:53,810
what's the color of this? She would say
boom boo for blue. A. Okay. Soon enough,

237
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
Alma is a total pro. She could identify
any color, show me the red object,

238
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,590
show me the destiny. Right.
The only thing I didn't do,

239
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,000
and I asked my wife not to do, was
ever mentioned that the sky was blue.

240
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,700
That was the setup.

241
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,620
So one day guy and Elmo were taking a
stroll and they're practicing the colors.

242
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,510
What's the street?
What's this, what's this?

243
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,200
And then I pointed at the sky
and said, what kind of is that?

244
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,600
And she wouldn't give
me any answer. Huh? Oh,

245
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:27,470
does she just a second before would was
happily telling me that something was

246
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,580
blue on red or green.

247
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,770
She just looked up and looked at me
in comprehending Dingley sort of,

248
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:35,720
what are you talking about?
Cheetah? You're kidding.

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,320
I think she didn't understand what
I was on about. Huh? In retrospect,

250
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,770
there was no object that there
was nothing with color for her.

251
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,370
You're just pointing into the void,
basically pointing into nothingness.

252
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,110
So she wouldn't say anything,

253
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,470
but guy kept asking every
single time they went out.

254
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,800
And once I would do it only when the
sky was blue and she would never answer.

255
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,000
And this went on for two months.

256
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,780
And then finally she did consent to give
me a color name, but it wasn't blue.

257
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,950
It was white for for a
few times you said white.

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,010
And then finally after a month
and a half or two moments,

259
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,580
she said blue for the first time. Wow.

260
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:15,350
Even then it wasn't consistently
blue. So she then she said once blue,

261
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,360
no white, no blue. Did she eventually
decide though? You know what that is?

262
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,610
Blue wasn't, no, she
never said it this way,

263
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:26,330
but eventually when I asked
it became consistently do it.

264
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,460
So she just would say blue. Okay.

265
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,790
This was for me really the point
where I, I could, you know,

266
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,920
convince myself,

267
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,870
I convinced at least my heart that this
sort of allegedly perfect example of

268
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:43,700
blue, um, is not so perfect.
So you know, for Houma who,

269
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,031
you know,

270
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,830
never ever probably saw a blue
object except the sky and the sea,

271
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,570
never had a dad who sort of went on and
bought blue objects and asking them what

272
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,840
they kind of, this guy was the fact
that he didn't lose sleep over.

273
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,020
It doesn't seem so strange anymore.

274
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,260
You know, it's kind of, it's a, now
that I've heard this, I'm a little,

275
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,770
I'm a little, uh, ruining the,

276
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,960
the moment when Alma
decided the sky was blue,

277
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,730
let her have whatever
color she wants it to be.

278
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,800
Doesn't have to be blue weirdly
then color is a loss of innocence.

279
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,770
Yeah.

280
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,770
It's Kinda like having something fixed
that for awhile it's just between you and

281
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:29,030
your friends, he'd hearts, you know,
this guy has many colors. Truthfully,

282
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,970
on the other hand though, I'm
disagreeing with myself now.

283
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,710
If we all agree the sky is blue,

284
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:36,200
then that's something we can
share that she can share.

285
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,550
And then she's in conversation and then
eventually she'll understand, you know,

286
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,503
this kind of blue,

287
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,793
um, uh,

288
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,473
[inaudible]

289
