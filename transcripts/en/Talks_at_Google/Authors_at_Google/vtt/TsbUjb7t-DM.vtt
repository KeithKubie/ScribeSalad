00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
&gt;&gt; STEVENS: We'd like to welcome our author
today, Jean Hanff Korelitz who will be reading

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.769
from her new book, "Admission." Jean was raised
in New York City, and graduated from Dartmouth

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.970
College and Clare College in Cambridge. She's
the author of several novels, the most recent

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.860
of which are "The White Rose" and "Admission"
which just came out. She's also published

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.130
a children's novel and a book of poems. She's
also contributed many articles and essays

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.580
to magazines. And she lives in Princeton with
her family, the Poet and Professor Paul Muldoon

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.690
and their children, and she works full time
as a writer and part-time as a chauffeur,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.949
i.e., mom. So I'd like to welcome Jean and
thank you very much.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:59.430
&gt;&gt; KORELITZ: Thank you, Molly. Thank you to
this small but quality audience. This is actually

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.970
the first invitation that I had months ago
before the book came out. And I was very thrilled

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.720
to be invited, and I'm very, very, very happy
to be here. As Molly said, "Admission" is

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.070
my fourth novel. The subject matter is something
I've been thinking about since my own horrendous

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.880
experience of applying to colleges back in
the 1970s. You know, what was a gruesome process

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.930
back then has only grown more gruesome and
horrendous, as those of you who have applied

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:41.360
to college in the last 20 years can doubtless
testify. I became very interested in the place

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.460
in our society that Ivy League applications
has come to occupy, especially in our sort

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.909
of family tree of American obsessions with
things like social standing, social class,

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.180
money, immigration, ideas of success, and...
It just seemed to me that every time I open

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.100
one of these subjects to look at them, I found
myself looking at Ivy League admissions. I

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.340
don't know how that happened, and luckily
I don't really have to answer that question

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.350
in my novel. You know, there are other books
that really have looked very directly at that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.750
question, and I've read most of them. But
I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in how

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.770
people respond to pressures in their lives.
And the protagonist of Admission is an admissions

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.980
officer at Princeton. I worked at Princeton
for two years as what they call an "outside

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.860
reader" in the admissions office. I was not,
thank goodness, given the terrible responsibility

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.640
of making decisions about who got in. But
I was--I did read many hundreds of applications

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.090
and evaluated them as I have been trained
to do. It was a fascinating experience; it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.501
was a humbling experience; it was an experience
that made me feel really good about who's

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:07.080
applying to college right now. And that in
itself is interesting, because I have a teenage

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.480
daughter. You know, I think her generation
has been kind of maligned a little bit. You

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.980
know, all we hear about is the texting and
the Facebook-ing, and we don't really hear

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.000
about what they're going through and what
they have on their minds. And if you want

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.270
to know what's on the minds of American 17-year-olds,
that's where you find it, in their college

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:38.720
application essays. They were profoundly moving.
They were extraordinarily insightful and sensitive

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.879
and just wonderful to read. My feelings about
how the system currently works are complicated,

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.170
but at least in terms of the college where
I worked, at Princeton, they're pretty positive.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.170
I really came away feeling that the system
may not be perfect but I couldn't think of

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.870
a better system. And people out there who
have lots of ideas about how it should be

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.209
done, I don't think they've really thought
very carefully about it either. Because some

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.150
of the college environments that they would
create with their methodology; for example,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.330
setting, you know, setting your computer to
pick the top scoring applicants and then walk

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.550
away, would not really produce very interesting
college environments, certainly, not the kind

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.439
of environment we see at Princeton, for example.
So I don't have an axe to grind with how it's

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:40.319
done. I think it's complicated, but I think
that's what makes it interesting. So I'm going

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:47.409
to read two excerpts from the novel. My protagonist
is a 38-year-old woman named Portia Nathan.

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:53.099
She's very complicated. She's not very happy.
She's made some decisions in her life that

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.910
have never really left her and now they're
really coming into the foreground of her life;

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.309
hence, the double meaning of the word "admission."
And at the start of this excerpt that I'm

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:12.800
going to read, Portia has just returned home
to Princeton after a difficult Christmas visit

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.669
with her mother in Vermont. She's come home
to an empty house because while she's been

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:27.039
away, her partner of 16 years has moved out
to move in with someone else who's already

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.759
pregnant, so it's a rough homecoming. And
after a very short time back in her house,

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.759
she discovers that she's pretty unhappy to
be home. So this is where we're going to start

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.879
the excerpt. And you'll see why I chose this
excerpt because a certain internet company

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:53.289
is in fact mentioned in this excerpt, so feel
free to cheer. Standing in the dull silence

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.961
of her foyer, Portia understood that she had
no clear idea of what to do with herself,

00:05:56.961 --> 00:06:02.680
except to get away from this place. Methodically,
she considered and rejected other places to

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.330
be, including the gym, the supermarket at
the end of her street, any public space downtown.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.139
At any of these, Mark and Helen might be lurking,
ready to display their happiness and gestational

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.150
glow. With each locale indeed came a jolt
of distress like a shot of black ink to the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.430
system, feathering out to each extremity before
fading. It was the return of pain, its forces

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.240
rested and restored during her short distraction,
and ready with a reconsidered battle plan.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.419
Considering her new circumstances, there seemed
to be only one place she could retreat to.

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.240
And realizing this, Portia duly began her
retreat, locking the front door behind her

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.839
and picking her way over the hard snow back
to the car. She had been home less than half

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:51.251
an hour. She had been able to stand being
home for only half an hour. She had the sense

00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:56.600
suddenly of running before a wave. Moments
later, she was cruising downtown for a parking

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.590
spot. The town was wide open and she pulled
in opposite Nassau Hall, telling herself that

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.080
it really was a rational, laudable thing to
go to work late in the afternoon on a day

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.679
when the rest of the campus was still in steely
silence. This time of year after all was not

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:16.899
a vacation for her. The application deadline
had only just come and gone, and so had commenced

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:25.550
reading season, a tunnel of stress and weighty
decisions, ringing phones; an email inbox

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.580
that filled at the rate of four messages per
minute; students terrified they had mistyped

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.580
their Social Security numbers; guidance counselors
duty-bound to report that an applicant along

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.960
with the rest of the football team had just
been given a citation for disorderly conduct.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.339
And always, always parents. Parents. Susanna
had been entirely uninvolved in Portia's own

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:51.819
college search. She remembered one heated
discussion about applying to Smith: reactionary

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:56.099
playground for future Republican wives or
hotbed of radical lesbianism. But apart from

00:07:56.099 --> 00:08:02.509
that it had more or less been her own show.
Had Susanna read her essays, checked for spelling

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:07.459
errors; had she offered to hunt down friends
or cousins with connections to the various

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:12.479
admissions offices--misguided though that
surely would been even back then. Had she,

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:17.330
God forbid, herself called up the offices
demanding to speak to whoever was in charge

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.669
about the brilliance and promise of her daughter.
Compared with the parents Portia was dealing

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:28.779
with now, Susanna looked like a saint. Portia
hauled her bags of folders through the FitzRandolph

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:33.430
Gate. Nassau Hall, Princeton University's
nerve center--and for a few heady months in

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:39.530
1777, home to the infant US government--looked
majestic in the failing light with its great

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:45.520
preening tigers and fluttering ivy. And behind
it, the campus unfurled, stalwart buildings

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.990
linked by deserted walkways. Looking up at
West College, she saw no lights at all, not

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.140
Clarence's corner office, [INDISTINCT] partner
were in New Haven with friends; not Dylan's,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.420
visiting his parents at Houston; not Corrine's,
with the kids on some island. That she was

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.820
here after nightfall was not in itself unusual.
In January, February, and March, as the intense

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.780
period of reading gave way to the still more
intense reading period of committee meetings,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.470
all of them frequently worked late into the
night, percolating along in a fittingly collegial

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.160
rhythm. She had sometimes certainly been the
last one out of the door, intent on making

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.260
it to Western Oregon or the Archbishop Mitty
School, or the imperious baseball coach's

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.820
most urgent request before allowing herself
to head for home. But coming in like this,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.830
alone in the darkness to an empty building--in
all these years it was a first. The unbroken

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.810
line of dark windows was definitely disconcerting,
but at the same time she felt some relief.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.330
There would be no one out there to question
her. She opened the door with her own key

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.630
and went first to the administrative warren
at the back of the building, passing the abandoned

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.830
receptionist's desk. She turned on the lights
as she went, bathing the nondescript corridor

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:02.930
in harsh fluorescent illumination that picked
up every ding and mark on the walls, passing

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.710
the silent photocopier in its alcove. Against
one wall, two of the fax machines were lit

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:14.500
and humming, neatly depositing pages and pages
into their trays. In the cubicles screensavers

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.220
pulsed and danced, the smorgasbord of ill-judged
baked goods had been cleared away; only a

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:25.530
spattering of crumbs left behind. On Martha's
desk, a phone purred forlornly, five times,

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:31.740
six times, then went silent. It was all in
fact very silent. She hoisted her bags onto

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.940
the counter below the staff mailboxes and
began to lift out handfuls of files. There

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.110
were a few she'd flagged to remove at this
point, and she went hunting for them now,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.800
quickly locating the fluorescent pink post-it
notes on their covers. These were folder she

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.160
had questions about for one reason or another
small items she might already have dealt with

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.570
if Susana were not such a Luddite who refused
to own a computer. Because she was however

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.050
and because she did not; because Portia had
to climb to drive into Hanover to undertake

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:05.170
this sensitive business on some public terminal,
she had merely flagged the files to come back

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:10.570
to. One of these was a boy from a private
day school near Boston whose guidance counselor,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.900
a woman Portia had met when she visited the
school last spring, had declined to answer

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.870
two notable questions on the school secondary
report: Has the applicant ever been found

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:25.160
responsible for a disciplinary violation at
your school, whether related to academic misconduct

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.000
or behavioral misconduct that resulted in
the applicant's probation, suspension, removal,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.850
dismissal, or expulsion? Has the applicant
ever been convicted of a misdemeanor, felony,

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:40.530
or other crime? Almost always, the answer
to these questions was no. Sometimes it was

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.760
yes. And sometimes that was not in itself
the kiss of death. There were kids who'd made

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.620
mistakes and grown from them. There were excessive--there
were victims of excessive zero tolerance school

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.300
rules: suspended for carrying a loaded water
pistol or pointing a finger and declaring

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.030
"bang." There was even the occasional Jean
Valjean crime of necessity. She had never

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:07.740
forgotten a boy from Oregon which shoplifted
liver for his family. Liver. If only he had

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.630
been a stronger student. But she could not
remember a single instance in which the guidance

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:18.930
counselor had declined to answer these questions.
It could, of course, be an oversight, a typo.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.950
But at this school, with tuition upward of
$25 grand a year and a student parking lot

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:31.570
crowded with Lexus 2Ks and BMWs, Portia suspected
not. Another worrying application was from

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.370
a Rhode Island girl whose complex, mellifluous
essay was somewhat at odds with her low English

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.400
grades and poor score on the writing section
of the SAT, not to mention the fact, the favorite

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:47.650
book listed in the few detail section was
Pride and Privilege by Jane Austin. That's

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:54.280
A-U-S-T-I-N. Portia, accordingly, wanted to
check the girl's tribute to Fannie Lou Hamer

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.480
against their databank of essays for sale.
These were gleaned mainly from internet sources

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.210
where they were billed as teaching tools and
slaughtered with disclaimers, but supplemented

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:10.210
by an Iowa entrepreneur with an essayist-for-hire
business. This unpleasant individual had decided

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:15.210
to publish his expertise in book form, and
closed up shop by mailing his entire backlist

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:21.690
of custom essays to every college his clients
had ever attended, plus People Magazine. Of

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.750
course, the Rhode Island girl might simply
have reason to the challenge of her essay:

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.060
taking her time, thinking through her points,
checking her sentences carefully to avoid

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:35.690
grammatical errors. But there was something
in the ease of the language that worried Portia.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.760
Correctness after all was achievable with
sweat. But in her experience, it was nearly

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.040
impossible to build grace into prose. There
was also a boy from Boston Latin who had furnished

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.400
the list of Princeton philosophers he wanted
to work with and an essay with such dense

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.529
philosophical prose that Portia had had no
idea what he was talking about. In fact, she

00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:01.250
could have sworn when she'd read it that Susana's
kitchen table days earlier that it had something

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.520
to do with zombies. What's next? She thought,
Mummies and Vampires? She had decided to send

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.980
the essay to David and asked him to sort it
out. Philosophers seemed to have a knock for

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.660
recognizing their own kind, as well as the
impostors in their midst. Finally, there was

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.230
the Connecticut boy whose long list of school
of government offices, dramatic roles, community

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:28.190
service projects, and baseball positions had
ended with the words "National Judo Champion."

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:33.529
It might, of course, be true. But in Portia's
previous dealings with bonafide National Judo

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:37.660
champions, and not a few had indeed applied
to Princeton, this accomplishment did tend

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.840
to be noted in recommendations, and to require
enough practice time to preclude student government,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.300
drama, and varsity baseball. National Judo
champions also had a tendency to write about

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.180
being National Judo champions. They solicited
their coaches for references and supplied

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.800
newspaper reports, attesting to the fact that
they were, well, National Judo champions.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.560
It would easily be settled by Google, Portia
thought, finding the file at the very bottom

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:11.100
of the stack and sitting it aside. Why anyone
would bother to lie in the age of Google was

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.270
baffling. "We are trusting skeptics," her
first Dean of Admissions had told her years

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:20.540
before. "We believe what they tell us, but
they'd better be telling us the truth." This

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.480
was Harold McKendry, the soon-to-be-former
Dean of Admissions at Dartmouth who had hauled

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.630
her aboard the profession in the spring of
his final Dartmouth year. Harold's sense of

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:33.480
fair play, the fair play he sweetly assumed
to everyone else likewise embraced, had been

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.820
one of his most endearing qualities. Yet the
horror of the so-called new rules of admissions,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.980
the outsmarting and end-runs and decoding
now rampant out there; the snake oil salesman

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.700
promising to package and sell your kids to
his or her school of choice. For as long as

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.029
he could, and longer perhaps than he should
have, Harold stubbornly regarded each application

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:58.870
as an open invigorating conversation between
his staff and the applicant in which there

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:04.060
could be no dissembling on either side. He
expected total candor from each applicant

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.470
and maintained that expectation even after
little wildfires of scandal broke through

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:14.060
the industry in the 1990s: kids getting other
kids to take their SATs for them; applicants

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:19.550
who wrote their own recommendations; people
pretending to be Rothchilds and ranch hands.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.070
These events had been personally wounding
to Harold, but he had stayed the course, doing

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:30.320
his best to ride the new wave, trying to maintain
his personal honor code. There was something

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.860
a little haunting about this terribly ordinary
room, Portia decided. She tried for a moment

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:40.000
to see it not as the generic office it absolutely
was--but as the epicenter of so much urban

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.570
speculation by students, teachers, counselors,
and the parents. To them, this utilitarian

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:51.630
space was the holding pen where their child
and all of his or her antagonists were gathered,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.650
vetted, directed, shunted into narrower and
narrower corridors, leading to smaller and

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:01.670
smaller vestibules, where they were commanded
to wait in mute distress face-to-face with

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:08.240
their most closely matched fellow aspirants.
Wrestlers here, legacies there, Pakistanis

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:15.459
to the right, woodwinds, novelists, witheringly
brilliant mathematicians, faculty kids, staff

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:23.999
kids, movie star kids, movies stars, ordinary
decent kids, good debaters, great debaters,

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:29.889
boys who wanted to be Brian Green, girls who
wanted to Steven Sondheim or Meg Whitman or

00:17:29.889 --> 00:17:35.720
Quentin Tarantino. There was, for instance,
one tiny chamber in which the diver from Wisconsin

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.860
sat knee to bandaged knee with the diver from
Maine; the lounge where the girls from MIT's

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:46.830
Women's Technology Program were briefly, uncomfortably
reunited; the claustrophobic cubicle where

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.149
the classically trained soprano from Florida
eyed the classically trained soprano from

00:17:51.149 --> 00:17:56.419
Los Angeles, and the classically trained soprano
from Cleveland. That it didn't actually work

00:17:56.419 --> 00:18:01.549
like this was not even relevant, because Portia
understood the symbolic power of this place,

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:07.429
banal as it was. That power was even greater,
she suspected, than the symbolic power of

00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:14.690
their individual offices upstairs. She had
been inside machine for so long that she sometimes

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.440
forgot how this applying-to-college thing
had looked from the outside. But it did come

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.340
back, vividly back, when she tried to remember.
It had been like watching a mass of seemingly

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.350
identical sheep cram themselves into a great
black building with no windows knocking against

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:38.369
one another, stepping on one another's hooves
and over their panicked bodies when they fell.

00:18:38.369 --> 00:18:41.889
At the other end of the building, only a thin
line of sheep trickled out into bountiful

00:18:41.889 --> 00:18:47.269
fields. And what was it about those sheaths
which look, to all intents and purposes, exactly

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:52.669
like every sheath that were crowded in. What
made them special? Why should they get the

00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:57.869
meadow when those others were barred? What
happens inside that box was a mystery, a secret

00:18:57.869 --> 00:19:02.210
shielded from the light. She remembered how
the class ahead of her in high school had

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:07.259
been sorted with the most cerebral Latin geek
shout out from every college she applied to,

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:12.690
while the class's drug dealer of choice has
his pick in Harvard and Brown. How the valedictorian

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.580
who was also the student body president retreated
in humiliation to a safety school, while the

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.760
dullest dishwater football player charted
off to Cornell. Who were these people in the

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.499
admissions office at Swarthmore and Williams?
And what could they have been thinking when

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:31.999
they accepted Camilla Walden, Portia's soccer
teammate and the most superficial girl she

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:37.809
had ever met, but passed over Gordana Miles
who wrote her own column in the school newspaper,

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:44.080
and had actually published three short articles
in 17 Magazine. There was perhaps no mystery,

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.159
however, as baffling as that of her own admission
to Dartmouth. She had been a worried high

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:55.809
school senior lacking in, well, anything special,
really. A pretty good student, a pretty good

00:19:55.809 --> 00:20:00.730
soccer player, a pretty good writer, and all-around
nice person, Portia knew exactly what would

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.210
happen to her own college application if it
arrived through some warp of time and space

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:10.990
in this room today. With her strong GPA and
merely quite good scores, busy athletics schedule

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.239
and character building volunteer efforts,
Portia Nathan's application would have landed

00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:22.159
in the great moving tide of similar applications.
Great kids, smart kids, hardworking kids who

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:26.740
would certainly do great at whatever college
they ended up going to, which almost certainly

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:32.260
wasn't going to be Princeton. The secret of
her own mediocrity was quite likely similarly

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.019
held by men and women all over the industry.
To wade through these best and brightest 17-year-olds

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:41.470
was to be at once deeply reassured by the
goodness and potential of the American near-adult

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:47.440
population--and deeply humbled by one's own
relative shortcomings. These students were

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.690
absolutely going to make scientific discoveries,
solve human problems, produce important works

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.220
of art and scholarship. And generally, as
so many of them pointed out, give back to

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.889
their communities and make the world a better
place. She, on the other hand, was fit only

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:09.510
to make life-altering decisions on their behalf.
And how could that make sense? So that's the

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:24.330
end of the first excerpt. Are there any burning
questions or should I segue directly? Or you

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:29.210
can hold them until later.
&gt;&gt; STEVENS: Comment? Okay.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.700
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: I have a question, actually.
&gt;&gt; KORELITZ: Okay.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.100
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: You said that you were kind of
intrigued by the admissions process for a

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:43.010
long time since you applied. What made you
go ahead and take that step to approach the

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:50.539
Dean of Admissions and ask to be a reader
and, with the intention of eventually writing

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:52.450
the book?
&gt;&gt; KORELITZ: Yeah. I knew that Princeton--I'm

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.629
a faculty spouse at Princeton so I've watched
an entire generation of Princeton students

00:21:57.629 --> 00:22:03.619
pass through my husband's classes and my own
home, because I have kids and Princeton students

00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:10.980
are fabulous babysitters. So, I really have
had my eye on Princeton students for a long

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:16.159
time, and I love them. I adore them. I think
they are amazing people, but they're terribly

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:21.360
ordinary, too. And you know, when you look
at other college students, you know, it's

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:27.669
not that they have light shining out of them
that makes them those sheep that are the ones

00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:32.730
that get the meadow. And of course, I was
fascinated. I've heard--you know, lot of people

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.989
talk about how hard these decisions were,
how most of the applicants to these colleges

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:44.489
are perfectly capable of coming in and doing
the work and contributing to the community.

00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:50.059
My question is the same as almost everybody
else's. How on earth can you decide? And you

00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:55.850
know that it's only getting harder, because
in defiance of all, you know, logic in the

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.629
last couple of years with the economy tanking,
you know, applications to places like Princeton

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:10.990
have gone up. And not just a little, a lot.
So, you know, whereas in my day 30 years ago,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:15.249
you know, I think the acceptance rate at my
college was something like 18%. That seemed

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:23.739
pretty tough to me. Today, my college is below
10%. So I mean I'm full of compassion for

00:23:23.739 --> 00:23:29.100
our kids, basically, who are going through
this now. So I went to them and I said, "You

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:34.090
know, I want to write about this. I want to
write a novel about Ivy League admissions.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:40.590
Will you hire me?" And frankly, I didn't expect
them to say yes, but they did. And as I said

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:48.029
before, you know, I really love the work.
It was such a fascinating job. And I learned

00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:54.570
both those things that, you know, the ones
who get in are absolutely spectacular but

00:23:54.570 --> 00:24:03.840
they're very ordinary, too. So, you know,
there is no, you know, be all and end all

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:13.419
that makes that difference, and yet you can
see the ones that really, really shine among

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:19.119
the brilliant and amazing. So, you know, I
have a kid; I have a daughter who is about

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:26.239
to go through this, so I really feel everybody's
pain. So, anyway, let me move on to the next.

00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:31.010
This is actually from the following chapter,
and I know you want to find out what happened

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:39.570
to all of those kids who Portia flagged. So,
now you're going to find out what happens

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:47.940
to them. And you know, there's quite a bit
of humor in this book. Just because this is

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.700
incredibly serious to a lot of people including
me, it doesn't mean it's not incredibly funny,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.950
too. The kid, who had written about zombies,
it turned out, was the real thing. His impenetrable

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:05.600
essay which she had dispatched to David through
the university mail came winging back the

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.899
first week in January with a cover note that
read "Definitely. Absolutely." Portia found

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:15.649
the file in the overhead shelf she used as
a parking lot for applications awaiting something

00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:20.429
or other. She slipped this memo in the back
and made a note in the department rating area

00:25:20.429 --> 00:25:26.080
at the reader's card, a seldom used but highly
influential section on the front. Then before

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.929
she let it go, and armed with David's endorsement,
she made another attempt to glean some sense

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:37.980
from the essay. Here's the essay. "Certain
things are conscious. We may not know what

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.889
it's like to be a dog or a bat, but we know
or at least we think we know that animals

00:25:42.889 --> 00:25:47.590
have feelings and experiences. We also know
that a creature's conscious life is somehow

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:53.220
determined by what's going on in its brain.
So here's the question. What exactly is the

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.309
relation between conscious experience and
the brain activity that underlies it? Many

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:03.840
philosophers, materialists have thought that
conscious experience just is brain activity

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.570
in the same sense in which heat is just the
motion of molecules. The zombie thought experiment

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.590
puts pressure on this sort of view. We seem
to be able to imagine or conceive a creature

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:19.820
that is just like you in every physical respect
down to the last detail, but which is altogether

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.509
unconscious. A zombie will move and talk as
if it were awake and genuinely aware of its

00:26:25.509 --> 00:26:31.100
surroundings but its inner light is off. It
has no subjective experience. Now the fact

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.039
that we can imagine such creatures gives us
some reason to believe that they are logically

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:38.940
possible. But if it's logically possible for
a creature to have a brain just like yours

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.920
and no conscious experience, then consciousness
is not literally identical to brain activity.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.779
Instead, we should say that brain activity
normally causes consciousness in the sense

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:53.970
in which heating up the filament in a light
bulb normally causes it to glow. On this view,

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.970
the physical aspects of an organism are distinct
from its subjective mental aspects. At best,

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:05.799
they are various causal laws connected the
two domains." She read this twice, but could

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:10.710
not follow the logic past the point about
the inner light being off. Did this in fact

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.659
indicate that her own inner light was off?
Nonetheless, she wrote her summary and checked

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:20.330
"high priority admit" at the bottom of the
card, then put the file in the pile of folders

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:26.210
to go to Corrine for second reading. Her colleagues
were on the early stages of their shared annual

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.220
affliction. The traveling was done for the
year, and what remained was this confluence

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:36.609
of the cold on winter. And the all-in-our-hands
sense of bleak responsibility, to the trustees

00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:40.700
and faculty, of course, and to the guidance
counselors who are, for better or worse, they're

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.149
partners in the work of getting the right
students into the freshman class. And yes,

00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:49.470
to the alumni, because Princeton honored its
graduates and wished to attain their high

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.479
opinion. But mainly to the applicants themselves,
who collectively seemed to hover everywhere

00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:59.119
in Portia's imagination by spectral Jude the
Obscures waiting for the verdict on their

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:04.940
futures. And Portia very much feared, their
sense of self-worth. Sometimes she imagine

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.659
them waif like across Cannon Green behind
West College and along Nassau Street winding

00:28:10.659 --> 00:28:15.039
their white supplicating hands through the
great iron gates. This was not needless to

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:20.149
say an image she shared with her colleagues.
No one was complaining aloud, but then again

00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:24.600
no one had to. The weight of the burden was
intense and everywhere, and the entire crew,

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:30.399
fighting the same cold, shuffled through the
corridors with the same set of dour thoughts.

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:34.769
Portia too was well into her winter sinus
misery, a malady that typically began after

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:38.919
New Year's, did battle with the tag team of
antibiotics over the winter months, and finally

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:43.729
surrendered to modern medicine just in time
for the pollen surge in April. It had begun

00:28:43.729 --> 00:28:47.850
right on schedule the week she returned from
Vermont, flickering behind her cheekbones

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.850
as the year turned, sneaking tendrils of pain
along the facial nerves, coiling around her

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:58.090
ears and scalp. At her appointment with the
internist, she got a prescription for Septin,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:02.850
the best of a bad lot, and asked for Ambien
which she had been given but was not yet brave

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.539
enough to use. Instead, she lay in bed timing
the pounding in her head against the dull

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:11.919
clicking of the bedside clock, feeling the
pain across her entire face as if the bones

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:16.070
of her skull were contracting steadily, the
flesh struggling against containment. This

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:21.869
was not an effective sleep aid. The house
would not seem to warm up, and she wondered

00:29:21.869 --> 00:29:25.570
if there was something she was supposed to
have done to the boiler after her return.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:30.119
But the boiler was Mark's domain, and she
did not want to ask him about it. She did

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:34.080
not want to ask him about anything. She did
not want her reverie that he did not exist

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.519
and that therefore nothing had happened between
them broken. Besides, she was hardly at home

00:29:39.519 --> 00:29:44.789
so it hardly mattered that she was cold. Once
again, this year the application had jumped

00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:50.739
up 800 this time, more evidence of the still
swelling population bubble of teenagers. And

00:29:50.739 --> 00:29:54.590
too, perhaps, that their efforts to reach
beyond the traditional applicant pool, to

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.100
students who might not have thought to apply
ten or even five yeas earlier were proving

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.549
successful. It all seemed utterly overwhelming
just now with every surface in her office

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:08.549
piled with files and boxes more waiting downstairs
in the office. But no one was panicking, because

00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:13.769
they always felt this way at this particular
moment in the cycle. There had never in Portia's

00:30:13.769 --> 00:30:17.980
recollection been any real worry that they
wouldn't finish in time, though the task did

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.830
have a way of expanding to fill every worker's
every available hour. This was the point in

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:28.039
the admission cycle when Portia became reacquainted
with many of the students she had spent the

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:33.029
previous spring encouraging to apply to Princeton.
Selling the university, of course, was not

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:37.909
difficult, but overselling it to potential
applicants sat near the top of every critic's

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:42.909
list of complaints. The gist of this being
the top tier colleges went out of their way

00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:47.070
to get vast numbers to apply only to admit
an ever smaller percentage and earn, as a

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:53.619
result, a higher US News and World Report
ranking. But while Portia did sometimes wish

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:58.259
that there was a way to selectively discourage
the students she met while visiting high schools,

00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:03.669
she would never and could never do it. Not
only was it the office's pop philosophy that

00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:08.090
every student should feel welcome to submit
an application, and that equal and thorough

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:12.609
consideration awaited everyone who did so,
the fact was that you just couldn't tell when

00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:17.720
you looked into their serious, tremulous faces
at the information sessions who was the kid

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.059
who cheated his way through Calculus BC, and
who was the kid whose English teacher was

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:26.840
going to call him the most exciting student
I've had in my 30-year career. What if she

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.409
discouraged some student who couldn't break
1200 on his SATs from applying when he would

00:31:31.409 --> 00:31:36.179
turn out to be idiosyncratically cerebral?
A true, original kid whose unqualifiedable

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:41.619
abilities would lift the discourse in every
class he enrolled in. How could you know that

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:46.580
the thoroughly dull high school junior struggling
to make conversation over cider and cookies

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:52.200
would emerge as the writing program's most
gifted novelist in a decade? Still, when their

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.489
faces came back to her now, swimming up from
the accounts of debating triumphs and stage

00:31:56.489 --> 00:32:01.739
fright at the piano recital, she sometimes
wish she have been able to say to them, "Don't.

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:06.480
Don't try for this. Don't want this. Or worse,
make some terrible connection between who

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.870
you are as a human being and whether or not
you get in." The pool once again was absurdly

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:18.409
strong. The applicants more driven, more packaged,
more worried even than the year before. They

00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:22.989
were decent kids who would never consider
that their life experience wasn't all unusual

00:32:22.989 --> 00:32:28.139
since they were like everyone else they knew.
So when they set foot outside the United States

00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:33.070
on a church home-building trip to Mexico,
or a visit to relatives in Bombay, they were

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:38.029
stunned by the poverty; dumbstruck to discover
how wealthy and privileged they were. They

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:44.529
wanted to fix things, cure diseases, make
it better. They want to turn into the amazing

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:48.369
people their teachers swore they were, and
their parents had always planned for them

00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:53.499
to be. They wanted not to fall short at this
finish line of their entire lives and be that

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:58.879
kid who thought he was so great, could aim
so far above himself. Portia feel for them,

00:32:58.879 --> 00:33:05.619
of course. She wish as she checked again and
again the box reading "only if room," a euphemism

00:33:05.619 --> 00:33:10.039
for no, as there was never any room. But she
could reach through the folder to the kid

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:15.519
beyond and say, "Anyone would be ecstatic
to have their child turn out as great as you.

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:20.679
And please, go and do all the things you say
you intend to do." Few of them were eliminated

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:26.249
easily. The campaigners who fashioned elaborate
dossiers with glossy 8X10s of their grinning

00:33:26.249 --> 00:33:31.759
faces, and sent in reams of thick stock pages
enumerating each spelling tests and charity

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:35.879
works as far back to middle school, could
not be dismissed out of hand, because you

00:33:35.879 --> 00:33:41.510
couldn't hold somebody's personality against
them. And besides, some idiot might have told

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.549
them to do it. The student who provided an
18th century family tree with a name of a

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:49.729
distant ancestor circled in red could not
be eliminated instantly, though his cover

00:33:49.729 --> 00:33:55.309
letter said he wanted to go to Princeton because
his antecedent had helped set up the place.

00:33:55.309 --> 00:34:01.169
The girl who had entered her email address
as "HotSexygirl69@yahoo.com" could not be

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:06.269
declined on the spot because even Princeton
applicants were allowed to be idiotic teenagers.

00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:11.130
The ones with low SAT scores couldn't be dispatched
quickly because some of them were superb and

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:17.150
thoughtful writers with (inaudible) courtesy
passed the numbers to the singular (inaudible).

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.410
So when she came to an applicant who have
given the benefit of every doubt fell decisively

00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:26.060
short, she was relieved. Here was one she
did not have to bring to committee, sell to

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.270
her colleagues, sell to Clarence. The math
geeks who hadn't done any math outside of

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:38.660
school, only if room. The literary types who
were poor writers, only if room. The faux

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.230
philosophers high on Nietzsche and Ayn Rand
who hoped only to find professors worthy of

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:50.120
having them as a student, she had no need
to travel David with their essays. Such as,

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.860
"As Sartre wrote in his play 'No exit,' hell
is other people. This play illustrates the

00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:00.020
theory of existentialism which is a philosophy
that since God is dead we are all ultimately

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.830
responsible for everything that happens to
us. This philosophy is valid in my opinion.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:08.760
When I first read Sartre's play, I realized
that other people are cowards who hide behind

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.080
religion and rules and laws. They think that
their lives are not really up to them, and

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.710
this makes them lazy and complacent. Since
the night I've been reading the great works

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.700
of philosophy on my own starting with the
Apology of Socrates which shows that it is

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.250
important to stand up for what you believe
in even if everyone else thinks you're wrong.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:31.130
After one year of intense study, I began to
think of my own philosophy. I call it Meta-existentialism,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:36.550
and it builds on the profound insights as
Socrates and Sartre. My first book, Dionysus

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.860
Novus: a Treatise on Agony and Ecstasy is
almost complete.' And I hope they publish

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.910
it soon. It argues that we are most real when
we experience intense emotions and that those

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:50.670
who are not capable of intense emotions live
lives that are mediocre and sad. In college,

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.150
I hope to develop these ideas and possibly
teach courses in philosophy and literature

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.380
to impart my philosophy to others. I have
found that other people often find it hard

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.480
to understand my theories, but they are not
professional philosophers, so that is to be

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.590
expected. I look forward to study with important
professors who will definitely understand

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:15.220
what I am saying--only if room. The Fannie
Lou Hamer essay had not turned up in the database

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.140
but Portia, reading through it again could
not let go of her suspicions. Misspelling

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.150
both the title and author of your favorite
book, as this Rhode Island girl had done,

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:27.720
was pretty close to unforgivable on a college
application. But it was the disparity between

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.720
this carelessness and superbly fluid well-constructed
and correctly spelled essay that bothered

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.290
her. There was little else noteworthy in the
application. The girl was a strong student

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.660
who had taken summer classes at Brown, played
squash. She did like the fact that the girl

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:46.260
had written about Hamer, not a more obvious
civil rights figure. That counted for something.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:51.690
But in the end she could not disentangle herself
from that Pride and Privilege--only if room.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:57.240
And there would be no room. The National Judo
champion did not appear anywhere on the website

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.351
of the United States Judo Federation. Portia
looked through the application again and found

00:37:02.351 --> 00:37:07.400
nothing to outweigh this information should
be marked the "unlikely box" effectively concluding

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.760
the matter. Which left the application with
the unchecked disciplinary waiver. It was

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.280
3:30 in the afternoon when she picked up the
phone, summoning what she could recall of

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.680
the counselor from their meeting last May--no
April, on a swing through Boston. Noble and

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.460
Greenough, Milton Academy, a charter school
in Roxbirys run by a heroic woman in her 60s,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.840
and Ford Country Day School, Portia's final
stop. The counselor was in her late 30s, small

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:41.280
with blonde hair, blonde streak, and an accent,
Portia remembered thinking more New York than

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.460
Boston. Her name right on the secondary school
report was Elisa Rosen. She picked up quickly

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.600
as if she's been waiting by the phone. And
if she sounded initially distracted, the utterance

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.890
of the word "Princeton," and she snapped to
attention. "Of course, I remember," she said

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:05.290
with great warmth. "You had a name from Shakespeare.
Juliet? Helena?" "Portia." "Oh, yes, the Quality

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:10.370
of Mercy, very appropriate for an admissions
officer." Portia nodded. It was not the first

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:15.470
time she had heard this. "How can I help,"
says Elisa Rosen. "Oh, I just had a quick

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:20.410
question about one of your seniors." "You
got about 20 from us this year." "Yes. His

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:27.760
name is Sean Erinson. I wanted..." "Ah," the
warmth in her voice had fled quite suddenly.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.040
"And what about?" "This may have been nothing,"
she said carefully. "I noticed that the disciplinary

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.060
action question wasn't checked. It's not a
huge deal." She listened into the silence

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:45.930
which grew. "Unless..." Portia had said frowning,
"...it is." More silence. "Miss Rosen?" "Elisa,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:52.620
please," the woman said, "I'm thinking about
this." Portia now thoroughly alert sat waiting,

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.130
the application open before her, reading and
rereading the question and question as if

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:03.300
she did not know it by heart. "You know,"
Elisa said abruptly, "I think... Do you mind

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.840
terribly if I phone you back in a few minutes?
I'd like to phone you back." "All right,"

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.320
said Portia, giving her the direct line. She
hung up the phone and opened the application

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.160
to the first page. Dad, an ophthalmologist,
went to Brandeis; mom, a homemaker, went to

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:25.270
Wheaton; two sibs, both older, one in college,
one in medical school; swimming, lots of swimming;

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:32.980
tennis. Probable major: economics; possible
career plans, well, summers tennis pro, working

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:38.080
for dad, calculus and history at Andover.
One essay about his swim coach; one about

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.600
tutoring a neighbor's child who have trouble
with Math. His favorite movie was Donnie Darko,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.080
the single, most cited film in this year's
key detail section, trailed only slightly

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.280
and incredibly enough by the Princess Bride.
She'd have the impression that Donnie Darko

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.550
was a horror film until some boy from Maine
wrote an essay about why he loved it. Now

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:03.670
she concluded it was merely bizarre. The phone
rang, and Portia noted the caller ID on her

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:08.220
phone which was not surprisingly the school
she had just phoned but 617, the right area

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:14.920
code. Tentatively, she answered, "Portia Nathan?
It's Elisa Rosen." "Oh, yes. Hello, Elisa."

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.960
"I'm sorry I couldn't talk. I wanted to have
this conversation on my cell," she laughed

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:25.520
shortly, "I'm actually in my car right now."
By this time, Portia was paying very close

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.180
attention. "I take that there is an issue
here?" "Oh, yes. And I decided that if any

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.100
of you ever asked, I was going to answer.
You're the first one to call, by the way.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.870
Congratulations," she said with deep sarcasm.
Portia found a piece of note paper on her

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.590
desk and wrote the name of the counselor and
the date. "I must ask you please to make this

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:50.520
an off-the-record conversation. Can you agree
to that?" Portia considered. "Sean Erinson

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:56.500
had an academic rating of 2 and a non-ac,
3," smack in the middle of the pool. He wasn't

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.770
a legacy which vastly decreased the likelihood
of a belligerent phone call if he was rejected.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:05.820
She could probably terminate the application
without consulting Clarence. "Well, let's

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.740
do this. Let's have a conversation. And if
we come into something I think my boss needs

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:15.780
to hear about, I'll stop you and you can think
about it, okay?" "Yes," she said after a minute.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:21.520
"So what are we talking about here?" "He got
hold of the chemistry final in December. We

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.573
have no idea how. His teacher has no idea
how. Apparently, he sold it to at least two

00:41:26.573 --> 00:41:30.330
of his classmates, but we can't compel him
to tell us who they are, which hasn't done

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:35.340
wonders for our morale. Plus, when I first
met with him before Christmas, he very clearly

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.530
implied that he done it before. He wanted
us to know he'd been having his way with the

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:44.730
system for a while." Portia, listening, turned
over the pages of file for secondary school

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:51.810
transcript, as and A-s with appropriately
enough a single B+ in Foundations of Ethics,

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:58.180
junior year. "So he was suspended then?" "Well,
that's just it. His father told us that if

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:03.130
we suspended him or did anything to the transcript
or the recommendations, he'd sue the school.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.540
He also told our headmaster he was prepared
to claim the chemistry teacher had given Sean

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.540
the answers as part of an attempt at deduction.
And he was ready to make a sexual harassment

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:17.610
charge. And the chemistry teacher does happen
to be gay which didn't help. So we were in

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.960
meetings for days with our attorney, and finally
felt we just had to let it go. We had to,"

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.640
she said defensively. "We didn't want to.
I mean, what I've told you, it doesn't even

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.500
scratch the surface of how truly gruesome
it was. And both of his references had already

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.420
sent out their letters including, I should
point out, the chemistry teacher who had written

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:41.050
him this glowing recommendation in November.
It would have meant contacting 11 colleges

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:45.330
with whom we've had good relationships and
telling them we had a cheating scandal. But

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.600
you know what? When the time came for me to
fill out the SSR, I just couldn't bring myself

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:55.540
to check that box, you know. I couldn't do
it. It's my silent protest." "I see," said

00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:01.010
Portia, writing quickly. "Well, thank you
for your candor." "I'm in my car," Elisa Rosen

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.470
said again. "I feel like I'm in a spy novel,
but I didn't want anyone to hear me talking

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.330
about this. We kept the students from finding
out. I don't know how, but if we hadn't we

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:14.050
would have been overwhelmed with parents demanding
we throw him out and inform the colleges.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.420
They don't want Sean taking their kid's place.
And I have to tell you, I don't really blame

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:23.080
them. But do you know what I hate most about
this whole thing?" "What?" Portia asked. "I

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.020
hate the fact that he's actually a sweet kid.
Seriously, I've known Sean for years. You

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.850
couldn't meet a nicer guy. Always smiling,
always wants to tell you about some book he's

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:36.040
just read or something that he saw on the
paper. He's very popular but he's one of these

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.130
popular kids who reach out to the misfits.
Do you know what I mean? And I'm not excusing

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:44.190
what he did at all, but I got to tell you,
I don't think I'd last a week with a father

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:49.370
like that. I mean, angry, angry man. You could
hear him screaming at his son outside in the

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:55.560
parking lot after our meeting. I wanted to
call child protective services." "Okay," said

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:59.390
Portia, frowning. "So I'm just telling you,
this is what happened. And I have no idea

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.410
what he'll be like when he gets away from
home. I mean, Sean is really smart, really

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:07.720
capable. He can absolutely handle the work
at Princeton, and I'm sure he'd be an asset

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.760
to the university. But it's right that you
have the information. Are there any applicants

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:18.151
you'd like to discuss?" she said hopefully.
I'm just going to stop there. Thank you so

00:44:18.151 --> 00:44:29.760
much. I do the other thing? And now as promised,
Molly Stevens, your fellow Google employee,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.450
has helped me set up a website for a project
that I'm involved with now. This is something

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:43.410
that did grow out of the Admission novel.
In Admission, every chapter begins with a

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:49.190
little excerpt from an application essay.
Some of them are funny. "I accompanied the

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:56.630
Acapella choir," one of my personal favorites.
Some of them were quite serious. But the potential

00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:04.080
for satire is so unignorable. And I have a
friend who has gone through several of his

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.120
children applying to college, and at one point
he went to Barnes and Noble to try and find

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:14.190
the book about how to write a college essay.
And he was so overwhelmed by how grim most

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:19.090
of them were, he called me and he said, "What
the world really needs is a book of the worst

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:27.700
college essays." So that's what we're trying
to compile. We are looking for the most imbecilic,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:35.000
absurd, excessive college essays. We want
people to write them for us, and they're very

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.040
hard to write. We've turned down, like a Princeton
University admissions officer, we've turned

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.650
down most of the essays that have been submitted
to our website. But I brought a couple of

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:50.250
our best ones to reach you, to give you the
idea of what we're looking for and maybe this

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:57.110
will inspire some of you to try your hand
at this because we need more. And if you have

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:06.420
friends who you think might like this assignment,
please have them look at our website which

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:15.910
is FunniestCollegeEssays.com. WWW.funniestcollegeessays.com.
Okay. Here's one of my favorites. From the

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:20.210
time I was in the Odyssey Program for Gifted
Students in the third grade, I have worn the

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:25.140
baseball, the Harvard baseball cap that my
Uncle Kenneth Breadstine, Harvard '72, a major

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.960
in [INDISTINCT] to Harvard bought me. Of course,
being respectful, I never wore my Harvard

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:35.210
cap in class, only in the corridors, on the
street, and everywhere else. If you look at

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:39.820
my photo closely, you'll see the proof because
I have permanent hat head. Thin hair on top

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:45.580
and on the sides, bunches out around my ears.
In ninth grade, I almost won the Regional

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.920
High School Science Fair for my study of the
social systems of ants, but someone jiggled

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.010
the table and my jar of ants crashed to the
floor and the other competitor stepped on

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.720
them. In 10th grade Honors History, my teacher
told me that I could have won the Historical

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.150
Society Award for the colonial newspaper that
I wrote, but the glue I used to put the newspaper

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.760
together made the pages bleed into one another.
If I had done that immediately, I never would

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:14.610
have handed it in that way. Unfortunately,
it waited until I had handed it in to bleed.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.470
And last year, I was absolutely sure that
I was going to win the Junior Class Thespian

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:23.910
Award for my portrayal of the wandering minstrel
Nanki Poo until the costume mistress who has

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:28.550
always behaved toward me in an antagonistic
manner for some reason she had never inform

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:33.480
me of, switched my wooden sandals with those
of Coco, the lord high executioner. And as

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.820
a result, I slipped off the stage while wandering.
Also this past summer, I could have gone to

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.960
Yugoslavia with my soccer team, but I didn't
want to do anything to harm my straight A-average.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.610
So I went to summer school while everyone
else was hanging out in the mall and taking

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:51.500
who-knows-what drugs. My favorite book is
"Catcher in the Rye" because I identify with

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.010
Holden Caulfield who was in therapy like me,
but I would never go to a prostitute like

00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:00.480
he did. Also, I'm an extremely moral person
who only wants to use my many talents and

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.400
strong work ethic to give back to my community.
For example, the summer before my junior year,

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:12.650
I went to the Mitsba Corps at Rutgers University.
We had choices. We could work in a soup kitchen

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:17.860
or be a counselor in an inner-city camp or
in a camp for adults with disabilities or

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:23.200
with senior citizens. I chose to do all of
them. They said it couldn't be done, but my

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.480
Uncle Kenneth Breadstine, Harvard '72, hired
me a limousine so I could show up in each

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.930
place for an hour a day. That's all. I won
the Rotary Club for the photography contest

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:38.340
with my photos, the astonished faces of the
inner city kids and the homeless people when

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:44.310
I showed up in that limousine. When I graduate,
my Uncle Kenneth Breadstine, Harvard '72,

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:48.570
has promised to give me a thousand dollars
toward my future tuition to Harvard, a small

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:52.230
percentage of what he'll give to Harvard when
I'm admitted. I hope that you will accept

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:57.740
me into Harvard. Not only will I be forever
grateful but my Uncle Kenneth Breadstine,

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:06.180
Harvard '72, will be forever grateful, too.
That was written Rachel Jewel Shapiro. She

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.690
teaches the writing the personal essay course
at UCLA Extension. And that was one of the

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:24.970
first essays that we accepted. Okay, here's
another one. Here's another one. It's not

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:32.260
titled. It goes like this. My favorite saying
is "No guts, no glory." I can't recall who

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.030
said it first but whenever I'm in trouble
or facing a big challenge, I think about this

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:40.930
saying. In life, just like on the playing
field, you always have to bring your A-game.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.810
You have to step up to the plate and give
110% if you really want to turn up the heat

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:49.840
on the competition and take things to the
next level. Sure, some people may say it's

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.100
only a game, but this is true for the game
of life just like everything else. The fact

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:59.780
that is that anything worth doing is worth
doing well, and every one of us controls our

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.640
own destiny. You just take life one game at
a time, and be the best you can be. That's

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.030
all anyone can ask from you. I know what it's
like when it's crunch time and our backs are

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:12.380
against the wall. Those were the times when
you have to circle the wagons. There may have

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.900
been occasions when my team is in the dumps
because things are going south, but we never

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.810
say die. The beat is a bitter pill to swallow,
but sometimes it's just isn't our day. Nobody

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:26.810
ever promised us a rose garden. The game may
not be cakewalk but to me, a tough competitor

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:31.260
is a wake up call. Even if the game is a nail
biter, there's nothing like snatching victory

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.340
from the jaws of defeat. The crowd goes wild
and it's time to rewrite the record books.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:41.240
My teammates are like my family, and every
game is a team effort. No one ask for personal

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.020
glory and no one gets it. After all, there's
no "I" in team. The days we experience the

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.290
thrill of victory are the days that make you
want to get out of bed in the morning, but

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:54.320
no one knows what that day will bring. I truly
believe that everything happens for a reason,

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.930
and life never shuts the door without opening
a window. In trying times such as this, you

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:02.950
can't do better than live by the golden rule.
If everyone did, the world would be a better

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:13.300
place. So once again, that's www.funniestcollegeessays.com.
I hope you will all have a look at it. And

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:18.060
please, send us essays because we really want
them. Yeah?

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:22.470
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: I have some friends that I think
might be able to contribute.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.050
&gt;&gt; KORELITZ: Excellent.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: So I'll certainly pass that along.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.900
I'm curious about your introductory comment
that I very much agree with some of the things

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:33.360
you said in terms of that somewhat negative
light that a lot of the youth in this country

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.170
has been portrayed, and I personally have
a number of very close [INDISTINCT] in Princeton

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:44.700
so this is quite comical for me. But--and
I agree that while wonderful, many of them

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:51.390
are very normal. My brother probably wouldn't
appreciate that. In any case, I'm wondering--you

00:51:51.390 --> 00:52:00.360
see an older sibling and relative, I do see
incredible talent and interest in improving

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.830
the world. But I'm wondering what your perspective
both from your involvement with the university

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:09.560
and then, you know, as a writer and as a parent.
It seems to me to some degree that whether

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:15.060
it's the application process or the packaging
that you mentioned that there's so much pressure

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.010
and there's this innocence lost that I feel.
And so I'm just wondering your perspective

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:23.290
on that.
&gt;&gt; KORELITZ: I think it's one of so many ironies

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:29.020
of the process that it takes place at this
point in the development of young people,

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:34.810
because young people aren't idiots. I mean,
they're imbeciles. Teenagers behave like complete

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:41.350
imbeciles but here's the point. Don't we want
them to? Would we rather that that phase of

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:47.850
behaving irrationally, you know, comes in
the 30s or the 40s? No. This is when we want

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:52.480
them to behave badly. This is when we want
them to make mistakes. This is when we want

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.720
them to take these detours that, you know,
sometimes the only information that can be

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.781
gleaned from the detour is I don't want to
do that anymore. I don't want to be that kind

00:53:01.781 --> 00:53:07.640
of person that I just spent the last half
year being. And yet, you know, we now have

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:14.210
this microscope over these couple of years,
and it's a great, great shame. And one of

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:20.950
the first things that we were taught in our
training is, the process does not favor the

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:29.220
late bloomer. But look at late bloomers among
us who have enriched all of our lives. And

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.760
it's very sad and I think the people who make
these decisions are very aware of it, but

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:41.420
what can they do? You know, they're not fortune
tellers. You don't get a crystal ball. You

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:49.010
know, it's very sad. But, you know, the late
bloomers bloom eventually and then they can

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:54.440
become professors at Princeton. I mean, I
would just say this about my husband. My husband

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.020
barely graduated from college, and now he's
a Princeton professor. And you know, there's

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:05.430
a reason for that. But you know, sometimes
in the fullness of time, these talents flower.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:15.181
So, I hope that answered your question. Is
there any other question? Okay. Thank you

00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:23.520
so much for having me. It was really a pleasure.
&gt;&gt; STEVENS: Thank you.
