It's important to note, that touch is starting

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.810
to show up in many desktops and laptops, like

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.790
my Chromebook Pixel and many Windows eight machines.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.590
So ,don't make the mistake of thinking that touch

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.130
is only for mobile devices. In fact, this

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.410
is a critical point. Touch and mouse are not

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.990
mutually exclusive. The user may use them both

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.260
on the same device, even at the same time.
