RICH HYNDMAN: Welcome to this
week's Android Developer

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.310
Office Hours, live
from London.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.310
Yay!

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.980
Today, we're joined by Chris
Banes, Matt Gaunt, Nick

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.270
Butcher, and-- duh
da da duh duh--

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.790
Ellie Powers from the Google
Play developer consult team.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.110
Ellie's joining us today because
she's got a couple of

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.635
announcements she's gonna make
at the top of the show.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:23.470
As normal--

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.600
I'm going to say it's normal.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.730
We won't be making any
announcements, but we will be

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.992
making one or two announcements
at the start.

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:29.560
We won't be talking
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.510
or any unreleased products.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.020
We have a pretty full Moderator
today, so it's going

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
to go quite quickly to
get through them all.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.330
I'm going to try and make a note
when we've answered these

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.500
questions, so afterwards I can
put a little synopsis under

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.870
the YouTube video and make
that even more useful.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.240
So welcome to the guys live
in the Hangout as well.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.870
We've got--

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750
well, you just want to say hi?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.700
I'm too far away to actually
see you [INAUDIBLE] today.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.490
WIEBE ELSINGA: Hi.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.340
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.157
RICH HYNDMAN: Wiebe and Yossi
I recognize over there, and

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:57.340
we've got people piling in.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.360
So welcome to everyone
in the Hangout.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.090
There's Giuseppe as well.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.890
You'll have a chance to ask
some questions shortly.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.852
But for now, we will hopefully
have some information on the

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.440
new Play Developer
Console for us.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.725
ELLIE POWERS: Cool.

00:01:10.725 --> 00:01:14.960
So we've had a lot of interest
in the new Developer Console.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.060
A lot of people are using it
already, which is great.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.580
And last week, we asked people
what are the things that you'd

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.580
be looking for that would
encourage you to use the new

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.180
Developer Console.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.220
And so today, we actually
released a number of new

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.920
different features, and
most of them haven't

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.950
been announced before.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.280
So I guess you're the first
people to find out.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.620
So the Google Play private
channel is now available in

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.590
the new Developer Console.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.190
So if your company or
organization is using Google

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.050
Apps to distribute--

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.990
do we have a happy
guy down there?

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.790
I saw some happy guys.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.640
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yes, I am.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.400
ELLIE POWERS: Hey.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.360
So if that was keeping you
from switching to the new

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.960
Developer Console, you can now
use that to take certain

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.850
applications and distribute them
only within your Google

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.500
Apps domain.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.320
So go ahead and use
that right now.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.280
You can find it on the Pricing
and Distribution page, if you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.330
just scroll all the
way to the bottom.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.600
The second thing is that the
announcements module is now on

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.040
the new Developer Console, so
you'll be able to get any news

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.930
and other pieces of
information that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.280
we're sharing there.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.530
You can find that in the left
side of the navigation.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.120
It looks kind of like a
megaphone, and it lights up

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.090
bright orange when there's
a new announcement there.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.690
So you can try clicking on it
and seeing what's in there.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.810
The next thing that we have is
sort of a detail, but many

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.090
people, when they get in their
string resources, they don't

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.690
know which language codes
correlate with

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.750
which language name.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.540
So we're now showing the
language name and also the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.150
language code together, so that
if someone's sending you

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.700
a big file, and it's specified
only by the language code, you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.660
can be completely sure that
you're putting it into the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.860
right language.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.110
So that's sort of a detail.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.705
The next thing-- probably, I
think, the most popular change

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:01.150
is a lot of people have been
asking, how do I delete a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.690
draft application?

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.550
Maybe you created an
application, oops, it was the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.000
wrong package name.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.640
You've switched, or you just had
some experiments that you

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.650
decided not to publish.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.400
So that is now available.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.740
You can find that in the upper
right-hand corner of your

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.380
Developer Console, and if you
look in the little menu where

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.040
it'll say Draft, you can click
on that, and there should be

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.670
an option under there that says
Delete This Application.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.930
RICH HYNDMAN: After
you've done that--

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.550
ELLIE POWERS: Sorry?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.924
RICH HYNDMAN: After you've done
that, would you be able

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.787
to reuse the package
name again?

00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:31.040
Is it completely gone?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.110
ELLIE POWERS: I think so.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.630
I'm not 100% sure about that.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.760
Usually, when people--

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.990
I mean, there's no reason why
you would want to do that.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.990
If you have used the package
name, you should just carry on

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.790
with that one.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.120
But it's more like, a lot of
people would create the wrong

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.340
package name, and then realize
they need to change it.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.500
So if you already have
that package name

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.480
in there, it's fine.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.330
You don't have to do anything.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.750
But if you clutter up your
Developer Console, now you can

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.930
declutter it.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.890
RICH HYNDMAN: From apps that
have never been published.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.170
ELLIE POWERS: Right.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.940
Once you've published an
application, even if you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.340
unpublish it, you
can't delete it.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.940
But if it's a draft, and it's
never been published,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.810
you can delete it.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.400
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Just wanted to
say, I tested that feature a

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.770
few minutes ago.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.590
ELLIE POWERS: Did it work?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.660
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.870
ELLIE POWERS: Fantastic.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.985
OK, I'm very glad that you
tested that for us.

00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.540
RICH HYNDMAN: How did you know
the feature was there, Yossi?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.520
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, I have
two developer accounts.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.310
One is for Legacy, because the
Israeli market was changed to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.210
the Israel currency,
so I had to open a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.000
new developer account.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.610
And when I tried to log in with
the Legacy one, I had a

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.450
message saying I need
to pay $25 again to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.700
register as a developer.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.570
So I paid again, and when I
entered the Developer Console,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.440
I saw all the new features.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.900
Also the megaphone, also the
strings and everything.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.560
ELLIE POWERS: Cool.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.990
We updated the Developer Console
just a couple of hours

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.890
ago, so that's--

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.150
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, so I was
lucky to see all the changes

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.426
in real time.

00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:11.340
RICH HYNDMAN: That's how
relevant this show is.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.752
ELLIE POWERS: Exactly.

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:14.670
This show is like,
right there.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.040
Did you think it was a dream
that you saw a megaphone that

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.300
wasn't there before?

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.240
Confirm it here.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.380
And then the other thing that
we've launched today is what

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.860
we're calling Statistics
Annotations.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.990
So, a lot of times, when
you're looking at your

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.820
statistics graph, you wonder,
why did that go up?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.900
I had a certain number of users,
and then it went up.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.800
Or, I had a rating,
and then it just

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.160
dipped all of a sudden.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.880
And a lot of times, that's
because you've

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.960
released a new version.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.935
Maybe that new version has
different functionality.

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:41.860
Maybe you fixed some bugs,
and that caused your

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.520
rating to go up.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.700
And now we have little dots on
your Statistics page that show

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.700
when each of your different
APK versions went out.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.010
So you can just hover your mouse
over your Statistics

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.790
page on this little grey dot
that comes up, and it'll say,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.980
OK, that was version number 7,
or that was version number 50.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.130
And you can use that to see if
some of the spikes in your

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.270
statistics graph are correlated
with new releases.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.660
WIEBE ELSINGA: Based on your
version code or version name?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.530
ELLIE POWERS: I don't remember
which one it shows.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.620
It definitely shows either
one of the two.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.130
Every APK has both a version
code and a version number.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.010
I don't remember which
one it shows.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.390
I think it might--

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.850
well, I'm not even going
to guess, because--

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.673
RICH HYNDMAN: Why don't you
check, Wiebe, and tell us.

00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:25.010
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, you
can check and tell us.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.540
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I'm
checking right now.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.850
ELLIE POWERS: Cool.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.420
Yeah, it only works on an
application where you've

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.890
released multiple
versions of it.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.980
So after you've released your
second version, you'll have

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.600
some grey dots on there.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.410
And that's basically all
we have for today.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.415
That's all of our
new features.

00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:43.680
But I hope the message to any
developers out there listening

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.570
is, keep using the new
Developer Console.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.790
Click the feedback link.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.960
Let us know what you think.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.140
And we have a team here in
London that's working to make

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.840
more improvements, so even if
you're looking for something

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.940
that isn't there yet, it still
could come out pretty soon.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.490
So just keep telling us what
you think, and we'll keep

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.150
working on it.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.430
RICH HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.640
And if there's any reason why
you haven't switched from the

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.550
old Developer Console to the new
one, just let us know on

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.830
Google+ straightaway.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.050
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah,
we definitely like

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.940
to hear those comments.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.670
And if you're having any
problems, we want to make sure

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.274
that the support team figures
them out for you.

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:15.990
RICH HYNDMAN: The new Developer
Console is supposed

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.610
to be all-encompassing.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.570
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Just to let
everyone know, the version

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.040
code is what I see as a
grey dot on the graph.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.850
ELLIE POWERS: So it's
version code.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.070
Thank you.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.580
RICH HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.605
ELLIE POWERS: I'm going
to make a note.

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:28.530
RICH HYNDMAN: Well, that's it
for this week's Android

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.590
Developer Office Hours.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.214
I want to go and play with
the new console.

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:35.031
It's going to be half an hour
before I can try all these

00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.350
little things out.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.542
OK.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:41.250
Before we fire off into the
Moderator, has anybody from

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.890
the Hangout got a question?

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.653
There's a few things down
in the chat window.

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:46.579
NICK BUTCHER: I'm just bumping
up the text size.

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:48.900
I couldn't read it.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.420
ELLIE POWERS: We saw someone
saying it would be good if it

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.700
showed the version name as
well as the version code.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.250
OK.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.130
I'll take that note.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.380
RICH HYNDMAN: Quite
literally noted.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.460
Look at us, all staring
at the screen.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.620
Should we get better glasses?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.360
This is incredible.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.010
MALE SPEAKER: Everyone's
saying [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.890
version name.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:03.695
NICK BUTCHER: Interesting.

00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:04.550
Well, all right then.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.780
RICH HYNDMAN: First one
to version eight.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.415
NICK BUTCHER: Well,
thank you, Ellie.

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:09.520
You heard it here first.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.980
News breaking.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.141
ELLIE POWERS: Should I stick
around, or are you

00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:11.610
guys good to go?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.070
RICH HYNDMAN: You're welcome
to stick around, because

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.470
there's a question
in the Moderator.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.160
ELLIE POWERS: Oh, well, we'll
see if any questions come up.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.140
NICK BUTCHER: Should I go
straight to that one?

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.260
RICH HYNDMAN: Go on then.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.835
We'll go straight to the
Moderator question, which

00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:21.470
Ellie will probably say she
had to [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.224
ELLIE POWERS: Is it a question
about our future roadmap?

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.300
CHRIS BANES: Well, Hans Peter
has said, "When will you start

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.990
publishing regional Android
version distribution lists, in

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.150
addition to the global ones?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.360
ELLIE POWERS: I've never--

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.671
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, hold on,
this isn't related to the

00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:41.328
Developer Console.

00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:41.766
ELLIE POWERS: No, it doesn't
sound like--

00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:43.563
RICH HYNDMAN: See, I thought
this was the person asking to

00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:45.270
be able to do regional
APKs or something.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:45.890
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.240
Is this a version of Android
that would be able to--

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.304
RICH HYNDMAN: This is like which
country has the most Ice

00:08:50.304 --> 00:08:51.760
Cream Sandwiches [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.300
ELLIE POWERS: Oh, looking
for data.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.420
RICH HYNDMAN: Sorry, that's
not Developer Console.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.528
And yeah, that's something
we won't talk about.

00:08:56.528 --> 00:08:57.502
Or can't.

00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:59.250
We have no information.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.110
NICK BUTCHER: But if you
look at something

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.320
like Distomo, is it?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.150
ELLIE POWERS: Distimo?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.330
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, Distimo,
that's it.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.050
They put out some pretty
interesting stats.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.400
Or what's the other one?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.020
Stats Counter.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.420
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.195
The best way to get this
information is to publish an

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:11.790
app on the Play store.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.670
RICH HYNDMAN: You get access
to everything then.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.994
Publish it and make it
successful in every

00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:17.422
country in the world.

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:18.820
You can find out all
the statistics.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.720
MATT GAUNT: It's that easy.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.910
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Or have a botnet
all over the world, and

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.060
see those devices.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.372
RICH HYNDMAN: Or look out for
something like Distimo that

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:28.860
[INAUDIBLE] publish them.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.160
NICK BUTCHER: Or [INAUDIBLE]
and people like that.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.670
They have some interesting
stats that

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.810
aren't terribly off.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.810
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.780
[INAUDIBLE] if we don't have
any other questions

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.050
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.894
What else have we got
in the Moderator?

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:44.144
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:47.612
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Everybody's
looking at you, Chris.

00:09:47.612 --> 00:09:48.536
RICH HYNDMAN: Just set up a
meeting between Andrew Kelly

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:49.922
and Chris each week.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.770
Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.700
CHRIS BANES: Andy's
here isn't he?

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.880
He had a camera when he jumped
in, but then he muted it.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.700
RICH HYNDMAN: Black and
white on the far left.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.970
CHRIS BANES: So Andrew Kelly has
asked, he's implementing a

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.750
new filter for the array data,
and it seems to be

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.500
particularly cumbersome, because
most [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.250
tunnels are private.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.540
He's switched [INAUDIBLE] data,
but do I have any tips

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.425
for using the array
data to do this?

00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:19.930
Not really, as such.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.790
It shouldn't be much different
to use an array data as it

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.700
would be a beta data.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.013
The only difference is you won't
have direct access to

00:10:25.013 --> 00:10:27.850
the sort of collection.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.830
But you can use data rates as
you normally would by using

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.690
getSize and getItem.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.256
And it's right through.

00:10:35.256 --> 00:10:38.220
So yeah, it shouldn't
be much different.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.590
Can't think of a way
it really would.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.210
So yeah.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.010
If you want to chime in?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.187
RICH HYNDMAN: He might chat
in the side window

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.101
unless we carry on.

00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:47.735
Unless you want me to
[INAUDIBLE] the G+ stream open

00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:48.910
at the same time.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.780
CHRIS BANES: So yeah, I can't
really think of much sort of

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.790
difficult with it.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.990
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.595
Excellent.

00:10:56.595 --> 00:10:58.256
What's now?

00:10:58.256 --> 00:11:00.090
Have you seen anything
that you--

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.755
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:02.900
questions.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.050
So someone's asking when will
subscriptions come to In-app

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.240
Billing version 2, the answer
which is, last week.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.250
ELLIE POWERS: Version
3, right?

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.760
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
version 3, sorry.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.380
From v2 into v3, yeah.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.130
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, just like
the new Developer Console

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.250
that's all-encompassing, the
In-app Billing v3 is now also

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:18.960
all-encompassing.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.670
There's no reason you
should be using v2.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.020
V3 is better in every
single way.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.120
NICK BUTCHER: A lot easier for
you to implement as well, so

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.075
there's a lot fewer gotchas
and things you

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:29.260
have to be aware of.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.984
CHRIS BANES: I did see one
gotcha the other day.

00:11:30.984 --> 00:11:33.560
I mean, there's no more
unmanaged items.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:33.790
RICH HYNDMAN: Correct.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.290
ELLIE POWERS: That's right.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.280
CHRIS BANES: So they're
all managed.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.690
ELLIE POWERS: It's a
blessing and curse.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.490
Mostly a blessing.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.180
CHRIS BANES: So if you have an
unmanaged item now, you have

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.380
to consume the item to
actually use it.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.580
So I've had a couple of
partners who've--

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.840
RICH HYNDMAN: Asking how
to consume items?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.628
CHRIS BANES: Well, they didn't
know that they had to.

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:53.440
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.570
NICK BUTCHER: So switch to v3
without reading the docs.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.850
Interesting.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.270
RICH HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.118
That's about the only one.

00:12:01.118 --> 00:12:02.770
And other than that, it should
be a lot easier.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.020
CHRIS BANES: Yes.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.440
MATT GAUNT: Someone saying, "Is
there an ETA for In-app

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.250
Billing version 4?"

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.370
ELLIE POWERS: Version 4?

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.145
RICH HYNDMAN: That was the
question we just answered.

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:14.905
MATT GAUNT: Oh, OK.

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:18.310
Everyone's getting version
numbers mixed up.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.560
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:26.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.300
this one.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.710
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.625
RICH HYNDMAN: I'm going take
one from the floor.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:32.876
If anybody in the Hangout has a
question, get ready for it.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.440
WIEBE ELSINGA: I posted this
on Google+ as well.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.790
Is there a good alternative
for the left menu

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.220
bar on a Google TV?

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.590
There's a lot of complaints
that it isn't the right

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.580
navigation field for a TV.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.220
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, so there's
no real good solution.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.350
I think what we're seeing
a lot of developers do,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.390
especially when you look at
someone like Amazon, et

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.080
cetera-- like, they start just
going down the route of making

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.020
quite a custom UI, in
terms of what makes

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.260
sense to their content.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.680
I think the general thing that
we're trying to encourage

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.660
developers to do is only show
the relevant information based

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.170
on where the user's focusing.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.110
Try and keep the UI as clean
and as basic and kind of as

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.310
attractive as possible, and
then start showing them

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.140
additional information depending
on where they're

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.410
focusing, because that's
going to be

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.010
the main way to interact.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.040
So yeah.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.380
I don't have a perfect solution
to avoid using the

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.820
left nav bar.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.530
The biggest thing is to try and
avoid that navigation trap

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.950
when you're using
the action bar.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.590
Because you're using up and down
along with the list view,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.000
et cetera, it's going to
run into problems.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.260
But we don't have a
perfect solution.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:54.080
I have played with some of
the slide in drawers.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.070
They do work on Google TV.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.010
We started playing around with
the idea of having the menu

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.970
button to kind of slide it open
and close it, which is an

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.060
OK design paradigm, but
obviously, you have to kind of

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.090
train the user to do it.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.810
And then you start running into
issues of, is that the

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:10.820
right thing or not?

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.765
And it kind of starts going
against the way you'd use it

00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:14.180
on tablets and phones.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.390
NICK BUTCHER: Why was
it focused then?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.950
MATT GAUNT: Well, the default
thing is, you can actually

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.920
make it so that when you focus
to the left, and then you get

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.695
to the point where you're on
the edge of the screen, it

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:23.540
will open it for you.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.780
And then when you focus out,
it will close it for you.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.490
So that's in the--

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.700
NICK BUTCHER: So if you use the
menu button to open it,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.130
does it then focus it as well?

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.440
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.550
You can do it because you're
programmatically doing it.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.490
But yeah.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.880
It's one of those things
we were playing with.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.940
You can do it that way, but
I'm not entirely convinced

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.590
it's a great kind of
user experience.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.500
So those are kind of the main
things that I've seen people

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.180
trying to do.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.090
But I don't have a
perfect solution.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.885
Not one that I'd say,
definitely go

00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:52.324
down this route, yeah.

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.680
WIEBE ELSINGA: OK.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.260
Shame.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.510
MATT GAUNT: I know.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.550
CHRIS BANES: I'll answer
Andy's question.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.170
So Andy has asked, "How secure
is data stored in shared

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.800
preferences when using mode
private?" And he's asked, "Is

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.160
it worth doing encryption?"

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.720
So, mode private basically
makes the firewalls only

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.350
accessible to your user
ID as an app.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.110
So if there are other apps that
are sharing your user ID,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.140
they can access those files.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.910
If the device is rooted, sort of
a rooted app could actually

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.050
access those files too.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.500
So it depends on the
context of the

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.930
information that you're storing.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.420
But it's sort of up
to you, really.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.520
NICK BUTCHER: And if you're
talking about encryption, then

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.130
you get down to then,
where are you going

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.310
to store the key?

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.445
So you might just end up moving
the problem, rather

00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:42.540
than solving the problem.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.200
RICH HYNDMAN: And there's some
great guidelines published

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.700
yesterday by Trevor Johns on the
Android Developers Blog,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.160
which say don't create and
store the key beforehand.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.940
Make sure you create it on the
device after run time and then

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.525
store it, so that if someone
does get hold of the key, it

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:58.040
obviously doesn't apply to every
single instance of your

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.810
application.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:04.830
He says store the salt
for the key in local.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.005
NICK BUTCHER: And that is
relying on your user ID to

00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:07.665
protect it.

00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:08.680
RICH HYNDMAN: And then
regenerate the key

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.630
when you need it.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.340
Use Secure Random.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.670
A few other things that
he's put in there.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.160
So there's a blog post that's
currently on Android

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.520
Developers Blog Blogspot.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.580
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, obviously
these are all defeated if

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.120
users have rooted
their devices.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.810
So I'd say, yeah, it comes out
to if it's like your banking

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.850
information or something like
that, then probably don't

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.390
store it on the device.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.470
Like, anything super secure--

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.915
because it's not a trusted
computing platform at the end

00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:31.910
of the day.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.727
People have access to
this information.

00:16:33.727 --> 00:16:37.140
So depends on the information.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.810
RICH HYNDMAN: What is
secure these days?

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.700
Store the hashes or whatever
you need to access your

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.450
service on the device, but
don't secure plain text

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.244
passwords [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:48.601
Don't store passwords or reverse
engineerable versions

00:16:48.601 --> 00:16:49.606
of passwords.

00:16:49.606 --> 00:16:50.520
That would be crazy.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.210
We've got a few people asking
about IABv2 bugs.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.610
We do know there was a lot
of issues with IABv2.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.300
Messages were bundled up, a
lot of developers wouldn't

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.090
read them all.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:03.330
It was very hard to debug a lot
of the IABv2 issues, so

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.430
obviously, the answer is, if
you're having IABv2 issues,

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.770
please, please, please
switch to IABv3.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.059
That's what it's there for.

00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:12.440
And [? Sika ?]

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.150
is asking something in
the chat window.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.750
"Can we answer questions
in chat?" Yes we can.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.045
ELLIE POWERS: There's a
follow-up question at the

00:17:20.045 --> 00:17:21.480
bottom from [? Sika. ?]

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.920
RICH HYNDMAN: "Is it possible
to clear programmatically

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.630
Google Chrome cache on Android?"
I think not.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.280
You can send someone to the app
info for Chrome, and they

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.801
can choose to press the
Clear Cache button.

00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:41.070
But I don't believe that you
could add-- no, no no.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.840
You can send them to the app
info, and they can clear the

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.620
cache and the data there.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.650
But you can't from your
application go ahead and start

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.100
clearing other applications'
data.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.470
It would also be against the
developer distribution

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.160
agreement, which says you're not
allowed to interfere with

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.580
the behavior of other
applications.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.990
NICK BUTCHER: And also in the
sidebar, Giuseppe's asked two

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.630
questions about the
Developer Console.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.020
He asks, he would like contact
information for crashes for

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.340
the user who incurred a crash.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.212
Which is interesting [INAUDIBLE]
supports.

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:08.940
So thanks for that suggestion.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.970
And number two, he says, "When
will we get reply to review?"

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.570
ELLIE POWERS: Yeah, this is
a really common question.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.380
I guess what we're doing right
now is we're rolling it out

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.010
gradually to more developers
over time.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.030
And sorry that you don't
have it yet.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.150
We have been making some tweaks
to the feature as we do

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.695
roll it out, so hopefully by
the time we do get it out

00:18:27.695 --> 00:18:29.580
more, it'll be a better
experience for both

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.500
developers and users.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.080
So please hold tight.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.330
Sorry about the delays.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.140
NICK BUTCHER: Back in the
Moderator, Nick in Chicago

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.500
asks-- he says he has a GLView
on top of two VideoViews,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.030
which he switches to go
from an intro video

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.500
to a looping video.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.810
And in between, he gets a black
screen flash, which is

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.200
the background actually
bleeding through.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.470
And how to make it gapless.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.520
And Chris has posted a link to
Stack Overflow [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.860
which is very, very good.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.970
Just to add a little bit
of context to that.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.080
So a surface view is actually a
hole in your view hierarchy,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.020
and the reason we do this is
because normally, you're

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.700
playing videos, and in order to
not have to recomposite the

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.560
whole thing when we're trying
to get it into the window,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.720
it's much more efficient
to render it like this.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.260
So it takes one less copy, and
you can play videos at a much

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.130
higher frame rate, and
so on and so forth.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.670
But yeah.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.140
The consequence of that is that
it's not part of your

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.780
view hierarchy.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.010
So you get these strange things
where something might

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.060
bleed through from having
this hole in it.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.530
So yeah, you can't actually
get around

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.365
the whole black flash.

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:28.770
You can't avoid it happening.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.100
But what you can is
work around it.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.720
So you can put something
on top of it.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.590
So you can put a view on top of
your surface view, right?

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.670
And so, during the transition,
you might put fade to black

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.680
view on top, switch out the
video view underneath, and

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.550
face that view back out to
transparency to give the

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.430
impression of a gapless
playback.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.750
So it's just a consequence
of using that.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.865
And the alternative is you could
take a look at texture

00:19:52.865 --> 00:19:56.400
view, which is available since
Ice Cream Sandwich?

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.260
Yes, API 11.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.260
No, 14.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.733
Sorry.

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:02.100
Honeycomb.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.080
But that does involve an extra
memory copy, so you might want

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.730
to not use that for your entire
video playback, or test

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.182
it to see how the
performance is.

00:20:13.134 --> 00:20:14.040
MATT GAUNT: Nailed it.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Ooh.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.880
Someone's just destroyed
our chat.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.145
Hopefully if you had a question
in the chat, it just

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:22.160
refreshed it.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.350
CHRIS BANES: I think it's meant
to do reverb and why

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.168
don't we support another
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:27.168 --> 00:20:28.418
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.570
They work very well for Android
development, and some

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:39.610
people do use IntelliJ for their
Android development.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.270
But yeah, the primary focus
of the tools team--

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.511
they have to focus
on something, and

00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:44.761
they focused on Eclipse.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.450
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE] come
in from [INAUDIBLE] in Israel.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.100
He says--

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:51.870
RICH HYNDMAN: He's just
joined us live?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.420
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.110
RICH HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.720
NICK BUTCHER: You want to
ask your question live,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.970
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:58.468 --> 00:20:59.460
RICH HYNDMAN: Obviously not.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.500
ELLIE POWERS: Is he muted?

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.060
MATT GAUNT: I think he is.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.310
ELLIE POWERS: If you're
muted, can you unmute?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:10.510
MATT GAUNT: Nope.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.670
Not working.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.930
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, he's not
muted on the Hangout.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.300
ELLIE POWERS: OK.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.680
NICK BUTCHER: Anyway, if you
manage to make noise, then you

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.730
can chime in, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.960
But until then, I'll crack on
with what you've written in

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.210
the Moderator.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.605
So you asked, you'd like to load
a NinePatch image from a

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:27.100
remote server.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.500
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.783
My question, exactly.

00:21:29.783 --> 00:21:31.335
You got me?

00:21:31.335 --> 00:21:32.840
NICK BUTCHER: You want
to ask it live?

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.061
Go for it.

00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:35.110
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, sure.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.530
We all know that usually we
have image views that get

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.480
their images remotely.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.010
And I want to try to
do that with a

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.100
NinePatch image, basically.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.430
So in order to do that, I've
digged a lot in resources--

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.190
resource types .h and do
NinePatch and all that.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:22:00.380
And I understood that I either
need to compile the .9.png on

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:06.240
the server side before I hand
it down to my application.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.230
I couldn't find a utility
that will do that.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.490
There is some way to hack APT
to do that, but it's not

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.330
something that I can rely on in
the production environment.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.320
And so I looked for another way,
and that's to basically

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.340
compile the .9.png file in real
time on the fly in my

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.360
application, which means
drifting down and to extract

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.510
two pixels on each dimension,
and create a new PNG file and

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.300
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:45.950
array, and then use the
NinePatchDrawable interface or

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.580
API, basically, to create the
NinePatch programmatically.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.880
I am ashamed to say that
I failed to succeed.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.080
I couldn't do that.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.290
I mean, I've tried for about a
week, and I couldn't find any

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.280
resource on the net
to do that, or

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.310
any other leads there.

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.360
So any help will be greatly
appreciated.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.160
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, there
is no supported way

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.830
of doing this, really.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.598
No officially supported way.

00:23:16.598 --> 00:23:18.350
It definitely has
been documented.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.950
There was a question similar to
this a couple of weeks ago

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.330
on this show, and there was
a couple of Stack Overflow

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.800
threads which were linked.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.740
So someone has worked out
[INAUDIBLE], but there's a

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.840
[INAUDIBLE] array that you
can sort of decode

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.730
the resource wave.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.570
It'll actually do it for you.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.860
But I can't remember off
the top of my head.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.210
I'll have to look and
then reply later.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:42.470
So yeah.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.331
I'll have a look and sort of
reply after this show.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.960
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, we have
had this question before.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.820
I have passed it around
the Android team.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.085
I've [INAUDIBLE] as well, and
the resounding response has

00:23:56.085 --> 00:23:59.971
been that there isn't a
supported way of doing it.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.960
YOSSI ELKRIEF: But why not
do the [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.160
to take care of all the
files on the server?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.170
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, the problem
with that is, you're then at

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.990
the whim of network
compression, all

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.140
that kind of stuff.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.000
So if the network mangled
your file in between--

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.330
MALE SPEAKER: I couldn't
hear that.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.960
CHRIS BANES: So if you're on a
mobile network, most mobile

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.240
networks compress images.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.660
So if I compress
your NinePatch,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.040
it won't work anymore.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.460
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.170
So just do a secure way to
transfer the files in parts,

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.370
like a multi-part encoded
in base 64, maybe.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:47.717
MALE SPEAKER: I know how to
bypass the mobile network

00:24:47.717 --> 00:24:49.060
compression things.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.380
Everything is secured in
Talon, so the mobile

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.670
doesn't know what I'm
passing there.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.850
They have no way to
touch my data.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.890
I know that because
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.770
mobile operator that if you're
trying to do [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.090
so I'm funneling everything.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:17.870
So as for [INAUDIBLE], so
the mobile operator

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.284
won't touch my data.

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:22.620
So I know that I'll get the
PNG file [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.870
on server.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:27.790
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.460
Yeah.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.440
Just looking at the time, we're
down to the last five

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.440
minutes of today's Hangout.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.650
Maybe have a quick look
at the next page

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.640
and clear the Moderator.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.530
Has anybody got anything urgent
they want to get in

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.064
before the end of the Hangout?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.530
MATT GAUNT: Silence.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.000
RICH HYNDMAN: Any more questions
from inside the chat

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.858
or the Hangout as we just
look through the

00:25:50.858 --> 00:25:51.740
last couple of questions?

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.380
CHRIS BANES: Andrew
Kelly has asked

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.850
about Google I/O tickets.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.101
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Buy one.

00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:59.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.880
CHRIS BANES: You've got
the right idea.

00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:10.720
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.900
NICK BUTCHER: So someone's
asking, "Is there a design

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.040
pattern for synchronizing rows
of data between disparate

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.910
systems, between different
devices, in particular,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.260
without having conflicting key
identifiers?" Because they're

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.310
using UUID.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.570
"But I think they will not
work for a large system.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.790
Any comments?"

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.962
Interesting.

00:26:30.962 --> 00:26:33.575
So there's a bunch of different
things you could do.

00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:35.740
I don't know how you're actually
synchronizing between

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.200
your devices.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.450
I don't know if you're using
some kind of back end system

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.020
like App Engine, or whether--

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.403
you could build something
like this.

00:26:42.403 --> 00:26:45.340
We gave a workshop on how to use
Google Drive, for example,

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.630
to synchronize data between the
two devices, and Dropbox

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:51.080
just launched a similar API for
Android to help you to do

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.080
syncing of data between
devices.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.110
But when you're talking about
the actual key creations, so

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.220
like, if you're creating an
object on two devices, and you

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.850
want them to not collide,
then, yeah.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.207
It makes sense to either use
some kind of [? GUI, ?] or I

00:27:04.207 --> 00:27:06.610
think the way Drive actually
does it is it doesn't have an

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.970
identifier until you
try and upload it.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.690
And when you upload it, Drive
will give you a unique

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.160
identifier.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.246
So you could use something
like that, perhaps.

00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:14.860
If I've understood the
question correctly.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.130
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.340
You can generate something--

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.110
NICK BUTCHER: [? With GUI, ?]
right?

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.030
YOSSI ELKRIEF: --random
or with a timestamp.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:24.210
So it will be completely
unique.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.856
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:31.800
Was somebody else-- no, I
think-- there we go, yeah.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.770
Who's that in the chat--

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.526
in the Hangout there?

00:27:35.526 --> 00:27:37.234
CHRIS BANES: I think it's
Carson [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.290
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.540
Nothing to say?

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:48.580
Yeah.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.260
Unless anybody else has any--

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.970
oh, hi.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.265
Hi.

00:27:51.265 --> 00:27:52.515
Hello?

00:27:54.248 --> 00:27:57.810
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so I have
a question [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:58.930
CHRIS BANES: We're having
trouble hearing you.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.666
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.666 --> 00:28:01.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Sure, go ahead.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:02.740
Just speak slowly, because--

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.320
MALE SPEAKER: OK, [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.454
systems.

00:28:08.454 --> 00:28:10.650
I am trying to [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.980
ELLIE POWERS: Oh, OK.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.230
Now we can see.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.217
RICH HYNDMAN: Yeah, if you could
type the question into

00:28:36.217 --> 00:28:37.160
the chat window.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.852
We're having a bit of trouble
hearing what you're saying.

00:28:41.852 --> 00:28:43.102
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.720
WIEBE ELSINGA: The guy
said, just did it.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.850
It was the question about
the cache for Chrome.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.215
RICH HYNDMAN: OK.

00:28:51.215 --> 00:28:53.010
Yeah, we answered that, that
it was impossible.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.410
Personally, if I was looking
for that, I would plug the

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:02.340
device in, go to the app info,
and see which intent was fired

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.044
to get [INAUDIBLE] info.

00:29:04.044 --> 00:29:06.825
Then put that intent inside my
application, so when you fire

00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:11.235
it off, the user gets taken
to Chrome's app info.

00:29:11.235 --> 00:29:15.070
Chrome probably supports the
intent for going directly to

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.320
storage settings as well.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.000
NICK BUTCHER: It's probably not
documented, so it could

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
change, obviously.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.690
RICH HYNDMAN: Oh, that's true.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.490
It's a good point.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.740
All right then.

00:29:27.315 --> 00:29:27.770
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:28.125
OK.

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:30.190
So I think that brings us to the
end of our time this week.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.340
So thank you, everyone, who's
pre-submitted the questions.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.030
I hope you're enjoying the
new shorter format.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.240
Hopefully we get through quite
a lot of content, and it's

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.520
easier for you to re-watch
later as well.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.860
So, as always, we prefer
questions pre-submitted in

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.470
advance into the Moderator
queue.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.760
So if you have any questions,
or we didn't get around to

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.270
your question, please do submit
it for next week.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.180
And thanks for everyone who
