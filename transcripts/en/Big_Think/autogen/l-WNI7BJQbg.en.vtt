things that as a poker player I'll look
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.300
things that as a poker player I'll look
for and the most important thing is

for and the most important thing is
 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.470
for and the most important thing is
first of all to get sort of a baseline

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
first of all to get sort of a baseline
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.189

of somebody it's impossible to to tell
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.160
of somebody it's impossible to to tell
whether the behavior someone's showing

whether the behavior someone's showing
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470
whether the behavior someone's showing
is meaningful or not if you don't know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
is meaningful or not if you don't know
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.930

how they naturally behave so the first

thing I'll do when I sit down at the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
thing I'll do when I sit down at the
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.860
thing I'll do when I sit down at the
table is look at what my opponents are

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
table is look at what my opponents are

interact with the waitress or are they
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.350
interact with the waitress or are they
naturally quite quiet and shy how do

naturally closed off are they very

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579
naturally closed off are they very
 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.250
naturally closed off are they very
languishing that kind of thing and it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
languishing that kind of thing and it
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.450
languishing that kind of thing and it
must have got an idea of their baseline

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
must have got an idea of their baseline
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430
must have got an idea of their baseline
outside of a hand then I looked to see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
outside of a hand then I looked to see
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319
outside of a hand then I looked to see
how they deviate from that when they're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
how they deviate from that when they're
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.899
how they deviate from that when they're
actually in the middle of playing or you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
actually in the middle of playing or you
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.590
actually in the middle of playing or you
know in a tense situation and in general

what you want to look for in both poker

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
what you want to look for in both poker
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550
what you want to look for in both poker
but also when you're to say trying to

their comfort level if if there's sort
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.179
their comfort level if if there's sort
of if they seem authentic like as a rule

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
of if they seem authentic like as a rule
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160
of if they seem authentic like as a rule
of thumb humans are actually quite good

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
of thumb humans are actually quite good
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.330
of thumb humans are actually quite good
picking up authenticity if someone's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
picking up authenticity if someone's
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.210
picking up authenticity if someone's
being disingenuous so that's that's sort

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
being disingenuous so that's that's sort

of the thing to look out for and there

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540
of the thing to look out for and there
 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230
of the thing to look out for and there
are some like classic behaviors that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
are some like classic behaviors that
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.609
are some like classic behaviors that
I've noticed people do at the table

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
I've noticed people do at the table
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.780
I've noticed people do at the table
where they'll they'll sort of make a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
where they'll they'll sort of make a
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.429
where they'll they'll sort of make a
point of if you see them something

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
point of if you see them something
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.749
point of if you see them something
making a point of making themselves

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
making a point of making themselves
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910
making a point of making themselves
bigger you know they wear their

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
bigger you know they wear their
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.260
bigger you know they wear their
naturally sitting like this and now

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
naturally sitting like this and now
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050
naturally sitting like this and now
they're sort of puffing up ah that's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
they're sort of puffing up ah that's
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330
they're sort of puffing up ah that's
more often than not sort of false

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
more often than not sort of false
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.870
more often than not sort of false
confidence that they're trying to show

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
confidence that they're trying to show
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.719
confidence that they're trying to show
you know most people do try to stay very

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729
you know most people do try to stay very
 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.179
you know most people do try to stay very
constant so if you notice sort of like

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
constant so if you notice sort of like
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.440
constant so if you notice sort of like
you really do notice a behavior

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
you really do notice a behavior
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.210
you really do notice a behavior
particularly against someone who seems

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
particularly against someone who seems
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.619
particularly against someone who seems
to play quite regularly their chances

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
to play quite regularly their chances
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.300
to play quite regularly their chances
are they're they're aware of their

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
are they're they're aware of their
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890
are they're they're aware of their
behavior so they're probably trying to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
behavior so they're probably trying to
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.510
behavior so they're probably trying to
mislead you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520
mislead you
 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610
mislead you
but another rule of thumb I like to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
but another rule of thumb I like to
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.250
but another rule of thumb I like to
follow is the first thing you learn as a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260
follow is the first thing you learn as a
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.820
follow is the first thing you learn as a
kid usually to when you lie is Oh Liars

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
kid usually to when you lie is Oh Liars
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440
kid usually to when you lie is Oh Liars
won't look you in the eye so what to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
won't look you in the eye so what to
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910
won't look you in the eye so what to
pick what the kids do to overcompensate

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
pick what the kids do to overcompensate
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250
pick what the kids do to overcompensate
they'll look you in the eye and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
they'll look you in the eye and
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830
they'll look you in the eye and
similarly people are very aware of their

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
similarly people are very aware of their
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020
similarly people are very aware of their
faces and you know this part of their

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
faces and you know this part of their
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.699
faces and you know this part of their
body if they're trying to be dishonest

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709
body if they're trying to be dishonest
 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.980
body if they're trying to be dishonest
but what they're not thinking about is

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990
but what they're not thinking about is
 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.550
but what they're not thinking about is
the rest of their body so the lower down

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
the rest of their body so the lower down
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.490
the rest of their body so the lower down
on the body that you're looking at the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
on the body that you're looking at the
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.340
on the body that you're looking at the
more reliable the information is so if

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
more reliable the information is so if
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.479
more reliable the information is so if
you think about when you're excited

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489
you think about when you're excited
 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.220
you think about when you're excited
about something generally speaking you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
about something generally speaking you
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.440
about something generally speaking you
want pounce around and and and before

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
want pounce around and and and before
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.410
want pounce around and and and before
some of you can't keep still and you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
some of you can't keep still and you
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.760
some of you can't keep still and you
know that's like we call it Happy Feet

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
know that's like we call it Happy Feet
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.040
know that's like we call it Happy Feet
in poker like the the feet are often the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
in poker like the the feet are often the
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.620
in poker like the the feet are often the
most reliable thing to look at on your

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
most reliable thing to look at on your
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.510
most reliable thing to look at on your
opponent because they might be

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520
opponent because they might be
 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.360
opponent because they might be
completely stoic in their face but their

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
completely stoic in their face but their
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.699
completely stoic in their face but their
feet are bouncing around it's usually a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709
feet are bouncing around it's usually a
 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.140
feet are bouncing around it's usually a
sign that they have a really strong hand

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
sign that they have a really strong hand
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420
sign that they have a really strong hand
but similarly if they're sort of smiling

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
but similarly if they're sort of smiling
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.760
but similarly if they're sort of smiling
and chatty but their feet FL all of a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
and chatty but their feet FL all of a
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.620
and chatty but their feet FL all of a
sudden sort of tucked themselves around

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
sudden sort of tucked themselves around
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.790
sudden sort of tucked themselves around
the table that we were you know around

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
the table that we were you know around
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.420
the table that we were you know around
the chair legs something's up there so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
the chair legs something's up there so
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.840
the chair legs something's up there so
as a rule of thumb look for the rest of

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850
as a rule of thumb look for the rest of
 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.050
as a rule of thumb look for the rest of
someone else's body more than their face

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
someone else's body more than their face
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.979
someone else's body more than their face
if you're trying to figure out if

if you're trying to figure out if
 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.940
if you're trying to figure out if
they're telling you the truth or not
