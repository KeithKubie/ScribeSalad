00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.800
When there are grave disagreements about whats good or bad in architecture and art,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.380
there is often someone around who is keen to quickly close the discussion down,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.600
by saying 
"Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder"

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.600
its a phrase with the power to silence.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.700
Once its been uttered adding anything else

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.980
can seem a bit shrill or just plain rude.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.880
But in reality, the idea that beauty

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.800
could be entirely subjective

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.360
is troublesome, quite untrue

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.820
and plain dangerous.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.920
For a start,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.520
no one believes it.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.260
At the extremes of the argument,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.800
we know that some things simply are,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.500
just uglier than others.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.080
And we can tell by looking at tourist figures

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.420
that certain places do strike millions of people

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.680
as far prettier than others.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.060
If the will of the majority can be respected in politics

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.680
then it should also be respected in aesthetics.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.540
Even in more ambiguous situations,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900
progress towards some sort of resolution

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.180
can be made.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.080
By using careful logic and patient argument

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120
After all, that's what we do with other big topics

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.200
like how to run the economy

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880
or evaluate a hospital

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.020
or identify which one of two restaurants might be the better.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.760
We may not be able to reach a conclusion that's scientifically proven

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.560
but non-scientific agreement can be acceptable too.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.420
We don't need evidence from laboratories to agree on

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060
the importance of family

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.760
or the intelligence of Shakespeare.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040
or the charm of the Alps.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.440
So why insist that beauty in art and architecture

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.500
should be an impossible subject

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660
to have any clear views about?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.120
The answer is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.780
actually rather sinister

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.580
The people who love our doubts about beauty

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.380
are one group in particular-

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.320
Property Developers.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.860
Its extremely convenient for them to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.900
operate in a society that has no confidence

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.800
in people's ability to make judgements

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.260
about whether things are beautiful or ugly.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.800
If there's no such thing as an objective measure of beauty,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.820
then you can pretty much do whatever you like to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.360
a city or a landscape

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.960
and that's a lot cheaper.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.160
We shouldn't let a few areas of doubt

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.280
over beauty, whether this or that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.020
chair is more or less handsome, for example.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.160
Hijack the wider argument

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.520
and lead to the reckless conclusion

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.820
that all beauty is always relative.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.500
We must learn to stick up publicly and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.880
sensibly for things

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.680
that a vast majority of us

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.320
can see is more

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800
beautiful.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.000
So that we don't get exploited

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.940
and end up being condemned

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.320
to living in the ugly environments

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680
that have become so painfully common.
