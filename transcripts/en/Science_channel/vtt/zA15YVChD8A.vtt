00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:08.801
SCIENCE TO ME IS
THE ABSOLUTE COOLEST THING EVER.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.968
NOT TO GET, LIKE,
HIPPY-DIPPY ABOUT IT,

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:12.367
BUT SCIENCE IS EVERYWHERE.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.567
SO ANYTHING THAT'S COOL
IS SCIENCE.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.067
LIKE PANTS -- THAT'S SCIENCE.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.734
IT'S WHAT WE'RE MADE OF.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:21.300
AND WITHOUT SCIENCE,
WE HAVE NOTHING.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000
IT'S MORE THAN JUST INFORMATION.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.634
IT'S MORE THAN JUST
WHAT YOU READ IN A TEXTBOOK.

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:27.234
SCIENCE ITSELF IS A PROCESS.

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.367
IT'S A MEANS BY WHICH WE
INTERROGATE THE NATURAL WORLD.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.200
SCIENCE HELPS US UNDERSTAND

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.968
THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN,
WHY, AND HOW OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.801
IT'S COMPLETELY IMPARTIAL.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.901
IT'S ALWAYS READY
TO BE PROVEN INCORRECT

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.801
IF NEW, BETTER INFORMATION
COMES IN.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.067
TO ME,
SCIENCE IS THE ULTIMATE COOL.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:47.133
IT'S CREATING SOMETHING
THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE,

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.067
AND I THINK THAT SOME
OF THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE --

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:50.501
EVEN WORK THAT I DID
30 YEARS AGO --

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:51.834
IF I HADN'T DONE IT
AT THAT TIME,

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:54.400
IT STILL WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THIS DAY.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.667
YOU REALLY GET DOWN
TO THE BONES OF IT,

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.200
SCIENCE IS ULTIMATELY
WHO WE ARE.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.234
EVERYTHING THAT'S COOL
IS SCIENCE, SO SCIENCE IS COOL.

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:03.801
THERE'S AN EQUATION IN THERE
SOMEWHERE, I'M SURE.
