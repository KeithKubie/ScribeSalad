00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.567
Let's try one with
a little bigger smile.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.867
[rushing sound]

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.467
[dial tone]

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.166
[gagging]

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.133
[dramatic sounds]

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.700
[gun clicks]

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.700
[horn honking]

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.667
Oh my god.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.033
Shh.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.967
You see all that,
it didn't happen.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.100
[electronic music playing]

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.333
Microsoft didn't
literally kill anyone.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.100
They were coming
hard after Netscape.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.934
And in a fashion element,
the gangsters say,

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:31.300
that was pretty gangsta.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.200
[inaudible] shady.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.400
It's sleazy.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Sleazy?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.367
Last time I checked, was
antitrust level illegal?

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:37.567
I was ready for a fight.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.500
We can't force the
DOJ to prosecute,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.734
but we can give them all
the ammunition they'll need.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.400
Back then, Hollywood
was interested

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.767
in internet streaming.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:46.900
Michael Fenne.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.767
Also known as
David Kim Stanley.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:49.667
What a pleasure.

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.800
Pleasure is all mine.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.367
He started showing off
the same technology to

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.066
a whole new crop of investors.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.600
Wow.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.867
MICHAEL FENNE (ON LOUDSPEAKER):
Who's ready to become rich

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.767
beyond their wildest dreams?

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.533
[cheering]

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.934
He sparked off
internet IPO mania.

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.967
Do we even want
his $5 million?

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.200
Do we want $5 million?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.633
We believe $40 million
valuation is fair.

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.700
[yodeling]

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.767
We're going to drink,
and we're going to dance.

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.834
And you're going to have
the time of your life.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.133
All right.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.633
Some of the
parties were insane.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.266
[cheering]

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.667
People were maybe
overindulging.

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.166
[inaudible] was throwing
$100,000 parties before

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.467
they'd even earned a cent.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:36.734
The biggest red flag
is throwing a party.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:37.900
Big, gold letters--

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.233
iBash.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.533
iBash was this massive
concert in Las Vegas.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.166
To iBash.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.533
iBash!

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.934
The biggest star-studded
musical event ever.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.133
and in your home, pitch perfect.

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.900
Write that down, pitch perfect.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.233
It was not possible to use the
Pixelon technology to pull off

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:57.166
something like iBash.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.667
Nobody can compete
against Microsoft.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.734
This crazy battle that's now
being called a browser war.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.834
Creating this browser was the
only thing that mattered to me.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:09.967
You're welcome.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.800
Your job is keep
running as fast

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.967
as you can toward that cliff.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.400
My job is to keep
moving the cliff.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.600
MICHAEL FENNE: He's a reporter
doing a story on iBash,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.533
and you're going to
have a front row seat.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:21.800
Everyone with an
internet connection

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.200
is going to have a
front row seat, right?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.533
[dramatic music playing]

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.467
You're the guy who's
making all this fuss?

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.200
You guys ready for your
lives to change forever?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.133
- 5--
- Doesn't mean it didn't work.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:33.834
I'd like to report the
setting of a fugitive.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.100
4--

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.767
There's a judgment coming.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:37.600
3--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.967
It's over.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:40.633
It's far from over.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:41.333
2--

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.433
[dramatic music playing]

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:44.667
1.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.433
MICHAEL FENNE: We all
going burn in hell for what

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.200
you're trying to do to me.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.300
[dramatic music playing]

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.734
