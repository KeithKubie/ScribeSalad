principle knowledge principle yeah so
 

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.150
principle knowledge principle yeah so
it's the idea that the amount of

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160
it's the idea that the amount of
 

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.030
it's the idea that the amount of
knowledge about the domain of work that

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040
knowledge about the domain of work that
 

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.699
knowledge about the domain of work that
matters it's not the reasoning yeah so

00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:38.709
matters it's not the reasoning yeah so
 

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:41.860

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.620
were going on in the 50s so at let's say
the working paper series that Newell and

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:04.630
the working paper series that Newell and
 

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.730

that one so we didn't really give him

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200
that one so we didn't really give him
 

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.470
that one so we didn't really give him
the best we gave him a little short list

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480
the best we gave him a little short list
 

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.730
the best we gave him a little short list
of the best ones and that's the way we

for me that was a big breakthrough
 

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.940
for me that was a big breakthrough
because a break sr we break with the

because a break sr we break with the
 

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:33.140
because a break sr we break with the
past because remember the setting i had

seeing if we can publish papers about it

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880
seeing if we can publish papers about it
 

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.309

into myself I realized that the reason I

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920
into myself I realized that the reason I
 

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.709
into myself I realized that the reason I
had gotten into this field wasn't that

00:46:57.709 --> 00:46:57.719
had gotten into this field wasn't that
 

00:46:57.719 --> 00:47:00.859
had gotten into this field wasn't that
at all I mean for her it was only that

00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:00.869

he loved that that was he he was a
 

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.769
he loved that that was he he was a
psychologist and indeed he won the

00:47:06.769 --> 00:47:06.779

was really interested in doing what a

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:17.390
was really interested in doing what a
 

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:21.229
was really interested in doing what a
statistician named IJ good that Gordon

00:47:21.229 --> 00:47:21.239
statistician named IJ good that Gordon
 

00:47:21.239 --> 00:47:24.380
statistician named IJ good that Gordon
will remember IJ good in the 50s talked

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:24.390
will remember IJ good in the 50s talked
 

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.709
will remember IJ good in the 50s talked
about the ultra intelligent computer

00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:27.719
about the ultra intelligent computer
 

00:47:27.719 --> 00:47:30.199
about the ultra intelligent computer
that was his terminology and really I

00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:30.209
that was his terminology and really I
 

00:47:30.209 --> 00:47:32.209
that was his terminology and really I
was out after the ultra intelligent

00:47:32.209 --> 00:47:32.219
was out after the ultra intelligent
 

00:47:32.219 --> 00:47:34.939
was out after the ultra intelligent
computer and eventually that became

00:47:34.939 --> 00:47:34.949
computer and eventually that became
 

00:47:34.949 --> 00:47:36.620
computer and eventually that became
expert systems but it was no accident

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:36.630
expert systems but it was no accident
 

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.859
expert systems but it was no accident
that that that I was pushing things in

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:39.869
that that that I was pushing things in
 

00:47:39.869 --> 00:47:42.079
that that that I was pushing things in
the direction of expertise that's what I

00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:42.089
the direction of expertise that's what I
 

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:44.509
the direction of expertise that's what I
was looking for the world's best at

00:47:44.509 --> 00:47:44.519
was looking for the world's best at
 

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:47.390
was looking for the world's best at
something and you know it really

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400
something and you know it really
 

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.209
something and you know it really
actually so this was the launchpad so

00:47:50.209 --> 00:47:50.219
actually so this was the launchpad so
 

00:47:50.219 --> 00:47:52.729
actually so this was the launchpad so
now what I'd like to do is to take a

00:47:52.729 --> 00:47:52.739
now what I'd like to do is to take a
 

00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:56.239
now what I'd like to do is to take a
gallery through the rest of the

00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:56.249
gallery through the rest of the
 

00:47:56.249 --> 00:48:00.079

00:48:00.089 --> 00:48:01.519
seventies the 80s and the 90s during
that period you found that the

00:48:01.519 --> 00:48:01.529
that period you found that the
 

00:48:01.529 --> 00:48:04.759
that period you found that the

you told me that you took a very

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180
you told me that you took a very
 

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.949
you told me that you took a very
important lesson from this period oh I

00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:30.959
important lesson from this period oh I
 

00:48:30.959 --> 00:48:33.799
important lesson from this period oh I
that must be what I probably told Arnold

00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:33.809
that must be what I probably told Arnold
 

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:37.160
that must be what I probably told Arnold
was this is I guess Nancy Reagan

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:37.170
was this is I guess Nancy Reagan
 

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.160

summarized it in just say no but you

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:40.170
summarized it in just say no but you
 

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.920
summarized it in just say no but you
have that yet to learn how to say no and

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:42.930
have that yet to learn how to say no and
 

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:45.140
have that yet to learn how to say no and
if you don't know how to say no you get

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.150
if you don't know how to say no you get
 

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.479
if you don't know how to say no you get
but you all those things but you flunked

00:48:47.479 --> 00:48:47.489
but you all those things but you flunked
 

00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:50.689
but you all those things but you flunked
but I think of all of those things that

00:48:50.689 --> 00:48:50.699
but I think of all of those things that
 

00:48:50.699 --> 00:48:52.459
but I think of all of those things that
he just mentioned the the two that were

00:48:52.459 --> 00:48:52.469
he just mentioned the the two that were

the computer science department I think

00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:57.800
the computer science department I think
 

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.080
the computer science department I think
if I had to do it all over again I

00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.090
if I had to do it all over again I
 

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.460
if I had to do it all over again I
wouldn't have done those two things all

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:00.470
wouldn't have done those two things all
 

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.100
wouldn't have done those two things all
oh don canoes he's really at me for this

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.110
oh don canoes he's really at me for this
 

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.780
oh don canoes he's really at me for this
computer science thing because he says

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:04.790
computer science thing because he says
 

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.210
computer science thing because he says

shouldn't say that but the the business

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:12.560
shouldn't say that but the the business
 

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.130
shouldn't say that but the the business
about the books was a quite deliberate

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:15.140
about the books was a quite deliberate
 

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.310
about the books was a quite deliberate
strategy that was not accidental at all

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:18.320
strategy that was not accidental at all
 

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.470
strategy that was not accidental at all
that wasn't just saying oh I guess it's

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480
that wasn't just saying oh I guess it's
 

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.780
that wasn't just saying oh I guess it's
time for me to write books that was a

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:22.790
time for me to write books that was a
 

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.900
time for me to write books that was a
deliberate strategy that came from the

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:25.910
deliberate strategy that came from the
 

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:29.200
deliberate strategy that came from the
successes of not only Dendra but several

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.210

other expert systems projects that were
working so well that it was almost

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:33.740
working so well that it was almost
 

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.760
working so well that it was almost
unbelievable like Ted shortleaf and

answer was in the software area 0 as if

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:16.290
answer was in the software area 0 as if
 

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:18.560
answer was in the software area 0 as if
it didn't exist as if as if the problem

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:18.570
it didn't exist as if as if the problem
 

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.120
it didn't exist as if as if the problem
didn't exist they were going to solve

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.130
didn't exist they were going to solve
 

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:23.360
didn't exist they were going to solve
the chemical laser problem first and so

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:23.370
the chemical laser problem first and so
 

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:26.030
the chemical laser problem first and so
the chemical laser problem eventually

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040
the chemical laser problem eventually
 

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.710
the chemical laser problem eventually
got solved with the software problem

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720
got solved with the software problem
 

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.530

one a little more but I let me just

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660
one a little more but I let me just
 

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:55.069
one a little more but I let me just
mention that see I told Arnold they were

01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079
mention that see I told Arnold they were
 

01:03:55.079 --> 01:03:58.849
mention that see I told Arnold they were
three yeah creativity was one of them

01:03:58.849 --> 01:03:58.859
three yeah creativity was one of them
 

01:03:58.859 --> 01:04:01.640
three yeah creativity was one of them
i'm also the combinatorial creativity a

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:01.650
i'm also the combinatorial creativity a
 

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:04.190
i'm also the combinatorial creativity a
pattern recognition and knowledge

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200
pattern recognition and knowledge
 

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.640
pattern recognition and knowledge
acquisition yeah ok the let me talk

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:07.650
acquisition yeah ok the let me talk
 

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:09.920
acquisition yeah ok the let me talk
about the knowledge acquisition one very

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:09.930
about the knowledge acquisition one very
 

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:15.380
about the knowledge acquisition one very
briefly if the diagram I described to

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:19.550
briefly if the diagram I described to
you earlier is correct that the big box

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:19.560
you earlier is correct that the big box
 

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.460
you earlier is correct that the big box
is the knowledge box you just have to

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:22.470
is the knowledge box you just have to
 

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:25.849
is the knowledge box you just have to
fill up the knowledge box if if you want

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859
fill up the knowledge box if if you want
 

01:04:25.859 --> 01:04:29.750
fill up the knowledge box if if you want
a program to know about everything you

at the left hand side and do a match and
 

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:24.740
at the left hand side and do a match and
the right hand side tells us what we're

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:24.750
the right hand side tells us what we're
 

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.770
the right hand side tells us what we're
looking at and or what to do and that it

to think about it and he really didn't
 

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.870

quite see that guy being open well it

01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880
quite see that guy being open well it
 

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.550
quite see that guy being open well it
isn't that the guy who was there 15

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:10.560
isn't that the guy who was there 15
 

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.849
