well there were many challenges but I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
well there were many challenges but I
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.450
well there were many challenges but I
would say the most the biggest challenge

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
would say the most the biggest challenge
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.759
would say the most the biggest challenge
was how to make this game

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769
was how to make this game
 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.179
was how to make this game
easy and fun to play I mean at the

beginning we had bunch of computer

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930
beginning we had bunch of computer
 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.510
beginning we had bunch of computer
algorithms and theories that we could

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520
algorithms and theories that we could
 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.240
algorithms and theories that we could
use but not but none of those were all

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250
use but not but none of those were all

in that by novices and our job was to
 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.069
in that by novices and our job was to
pick a subset of a subset of theories

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079
pick a subset of a subset of theories
 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.709

level levels of tutorials that people

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370
level levels of tutorials that people
 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.310

understanding the game how the game

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090
understanding the game how the game
 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.540
understanding the game how the game
works how the game works and eventually

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550
works how the game works and eventually
 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.210
works how the game works and eventually
how the RNA folding works in theories

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220
how the RNA folding works in theories
 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.210
how the RNA folding works in theories
and from our bed and from our beta beta

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220
and from our bed and from our beta beta
 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.930
and from our bed and from our beta beta
testing from our formal experience

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940
testing from our formal experience
 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.670
testing from our formal experience
experiences from beta testing I think we

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680
experiences from beta testing I think we
 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.130
experiences from beta testing I think we
did a pretty good job on that the only

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140
did a pretty good job on that the only
 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.920
did a pretty good job on that the only
one almost no one no one in Arkham you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930
one almost no one no one in Arkham you
 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.450

know beta testing community had

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460
know beta testing community had
 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.420
know beta testing community had
experience in studying all day but they

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430
experience in studying all day but they
 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.280
experience in studying all day but they
are doing really well and actually most

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
are doing really well and actually most
 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.959
are doing really well and actually most
of them are actually solving problems

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969
of them are actually solving problems
 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.669
of them are actually solving problems
faster than we are actually posting

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679
faster than we are actually posting
 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.980
faster than we are actually posting
problems and even actually solving the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990
problems and even actually solving the
 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.199
problems and even actually solving the
forms that one of the one of the best

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209
forms that one of the one of the best
 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.949

computer algorithms could not solve

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959
computer algorithms could not solve
 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.559

there are many aspects to making the

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569
there are many aspects to making the
 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.359
there are many aspects to making the
game fun the first of aspect was

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369
game fun the first of aspect was
 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.319
game fun the first of aspect was

underwater and this cute little paw

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
 
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 
these cute little faces that's wiggling

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460
these cute little faces that's wiggling
 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.300
these cute little faces that's wiggling
around and many special effects as you

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310
around and many special effects as you
 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.400
around and many special effects as you
play through the game and moreover we

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410
play through the game and moreover we
 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.590
play through the game and moreover we
made we made constant really added in a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600
made we made constant really added in a

concept of competitions so you get to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
concept of competitions so you get to
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.450
concept of competitions so you get to
you get to play compete with each other

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460
you get to play compete with each other
 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.550
you get to play compete with each other
you aren't points by clearing possible

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560
you aren't points by clearing possible
 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.680
you aren't points by clearing possible
and you want to earn more points by then

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690
and you want to earn more points by then
 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.480
and you want to earn more points by then
clearing more purpose than other people

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
clearing more purpose than other people
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.950
clearing more purpose than other people
you want to do better than other people

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960
you want to do better than other people
 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.440
you want to do better than other people
and that's actually a core aspect to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450
and that's actually a core aspect to
 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.620
and that's actually a core aspect to
making the making the game fun yes I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
making the making the game fun yes I
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.020
making the making the game fun yes I
find myself in the gaming in fact yes

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
find myself in the gaming in fact yes
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.390
find myself in the gaming in fact yes
when I want me when I need a break from

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
when I want me when I need a break from
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
when I want me when I need a break from
the break from developing the game I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
the break from developing the game I
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.220
the break from developing the game I
just start playing the game although

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
just start playing the game although
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.470
just start playing the game although
unfortunately I find a lot of lot of our

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
unfortunately I find a lot of lot of our
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.430
unfortunately I find a lot of lot of our
players to better than me so
