The Joe Rogan experience,
Jimmy.
Oh,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.350
I would take away your right to vote.
I'd be like,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.200
there's no way I got different computers.
Like what's wrong with you?

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.230
That's why I got different little creek.
That's why I got different computers,

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.740
you know,
to see my other ones,
Dan,

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.270
I don't want anybody know I have different emails.
This is Mr happy.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.560
Mr. Happy likes to get on this one.
He only looks for happy thing.
Flowers,

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
different personality for different computers.
Lawn mower was Mr dirty.

9
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.190
This is what I really like.
I liked the best organic fertilizer.

10
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:30.390
It doesn't hurt the environment.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.950
You do your computer live in La.
Where would you live?
And if we,

12
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:43.120
we all moved together,
where should we go to questions?
Either.
Well,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.771
it's gotta be somewhere.

14
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:46.860
There's no state income tax because you're tired of this shit.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.070
Tired of this bullshit.
What if you start making more money?
You don't do it.

16
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.720
Fuck anymore.
Yeah,
but still,
it's kind of like,

17
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.960
why am I paying any more money to the fucking plenty of homeless people around.

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.180
Okay.
All right,
fine.
Someone's going to fix the streets too.
Are they?

19
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.070
What are they going to start?
It looks good.

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.500
That's why a lot of athletes operate out of Florida.

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.720
I drove here today and it didn't bother me at all.
Yeah.

22
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.250
You live so close to here.

23
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.010
I live on the roof live in Florida because of low income tenants.

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.650
Operate your business out of this is why.
Oh,
Jay's.
They're like,

25
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.460
they can't get you if you owe money to Florida.
Kit Kat.
You,
yeah,

26
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:23.040
you can hide in Florida if you owe money.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.250
It's one of them weird ones.
So I've Trump nationals down there.
Well,

28
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.650
I think that's like pensions and shit.
Like they can't take away your pensions.

29
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.281
Right?

30
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:31.920
They probably have some weird like union restriction law that they can't touch

31
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.680
your stuff.
I think.
I don't really,
I don't know if I could live in Florida,

32
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.920
but yeah,
you could.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You would just mock it.

33
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.340
Me and oatmeal and John Travolta and he lives in a collar.

34
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:42.210
We're right next door to him.

35
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.950
He always offer massages and shit and you'd be like,
Nah,
I'm good.

36
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.570
I'm gonna jump on it together.
Let's you and me just fly.
Fuck.
Dunno man.

37
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:54.240
John Travolta wants to be my friend.
Do you think he just wants to be my friend?

38
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.780
He just said,
buddy,
he's a good guy.
He's got a exclaim.
Oh No,

39
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:58.980
we have to land in the water.

40
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.650
We'll have to hold each other for warmth for awhile.
Oh,
how long?

41
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.970
For like four days maybe inside you and keep you warmer from the inside by Dixon

42
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:09.420
your ass.
They might come respites astrons very hot.
I know it sounds crazy,

43
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:12.870
but it's a different shape of life and death.
Got to put it inside.

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.510
If you put your mouth on my penis,
it,

45
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.740
you'll see it's like over a hundred degrees comes up,

46
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.240
blow me up and then ride me as we float away.
Blow me up like a balloon.
