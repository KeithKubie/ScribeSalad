00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.010
The purest form of gold is, of course, golden
and is referred to as 24 karat gold.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.510
Pure gold is much too soft for use in jewelry
and can even be dented by simply pressing

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.450
your fingernail hard against it.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.759
Needless to say, daily wear, particularly
for things like rings and bracelets, would

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.689
see such jewelry bent and deformed quite quickly.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.080
So the gold must be made more durable by mixing
it with another kind of metal or metals, creating

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.509
a gold alloy.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.609
As far as terminology goes, the 24 karats
that make up pure gold translate to all twenty-four

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.050
parts being gold.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.480
So an 18 karat gold ring is constructed of
18 parts pure gold and 6 parts something else,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.300
adding up to a total of 24 (75% gold, 25%
other).

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.789
The same formula can be applied to any karat
of gold jewelry, such as a 14 karat gold pendant-

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.879
made up of 14 parts gold and 10 parts other
metals.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.820
So what are these other metals?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.310
If the desired result for a particular piece
of jewelry is still a golden color, common

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.450
metals mixed with gold include copper and
zinc.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
With white gold, the jeweler typically uses
metals like silver, palladium, manganese,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.049
and nickel, with nickel for a time being the
main bleaching agent due to its cheapness.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.130
However, nickel has fallen out of favor in
some jewelry circles because it more commonly

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.750
causes allergic reactions.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.370
All that said, while the resulting piece in
these cases will be bleached to more of a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.740
silvery color, it doesn’t typically produce
the vibrant silver hue commonly associated

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.060
with white gold today.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.920
(Although, there are methods to achieve this
that have been very recently developed.)

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.920
But for the vast majority of white gold out
there, the vibrant silver color is created

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.500
by coating the white gold alloy with a thin
layer of rhodium, a metal in the platinum

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.500
family.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.140
The choice of rhodium comes from its bright
white color along with its extreme durability.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.479
Eventually, though, it will wear down, at
which point it will reveal the yellow tint

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.060
of the white gold beneath.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.630
Depending on the exact makeup of the white
gold, this may be barely noticeable to extremely

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.630
apparent.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.859
With unscrupulous jewelers, they may even
simply use regular yellow gold alloys plated

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.200
with rhodium in their “white gold” as
a way to save a little money in production.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.910
The buyers would have no idea until the rhodium
wore off, which takes a while.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.300
Whatever the case, if you notice a yellow
tint after a while, simply having the white

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.450
gold cleaned then having a jeweler apply a
new coating of rhodium returns the metal to

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.220
its previous silvery shine, and usually is
relatively inexpensive to have done.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.720
While yellow gold and white gold tend to be
the most common in jewelry, other colors can

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.440
be made by adding different metals to the
gold.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.660
For instance, pink and rose gold is made by
adding a higher ratio of copper, with the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.720
amount of copper added determining the hue.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.530
Green gold can be created by adding silver,
copper, and zinc alloys.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:03:00.040
Even a black color can be achieved by coating
white gold with a black rhodium.
