00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.310
The values of the
definite integral

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.260
from 0 to 1 of x to the fourth
times 1 minus x to the fourth,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.890
all of that over 1 plus
x squared dx is or are--

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.930
and they say are because
more than one of these

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.096
might be the correct answer.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.221
This is one of those multiple
correct answer problems.

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.220
So this is just a straight-up
definite integral.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.310
And it looks like
the best way to do

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.210
it is really just expand
out the numerator,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300
see if we can simplify
that with the denominator,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.750
and then just try to
take the antiderivative.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.470
So let's do that.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.390
So first, let's expand
1 minus x to the fourth.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.750
And when you're taking a
binomial to the fourth power,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.624
to remember the
coefficients, you, of course,

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.692
can use the traditional
binomial coefficients.

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:39.775
But I find it easier just
to use Pascal's triangle

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:41.920
to remember what the
coefficients are.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.350
So if you have a binomial,
if you square it,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.710
the coefficients are 1, 1
plus 1 is 2, and then 1.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.247
And I've done several videos
where I explain why this works.

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:53.830
And if you take it
to the third power,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.560
the coefficients
are 1, 3, 3, and 1.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.550
I'm just adding the two
branches that point to that one

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.060
node there.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.410
I guess you could
view it that way.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.243
And then if you take
it to the fourth power,

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:13.380
the coefficients are
1, 4, 6, 4, and 1.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.230
So if we want to take 1 minus
x to the fourth power-- and I'm

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.396
going to write it like this.

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:19.787
I'm going to write it
as negative x plus 1

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:20.620
to the fourth power.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.203
And I want to do it
that way because I

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:24.560
want the high-degree x
terms to be listed first.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.127
Then this is going
to be-- so you're

00:01:28.127 --> 00:01:30.460
going to start with this term
at the highest power, then

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.790
this term at the 0 power.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.610
And then each successive
term, this term

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.450
is going to lower in
power, and this one's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.450
going to go up in power.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.000
So it's going to be negative x
to the 1/4 times 1 to the 0--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.510
I'll just write it
here-- times 1 to the 0

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.340
plus-- the coefficient of
that first one was just

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.270
that 1, so plus 4 times
negative x to the third times 1

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.130
to the 1 power, plus-- now
we have our 6-- plus 6 times

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.550
negative x squared
times 1 squared.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.380
Or another way to think about
is the exponents on the 1

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
and the negative x should
always add up to 4.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.200
And then you have plus-- now
we're at this 4-- plus 4 times

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.540
negative x times 1 to
the third, and then

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.990
plus 1 to the fourth power,
or negative x to the 0 times 1

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.010
to the fourth, which is really
just 1 to the fourth power.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.360
So this is going to
simplify to-- so negative x

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.380
to the fourth.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.010
Negative x to the fourth is the
same thing as x to the fourth.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.290
Negative 1 to the
fourth is just 1 times

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.530
1 plus-- well, actually,
I should say minus,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
because negative x to the third
is negative x to the third,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.500
so this is minus
4x to the third.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.829
So we've done that term.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.120
This term will become positive.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.203
Negative x squared is the
same thing as x squared.

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.340
So it's plus 6x squared.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.600
And then this is
negative 4x plus 1.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.850
Now, we want to multiply
this whole thing that we just

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.040
expanded times x to the fourth.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.550
So let's multiply that whole
thing times x to the fourth.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.840
So the expression x
to the fourth times 1

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.870
minus x, all of that
to the fourth power

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.370
is going to be equal
to-- we'll just

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.620
multiply this times
x to the fourth.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.870
That's pretty straightforward.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.840
It's going to be x to
the eighth minus 4x

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.390
to the seventh plus 6x
to the sixth minus 4x

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.580
to the fifth plus
x to the fourth.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.230
Now we want to divide
this bottom expression

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.460
into the top expression.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.690
So we can just use some
algebraic long division.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.160
So we want to divide-- and I'll
write it as x squared plus 1.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.980
We want to divide x squared
plus 1 into this big thing,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.180
into this thing right here.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.322
So let me copy and paste that.

00:03:55.322 --> 00:03:57.030
We want to divide it
into this, and we're

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.680
going to break out some
algebraic long division

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.930
to do it.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.560
Let me draw the division
symbol right over there.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.460
And so we just say we'd look
at the highest-degree terms

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.300
on every step. x squared
goes into x to the eighth x

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.570
to the sixth times.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.640
So we put in the x
to the sixth place.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.079
x to the sixth times x
squared is x to the eighth.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.000
x to the sixth times
1 is x to the sixth.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.740
And then we subtract this
from the number up here,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.979
the expression up here.

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.020
x to the eighth minus x
to the eighth is nothing.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.120
Negative 4x to the
seventh minus nothing

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.200
is negative 4x to the seventh.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.002
6x to the 6 minus x to the
sixth is plus 5x to the sixth.

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.210
And then these, you're
subtracting nothing from them,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.070
so it's minus 4x to the
5th plus x to the fourth.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.350
Now, x squared goes
into x to the seventh,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.810
or it goes into negative 4x
to the seventh, negative 4x

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.725
to the fifth times.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.470
Let's scroll down a little bit.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.920
Negative 4x to the
fifth times x squared

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.750
is negative 4x to the seventh.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.560
Negative 4x to the fifth times
1 is negative 4x to the fifth.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.900
Now we subtract this from that.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.810
These cancel out.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.800
These cancel out.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:28.330
And we are left with 5x to the
sixth plus x to the fourth.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.060
x squared goes into 5x to the
sixth 5x to the fourth times,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.380
so plus 5x to the fourth.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.830
I just arbitrarily
switched colors

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.050
since yellow was
becoming monotonous.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.711
5x to the fourth times
x squared-- scroll down

00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:42.210
some more.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.010
5x to the fourth times x
squared is 5x to the sixth.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.410
5x to the fourth times
1 is 5x to the fourth.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.670
And now we subtract.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.420
We just subtract.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.740
Those cancel out. x to the
fourth minus 5x to the fourth

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.220
is negative 4x to the fourth.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.580
Nothing to bring down.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.390
x squared goes into
negative x to the fourth.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.725
It goes into it negative
4x squared times.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.870
Negative 4x squared
times x squared

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.140
is negative 4x to the fourth.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.050
Negative 4x squared times
1 is negative 4x squared.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.100
And now we subtract
that from that.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.660
You subtract this from 0, where
0 minus negative 4x squared

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.450
is going to be
positive 4x squared.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.326
All of these steps,
we're always subtracting.

00:06:41.326 --> 00:06:43.325
Maybe I should draw the
subtraction symbol right

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:44.020
over there.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.797
And then x squared
goes into 4x squared.

00:06:45.797 --> 00:06:46.880
We're in the home stretch.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.200
It goes into it 4
times, so plus 4.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.880
4 times x squared is 4x squared.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.450
4 times 1 is 4.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.130
And then we subtract
one last time.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.650
We subtract this whole thing.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:02.770
These cancel out.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.290
And then we're just left with
a remainder of negative 4.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.110
So this whole thing, this
whole expression over here,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.440
simplifies to this plus negative
4 over x squared plus 1.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.810
Let me rewrite it.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.780
Let me copy and paste it.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.730
So it turns into this.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.720
So copy and then let
me paste it down here.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.630
I wasted a lot of real estate.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.460
Paste.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:35.440
So it turns into this, this,
and then we have the minus 4

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.000
over the x squared plus 1.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.844
So minus 4 over x squared
minus 4 over x squared plus 1.

00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:47.510
So this is the entire
expression that we

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.300
have inside of the integral.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.170
So this is the same
thing as the integral

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:59.729
of this from 0 to 1 times dx.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.020
So now we just have to take
the antiderivative of this.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.740
And this looks pretty
straightforward.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.720
The only complicated
part is this right here.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.910
But you might recognize that
the derivative with respect

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:17.290
to x of arctangent of x is equal
to 1 over x squared plus 1.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.050
So that kind of simplifies
this part for us.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.427
So let's tackle the problem.

00:08:21.427 --> 00:08:23.010
So let's just take
the antiderivative.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.270
This is pretty straightforward.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.820
Antiderivative, we
just have to make

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.403
sure we don't make
a careless mistake.

00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:30.280
Antiderivative of
x to the sixth is

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.435
going to be x to
the seventh over 7.

00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:35.870
Or maybe I should say
1/7 x to the seventh.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:41.080
Antiderivative of
this is negative 4/6,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.600
which is the same thing as
negative 2/3 x to the sixth.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.451
Antiderivative of that is x to
the 5th, plus x to the fifth,

00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:50.950
right?

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.410
I'm just raising the exponent.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.830
So that's where I get
the x to the fifth.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.288
And then I divide
by that exponent.

00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:57.190
So 5 divided by 5 is 1.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.880
And then I have x to the
third, or it's negative 4/3 x

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:12.650
to the third plus 4x, and
then minus 4 arctangent of x.

00:09:18.085 --> 00:09:19.710
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.950
So we're going to evaluate it
at 1 and then subtract from that

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.910
it, and evaluate at 0.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.610
So we need to evaluate this
at 1, and then from that,

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.600
subtract it at 0.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.050
So if you evaluate it at
1, you have 1/7 minus 2/3

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:42.460
plus 1 minus 4/3 plus 4.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.120
That's plus 4 right
over there, and then

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.545
minus 4 arctangent of 1.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.550
So let's think about what
the arctangent of 1 is.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.460
So the arctangent
of 1 is essentially

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.360
saying if I have
a right triangle,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.420
if I take the opposite over
the adjacent-- so the opposite

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.710
is telling us give us the angle.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.110
So we're looking for this angle.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.840
We're looking for the angle
where the tangent of this angle

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.050
is equal to 1.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.980
Or another way to say it is that
the opposite over the adjacent

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.410
is equal to 1.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.110
Or another way to say
it is the opposite

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.590
is equal to the adjacent.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.690
So this side has to
be equal to this side.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.070
This is going to be a
slope of 1 right over here.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.140
Now, we could try to look at
different types of triangles.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.170
And it might pop out at
you what kind this is,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.190
but you could just go to basic
geometry to think about this.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.817
This is a right
angle right here.

00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:47.900
These two sides are equal.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.024
These two angles are equal.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.780
So these two angles have to
evenly split the remaining 90

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.570
degrees in the triangle
because it adds up to 180.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.760
So this is a 45-degree angle.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.270
But in general, when
they don't tell you

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.660
whether you're in
radians or degrees,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.110
at least on most
exams I've seen,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.130
you should just assume
that you are in radians.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.530
So 45 degrees is the
same thing-- let's see.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.410
Pi is 180 degrees.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.630
Pi/2 is 90 degrees.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.630
Pi/4 is 45 degrees.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.280
So this is equal to-- that right
over there is pi/4 radians.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.290
So this over here
is pi/4 radians,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.080
or I could just say pi/4.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.200
Or another way to think
about it, tangent of pi/4

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.870
is equal to 1.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.660
So this is just the
inverse function.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.200
So these two cancel out.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.490
So I just evaluate it at 1.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.310
Before I move forward,
let me subtract

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.020
from that this whole
thing evaluated at 0.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.040
And this is a little bit
more straightforward.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.980
All of these things are going to
be 0 when you evaluate it at 0.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.060
And what's the arctangent of 0?

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.740
Well, tangent of 0 is 0.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.160
If this angle is 0, if
you just had a flat line,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.550
then your slope is flat.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.900
So this is just going to be 0.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.770
So this whole thing evaluated
at 0 is going to be 0.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.010
So the whole value of
our definite integral

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.090
is going to be this
thing over here.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.740
So it's going to be
all of this stuff,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.870
and then this last
term right over here

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.065
is negative 4 times pi/4, so
it's going to be negative pi.

00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:21.190
And all of these are going
to add up to some number

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.340
without a pi in it.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.010
So if you are under
time pressure,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.252
it's actually a good idea
to just look at the answers

00:12:26.252 --> 00:12:28.085
before we even add up
all of those fractions

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.382
and say, which of these
have a negative pi in them?

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:32.340
And only one of them has
a negative pi in them,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.897
so our answer is most
probably going to be this.

00:12:35.897 --> 00:12:38.230
If you're under time pressure,
I would just circle that.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.479
It's clearly not any of these.

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.347
None of these have a
negative pi in them.

00:12:41.347 --> 00:12:43.180
And there's no way that
that negative pi can

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.740
get altered by this
stuff over here.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.500
So you wouldn't have to
worry about adding it.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.833
But since we want to make
sure we have the right answer,

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:50.980
let's add up all
of these fractions.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.370
So let's think about
what we can do here.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.350
So let's see.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.320
Negative 2/3 minus 4/3, let
me take those two terms.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:09.090
Negative 2/3 minus 4/3 is
negative 6/3, or negative 2.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:16.240
So those become negative 2 plus
1 plus 4, and then plus 1/7.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.607
So this is 3 plus 1/7.

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:25.190
And of course, we
have the negative pi

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.880
out there, minus pi.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.550
And this is the
same thing as 21/7

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:36.230
plus 1/7 minus pi, which
is equal to 22/7 minus pi.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:41.730
So that is indeed the only
answer-- 22/7 minus pi.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.590
And we're done.
