00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.072
Voiceover: In this video,

00:00:01.072 --> 00:00:04.343
I want to give you a general
idea of what a bond is

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:06.681
and why a company might even issue them

00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:07.736
in the first place.

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:09.029
And just at a very high level,

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.207
a bond is essentially a way for someone

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:14.880
to participate in lending to a company,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.607
so you're a partial lender,

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:19.504
partial lender,

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:20.937
to a company,

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.336
and just to make that more concrete,

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:24.343
let's imagine some type of company

00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:26.940
that has $10 million in assets,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.854
so these are its assets right there,

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:31.288
assets,

00:00:31.827 --> 00:00:35.674
and it has $10 million in assets.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:37.681
Let's say just for the sake of simplicity,

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.031
it has no liabilities,

00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:43.155
so all of that value,
all of that $10 million

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:46.089
is what is owned by the owners,

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.078
or by the equity, this owner's equity,

00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:50.096
so this is $10 million,

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:53.281
$10 million in equity.

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.720
And if we had, let's
say, a million shares.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.391
I'll write it down.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.608
If we have a million shares,

00:00:59.608 --> 00:01:02.342
and if we believe this $10 million number,

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:07.547
that implies that each share
is worth $10 per share.

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.282
Now let's say this company
is doing really well

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:10.343
and it wants to expand.

00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:13.800
It wants to increase
its assets by $5 million

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.536
so it can go out and buy
a $5 million factory,

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:17.605
so it wants,

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:18.839
let me draw it right here.

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:23.203
It wants another $5 million in assets

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:24.607
that it needs to build that factory,

00:01:24.607 --> 00:01:27.270
or essentially a $5 million factory.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.340
The question is,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.343
how does it finance it?

00:01:30.343 --> 00:01:33.683
Well, one way is they could
just issue more equity.

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:36.125
If they're able to get a
price of $10 per share,

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:40.127
they could issue another 500,000 shares,

00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:47.543
500,000 shares at $10 per share,

00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:49.865
and then that would essentially,

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.395
it would produce $5 million.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.128
This is scenario one.

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:57.041
They issue 500,000 shares at $10 a share.

00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:00.861
They now have 1.5 million shares,

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:03.664
but these new owners
gave them, collectively,

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.477
$5 million dollars,

00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:09.492
so this, the equity
would grow by $5 million.

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:12.263
We now have 1.5 million shares,

00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:15.600
so this would now be 1.5 million shares,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.791
not one million,

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.917
and that new money from
these new shareholders

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:21.789
would go into the asset side,

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:22.679
and then we would use that

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.829
to actually buy the factory.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.263
What I just described is
essentially issuing equity,

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:30.822
or financing via equity.

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:35.495
Financing via equity,

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:37.529
or by issuing stock.

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.263
Now, the other way to do it

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:41.199
is to borrow the money,

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.102
to borrow the money,

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:44.740
so let me redraw this company.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.092
I'll leave this up here just
so we can compare the two.

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:52.573
Once again, we have $10 million of assets.

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:55.605
That's our $10 million of assets.

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:59.190
We have $10 million of
equity to start off with,

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:02.577
$10 million of equity,

00:03:03.424 --> 00:03:06.936
and instead of issuing
stock to get the $5 million,

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.330
we're going to borrow the money

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.198
so we could, we're
essentially issuing debt,

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:14.075
so we issue,

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:16.203
we essentially could go to a bank and say,

00:03:16.203 --> 00:03:18.345
"Hey, bank. Can I borrow $5 million?"

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.926
So we would have a $5 million liability,

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:22.757
it would be debt.

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:24.421
$5 million of debt,

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:27.196
and the bank would give
us $5 million of cash

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.400
that we can then go
use to buy our factory.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.130
So in either situation,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.733
in either situation,

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:36.272
the asset side of our
balance sheet looks identical

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:38.277
or the assets of the
company are identical.

00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:40.009
We had our $10 million of assets,

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.590
and now we have a factory,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.902
but in this first situation,

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:46.092
I was able to raise
that money by increasing

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.618
the number of shareholders

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:49.010
by increasing the number of people

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.662
that I have to split the
profits of this company with.

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:54.867
In this situation,

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.977
I was able to raise the
money by borrowing it.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.433
The people that I'm
borrowing this money from,

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.070
the people that I'm borrowing this money,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.142
this is borrowed money,

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.266
borrowed money.

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:10.344
They don't get a cut of the
profits of this company.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.512
What they do is they get paid interest

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:14.396
on their money that they're lending to us

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:17.129
before these guys get any profits at all.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.528
In fact, that interest
is considered an expense,

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:23.205
so these guys get interest,

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.689
get interest.

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:26.869
And even if this company
does super, super well,

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:28.676
and becomes very, very profitable,

00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:31.151
these guys only get their interest.

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.015
Likewise, if the company does really bad

00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:34.183
and these guys suffer,

00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:35.928
as long as the company
doesn't go bankrupt,

00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:38.428
these guys are still going
to get their interest,

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:41.356
so they're going to be a lot safer than,

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:43.793
well, they don't get as much of the reward

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:45.866
as the new equity holders would.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:48.019
They also don't get as much of the risk.

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.968
Now, this is just straight up debt,

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:52.013
and you could just get this from any bank

00:04:52.013 --> 00:04:53.197
if they were willing to.

00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:55.513
If they said, "You're
a good, safe company.

00:04:55.513 --> 00:04:57.610
"We're willing to lend you $5 million."

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.266
But let's say that no bank wants to

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.011
individually take on
that risk, so you say,

00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.825
"Hey, instead of borrowing
$5 million from one entity,

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:09.498
"Why don't I borrow it
from 5,000 entities?"

00:05:09.774 --> 00:05:11.428
What I can do instead,

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:13.792
instead of borrowing it from one entity,

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:16.764
I could issue these certificates.
I could issue bonds.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.990
That's the topic of this video.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.861
I issue these certificates.

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.528
They have a face value of $1,000.

00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:28.354
$1,000. This is my face value.

00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:29.230
Face value,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.181
or sometimes you'll hear
the notion of par value,

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:35.978
of par value,

00:05:35.978 --> 00:05:38.809
and I'll say what interest
I'm going to pay on it,

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:43.396
so let's say I say it
has a 10% annual coupon,

00:05:44.164 --> 00:05:46.529
annual coupon,

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:47.335
and it's actually called,

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:48.726
even though this is the interest,

00:05:48.726 --> 00:05:51.143
I'm essentially going to pay $100 a year.

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:52.900
It's called a coupon because when they,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.612
when bonds were first issued,

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:56.671
they would actually throw
these little coupons

00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.695
on the bond itself,

00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:00.627
and the owner of the
certificate could rip off

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.167
or cut off one of these coupons,

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:05.421
and then go to the person borrowing,

00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.995
or the entity borrowing the money,

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:08.811
and get their actual interest payment.

00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.556
That's why it's actually called "coupons",

00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:13.012
but they don't actually
attach those coupons anymore.

00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:14.238
And it has some maturity date,

00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:16.464
the date that not only will
I pay your interest back,

00:06:16.464 --> 00:06:18.402
but I'll pay the entire principle,

00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:19.624
the entire face value,

00:06:19.624 --> 00:06:22.565
so let's say the maturity,

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:25.633
maturity is in two years,

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:27.057
is in two years.

00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:28.220
In this situation,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.158
in order to raise $5 million,

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:34.014
i'm going to have to issue 5,000 of these

00:06:34.014 --> 00:06:38.173
because 5,000 times 1,000 is 5 million,

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:41.741
so times 5,000.

00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:45.554
If you wanted to lend
$1,000 to this company

00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:47.126
so that they could expand,

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:49.058
and if you think 10% is
a good interest rate,

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:50.422
and it's a safe company,

00:06:50.422 --> 00:06:53.099
you would essentially
buy one of these bonds.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.668
Maybe you buy it for $1,000,

00:06:55.668 --> 00:06:58.582
and when you buy that bond for $1,000,

00:06:58.582 --> 00:07:01.357
you are essentially lending this company

00:07:01.357 --> 00:07:04.750
that $1,000, and if you
did that 5,000 times,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.413
or if that happened 5,000 times

00:07:06.413 --> 00:07:07.893
amongst a bunch of different people,

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:09.458
this company would be able to raise

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.413
its $5 million.

00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:14.465
Now just to be clear how
the actual payments work.

00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:18.549
The coupons tend to
get paid semi-annually,

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:21.667
so let me draw a little timeline here,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.784
and this tends to be the case in the US

00:07:23.784 --> 00:07:24.753
and western Europe.

00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:27.324
If this is today.

00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:28.642
This is today.

00:07:28.642 --> 00:07:30.815
This is in 6 months.

00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:33.629
This is in 12 months, or 1 year.

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:35.658
This is in 18 months,

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.834
and this is in 24 months,

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:40.314
and I'm only going up to 24 months

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:43.828
because I said this bond
matures in 24 months.

00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:44.617
What is this,

00:07:44.617 --> 00:07:48.272
if you own, if you hold
this bond, this certificate,

00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:49.783
what do you get?

00:07:49.783 --> 00:07:52.329
Well, it's going to pay you 10% annually,

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:54.150
so $100 a year.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.581
$100 per year.

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:58.891
But they actually pay the
coupons semi-annually,

00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:00.127
so you get $100 a year,

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.636
but you get half of it every 6 months,

00:08:02.636 --> 00:08:05.422
so you're going to get $50 after 6 months.

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:08.067
You're going to get $50 after 12 months,

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:09.494
or after another 6 months.

00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:11.116
You're going to get another $50 here.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.683
You're going to get a final $50 there,

00:08:13.683 --> 00:08:15.693
and they're also going
to have to pay you back

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:17.338
the original amount of the loan.

00:08:17.338 --> 00:08:20.049
They're also going to have
to pay you the $1,000,

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:22.288
so that last payment's
going to be the coupon of 50

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:23.968
plus the $1,000,

00:08:23.968 --> 00:08:25.833
and so you will have
essentially been getting

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.221
this 10% annual interest.

00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:29.611
Now, when the company does this,

00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:31.948
they'll probably have to
issue some type of new bond

00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:32.647
because all of a sudden,

00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:34.116
they have to pay all of these people

00:08:34.116 --> 00:08:36.448
this huge lump sum of money

00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:37.778
if they haven't been able to earn it

00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:38.817
from the factories yet,

00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:41.161
and we could talk about
that in a future video.
