00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:43.680
AKINDELE AKINROPO: Hello.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.480
My name is Akindele O. Akinropo.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.830
I'm an urban planner studying
sustainable development

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.432
in Malaysia.

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:51.015
The study of this
course in this video

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:53.415
compares shopping at two malls.

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:56.220
The first one is
Jusco mall located

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.040
in the heart of
Bukit Indah in Johor,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.970
and the other is
Alamanda in Putrajaya,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.430
the administrative
headquarters of Malaysia.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.550
In this video, I want
to share with you

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.450
my research on the sustainable
dimensions of shopping malls.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.100
Sustainable development
means different things

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.750
to different people.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.040
However, it generally refers to
using environmental resources

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.340
in a way that allows other
generations to continue

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.750
to use and preserve it.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.940
Shopping in malls
can be sustainable

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.410
under certain conditions.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.160
For instance, the processes
of siting, building,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.080
and using malls need to
be properly organized

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.660
within the urban system
to promote city livability

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.890
and environmental performance.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.730
Mall sustainability
will be guaranteed

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.490
when site and operation
discourage carbon emissions,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
encourage socialization, and
promote continuous wealth

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.630
generation.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.290
This discussion naturally brings
some questions to one's mind.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.380
For instance, are malls
actually important to city

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.880
sustainability?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.470
If so, in what specific ways?

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.630
What kinds of malls are good
and what other factors make

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.910
shopping malls sustainable?

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.850
This video will explore the
following empirically observed

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.960
points.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.270
Sustainable malls
can and should be

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.970
a part of sustainable city
development in the developing

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.790
world.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.385
They can contribute to
sustainable development

00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:28.860
if designed, operated,
and located properly.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.900
Larger shopping malls are
better than smaller ones

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.855
because a larger scale allows
for diversified activities

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.590
and goods.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.960
Malls need to be linked
with public transportation.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440
In the next couple
of minutes we'll

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.790
go through each of these points.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.000
I want to highlight
why more development is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.220
important in the sustainable
development discussion.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.850
First, cities are noticeably
growing more vertically

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.850
than horizontally.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.330
High skylines have
become a symbol

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.910
of our contemporary
space-limited cities.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.860
City residents now live, work,
and play in tall buildings.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.270
Shopping in high
rise mall is today

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.395
connected to ideals
of urban life.

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.550
Consumer behavior theories
call this image-ability,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.480
which is connected
with the quality

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.650
in a physical object that
evokes a strong image

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.820
in the observers.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.970
Aside from the large size of
the mall, advanced technology,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.920
aesthetics, convenience,
organized parking,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.130
and cleanliness,
among other factors,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.400
improved image-ability in malls.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.010
We therefore attract,
shoppers, promote economic

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.760
sustainability, and increasingly
becoming a good platform

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.940
for local, intra-, and
inter-regional as well

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.710
as international trade.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.900
Malls are proven to be strategic
to central economic growth

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.630
in terms of GDP in many
countries like Dubai,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.510
like South Africa.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.510
In the United States,
business and education

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.060
alone account for more
than 40% of the GDP.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.440
In 2013, retail
and wholesale trade

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.250
have created
additional 12% increase

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.279
in the country's GDP growth.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.050
All of this growth is
mostly created in the 47,000

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.580
malls of the United States.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.720
Again, malls are quickly
over the functions

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240
of a public space.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.420
And we know that public space is
important for sustainable city

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.310
development.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.890
Malls are important
thought places.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.780
Thought places are the
next most important place

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.480
after where we live and work.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.170
Malls attract large
crowds and encourage

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.030
information dissemination,
social networking,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.070
social interaction, and
economic redistribution.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.590
This process describes
social capital formation,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.680
which is essential for
overall community development.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.880
This explains why
mall contributes

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.980
to social sustainability.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.940
Now, let us narrow our focus.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.980
One would ask, what kind of mall
design, location, and operation

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.440
promotes sustainability?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.120
Malls are necessary
large and they generate

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.450
carbon emissions and heat.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.150
It appears to be using mall
resources, such as electricity,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.410
water, and chlorofluorocarbons,
through extensive use of air

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.370
conditioning,
heating, and cooling.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.070
However, instead of
increasing carbon production,

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.280
it may be designed
to reduce it through

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.650
technical interventions.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.850
If a mall is designed and built
using ecological principles

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.290
of green buildings,
during operations,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.350
use environmental-friendly
and other sources,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.430
and have efficient waste
management systems.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.550
Sustainability is also
promoted when malls discourage

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.260
the proliferation of
informal activities

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.910
that often take
place on the roadside

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.700
and in sprawling market stalls.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.360
These spaces are
not easily managed

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.390
because of the diverse
stakeholders involved.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.300
Again, malls will
enhance sustainability

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.690
when its location is in a
heterogeneous environment where

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.760
there is greater land use
mix, where residents pay less

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.710
to reach it, and
where [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.680
such as fossil fuels are
required for transportation.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.910
For instance, in
Putrajaya, Malaysia,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.000
the mall studied perform less
well in times of patronage

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.330
compared to the other
one in Bukit Indah

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.450
because it is located in
a more regional setting

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.400
while the other locates in a
more heterogeneous setting.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.590
Many residents in Putrajaya are
civil servants with two homes

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.860
and are in and out of the city.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.700
Suburb locations of malls
like Jusco, Bukit Indah,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.260
isolate them from
public transportation

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.740
and therefore encourage
private car use.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.680
This leads to an increase in
energy use, which is converted

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.860
into environmental pollutants.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.640
While the use of alternative
environmentally friendly

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.070
energy, such as electricity,
is advocated for,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.530
using even a smaller
amount of energy

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.690
by organizing an
efficient retail center

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.660
is the whole essence
of sustainability.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.050
Operations in the mall
contribute to sustainability.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.750
Malls will thrive when
operations [? in ?] [? need ?]

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.950
are suitable for more
types of shoppers.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.100
Empirical observation shows
that most shoppers are women.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.720
They prefer malls where their
children can play safely

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.820
while they shop.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.350
In addition to [INAUDIBLE],
cinemas, bowling,

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.150
and among other activities
which attract young adults that

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.550
have less economic
power to malls,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.820
provisions of
children's activities

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.540
is observed to be strategic
to malls operation.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.570
Multiple shopping
opportunities combined

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.090
with multiple types of
activities encourage patronage.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.940
This pours economic
sustainability

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.230
and we increase the long-term
vitality of the mall.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.570
Malls can also save space
and promote compact city

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.390
sustainable development.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.460
The thought point is concerned
with the scale of malls.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.430
Research shows that the bigger
the mall the better it is.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.010
Not only does a large
mall provide opportunities

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.790
to assess diversified goods,
services, and activities,

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.900
it also reduces
shopper's cost in terms

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.179
of stress, time, and money.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.549
A single trip will satisfy
retail, recreation,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.799
and other needs.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.740
Numbers of trips are
reduced, therefore reducing

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.450
the amount of energy used.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.560
This contributes to
environmental sustainability.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.010
Large scale and
localization of malls

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.820
may also help a city to
better plan transportation

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.826
options for shopping trips.

00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:00.380
The largest shopping
malls will encourage

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.520
more efficient and
effective resource use.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.220
For instance, use of security
cameras and personnel

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.340
would be effective in
a single mall compared

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.395
to many smaller
and [? scattered ?]

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:14.660
retail buildings.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.350
Because of the large
scale and compactness,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.480
waste generated in the
mall can also be large.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.180
If the waste collection
methods are efficient,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.440
it may encourage
industrial recycling.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.110
All together, each
and every function

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.270
in a diversified large mall
could support one another

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.430
and allow for its
continued existence.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.370
Large malls are those iconic.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.510
They are like monuments
of historic significance,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.750
making cities immeasurable
and attracting tourists

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.350
and economic prosperity.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.260
At this point, it
is very important

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.130
to [INAUDIBLE] the importance
of public transportation system

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.230
to mall development against
a background of city

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.540
sustainability.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.930
The late arrival of the mall
after much of the central city

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.100
had already being
developed is probably

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.430
the reason for its location in
the suburbs in many developing

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.220
countries.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.400
This makes it
challenging to integrate

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.530
the mall into the city's
public transportation system.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.510
Malls will be more
sustainable if effectively

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.100
integrated into the public
transportation system.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.860
Connecting commercial areas
with intra- and or intercity

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.780
transportation of road,
rail, and where possible--

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:30.160
like Putrajaya-- waterways, can
improve customer convenience

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.510
and reduce pollution making
the city more sustainable.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.620
In Malaysia, Jusco Bukit Indah
has a better overall assessment

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.890
in terms of patronage,
diversified activities,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.210
and so on.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.650
But it is less integrated with
public transportation compared

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.920
to Alamanda mall in Putrajaya.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.220
Though the transportation
is better in Alamanda mall,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.780
other important features of
a sustainable shopping mall

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.430
are still in progress.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.990
In conclusion, for a mall to
be sustainable, especially

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.840
in Malaysia and other
developing countries,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.540
all the factors should
be considered together.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.650
Large malls in a well integrated
public transportation system

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.160
should offer multiple
shopping, recreation,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.770
and social activities that
are preferred by women--

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.630
who are the largest
shoppers-- and should

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.290
be located in an area
where land use are mixed.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.110
The beauty as well as
the general environment

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.130
should be designed using green
building and environmental

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.120
principles.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.700
These assure us of a
sustainable shopping

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.450
mall within the framework of
sustainable city development.
