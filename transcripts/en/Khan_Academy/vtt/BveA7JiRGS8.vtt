00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.966
Voiceover:Paul has the option
between a high-deductible

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:09.234
or a low-deductible health insurance plan.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:11.433
When we talk about the
deductible in health insurance,

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.700
if someone says that they have a plan

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.767
with $1,000 deductible,

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.500
that means that the insurance company

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.967
only pays the medical cost
after the first $1,000.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:21.766
So if you have a $1,000 deductible

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.900
and you, say, incur medical cost of $800,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.767
you're going to pay that $800.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.500
The insurance company won't pay anything.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.233
If you have a deductible of $1,000

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.367
and your total medical costs are $1,200,

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.300
you're going to pay the first $1,000,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.100
and then the insurance company
will kick in after that.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
So with that out of the way,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.566
let's think about his 2 plans.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.771
If Paul chooses the low-deductible plan,

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.646
he will have to pay the first $1,000

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.367
of any ...

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:47.434
let me do that in purple,

00:00:47.434 --> 00:00:50.766
the first $1,000 of any medical cost.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:54.433
The low-deductible plan
costs $8,000 for a year.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.766
So in this situation,
he's going to pay $8,000

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.433
to get the insurance.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.167
If he has $900 of medical expenses,

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.100
the insurance company still pays nothing.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.235
If he has $2,000 of medical expenses,

00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:08.300
then he pays the first $1,000,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.433
and then the insurance company would pay

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:10.566
the next $1,000.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.900
If he has $10,000 in medical expenses,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300
he would pay the first $1,000,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.433
and then the insurance company would pay

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.401
the next $9,000.

00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:20.433
If Paul chooses the high-deductible plan,

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:23.433
he will have to pay the first $2,500

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:24.966
of any medical cost.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.033
The high-deductible plan
costs $7,500 a year.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.233
It makes sense that the
high-deductible plan

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.108
costs less than the low-deductible plan

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:34.567
because here, the
insurance doesn't kick in

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:39.103
until he has over $2,500
of medical expenses,

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:40.900
while here, it was only $1,000.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.100
To help himself choose a plan,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.966
Paul found some statistics
about common health problems

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.834
for people similar to him.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:49.367
Assume that the table below,

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.766
and I put it up here on the right,

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.500
correctly shows the probabilities in cost

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.035
of total medical incidents
within the next year.

00:01:58.035 --> 00:01:59.437
So this right over here, it's saying

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:01.700
what's the probability he
has $0 in medical costs?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.768
What's the probability of ...

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.700
he has a 25% probability of $1,000,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.740
20% probability, $4,000.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.103
And this is a simplification,

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:12.966
a pretty dramatic simplification
from the real world.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.300
In the real world, the
way this makes it sound

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.900
is there's only 5 possible medical costs

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.167
that someone might have,

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:22.502
$0, $1,000, $4,000, $7,000, and $15,000.

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:26.033
In the real world, you could
have $20 of medical cost.

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.300
You could have $20,000.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.835
You could have $999.

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:32.300
So in the real world,
there is many, many more

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
situations here that you
would have to redistribute

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.901
the probabilities accordingly.

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.434
But with that said, this
isn't a bad approximation.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.207
It's just saying, OK, roughly,

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:43.002
if you wanted to construct this

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:44.433
so it's easier to do the math,

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.433
which the problem writers have done,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.515
say, look, OK, 30% $0, 25% $1,000.

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.633
This is pretty indicative

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:55.900
if you had to group all
of the possible costs

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.367
into some major bucket.

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.902
So it's probably at least
a pretty good method

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:03.700
for figuring out which insurance policy

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.392
someone should use.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:07.700
So they say, including
the cost of insurance,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.367
what are Paul's expected
total medical costs

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.447
with the low-deductible plan?

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:15.700
Round your answer to the nearest cent.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.238
Actually, I'll get the
calculator out for this.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:24.437
With the low-deductible plan here,

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.833
low-deductible plan,

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.100
he's going to have to
spend his total cost,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.570
he's going to spend $8,000 no matter what.

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.666
Whoops, what happened to my calculator?

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.568
He's going to spend $8,000 ...

00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.365
My God, I'm having issues.

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:42.366
He's going to spend $8,000 no matter what,

00:03:42.366 --> 00:03:46.433
so that is $8,000.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:47.566
Then let's see.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:51.233
There is a 30% probability
he spends nothing.

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:55.234
I could just write that
as plus 0.3 times $0,

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.633
and I will write it just so that you see

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.300
I'm taking that into account.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.766
There's a 25% chance that he
has $1,000 in medical costs.

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:04.234
In the low-deductible plan,

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:06.238
he still has to pay that $1,000,

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:14.433
so plus 0.25% chance that he pays $1,000,

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:16.101
$1,000.

00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:18.502
And then you might say,
OK, plus 0.2 times $4,000,

00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:23.633
but remember, if his
medical costs are $4,000,

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.301
he is not going to pay that $4,000.

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:27.301
He is only going to pay the first $1,000.

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:30.884
So it's really plus 0.2.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.708
In this situation, his
out-of-pocket costs are only $1,000.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:40.033
The insurance company
will pay the next $3,000.

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:42.766
So 0.2 times $1,000.

00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:50.433
And then plus 0.2, 20% chance,

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:52.247
even if he has $7,000 in medical costs,

00:04:52.247 --> 00:04:55.300
he's only going to have
to pay the first $1,000,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.433
so 0.2 times $1,000 again.

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:04.366
And then plus 0.05 times,
once again, $1,000.

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:05.700
If he has $15,000 in expenses,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.100
he is only going to have
to pay the first $1,000,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.833
times $1,000.

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:15.600
And we get $8,700.

00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:16.966
One way you could have thought about it

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:21.633
is OK, he is going to have
to pay $8,000 no matter what,

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:25.633
and all of the situations
where he ends up paying,

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.701
that's anything,

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.966
that's these 4 situations right over here,

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:32.243
there is a 70% probability of falling into

00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:33.833
one of these 4 situations.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.233
At any one of these, he
only has to pay $1,000.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.444
The insurance company pays
everything after that.

00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:43.976
So you could say $8,000
plus there is a 70% chance

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.546
that he is going to pay $1,000.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.768
And once again, this table is
a pretty big simplification

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.368
from the real world.

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:53.633
There's probably a lot of scenarios

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:56.300
where you would have to pay $500 or $600

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.568
or whatever it might be.

00:05:57.568 --> 00:05:59.233
But let's just go with this.

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.569
That's essentially a simplification.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.568
There's a 70% chance that he's
going to have to pay $1,000,

00:06:05.568 --> 00:06:08.433
and so that's $700
expected cost from that,

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.300
plus the $8,000 from the insurance

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.768
gets us to $8,700.

00:06:13.768 --> 00:06:17.700
So let's write that down.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.966
So $8,700 ...

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:23.633
My pen is really acting up.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.010
I don't know what's going on here.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.967
I think I have to get a new tablet.

00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:28.366
You can't even read that.

00:06:28.366 --> 00:06:30.300
Let me write this.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.000
$8,700.

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:39.566
Including the cost of insurance,

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:42.702
what are Paul's expected
total medical costs

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.233
with the high-deductible plan?

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:46.533
Round your answer to the nearest cent.

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:48.900
Let's look at the high-deductible plan.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.100
He's going to pay $7,500 no matter what,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.766
$7,500 no matter what,

00:06:54.766 --> 00:06:58.847
and then there's a $0 ...

00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:02.504
We could write $0 times
30% or 30% times $0,

00:07:02.504 --> 00:07:04.100
but that's just going to be $0.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.366
There is a 25% chance he spends $1,000,

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:13.100
so plus 0.25 times $1,000.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.501
There is a 20% chance, plus 0.2,

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:21.233
he's not going to spend $4,000 here.

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.633
He's going to have to
spend the first $2,500.

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:26.700
So it's a 20% chance he spends $2,500,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.700
so times $2,500.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.100
Insurance company will
pay the next $1,500.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.567
Plus another 20% chance.

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.833
Even in this situation,
he only has to pay $2,500,

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:41.633
so times $2,500,

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:43.166
$2,500.

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:46.233
And then finally, plus
there's a 5% chance.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:49.433
Even in this situation, he only
has to pay the first $2,500,

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:52.366
times $2,500

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:57.446
gets us to $8,875.

00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:04.733
So $8,875.

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:06.700
Once again, you could think about it

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.167
as, OK, there is a 25%
chance that he pays $1,000,

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:15.131
and then there is a 45%
chance that he pays $2,500.

00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.368
All of these situations,
he is paying $2,500.

00:08:18.368 --> 00:08:22.266
But either way, you would get $8,875.

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:25.366
If Paul wants the best
payoff in the long run

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:27.582
and must buy 1 of the 2 insurance plans,

00:08:27.582 --> 00:08:29.434
he should purchase the?

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:34.433
Well, his expected
total cost of insurance,

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:36.100
including medical costs,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.566
is lower with the low-deductible plan.

00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:43.167
So this one, he should go with the low,

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:46.006
low-deductible.

00:08:46.006 --> 00:08:47.100
Which, once again,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.033
you shouldn't use these
videos as insurance advice.

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:50.633
This is actually ...

00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:52.256
But also, it's an interesting
way to think about it.

00:08:52.256 --> 00:08:53.633
It's typically ...

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.233
Well, it's not always typically the case

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:56.767
that the low-deductible
plan is going to have

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:59.767
a higher long-term ...

00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:03.233
or the low-deductible plan
is going to be a better deal.

00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:04.033
It's usually the ...

00:09:04.033 --> 00:09:06.633
Well, I won't make any
actuarial statements.

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:08.100
But at least in this situation,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.567
the low-deductible plan
seems like the better deal.

00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:15.302
He has lower expected total
costs given these probabilities.
