00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:05.972
(dissonance)

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.544
- That's a close one.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:14.114 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you sitting
on any green houses?

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.181
- Um...

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.052
No.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:20.920
This is purple.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.422
- Yeah, wrong game, actually.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
- If you land on go, you
get $400, but I'm not sure--

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.327
- That doesn't make any sense,

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.528
because you're not
even going, right?

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.462 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't know if
that's in the rulebook.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.363
- It's like the opposite.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.164
(knocking)

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.665
- Hi Mike.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.200
- Hey, do you have any more
of those little green houses?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.503
- Uh, yeah, guys, it's not
a good day for me right now,

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.804
I'm really busy.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.105
- Well little green
anything would work.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.040
- Yeah, maybe we
could even use--

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.307
- No no no no, look, no,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.343
no one's coming in,
not ever again, okay?

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.845 align:start size:97% position:3%
Very specifically, Wednesdays
are always bad for me,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.881 align:start size:97% position:3%
so just, if you want to
mark that down a little bit,

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.449
okay, I don't know if
you keep a calendar,

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.351
because it's very
important to know.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Uh, we'll just
come back later then.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.054
- Yeah.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.055
- Who knows.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.623
Maybe I'll see you at one.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:57.390
- Okay.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.324
- Goodbye.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.592
- All right.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.527 align:start size:81% position:19%
I don't know, I
think it was maybe

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.327
the vent scenes or something.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.762
- I've never seen it.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.030 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I've never talked with
him, but I feel like I saw it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.831
on a piece of mail
once or something.

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:06.299
(knocking)

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:21.481
(door creaking open)

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.520
(knocking)

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.655
- Hello?

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:36.529
(dissonant music)

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.168
Guess we could call it a tie,

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.670 align:start size:84% position:16%
cause we didn't
technically finish.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.773
- What's the deal with this?

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.775
- Um, well you roll dice,

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.844
and then you take the dice
that you want to reroll.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.479
- No, I mean, why do
we have two of these?

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.380
It's a waste of space.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.317
- Well, what are you talking
about, we got plenty of space.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.088
- This is getting
out of hand, Matt.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.023
I mean, look at this place.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.492
Monica's coming over later,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.794 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I don't want her to think
I live with a total slob.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.329
No offense.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.563
Well, what about you?

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.564 align:start size:81% position:19%
I mean, what about
all this stuff?

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.866
This is your stuff.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.501
- Yeah, those are all
priceless works of art,

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.436
and by keeping those
I'm doing a service.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.470
- You need all of them?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.204
- Yes.

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.439
- Who is this?

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.540
- There's only one of
those in the world.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.474
- All I'm saying is that

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.775
if you are so worried about

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.277 align:start size:84% position:16%
Monica thinking
that we're hoarders,

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think that we could probably
both get rid of some stuff.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.218
Monica?

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.019
- Yeah.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.220
- That's who you said?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.855
- You've met her
like so many times.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.557
Okay, what about this?

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.492 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's, no way,
that's the best thing,

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.361
it's got Sonic, it's in color.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.695
- We don't have any
batteries for this.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.464
Nobody has batteries.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.000
Can I at least put
it on the maybe pile?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.967
(sighs)

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.169
- Yeah, okay.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.673
Okay, how about this stuff?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
- That's the original sheet
music for Jean Baptiste Friso's

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.612
(speaks French)

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.281
- Okay, yeah yeah, but
you have six of them.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.049
So why, you don't need six.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.350
- Well it's six movements.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.618
- This one isn't even done.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.387
- True, Baptiste Friso
wasn't able to finish

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.888 align:start size:81% position:19%
the final movement
before he died,

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.924
but that doesn't make it
any less an important part

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.727
of the canon that he
spent his whole life...

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.263
Okay, fine.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.598
- Cool.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.566
There we go.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.067
- Okay.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.302
Garbage?

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.636 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No way, I eat off
that every single day.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.004
- It's covered in filth.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.240
(gunfire)

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.344
(dogs barking)

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.913
Are we keeping this?

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.848
- Definitely.

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:36.916
(sighs)

00:03:38.551 --> 00:04:02.575
(upbeat guitar music)

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.481
(coughs)

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:14.821
(gunfire, dogs barking)

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.059
- Okay.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:20.960
Let's see it.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.495
Oh, this looks nice.

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.463
- Alright, so do you want
to take the bags of stuff

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.430
that we do want to keep

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.799
and move those into the kitchen?

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.236
- Umm...

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.273
I think I just got into
the zone of moving bags,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.140
and I just--

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.447
- Oh no.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:49.389
- Do you want me to go
get that one painting?

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.523
- Uh, no.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.457
You know what?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.692
Maybe we could take two Yahtzees

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.327
and like, stick them
together or something,

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.129
that like, does the same thing.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:01.034 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Uh, okay, well I think
we kept two Yahtzees,

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:01.901
so maybe we could--

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.036
- I'm being sarcastic.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.871
Jesus.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:05.605
- Sorry.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:06.839
- Do me a favor.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.609
When Monica's here, just
stay out of this room.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.844
- Okay.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:06:01.127
(somber piano music)

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.766 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Do you think maybe
she's not coming?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.202
It's been like five hours?

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.671
- Yeah, she's probably dead,

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:17.477
or has a boyfriend or something.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.583
You got it working.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:24.751
- Yeah.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.652 align:start size:84% position:16%
Um, I found some
batteries that worked

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:29.655
in the emergency flashlight.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.457
Sorry that I took
them out of that.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.859
- No, it's fine.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.428
(video game sound effects)

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.132
- You want to play?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.037
- Yeah, sure.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.276
How do I jump?

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:51.310
Is it A to jump?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.212
- It's B to jump, A to kick.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.948
(buttons clicking)

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.219
(crunching)

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.558 align:start size:84% position:16%
You have to kick,
you're just jumping.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.293
- I want to be jumping.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.127
- Okay.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.830
(dissonant music)
