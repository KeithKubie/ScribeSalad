00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.700
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Thank you very much. It's
nice to be here. So, the story of this book,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.130
The Peep Diaries: How We're Learning to Love
Watching Ourselves and Our Neighbors, really

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:53.210
starts about four years ago when I become
a father, and my social life starts to, you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.330
know, take a precipitous downturn. I used
to go out, and then all of a sudden I didn't

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.220
go out. Any one who has had that experience
knows what I'm talking about. So social life

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.580
was diminished a lot of my "hipster" friends
who were no longer my friends, and this is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:23.010
what things started to look like. Pretty much,
there's me, and that's me with my back hair.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.380
There's the child. She does not yet have back
hair. She will hopefully take after her mother

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:41.270
in that regard. So, yeah, basically, the social
life is diminishing to the point where I began

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.740
to think that, really, I didn't have too many
friends, I start to wonder if I had any friends.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.020
As, you know, you get more into the daddy
thing and everything just kind of changes.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.979
At the same time, I was starting to get into
things like Facebook, and Twitter, and these

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.450
kinds of things which, you know, it all kind
of flirted with, you know, Friendster or whatever,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:16.930
but no one really got seriously into it. And
I was developing a lot of friends on that.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.779
That was my social life again. That was me
at the park. You can see, I'm looking happy,

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:32.571
not. And like, where did my life go? Right,
so, I am basically, spending a lot of time

00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:38.919
at home with the kid, and I'm online a lot.
And, at one point, I noticed that, hey, you

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:46.120
know, good old Hal has 700 friends on Facebook
but he doesn't actually have any friends in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.330
real life. That's so sad. It's such a sad
life. So I had this genius idea which was

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.120
that I would have a Facebook party, and I
would invite all my Facebook friends to come

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.169
and meet me at a local bar, and we would get
to know each other and I would, I would resuscitate

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:14.930
my social life which is basically on complete
life support. And I needed to pull the wires

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.200
out and like "zzzzzzzz" on Hal's social life
which was, you know, every time I left the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.870
house, my wife was like, "Where are you going?
And where are you taking the baby?" So, okay,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.010
so, I decided I'm going to have this Facebook
party, and I go ahead and I invite all, whatever,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.389
700 Facebook friends that I have at that time.
And I'll say, "You know, I want you to meet

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:45.419
me at this local bar around the corner of
my house. I'm buying, come out, and we'll

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:53.089
hang out." And I send this invitation note
and I got, I got a pretty good response, about

00:03:53.089 --> 00:04:00.489
30 people said they were may be coming, about
15 people said they were for sure coming,

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.349
and, you know, a couple of hundred just said
no, and just ignored me. So, there I am, I'm

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.559
at the bar. I've informed the bar that, you
know, I've got between 20 and 30 people coming

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:18.169
to my Facebook party, and I'm ready for action.
See, I put my nice shirt on. I comb my hair.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.650
I shaved, just more than I can say. Now, I
just flew in from Chicago and I got all that--I

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.530
can't bring razors and shaving cream, and
everything. So I'm a little unkempt today.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.470
Joe, forgive me. So, I'm waiting for my friends
to show up, "Oh-oh, where are they?" No, no

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.760
one showed up yet, it's getting dark. There's
me. As you can see, I have run through a few

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.930
beverages at this point, things are starting
to--I was starting to wonder what's going

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:56.830
on exactly. So, no one's there. I'm waiting.
I'm waiting. And, oh, there we go. My Facebook

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.370
friend is showing up Paula. Unfortunately,
she is the only the person who shows up to

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.389
my Facebook party. So, only one person shows
up of the 700 invited. Paula, she's very sweet.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:13.240
She has a boyfriend. She plays some form of
sport which I forgot right now. She works

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.270
in customer service. She read one of my books,
thought it'd be nice to meet me. And, you

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.830
know, so we had this nice talk except that
I kept, like, kind of, apologizing from the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.740
fact that I invited her to a party, and, in
fact, I was the only member of the party.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.599
And I kept kind of looking over my shoulder
every time the door opens, praying that someone

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.669
else would arrive to save us from this socially
awkward moment. But that never happened. Nobody

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.949
else arrived, and it was just me and Paula,
and then Paula, you know, finished the drink

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:51.599
that I bought her, and announced that she
was now going home. So, so that brought me

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:58.190
to a kind of weird inspirational moment, if
you can call it like, "the inspirational moment."

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:06.000
There I am, Paula has left now. So I'm back
to drinking beer on my own. I'm an impressive

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.389
fellow. I can drink a lot of beer on my own.
Right. So, I had this, kind of, this moment

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.960
where I began to think, you know, we're not
using these social networks for what we claim

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.340
we're using them for which is to meet people,
and connect and deepen our friendships, and

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.580
make new friends. Then, what exactly are we
using them for, and--oh, there' me going home.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.759
There I am. I'm done. I [INDISTINCT]. They
threw me out of the bar. They were like, "Hal,

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.909
no one else is coming." That's it. You're
out of there. Okay, so, I began to think that,

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:44.289
in fact, most of us claim that we're using,
you know, Facebook, and other social network

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.211
and sites to connect, to make friends, and
deepen friendship. But I began to think that,

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:54.039
in fact, maybe we were also doing something
else which was basically, kind of watching

00:06:54.039 --> 00:07:00.090
each other, the way we watch television, sort
of, moving through people's lives. And I formulated

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:07.710
this theory that we're moving from a pop culture
to a peep culture. And in pop culture, we

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.740
derived our entertainment from watching celebrities
perform. And in peep culture, we are deriving

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.270
our entertainment from watching people go
about their lives, go about their ordinary

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:28.240
lives. And, obviously, the elements of peep
culture include things like, reality TV, like

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:37.009
blogging, social networks, Facebook, Twitter,
YouTube. So, here, we have my little chart

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:43.710
here, the pop versus peep chart. So, Pop:
Stars Have Talent. Peep: Who Needs Talent?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.590
Pop: The Lives of Celebrities are interesting.
Peep: I'm Interesting And So Are you. Pop:

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:56.240
When Will They Discover Me? Peep: Too Late.
I've Already Discovered Myself. And, you know,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.139
it's kind of funny that this will--I guess,
this is going to be on YouTube, at some point,

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.860
right. So, it's like all these clips I stole
from YouTube are going to go back on YouTube

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:10.569
in some sort of twisted way. Okay. So, there's
three kind of peep culture that I've identified.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:17.449
We just saw--this is peeping ourselves. This
is, again, a video I took from YouTube, that

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:23.029
is--this girl, and she talks about different
parts of her body as she goes through, and

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:29.120
talks about her feet and her hands, and this
created a bunch of copycat videos, perhaps,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.419
in the hundreds, maybe even the thousands
of similar talks of people showing different

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:39.100
parts of their body, and discussing their
feelings about them. So, this is one kind

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:47.830
of peeping ourselves, obviously, there are
many others. Again, you know, we have blogs.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:54.381
We have what we do in Facebook; we have the
information we put out on Twitter. We have

00:08:54.381 --> 00:09:01.670
all these different ways that we peep ourselves.
So here's a quote from Julie Allison who was

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:08.080
on the cover of Wire and sort of featured
as being one of the, the great--a kind of

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:17.391
Web 2.0 net celebrities. And she told Wire
about herself peeping, "I treat it like a

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:21.700
fire. You have to add blogs, or there'll be
like one of those YouTube videos that flame

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.830
out." And after the article came out in Wire,
she wrote, you know, on her blog, "The irony,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.260
of course, is that publicity is a full-time
job. I did over two dozen print interviews

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.470
and 350 television segments in the last year.
I taught my brain to think in sound bites.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.480
In PR, nothing speak, to project authority
on subjects, I have no real knowledge about.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.730
It's a game that I'm a bit tired of playing
it. Now, I need to unlearn much of that."

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.270
So, I thought that was a really interesting
observation on these whole phenomena of, kind

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:58.470
of, peeping yourself that you become really
involved in it, and it's kind of something

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:04.020
that becomes very hard to unlearn. So now,
we have peeping each other which is my, sort

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.100
of, second category of peep culture. Here,
this guy is going to walk over and you can't

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.441
really see the news--there's a newspaper at
the foot of the driveway, and he's going to

00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:16.100
walk over and he's going to kick the newspaper
behind that couch being put out for the garbage,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.470
and he's going to bend off--bend down and
grab it and run away. Which, you know, it's

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.600
amusing to watch in its own right, but what's
really interesting to me about this, of course,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.330
is that the neighbor whose newspaper is being
stolen is filming this to put up on YouTube

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.130
or wherever. So instead of maybe going out
and saying, "Hey, why are you stealing my

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.940
newspaper? We have problem," we're peeping
each other. We're creating entertainment out

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.780
of these weird moments in life. This is the
naked wizard. He was wearing some sort of

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:53.660
wizard outfit before he decided to take it
off in a moment of--perhaps, incoherent, spontaneous

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:59.230
happiness. Anyway, the police are eventually
going to wrestle him to the ground, handcuff

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:05.020
him and taser the shit out of him which is
unfortunate but not really the reason we're

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:12.170
watching this. As you can--you might notice,
as his situation intensifies more and more

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:17.740
people gather around behind him and this is
at the Coachella Music Festival. So, more

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.050
and more people are gathered around behind
him, and they're filming him. And the more

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:28.570
violent the situation gets, the more it escalates,
the more people are watching this, which again

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:39.340
is, I think, a symptom of peep culture. It's
part of the way peep culture works that we

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.410
watch each other, we are peeping each other,
and then we sort of move away from getting

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:50.920
actually involved in situations in environments.
We just tend to sort of sit back and watch.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:59.450
So then, there's this third category, Peeped
by 'The Other' which is this whole world of

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:07.070
search engines, corporations, different kinds
of entities that make--that facilitate peeping,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:13.080
that make it easy for people to peep on each
other, and do peeping themselves, obviously.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:21.310
Google is part of that category. And this
is Pipl which, I don't know, some sort of

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:27.680
Google rip-off, I guess, that does Pipl. Anyway,
I put my name into Pipl and it kind of provides

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.410
me with a list in categories of different
ways, different information you can find Hal

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.460
and I'm sure that there are people in this
room who can tell me how this works a lot

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.860
better than, I mean, I have no clue how it
works. But, all I know is the kind of social

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.570
effects of it. So there is some of the results
of when I put my name in. It's like every

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:57.580
picture I've ever had put up on the Internet
comes up, all different links and blogs and--basically,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.510
tons of information about Hal and it's neatly
ordered, so there's different, you know, categories

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:10.750
of find Hal, you know, locate Hal, various
variations on locating, finding, and accessing

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:16.680
Hal. That's a lot of Hal. I don't know who
would ever want to do that. But--so this is

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.730
the, this is kind of being peeped by the other
which is a kind of, peep culture facilitating

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:31.100
of peep making it happen, collecting this
information, amalgamating it, organizing it.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:36.420
Here's another category of peeping by the
other. This is net detective obviously, you

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:43.810
can go online, and I ordered net detective
search on my father for $34.95, I believe

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:48.991
it was. I was going to do myself, but I live
in Canada, so they wanted $350, so I was like,

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:57.350
"Fine, do dad." And, again, you get, a dossier
that's not that dissimilar from what you get

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:03.840
on Pipl which is, kind of, just, you know,
everything that there is to know about my

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.890
father. It's a little bit more precise through
Net Detective. You get his mortgage; how much

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:15.980
he owes on the house; what income bracket
he's in; if he's retired or not; how many

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:23.210
kids he has. All of these different categories,
and, you know, this is a sort of weird entertainment

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:29.210
that we access, if we so choose. And this
is part of--this rise of peep culture that

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.720
we can go and do these things for, you know,
they're pretty much the same costs as a movie

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.650
and popcorn. It was actually really funny
because when I got the net detective information,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:49.580
there's this one part that was like, criminal,
you know, criminal report. I was all excited.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.492
I was like, "Now, I'm finally going to find
out the truth about dad." So I tear and open

00:14:52.492 --> 00:15:00.420
this piece of paper, and it's like speeding
ticket. Like, that was not, you know, that

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.610
was not impressive for me. I thought, dad
maybe had like a third life or even a second

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:14.380
life would've sufficed to make dad more interesting.
Come on, dad. Get going. Where is your fifth

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:21.130
wife? And I don't know; your entire career
as a Canadian secret service agent. Anyway,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:28.940
okay, right, so in Peepville, we watch ourselves
and each other; it's what we do. Obviously,

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:34.550
in the book--I said I'm on this sort of quest
to understand why we're suddenly so interested

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:40.590
in peeping; why we're moving from pop culture
to peep culture with such reckless abandon.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:49.500
So I start to explore some of the people who
do peep. This is, Lisa Sargese, who is a woman

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:56.751
who blogs, and video blogs about her life.
She started blogging about four years ago,

00:15:56.751 --> 00:16:02.760
I think, when she was about to have gastric
bypass surgery. She's morbidly obese, could

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:09.900
barely kind of stand, and so she was going
in for the surgery, and right before that,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.720
she started to seriously blog about her experiences.
So this is, obviously, someone who has been

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:24.640
peeping herself very, very seriously over
the last four years. So I'll read a little

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:30.760
bit, this is from her blog, and she writes
on her blog, "My story doesn't matter, at

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.250
least, I don't think my story mattered until
folks started to thank me for sharing it.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.700
My fear, my low self-esteem, my aversion to
exposure and confrontation made me want to

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.310
hide. For years, I did hide. I hid behind
a mountain of fat. I'm still fat, at least,

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.560
by society standards. No one takes into consideration
that I can walk from my classroom to my car

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.120
without sitting three or four times. No one
looks at my big ass and applauds me for getting

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.500
off it. No one is sympathizing with my impending
reconstructive surgery to cut off all the

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.810
inevitable loose skin. No one does until I
tell my story." And this is the video that

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:13.830
she put up right after getting the surgery,
and you can see that she's really, you know,

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:19.880
showing everything, not hiding anything. And
that's the video that's linked to her blog

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:27.350
and up on YouTube. So, talking to Lisa made
me really realized just how kind of affirming

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.780
peep culture can be, this idea of no one is
going to care about my story unless I tell

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.410
it; unless I put it in front of people and
say, "Look at me. This is what I'm going through.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:43.070
You need to pay attention with my story."
At the same time, I noticed an evolution on

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.860
her blog where she's kind of starts off wanting
to connect, wanting to tell her story, and

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.020
hopefully, help other people. And then, as
she moves on, she becomes really, very focused

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:59.300
on the idea that she has a following that
she is, perhaps, moving on to a career as

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.920
a kind of self-help guru. And so, later on
in her blog, I noticed a couple of years later,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.250
she writes, "What is this drive I have to
be some bad ass, rock star celebrity. I don't

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:16.730
know why I want more. I just do." So, she
very quickly, kind of, illustrates--I think,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.810
the addictive nature of peep culture, just
how much having some followers who are, who

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:27.670
seem to be interested in the mundane details
of your life becomes a powerful feeling, an

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:33.930
empowering feeling for you. And now, she really
talks about wanting to become the Oprah Winfrey

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:41.330
of, you know, people who go through gastric
bypass surgery. So another person I met who

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:50.150
is in this category of seriously being a peep
participant, this is Amalyn. She does a video

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:56.860
blog about her life, you saw her there, about
to have her, her daughter. And she started

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:02.410
the blog right around that time, and she told
me that she was lonely and that she's a young

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.390
woman and none of her friends were sharing
this experience with her 'cause they, of course,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:14.500
were off to college or whatever. It's not
very common for 20-year-olds now to have kids.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.460
And she told me that her blog is a way for
her to reach out, and connect with people

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.680
and, kind of, break out of her loneliness.
So I'm going to read you a quote. This is

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:30.970
a discussion that ran alongside one of her
videos that she posted. And it was video talking

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.880
about her life that, in which she was wearing
a kind of shirt that was cropped like here.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.530
So it was like cropped-top shirt. So she has
this discussion with this guy, we'll call

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:47.430
him O'Neal. So this is O'Neal, he says, "Can
you do another video in that belly shirt?

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.800
Are you wearing underwear in this video? You
are hot." And Amalyn says, "Yes, I'm wearing

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.150
underwear. No, I don't really on belly tops."
O'Neal: "What kind of underwear were you wearing?

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.410
Can you do another video in the belly shirt
from the video? You do have a sweet belly

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.770
button" Amalyn: "I don't really disclose what
type I wear over the internet, but use your

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.420
imagination. I don't like doing belly videos
because the comments I get tend to creep me

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.700
out, to be perfectly honest." O'Neal: "I do
not mean to freak you out. I would just like

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.841
you to do another video in the belly shirt
you are wearing in the video. Can I guess

00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:27.920
what kind you are wearing, G-string or thong?"
Amalyn: "Ha-ha, I won't be doing a video wearing

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.309
just that shirt." O'Neal: "No, I meant another
video with you wearing that same shirt. Also,

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:39.520
were you wearing G-string or thong?" So, from
Amalyn, I learned again, there's this question

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.430
of loneliness and connection, but at the same
time, while she thinks that she's connecting

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.780
and making these friends online, a lot of
the people that she's communicating with,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:55.450
I feel have a whole different idea in mind
of what it is she's providing them. And, in

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:03.100
this way, you can see how her life becomes,
kind of, sucked into this whole void of other

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.220
people's fantasy. And she really becomes a
character for them, and that something that

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.920
reoccurs over and over again in the rise of
peep culture, is people don't empathize with

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.340
her and form a community with her so much
as they flick through her life as if they

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:24.040
were watching a sitcom and they're, you know,
encouraging her to develop her character in

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.200
ways that will excite them more and interest
them more, you know, kinds of, you know, based

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.370
on whatever it is they're into. So, that's
me and Amalyn having a discussion at a local

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:43.790
mall which she put upon YouTube. Okay, so,
another character here who I met, who appears

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:49.570
in the book. I say character which is probably
terrible 'cause these are actually real people.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:55.430
This is Padme, and Padme runs this blog Journey
to the Darkside. Padme is in a master-slave

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:01.950
relationship, and on her blog, she does two
things. She blogs about her master-slave relationship

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:07.710
and all its kinky goings on. And she also
blogs about her very ordinary life as a mother

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.910
of two and a housewife. So, I'm going to read
a little piece of this blog here. "I just

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.460
found out that Chucky Cheese where we were
going to have Skywalker's birthday party had

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.320
a pipe burst and they canceled his party on
us." Skywalker is her son. She doesn't identify

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:25.280
herself or any of her, any other people she
talks about. "The woman on the phone didn't

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.920
seem to think it was a big deal but we have
a ton of kids and people coming to the birthday

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.420
later, and we have to try to find somewhere
else. Also the lute bags and the cake, and

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.700
the packaging were all done through Chucky
Cheese. Now, we have a lot of running around

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:43.960
to do. Urgh [ph]." So you can see this is
the kind of mundane information that lots

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.550
of people might provide in different formats
online. But then she goes on talking in that

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.920
same post about how she really needs master
to come home and give her a thorough spanking

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.860
to alleviate her stress. So things get kind
of weird very quickly. And I said to Padme,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.290
I said, you know, "What is the appeal of this
blog? Wouldn't it be better if it was just

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:10.890
devoted to your sexual kinks or just your
family life, so there isn't a strange, kind

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:16.590
of, mix up?" And she said to me, "We're not
just one specific topic. A lot of people like

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:21.740
that we're really open. We're not just spanking
or sex. I think people are fascinated with

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.530
us. There's definitely a lot of lurkers, a
lot of return visitors, people are curious.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:32.371
They want to know what we're doing next."
So, for Padme, she's really kind of--set it

00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:36.690
up in this way that she thinks is going to
attract the most amount of people. So, she

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.690
has people who come who are interested in
the sex; people who come who are interested

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:47.560
in her lifestyle and in this master-slave
lifestyle; and people who come who are just

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.720
kind of interested in the mundane details
of her life. And for her, this is an ideal

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.960
kind of set up to attract the most people.
There she's just having her first spanking

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:06.070
apparently. You know, you can't make this
stuff up--you don't have to. So, you know,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.070
we had this fascinating talk, and one of the
things that I asked her is, "Would you ever

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.860
want your kids to see this?" She said, "Oh
no, definitely not." "Would you want your

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.330
family to see this?" "No, definitely not."
Her sister doesn't know about it. Nobody in

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.630
her community knows about it. So, again, she
talks like Amalyn and Lisa about loneliness,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:30.550
and, kind of, connecting to people but there's
this--the irony, of course, is that these

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.500
revelations about her life, the things that
would really connect her to people are only

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:42.559
provided for anonymous strangers. She does
not give access to this information to the

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:46.280
people who are closest to her because she
doesn't want them to know. So these are real,

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.420
kind of, disconnect between what we think
people want to do or what she thinks she kind

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.410
of wants to do which is make--alleviate her
loneliness and make connection and friends

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:01.270
to what she's really doing which is, again,
kind of turning herself into a, sort of, product

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:06.760
and she's really proud of the fact that over
1.5 million people have visited Journey to

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:14.630
the Dark Side. This is a big, you know, big
thing for her. Okay, so I met some of the

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.920
characters. I've introduced you to some of
the characters who appear in the book, who

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:27.970
are samples of peep. This is, this is Post
Secret. What I did after I talked to the people

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.929
who do a lot of peep is I started to talk
to other people who are kind of involved in

00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:39.800
facilitating peep culture, and Post Secret
is run by Frank Warren, and Frank Warren lives

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.720
in Maryland and he started this, sort of,
empire of secrets. To me, he's kind of the

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:51.860
high priest of peep in many ways. If you're
not familiar with this project which has been

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:59.350
running for a quite a number of years now,
basically, it is--secrets put up online that

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.320
are provided to him by anonymous people who
send in these postcards, these artfully done

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.990
postcards and on them is their anonymous secret.
And then, he then scans them in and puts them

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:14.230
on his Website postsecret.com. He also has
a series of bestselling books that collect

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:19.710
these postcards and he does a lot of speaking
towards where he shows the postcards and talks

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:25.360
about why he does what he does. So I went
to Frank to, kind of, try to understand this

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:32.290
impulse to put our secrets out for all to
see. And this is what he told me when I asked

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.730
him about the popularity of Post Secret. He
said, "Some of the reasons people come initially

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:41.830
might just be curiosity. But you can't look
at these secrets without them resonating with

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:47.070
you personally. You can recognize your secret
on a stranger's postcard. Each secret is very

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:53.360
individual but the emotion and the feeling
and the experience ties us into a commonality."

00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:02.100
So there's a kind of beauty there. There's
a kind of sad empathy which, I think, Frank

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:11.420
is tapping into this idea of recognizing each
other through these secrets. And there's a

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.730
real--this idea of tying us into this commonality
through this anonymous expression of our secret.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:21.820
So I think it's a really powerful one. But,
I couldn't help noticing after talking to

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:28.429
Frank that various, other entities were, sort
of, co-opting this idea and starting to try

00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:34.980
to, kind of, versions of Post Secret for their
own reasons. One of those entities is the

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.010
Kleenex Let It Out Website, which is, kind
of, a marketing campaign where they encourage

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:46.630
people to go to Kleenex and similarly, they
would let out their secrets. So, here's a

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:53.240
secret that somebody posted on the Kleenex
Let It Out site, writes underdog the world.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:59.330
"I'm 16, I'm a sophomore. I'm a rape victim.
It happened this year by a guy I thought was

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:04.280
one of my friends and to make it worse, it
was at my church. He said he needed to talk,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.530
and I trusted him. My life changed. My friends
changed. My school has changed, but most importantly,

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:14.150
I changed. I have no one to talk about and
I wish I did. I also wish I wouldn't have

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:19.000
trusted him." So that's the story that she
posted on the Kleenex Let It Out site. And

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.540
Kleenex helpfully, provides little kind of
tags at the end, and her tag was, "Find Similar

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:34.700
Rape." So, you can see how we go from Frank
Warren's vision of the shared commonality

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:42.900
of secrets to a more ill-advised, encouraging
of people to share secrets and, sort of, turning

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:49.780
their secrets into product for these different
marketing campaigns, which is maybe the not

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.860
so pleasant side of peep culture. So then
I begin to think, "Okay, why do people peep?"

00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:01.220
What is this obsession with peeping after
all these experiences I've had and people

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.120
I have talked to. And one of the things I
started to think about was apes. As you can

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:13.570
see, we got some apes going, and grooming
in the way that monkeys and apes spend hours

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.080
and hours everyday grooming themselves. And,
of course, they're grooming themselves, grooming

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.309
each other. So, you know, here we see apes
doing it to humans who seem to love it by

00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:28.059
the way. You don't see anyone going, "Get
off me, monkey," which is what I'd be doing.

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:35.820
But, so I came to this idea that we're searching
for community in an age of alienation that

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.480
we are basically evolved for monkeys, but
we haven't really evolved as far as we would

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:46.320
like to thank in that we really people who
need constant community, who want touch and

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:57.380
tactility, and we're searching for that through
these peep culture endeavors, through these

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.050
revelations. And so, for instance, you can
think of something like, Twitter, as a kind

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:09.760
of constant cyber grooming. And somebody asked
me--an interviewer asked me, a reporter asked

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.100
me, you know, "Aren't the status updates annoying?
Aren't they just pointless?" And I said, "Well,

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:21.010
you can look at it that way or you can look
at it as this really profound constant updating

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:28.030
that connects you to people's lives just the
fact that we really desire to be known for

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:34.220
just going about our lives." So instead of
constantly trying to, you know, create better,

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.460
more powerful resumes and turn ourselves into
celebrities, we really also want to be known

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:45.680
just for going about our lives. This is footage
from Nanook of the North, by the way, which

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:52.250
was a documentary shot by Robert Flaherty
in the '20s, and it was one of the first documentaries

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:58.220
ever made. And it was this incredible hit
and it really spoke already to this kind of

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:07.309
rise of alienation in our society. So we live
in this kind of alienated situations. We live

00:31:07.309 --> 00:31:14.640
in single family dwellings. We live in apartments.
We get in our cars. As we drive to work, we

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:23.160
go to our cubicle. And something about that
world does not fulfill us. There's an element

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.890
there that leaves us feeling like we need
more, and peep culture is kind of rushing

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:34.549
in to fill the gap. I like this video. I think
it's probably fake, but, you know, it's funny.

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:42.550
Here we have, I think, it was called "office
freak out" so he's freaking out. It looks,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:51.850
kind of, too good to be true in a way. But
we are lonely and we do live in very alienating

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.870
circumstances in our lives, and I think that
this search for community, this desire to

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:02.179
return to a more, in a way, almost more primitive
way of life where we're in a constant company

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:08.780
with each other, where we inherently need
each other, and can no longer--just, sort

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:14.440
of, get in our car, drive away, get into our
house and lock the door and watch TV all night,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:21.240
you know, we want to go back to those times
in many ways. So, I think, that is a big factor

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:29.470
in why we peep. There's another big factor
in why we peep, and it is, of course, the

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:36.570
rise of--wait for it--celebrity. Here we go.
Here's Michael Jackson, the King of Pop. I'm

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:44.580
going to spare you my moon walk which is,
you know, usually part of my show, here. No.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:55.370
So, this whole question of celebrity, the
rise of celebrity which has really been, been,

00:32:55.370 --> 00:33:03.160
perhaps, the predominant element of our social
and cultural life over the last, say, it's

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:09.090
probably fair to say, 60, maybe even a hundred
years. I think that we cannot underestimate

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.860
the power and allure of celebrity. We see
these people on the screen all the time. We

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:21.610
see them being held up as our role models
as "the people" that we should want to be

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:31.720
like. And so, we have this craving to be like
them. At the same time, our coverage of celebrities,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.020
the way we see celebrities is changing. So
instead of admiring their performances, we

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:43.910
now admire what they wear, who they're married
to, what, you know, how big their houses.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.750
Here we see a video that I found somewhere,
probably, some, sort of, TV show which, you

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.380
know, basically, involves a helicopter flying
over the houses of the rich and famous. So

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.920
the more, so the more the coverage changes
to reflect our obsession with their personal

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.340
lives the more we start to think, you know,
my personal life could also get coverage in

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:11.029
this way, enter, of course, the rise of high
speed Internet and all the different Web 2.0

00:34:11.029 --> 00:34:16.509
conduits, and you get people really accessing
peep culture in this way. I'm going to read

00:34:16.509 --> 00:34:22.749
a quote from the book. This is something I
wrote in the Peep Diaries that is a reaction

00:34:22.749 --> 00:34:28.859
to some of the ideas around celebrity. "The
peep celebrity isn't becoming so prevalent

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:33.129
in our culture because we're finally freeing
ourselves from the shackles of an entertainment

00:34:33.129 --> 00:34:37.849
industry that for too long, controlled who
and what we watched. In fact, the opposite

00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:43.210
is happening. The peep celeb is indicative
of just how entranced we are by the media

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:48.919
machine's ability to create the star celebrity.
We are drawn to the person product who seems

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:55.829
to fit so effortlessly into a society organize
around the principle that people can and should

00:34:55.829 --> 00:35:01.749
be reduced to hits, rating, views, box-office
gross. In such a system, we are encouraged

00:35:01.749 --> 00:35:07.249
to believe that our participation could lead
to us being recognized and lavishly rewarded

00:35:07.249 --> 00:35:12.900
just for going about our lives. Meanwhile,
we are also led to believe that our participation

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:20.130
is in some way against the system. So we want
to believe that putting ourselves online in

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:25.440
the way that celebrities are covered is in
some way against celebrity culture instead

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.729
of just entering it. Here you see some footage
from TMZ. Oh, this is Rihanna after being

00:35:32.729 --> 00:35:39.830
beaten up by her boyfriend. So, you can see,
that this isn't all fun and games. It is,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:45.391
in fact, the process by which we make entertainment
out of other people's misery. I began to think

00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:55.039
of all as breaking the seal. This is the Star
Wars kid, one of the most popular videos ever

00:35:55.039 --> 00:36:01.290
posted online. And, in many ways, the Star
Wars kid broke the seal for us on this whole

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:11.339
idea of using ordinary people's lives as entertainment,
over 150 million people have watched this

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:16.310
video, which is, you know, an incredible number.
And this whole idea of, kind of, breaking

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:22.239
the seal that once we've started down this
road, we really can't stop. Here we see our

00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:28.489
portly Quebec friend going about his Star
Wars machinations. So, I had this idea about

00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:33.769
breaking the seal, and I tied breaking the
seal into Flicker, and found thousands, perhaps,

00:36:33.769 --> 00:36:40.239
tens of thousands of photos of people breaking
the seal, and for those who don't know her

00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:45.359
or have decided to forget breaking the seal
as, of course, colloquialism for going to

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:50.369
the bathroom the first time while you're at
your keg party. So, you don't want to go,

00:36:50.369 --> 00:36:53.771
you want to hold it in as long as possible
'cause once you go then you're going to have

00:36:53.771 --> 00:37:01.299
to go repeatedly. So, in my mind, we've broken
the seal in many ways on this whole idea of

00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:07.849
peep culture. And this is leading us to a
world where, you know, we're actually happy

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:14.420
to be photographed breaking the seal, going
to the bathroom drunk. This is actually considered,

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:21.989
pretty normal in our society now and in many
ways is a good thing, you know. It's like,

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:29.200
"Look at me, yeah. Go for it." So, I mean,
breaking the seal I think has its good and

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:37.089
bad elements to it. Obviously, when you--every
one I talked to talks about the addictive

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:42.839
nature of it, how hard it is to stop once
they start. So, once you, kind of, start to

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:51.130
get followers, you've broken the seal. GPS
Snitch is an item that I ordered and got my

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:58.760
hands on, and basically, it's a tracker. I
put it in my wife's handbag and I began to

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:05.470
track her. I'm still married. Thank you. I
asked her permission. And so I tracked her

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:10.759
online, basically, it shows at Google map.
And she's a little dot, and she goes along,

00:38:10.759 --> 00:38:15.910
and I was tracking her going back and forth
to work. And in a way, I kind of broke the

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:23.440
seal for my own desire to watch because once
I started tracking her, I found out that I

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:29.410
couldn't stop. I was literally obsessed with
checking this Google map and where she was

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.740
going. And I would go like, you know, I pretend
to work for ten minutes, and then I'd go and

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:39.019
check this map. And at one point, she was
biking to work. She bikes to work, you know,

00:38:39.019 --> 00:38:45.109
we live in Toronto. You can do that there.
And she was biking to work and I was watching

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:49.640
her little dot travel at 12 miles per hour
heading east, and then, you know, it's all

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.760
very friendly and I was going about my work.
And what ended up happening is all of a sudden

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.630
the dot stopped. And, you know, I was like,
"Okay, you know, that's fine. The dot stopped.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:04.890
It's a red light or whatever." But the dot
didn't start again, and I started to get all

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.779
super paranoid, and I was like, "What's going
on here? Why has the dot stopped?" So I immediately

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:14.359
tried to call her on her cell phone and she
didn't pick up. So then I was like, "Oh, oh,"

00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:18.640
you know, I started--I broke into a sweat,
and I'm like, hitting like resets and the

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:24.641
dot is not going. And I'm like, convinced
that she's been run over by a truck. And then

00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:31.410
finally, finally, the dot starts to go again
as I like—just about to like start calling

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:38.499
like, the police, check the local hospitals.
So the dot starts to go again, and she's off

00:39:38.499 --> 00:39:43.180
to work. So later on, I finally got her on
the phone and I was, "What happened to you?

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:48.260
Why did you stop?" She said, "Oh, I stopped
to get a sandwich, tuna sandwich to eat on

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:55.950
the way to work." So, I mean, one of the things
I talk about in the book is this whole idea

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:01.430
of surveillance as entertainment and just
how obsessed we get once we start doing these

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:06.230
things. So again, you kind of break the seal.
And again, you know, we like to think that

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:12.489
this is making us safer in some way, but in
many ways, it might not be, it may just be

00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:23.740
making us more obsessive and this is something
that--oh, that must've hurt. He laughs. You

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.650
know, this is something that we have to consider
in our society as where all this is going

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.940
in terms of, you know, we can watch but then
I just wanted to watch more. The more I use

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:37.450
GPS Snitch, the more I became obsessed with
the things I couldn't see, and I wanted video,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:47.390
and I wanted audio. And, you know, I just
became less happy with what I could--with

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:52.970
the content that I could use to track her,
which is already, you know, a pretty amazing

00:40:52.970 --> 00:41:00.451
technology. So, I'm going to end reading something
from the book. This is, kind of, the conclusion

00:41:00.451 --> 00:41:07.231
of the book. And while I end, it'll play some
nice videos here for you. "And so I think

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:11.059
I finally come to the one thing I know for
sure, the one thing writing this book has

00:41:11.059 --> 00:41:16.160
made me absolutely convinced of. If there's
one thing I now know, it's the value of not

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.559
knowing. Our pragmatic, bureaucratic society
sees it differently, of course. But so much

00:41:21.559 --> 00:41:27.250
of the mystery of life, so much of its inherent,
unquantifiable worth comes from that which

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:32.969
remains a mystery. It's not knowing that make
us fall in love, that allows us to appreciate

00:41:32.969 --> 00:41:37.980
beauty, that permits us to ravel in the moment
despite the indisputable fact that one day

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:43.569
we will be sick, and that one day, we will
be dead. Why didn't people come to my Facebook

00:41:43.569 --> 00:41:49.099
party because they felt they didn't have to.
They felt they already knew me; so why waste

00:41:49.099 --> 00:41:54.180
an evening getting to know someone you already
know. Many times during the course of researching

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:59.300
this book, I heard a familiar refrain, and
this is something that I heard from Lisa Sargese

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:06.190
and from Amalyn, and from Padme. They said
to me, when I asked them how they felt about

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:13.069
the fact that thousands--hundreds of thousands
maybe even millions of strangers knew the

00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:18.759
details of their intimate private life, they
said to me, well, they think they know me

00:42:18.759 --> 00:42:24.690
but they don't really know me. It's as if
having revealed everything, having laid bare

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:29.910
every potential mystery, we want to pull back
and reclaim that insoluble essential something

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:35.640
we've given away. They don't know me. I'm
still the singular human being, an enigma,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.819
an unknowable. Not knowing is an option too,
it's a choice I hope my daughter's generation

00:42:41.819 --> 00:42:47.079
will be able to occasionally make. As for
us right now, well, we're busy frantically

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:51.299
trying to know everything and anything, no
matter how garish invasive or better left

00:42:51.299 --> 00:42:57.290
alone it may be. We're frantic about filling
the void. But the void is a vacuum. It sucks

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:02.519
everything into it. It's never full, it's
never satisfied. Peep is bad when it exists

00:43:02.519 --> 00:43:08.099
to feed the all-knowing void, and at the risk
of getting all chicken soup for the grownup

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:13.630
daughter here, peep is good when it feeds
that which is uniquely human, our capacity

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:21.069
to care without needing to know why." So,
I'll stop there, somebody who would want to

00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:28.759
take a stab in identifying our lovely videos?
There'll be a price. Nobody?

00:43:28.759 --> 00:43:35.670
&gt;&gt; That's one is [INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Right, David after the dentist.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:42.269
And before David, there was, I believe, the
dancing cadet. He also made an appearance.

00:43:42.269 --> 00:43:48.440
He was skyrocketed to fame after his roommate
planted a hidden camera in their dorm room.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.619
And, there was one more--what's the other
one? I always ask this question and then I

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:56.849
forget the answer, which is probably not that
bright. Somewhere on one of these cards, it

00:43:56.849 --> 00:44:04.609
will tell you. Well, you know, it'll let the
masses of YouTube decide. It'll come to me

00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:19.849
later. So, yeah, I'm here to, you know, if
there's any questions about what I've had

00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:28.049
to say.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:44:28.049 --> 00:44:35.829
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Well, I mean--yeah. That's
one of the things that I hear a lot is, oh,

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:42.109
you know, it's much more frightening now and
then there's a question of erasing and, again,

00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:48.650
you know, I'm by no means any kind of computer
genius, but I do get the sense that it's harder

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:53.769
to erase than it is to put the things on.
And, in the course of the book, you know,

00:44:53.769 --> 00:44:59.250
one of the guys that I talked to for awhile
was this private detective who basically told

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:06.261
me that, in previous, you know, he's up there
in age, and he said, "You have a previous

00:45:06.261 --> 00:45:12.979
decades when he would do his private detectiveing,
the holy grail was to get a picture of this

00:45:12.979 --> 00:45:18.079
person, so that you could then, you could
then track them better." And now we said,

00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:23.640
that, of course, the picture is--involves
just putting their name into the computer

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:29.430
and, you know, the picture is the easiest
thing to get. And that, in fact, most of his

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:34.670
investigations now don't involve him ever
leaving his office, whereas, before it would

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:41.980
be getting the picture, tracking the guy down
and following them around and accumulating

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.579
information that way. So there's this whole
kind of shift in how we can find out about

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:52.940
people.
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Where do you see this going? Do

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.360
you think it's going to be--there would be
more of it or do you think it's going to,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.989
kind of, peter out with the Internet being,
you know, still relatively young? Do you think

00:46:00.989 --> 00:46:04.040
this is just the Internet phenomenon or just
the way that we are?

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:11.809
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Yeah, I think that it is going
to continue. I don't think it's going to peter

00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:18.609
out. I think we're really looking at a, kind
of, quantum shift in how humanity is going

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:26.690
to relate to itself. And, I think, in many
ways, this is the beginning. You know, again,

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:31.440
I don't know anything about technology and
I don't know anything about business. You're

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.609
thinking, what do I know about--I don't know
myself. I know, you know, very little, in

00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:47.249
fact, but what I have observed is that people
are instinctually using these technologies.

00:46:47.249 --> 00:46:55.269
They're moving forward with, kind of, instinct
and desire as opposed to any kind of intellectual,

00:46:55.269 --> 00:46:59.950
really thinking through what they're doing,
and I think that that's--that accounts for

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:05.099
the crazy growth of something like, Twitter,
which I just read, you know, from 2008 to

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:11.619
2009 grew 300 percent or something like that.
So you've got this incredible desire to connect,

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:17.539
to put ourselves out there. And I think it's
just going to continue as technologies make

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:22.749
it easier and easier for us to fuse our lives
with our, kind of, parallel virtual lives

00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:29.609
which we're starting to experiment with--and,
people really want to do this stuff. I mean,

00:47:29.609 --> 00:47:34.880
if you ask me, "Is Twitter going to be around
or Facebook or Google?" That I can't tell

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.529
you. In many ways, that's something that I
think it's, kind of--beside the point from

00:47:39.529 --> 00:47:44.910
what I'm looking at, which is just this big
shift in behavior with who's going to profit

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:50.359
from it, and what the names are going to be,
that I don't know. But, I think there's no

00:47:50.359 --> 00:47:58.549
question that people are going to be continuing
to do this and doing it in even more reflexive,

00:47:58.549 --> 00:48:10.219
and what we might have thought of previously,
invasive ways. You guys are quiet. Come on.

00:48:10.219 --> 00:48:16.559
Don't you want to know how drunk I got on
Facebook night?

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:21.160
&gt;&gt; Who was taking your photos on Facebook
night?

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:27.180
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Well, I, of course, needed
a photographer to capture the glory of Facebook

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:34.089
night. So, I dragged my next-door neighbor
who's an amateur photographer along with me.

00:48:34.089 --> 00:48:39.141
And, see, the funny thing about Facebook night
is I excluded the 40 years old people on Facebook

00:48:39.141 --> 00:48:45.420
who I actually knew as, you know, real--I
don't know, most of them you wouldn't call

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:50.839
them friends, but you would call them associates
or whatever, you know, people that I knew

00:48:50.839 --> 00:48:57.259
from the scene. So I didn't invite them there.
I only invited people I'd never known, and

00:48:57.259 --> 00:49:01.220
the photographer was technically not invited
'cause he was in the category of Facebook

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.170
friends I actually knew. But, you know, you
got to--it was really interesting 'cause I

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:14.229
really did think that 15, 20, 30 people were
going to show up at this thing. And, you know,

00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:20.619
I really staged it more to ask people what--how
they use Facebook, and just get more insight

00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:25.019
into the whole social networking phenomenon
face to face. I though it would be a nice

00:49:25.019 --> 00:49:31.859
little mixer. And I really had no idea that
my attraction as a human being was so low.

00:49:31.859 --> 00:49:41.390
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: How did you have 702 friends on
Facebook? I mean, is this--as the result of

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:47.829
your book or is it just from--do you really
know 700 people?

00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:54.020
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Oh, no, no. I mean I--I don't
know like, ten people. I just--as a writer

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:59.349
in a public, you know, bit of a public figure,
it's not that girls are throwing themselves

00:49:59.349 --> 00:50:06.180
at me as I walk down the streets, yet, you
know, I know they will. But, you know, it

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:11.819
just sort of accumulated that I--people would
say, "Oh, I read your article then I friended

00:50:11.819 --> 00:50:17.700
with you." You know what I mean, I write articles,
have written books, and so I would accept

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:24.569
their friendship knowing, of course, that
they weren't really my friends. And it's really

00:50:24.569 --> 00:50:27.400
interesting when you talk to people who use
Facebook a lot or a lot of these social networking

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.710
things where they'll say, they all have these
different rules, and maybe you--in this room

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:38.539
have certain rules where they'll say, "I only
add people on Facebook who I have met in person

00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:42.450
or I only add people in Facebook who I've
had a drink with or I only do this or that."

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:46.809
And I always say to them, "Well, that's fine.
That's good. You have your policy but what

00:50:46.809 --> 00:50:51.499
is your--what's your rationale here? What
are you actually trying to achieve through

00:50:51.499 --> 00:50:55.729
Facebook that you've set those rules?" And
then they'll say, "Well, you know, I don't

00:50:55.729 --> 00:51:00.980
know. Like, that's just my rule." So, I mean,
people again, I think, throughout the writing

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:08.799
of this Peep Diaries book, I always found
that people were almost always using the technology--they

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:12.979
had an idea in mind of what they were using
it for, but they were actually using it in

00:51:12.979 --> 00:51:18.059
a way that was totally contrary to that idea.
And I think that that, you know, the Facebook

00:51:18.059 --> 00:51:21.660
party is one illustration of that, and the
fact, they we're, you know, we're often--we

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:26.880
adapt these rules and we think that we're--we
know what we're doing but, in fact, we're

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.019
usually, kind of, confused as to what it is
that we're actually doing and why. So part

00:51:32.019 --> 00:51:38.920
of, you know, my message is that we should
think more--we should step back and think

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:43.269
a little harder about some of the ways we're
using these, these interfaces and why we're

00:51:43.269 --> 00:51:46.119
using them. And what we actually want to get
out of them.

00:51:46.119 --> 00:51:52.136
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm kind of [INDISTINCT].
I kind of make it that way.

00:51:52.136 --> 00:51:57.059
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Yeah, I mean, that's part
of the--that's part of the fascinating thing

00:51:57.059 --> 00:52:02.099
about this is that people are really splitting
this as people would say, "You know, I never

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:06.530
want to take anything back. That's just who
I am. I'm going to put it all out there."

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:12.519
And other people will say, "Well," you know,
"I kind of, wish I hadn't done that or someone

00:52:12.519 --> 00:52:16.190
else hadn't done that." And a lot of times,
the material--most of the material I found

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:21.059
on that Pipl say about me was stuff from other
people that other people had put up there,

00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:24.579
especially pictures and stuff. So you go to
the party and someone takes a picture of you,

00:52:24.579 --> 00:52:31.799
they put it up, you know, there's not a lot
we can do. One of the scenes in the book,

00:52:31.799 --> 00:52:39.971
I had this dinner with this amateur sex Website
group who all put up visibly nude photos of

00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:47.369
themselves. And so a bunch of these participants
who--couples gathered and had dinner with

00:52:47.369 --> 00:52:50.779
me and it was all organized but this guy from
Amsterdam who runs these sites and his name

00:52:50.779 --> 00:52:57.150
Igor [ph]. Again, you can't make this stuff
up. And Igor--so one of the things they do

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:02.479
is when they have their gatherings, they have
their, kind of, social couples, sex uploading

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:08.329
party gatherings, they wear different wrist
bands, and the wrist band indicates what level

00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:12.760
of involvement you are in the scene. So, if
you are in a certain color of wrist band that

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:18.989
indicates to people that you're good to have
any body part of you taken and put online

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:24.490
including your face 'cause often though, you
know, they get nude and run around. And if

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.450
you have a different color of wrist band,
maybe they can take pictures of you, like

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:34.950
neck down or no pictures at all. So, in many
ways, that to me is, kind of, a microcosm

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:37.980
of where we're going in the society. We're
all going to be wearing these wrist bands

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:42.200
soon. You know, like, "Look, don't--here is
my wrist band. Don't take pictures of me vomiting

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:48.880
in the toilet after this tequila party. Okay.
I'm wearing the purple wrist band." But, of

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:54.940
course, will people respect that. I think
what I've seen is that people really don't

00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:01.779
respect that and that they're out there trolling
to get you at your most vulnerable moment,

00:54:01.779 --> 00:54:06.470
you know, when you are, maybe, drunk or high
and taking off your wizard costume when you

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:15.140
shouldn't be. That's when people want to take
your picture. And I think that's part of our

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:24.319
cultural ethos, that celebrity, you know,
they're kind of, feasting on the weak moments

00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:30.489
of celebrities that is almost spread to the
rest of us or like, following people around,

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:35.709
hoping they'll trip and hurt themselves so
we can video the action. That's not quite

00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:41.509
that bad but it can be on certain circumstances.
Anyway, okay.

00:54:41.509 --> 00:54:52.749
&gt;&gt; FEMALE: Do you talk about the ways that,
kind of, the peep aspect placed into the political

00:54:52.749 --> 00:54:56.329
realm, kind of, like that shooting in San
Jose? I know that brought up a lot of controversy

00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:58.219
'cause everybody caught it from different
angles on their camera that it pretty much

00:54:58.219 --> 00:55:03.710
like had them changed their policy or on shooting
and who was convicted and things like that?

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:07.859
&gt;&gt; NIEDZVIECKI: Oh, absolutely, I mean, you
can't look at the phenomena of peep culture

00:55:07.859 --> 00:55:14.359
without looking at the political ramifications.
There's been all kinds of scenarios in countries

00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:23.400
all over the world where people abusing their
authority have been caught doing things, essentially,

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.220
because of peep culture, because of this desire
to capture all these material. So when you

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:31.880
look at it from that perspective, you'd say,
it's actually, kind of good. It's actually

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.819
a good idea that we're all running around
with our cell phone cameras, because you'll

00:55:35.819 --> 00:55:42.700
never know when you're going to see these
abuses of authority. On the other hand, I

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:48.309
think it's also fair to make the argument
that, you know, for every one time that you

00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:53.359
capture an abuse of authority, the other million
things that are being captured and posted

00:55:53.359 --> 00:56:03.819
online are things that are much more mundane,
and maybe possibly a violation of someone

00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:11.559
else's privacy and their rights to go about
their life without, you know, being posted

00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:15.709
online. So, again, you have to weigh the good
and the bad and you have to decide for yourself.

00:56:15.709 --> 00:56:20.170
Every one has to decide for themselves how
they want to view this. And there's been a

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:24.980
lot of talk about this, the rise of the transparent
society where everything is on camera so every

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:32.400
one is equal. But, I'm not sure that it's
really working out that way so far. Okay,

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.589
thanks very much.
