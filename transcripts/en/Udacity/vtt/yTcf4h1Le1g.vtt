00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.719
So using all of the information we had about

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.830
Kate's family, we should know that fourth answer represents

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.790
the pedigree of lactose intolerance for Kate's family. Remember,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.790
Kate is lactose intolerant, but not her brother. So when

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.320
we look at these five options down here, we

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.910
should be looking for a pedigree that has a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.520
female symbol or circle that's shaded in. Meaning that

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.900
they are affected by lactose intolerance. This pedigree here has

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.930
an unaffected female and an affected brother. So that's

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.630
not what we want. All of the other four pedigrees

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.350
have an affected female with an unaffected brother. So

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.040
now we go up a generation and look at the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.956
parents. We see that, based on information, neither of

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.388
Kate's parents are lactose intolerant. Well if neither of her

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:48.754
parents are lactose intolerant, they shouldn't be shaded at

00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:51.209
all. This one has a shaded parent, so that can't

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.506
be right. And this one has a shaded parent,

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.212
so an affected parent, so that can't be right. Only

00:00:56.212 --> 00:01:00.670
these two pedigrees show parents that are unaffected, unshaded.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.240
And the last piece of information is that the maternal

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.140
grandfather and paternal aunt are intolerant like Kate. So

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.500
we need to find where the mother's grandfather is affected

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.970
which is right here. Over here it's the paternal

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.720
grandfather, right? There's the grandfather but it's on the father's

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.680
side based on the square male symbol.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.660
Although the paternal aunt is preserved in both

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.420
of these pedigrees or you see the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.460
sister of the father here, the unaffected father,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.864
the sister is affected. But because this

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:31.160
is the paternal grandfather and not the maternal

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.232
grandfather, we know that's not right and

00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:35.410
that leaves us with this one pedigree here.
