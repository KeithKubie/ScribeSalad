The visitor pattern is quite powerful and popular however there are some

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.820
issues with it. First off the implementation of the operations are placed in

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.280
a different place from the Elements being operated on.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.250
It means that the operations are kept together. The elements are kept together

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.980
but in a sense encapsulation is compromised because those two are separated.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.910
Second consequence is that adding new operations is straightforward,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.770
you just have new classes on the visitor side of things.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.300
In a sense you are actually extending the operations on a class without changing

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.870
the class itself on the other hand adding new element types is hard.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.400
This would break the data structure and cause a lot of reprogramming.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.510
Final consequences, if you need to, visitors can accumulate state as I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.660
indicated before an example would be collecting statistics.
