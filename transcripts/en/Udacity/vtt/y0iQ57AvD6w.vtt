00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.380
We seemed to have arrived at the moment
of truth for our entrepreneurs.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.610
They've gotta pick a model to implement.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.330
Do you have any suggestions, Ito?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.290
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.460
In many cases,
the choice is pretty clear.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.360
For example,
most games are using a framing model and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640
such, generally using subscriptions.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.150
Both benefits from the trust
they created with their users.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.020
However, there is no
replacement to keep trying and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.020
tuning the models that
fit your special needs.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.710
There are rare cases where
you have enough funding and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740
you wish to focus on growth.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.000
It's totally fine, since the value
of your company is composed

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.220
from the current revenue stream and
the future one.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.360
&gt;&gt; Let's also hear from some other
startups to get their advise on

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.830
choosing a monetization strategy.
