00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.520
[hinges creaking]

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.769
- I WAS WONDERING WHEN
I WOULD COME IN HERE TO FIND YOU

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:39.640
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:43.243
- IT WASN'T EASY
TRACKING YOU DOWN, DECKER.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.346
- WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.348
- I KNOW YOU'VE RETIRED,
BUT--

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.485
- THAT'S ALL BEHIND ME NOW,
GENERAL.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.223
I'M NOT THE MAN YOU KNEW
DURING THE COLD WAR.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:58.158
- I UNDERSTAND.

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:02.529
WE'RE NOW FACING A THREAT UNLIKE
ANY WE'VE EVER FACED BEFORE.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:07.534
A MAN WITH YOUR EXPERTISE--
- I MADE A VOW.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.537
NEVER TO KILL
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.845
SORRY, GENERAL, GONNA
HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.948
- OH...

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.685
NO, WE WEREN'T
THINKING YOU'D DO IT.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.120
WE WERE--[clears throat]
JUST HOPING YOU COULD

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:31.458
RECOMMEND SOMEONE
FOR THE JOB.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.727
- I GUESS I COULD
COME OUT OF RETIREMENT.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.764
- NO. NO NEED.
JUST A RECOMMENDATION WILL DO.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:41.101
- ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.203
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST
NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:46.173
- YOU SLY SON OF A BITCH.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:50.344
YOU ALWAYS KNEW
HOW TO PUSH MY BUTTONS.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:51.612
I'M IN.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.881
- NOT YOU, DECKER.

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:56.850
- I'M SHARP AS I EVER WAS.
- [sighs]

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:59.920
- EVEN FASTER TOO.
GRAB MY HAND.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.625
NOPE. WAIT TILL
I COUNT TO THREE FIRST.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:05.659
- REALLY?

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.160
- ONE.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.195
TWO.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.830
THREE.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.498
OKAY.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.200
I WANT YOU TO TRY
AND SLAP ME IN THE FACE.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.437
UNH! WASN'T READY FOR THAT.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.438
TRY AGAIN.

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:21.542
UNH! OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.510
- NOW WHAT?
- DIDN'T HAVE MY ADRENALINE UP.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.780
'CAUSE THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL
HIGH-STAKES SITUATION.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.449
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.385
DRAW YOUR WEAPON.

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.121
AND...DISARMED.
[gun hammer clicks]

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.129
YOU'RE GETTING PRETTY QUICK
AND DISARMED--OKAY.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.266
I DON'T NEED
TO TAKE YOUR WEAPON.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.102
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHOOT ME.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.338
- I AM NOT
GOING TO SHOOT YOU.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.974
- WING ME IN THE SHOULDER.
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.744
- TRY, GENERAL.
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.580
- [sighs]

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.850
- DEFLECTED--OOOWW!

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:04.852
- OKAY. I MADE
A MISTAKE COMING HERE.

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.054
- WING ME IN THE OTHER SHOULDER.
- I'D RATHER NOT.

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:08.922
- I INSIST.

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:12.759
DEFLECTED--AAAHH!

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.461
THAT WAS BECAUSE MY OTHER ARM
WAS ALREADY INJURED.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.198
- OKAY. I'M LEAVING.
- [grunting] ALL RIGHT.

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.400
ALL OR NOTHING. GUT SHOT.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:22.336
- NO!
- GUT SHOT! COME ON!

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.638
IF YOU CAN SHOOT ME IN THE GUT,
I'LL CONCEDE.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.373
- DECKER, YOU HAVE
TWO WOUNDED ARMS.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.542
- GUT SHOT! GO!

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.945
- GOT IT.
[groans]

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.915
- YOU--YOU CAUGHT THE BULLET?

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.251
- OH, YEAH.
[groans]

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.785
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT THE BULLET

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.822
IS IN BETWEEN
YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.191
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TELLING YOU.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.926
- [sighs]

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.595
[birds chirping]

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.299
- IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:56.103
COME ON.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:59.139
HEAD SHOT.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:00.807
HEAD SHOT.
I'M READY.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.842
ONE SEC THOUGH.
