1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,511
Well,

2
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:05,160
I think the distribution of information
has changed so radically over the last

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,550
couple hundred years and particularly
over the last 20 that you're seeing these

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:13,551
trends now where more people are
inclined to abandon a lot of the,

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:18,810
even if you remain religious or remain,

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,290
you keep a a thought or a belief in a
higher power p people are more inclined to

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,401
entertain these concepts of science and
to take in the understanding of what has

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:37,281
been observed and documented and written
about amongst scholars and academics.

9
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,070
And there's more,
there's more people accepting that.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,090
Have you looked at the number of agnostic
people now as opposed to 2030 years

11
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,640
ago? It's, it's, it's
rising, it's changing.

12
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:52,620
And I think there's also because of you
and because of Neil degrasse Tyson and

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,251
you know,

14
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,130
Sean Carroll and all these other people
that are public intellectuals that are

15
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,270
discussing this kind of stuff,

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,190
people like myself have a far greater
understanding of this then I think people

17
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,970
did 30 40 years ago. Yeah. And
that trend is continuing, I think,

18
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:10,180
in a very good direction. Yeah.
I mean I don't, you know, well,

19
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,800
well we should say is that science,

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,700
we don't know all the emphasis so we
don't know where the laws of nature came

21
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,534
from.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,570
We don't know why the universe began in
the way that it did if avian indeed had

23
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,710
a beginning. So I didn't know why the
Big Bang was very, very highly oded,

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,600
which is ultimately a show on Carol.

25
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:35,670
Actually you mentioned him often
points out you need right that the,

26
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,030
the whole difference, the only difference
between the past and the future,

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,650
the so called Arrow of time is that in
the past the universe was really old at

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,730
and it's getting more disordered
and that's that, that,

29
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:52,590
that necessary state of, of, of
older, at the start of the universe,

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,140
which is really the reason that we exist.

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,130
That's the reason cause the
universe began in a particular form.

32
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,610
We don't know why that was. So we, we,

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,300
we will probably find out at some point
and there'll be something to do with the

34
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,660
laws of nature. But, so I, I'm
always careful. I don't want to,

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,570
as science can sometimes sound arrogant,
right?

36
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,370
It can sometimes sound like it's the,

37
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,110
it's the discipline of saying to people
where you're not, right? Yes. Yeah.

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,690
And it's not the discipline of saying
you are not right it saying this is what

39
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,370
we found out.
Yeah.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,450
So I like to say that it provides a
framework within which if you want to

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,380
philosophize all you want to
do theology or you want to,

42
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,550
you want to ask these deep
questions about why we're here.

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,940
You have to operate within that framework
because it's just an observational

44
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,930
framework. So everything we've
said is stuff we've discovered.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,340
It's not stuff that someone made
up, right? We, we, we, you know,

46
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,490
we understand nuclear physics, we can
build nuclear reactors, for example.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,710
So we understand the physics of styles.

48
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,120
So we understand that the styles built
the carbon and oxygen and we know how

49
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:00,580
they did it. And we can see,
because as I said before, we can,

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,240
if you look far out into the universe,
you're looking way back in time.

51
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,440
And as you look back in time,
you see less carbon and less oxygen.

52
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,150
So we have a direct observation that in
the earliest universe there wasn't any

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,470
cause we can see it the now we see that
there is some and we know how it was

54
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,730
made.
So I think it's so it's important to um,

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,290
be humble when you're talking about
science and you're not saying this is the

56
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,120
way that it is. I mean, you own
it sense, but you know, it's not,

57
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,310
it's not able to answer ultimate questions
at the moment is not able to answer

58
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,120
even whether the universe had a beginning
or not. We don't even know that.

59
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,920
And I gave it salt to,
um,

60
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,130
I was asked to give a talk to some bishops
in the UK about cosmology and I said,

61
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,880
yeah, that'd be great fun. And so
I went and gave him this talk and,

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,440
and at the end I said,
I've got some questions.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,690
So if the universe is eternal and it might
be, it might not have had a beginning.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,790
If it's eternal, what place is there
for a creator? You know, that's,

65
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,210
that's a good question, right?
They didn't, they didn't
have an answer cost, right.

66
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,600
And Eternal Creator. But
yet, but I think that these,

67
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,900
it might be eternal and
we might discover that.

68
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,120
So we don't really know at the moment,
but we might.

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,570
So I think my point is
that these other human uh,

70
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,160
designed to be very natural to religions
and natural thing, right? People you say,

71
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,780
oh, across the world in
all different cultures,

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,890
but I think that in the 21st century,
it,

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
religion needs to operate within
that framework. If it's going,

74
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,020
if it's going to operate,

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,490
there are still great mysteries and it
is appropriate to think about what it

76
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,090
means to be human and are giving you
my view of what it means. But, but he,

77
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,050
I don't think the problem comes when you,
when your,

78
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,500
your theology or your philosophy
forces you to deny some facts,

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,830
some measurement. Now these things
are measurements. We were not saying,

80
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,430
it's not my opinion. The Universe is
13.8 billion years old. We measured it.

81
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,730
It's like having an opinion between
the distance from La to New York.

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,990
Then you can't have an opinion on that.
You know what it is. And it's the same,

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,033
you know,

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,280
slightly know that the things you notice
is the people say the earth's flat or

85
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:19,480
whatever that is. So it isn't,
we've measured it, so it's
just stop it, you know? So,

86
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,860
but that doesn't mean you can't be
spiritual and you can't be really just,

87
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,720
I would saying it doesn't mean you can't
believe in God or gods are a day that's

88
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,800
not ruled out.
