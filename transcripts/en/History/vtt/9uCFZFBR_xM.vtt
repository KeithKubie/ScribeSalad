00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.620
Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.710
It's the dreaded antler chop.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.880
I'm going to take these
beautiful signature blades

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.000
that you did, and
I'm gonna smash

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
them violently and repeatedly
into these extremely

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.120
dense antlers.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.210
I don't really care what
your blades do to the antler.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.120
I want to see what the antler's
going to do to your blades.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.830
It's going to be horrifying,
and I'm going to love it.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.750
Connor, you're up first.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.500
You ready?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.540
Yeah.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.580
Go ahead and try and break it.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.250
Let's see what we can do here.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.830
I addressed the issues that
the judges had with my blade,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.750
other than the heat treatment.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.170
If it's too brittle, then I
could be sending a blade edge

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.750
into somebody's eye.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.670
[chopping]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.580
Nice.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.120
All right, Connor, we've got
a couple little problems here.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960
Big one for me is this
bird's beak on the back end.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.460
It's shaped down so much,
it's metal metal sticking out.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.120
There's no wood on
the sides of it,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.380
and it's ripping into my pinkie.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960
But the big thing
is the chipping.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.620
I mean, this is 4 inches
of area that's chipped out.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.750
But it stayed straight,
it didn't bend,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.460
and it didn't snap.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.290
Good job.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.580
Thank you, sir.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.420
How you feeling, Brian?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.120
I'm feeling great.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.920
Cool.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.580
Ready to do this?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.460
Absolutely.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.080
Antler is a very
hard material, and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.620
after seeing Connor's blade chip
like that, I'm quite nervous.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.670
[chopping]

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.670
All right, Brian.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.960
Obviously we've got chipping
and wrinkled edges here.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.120
Yep.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.170
So there is a
heat treat issue.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.120
OK?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.460
OK.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.420
But it stayed true,
and it didn't break.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.330
So good job.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.000
Thank you.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.580
I appreciate it.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.000
Curtis, you ready?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.170
Go ahead.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.170
Don't act so excited.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170
Go ahead.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.960
Antler is a very,
very hard material.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.290
It may chip the edge, it
may completely destroy it.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.750
Here we go.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.120
[chopping]

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.380
Jay stops, and there's
definitely something wrong.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.380
Four more.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.790
[chopping]

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.210
All right, Curtis, the
first thing I want to say

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.710
is you made a beautiful handle.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.830
There was just enough in here
to fill the palm and index.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.500
I knew where that
edge was every swing,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080
so fantastic job on that.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.540
Thank you.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.750
But we definitely had
an issue in round one

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.000
with the heat treating.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.710
And I mean, you could
tell that you've

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.580
got your forge scale here, which
hides stress fracture there.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.670
So the blade is very brittle.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.420
This breaks my heart when
stuff like this happens.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.330
Well, Curtis, it seems a
flaw from the first round

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.170
has thwarted your efforts
here in this competition.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.540
We can no longer test your blade
due to a catastrophic blade

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.920
failure, and for that
reason, I have to ask

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.710
you to please leave the forge.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.170
Very, very disappointed
that I couldn't move on,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.120
but I'm very proud of the fact
that I was able to complete

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.620
my blade in five hours.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920
I really challenged myself here.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.710
The ball bearing, it
was made of 52100 steel.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.960
I've never used that before,
so it's really tough.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.380
But I really didn't
expect it to break.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.250
I'll go see Mark.
