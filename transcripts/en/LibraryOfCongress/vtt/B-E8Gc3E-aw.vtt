00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.990
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: -- to the last
meeting [inaudible] 2017-2018

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.350
academic year, we ran September,
October, November, February,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.240
March, April in the
academic year.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.410
So, this is going be our
last meeting for this year.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.560
If any of you are not on our
email list and you'd like to be,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.290
talk to myself or Eleanor

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.270
and we keep it [inaudible]
hopefully you don't have

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.350
to deliver it, if you're
interested in doing that.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.250
We'll be working on a schedule
for next year starting on June.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.980
So, if anybody is
interested in talking to us

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.920
or you have suggestions about
something, it might be good

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.070
for us to have and to talk to
us, we are always happy to--

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.660
we're always happy
to hear about that.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.620
When we finish here, we'll
take our speaker Jason Farman

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.960
over to [inaudible]
for dinner and drinks

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:27.720
and everybody is
welcome to come along.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.930
And so it's a good place to
continue the conversation

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.230
and ask questions and so forth.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.530
So Eleanor is going to give
Jason a little bit more

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.710
in-depth introduction.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.010
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: Hi there.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.360
It's our pleasure to
have Jason Farman.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.770
He's an associate professor
at the University of Maryland

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.500
in the Department of
American Studies at--

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.160
in College Park, of course.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.070
He's also the director
of design, culture,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.400
and creativity program
and a faculty member

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.770
with the Human Computer
Interaction Lab,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.280
very productive.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.510
He is the author of the book
"Mobile Interface Theory",

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.530
which won the 2012 Book of
the Year from the Association

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.410
of Internet Researchers.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.790
He's also the editor of the
book "Mobile Story" 2014,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
and "Foundations of
Mobile Media Studies" 2016.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.950
His most recent book has
undergone a retitling

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.440
and it's called "Delayed
Response: The Art of Waiting

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.960
from the Ancient World
to the Instant World."

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.620
Today he will be talking to us
about "Marks of Uncertainty:

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.950
Bodily Traces and Temporality
in Message Exchange".

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.710
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Thank you very much.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.590
So my talk today is going to be
drawn from one of the chapters

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.540
of my book, which is called
"Delayed Response" which will be

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.190
out this fall from Yale
University Press and it's funded

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.530
through the Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.130
So this should be out in
November and this is drawn

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.490
from one of the chapters.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.410
The book is concerned with
the time lag between sending

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.710
and receiving messages.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.070
I'm a digital media scholar
so I'm mostly looking

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.550
at mobile technologies and
I've been very interested

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.480
in tracing the history of
message exchange at time.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.950
We've used our mobile
devices predominantly

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.250
for sending messages.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.570
Since 2009 we've been
using our devices more

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.260
for sending messages and we
have a voice communication.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.680
And the time between sending

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.260
and receiving messages is
really significant time

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.850
of interpretation and it
also shapes our experience

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.150
of duration as a whole.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.350
So throughout the
book, I've gone back

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.390
through seven different eras
and objects of waiting looking

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.970
at how objects of waiting have
transformed the human experience

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.010
of time mostly looking at
how certain technologies

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.840
from message exchange
have shaped that in

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.860
between time of sending
a message.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.250
And waiting in the book is
not simply in between time.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.080
Waiting becomes an
interpretive moment.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.450
Waiting becomes a core part
of the messages themselves.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.590
It's something we interpret
through fear, anxiety, longing,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.800
hope, or even boredom.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.890
So I traced that throughout the
book how waiting becomes this

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.050
really key analytic for
understanding societies

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.000
and how they connect
across geographic distances.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.240
It's also key for
knowledge production as well.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.100
I want to show you some of
the objects study in a set

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.400
at the chapters of the book.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.270
So I begin with text messages

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.750
and I work my way back doing
kind of a media archeology

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.840
of message exchange from our
contemporary moment looking

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.780
at text messages and designs of
waiting like buffering icons,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.580
also how technologies in this
moment throughout history are

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.830
also key for the
development of knowledge

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.560
and knowledge production as we
share ideas across distances

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.810
as we send explorers
out into the unknown.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.000
The chapter focuses on the space
program specifically looking

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.220
at the long delay it takes to
get data from the other end

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.360
of the solar system and how
that shapes what we know.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.890
I look at the pneumatic tube
mailing system in United States

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.210
that began in the late 1890s all
the way to the 1950s and created

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.960
in the country this notion
of the instant messaging,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.130
instant connection as you could
send messages to one another

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.490
within the hour all day long.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.240
And I look specifically

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.640
at New York's pneumatic tube
mailing system for that.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.420
I look at civil war letters and
the exchange of these letters,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.160
how long they took and
shaped the rhythms of the day

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.480
and relationships the soldiers
and families back home had.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.980
I look at medieval wax seals
which I'll talk about today.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.960
And I go back all the way

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.620
to the very first messages
humans ever exchanged

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.820
with one another which were
aboriginal message sticks.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.790
As humans migrated onto
the continent of Australia,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.630
they used this sophisticated
communication system called

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.130
message sticks to
communicate with one another

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.040
about the landscape
and to share knowledge

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.900
as they would migrate
onto this space.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.710
So in January of last
year, I was escorted

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.190
through several sets of alarmed
doors at the National Archives

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:16.200
in Kew in London, back to this
long row or archival boxes.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.370
I was led there by Amanda
Bevan who's the head

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.000
of legal records there and
the lead researcher archivist

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.290
for the HCA Prize Papers.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.460
So HCA is on all
of these boxes here

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.650
since with high court
of admiralty.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.390
And she said-- she let me hear

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.880
and said back before post
offices, if you wanted

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.090
to send a letter to distant
relative or business contact,

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.690
you'd hand it to the nearest
ship's captain that was heading

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.990
in the right direction.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.240
So often in pubs or coffee
houses you have mailbags

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.600
hanging, you would drop your
mail into the bag of the ship

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.110
that was heading in the general
direction of the recipient.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.080
So the HCA letters
represented letters

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.090
that were captured
onboard enemy ships

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.720
that the royal maybe
had captured.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.700
So these were from the mid
1600s to the early 1800s.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.910
Any conflicts that England was

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.020
in as the royal navy
would capture ship,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.670
one of the things plundered
on board would be a mail bag.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.420
And they were saved as evidenced
in the high court of admiralty

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.680
because it was-- there was
major money to be made off

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.070
of the selling of the goods
onboard, but you have to prove

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.370
that it was an enemy ship.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.590
And in order to prove that,
you could use the mail onboard

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.570
as evidence that it wasn't
simple a civilian ship,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.770
it wasn't a ship that
was held by an ally

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.440
or it was an enemy ship.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.130
And so these bags were
stored and they've been kept

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.760
in the archives since then.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.030
And so, represented
in this long row

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.260
of archival boxes are thousands
of letters that never arrived.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.940
And I asked Amanda Bevan,
how many letters are

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.520
in the prize papers which they
call the HCA Prize Papers?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.060
And she said, I think it
would be an underestimate

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.100
to say 150,000.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.250
So you're standing in this long
archival row and it just all

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.780
of the attempts that human
connection and communication

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.730
that are represented there, this
is very powerful moment for me.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.730
So she pulls one of the
boxes down, we go over to one

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.110
of the tables that she and
her team are working at.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.490
This is a picture of her working
with some of the letters.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.080
And they're meticulously opening
these letters, one by one,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.380
marking what's inside.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.910
When I was there, this
was a Dutch letter

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.920
that was opened unsealed,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.920
and inside of it
was a glass bracelet

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.990
that somebody was trying to
send to a distant relative.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.220
And one of the archivists there,
Matt Greenhall, said to me,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.130
"What you have here
is the equivalent

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.310
of an early modern post office
being invaded, essentially."

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.330
Many of these letters were
closed with a wax seal

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:55.340
to keep [inaudible] adhesive
to close them in here.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.760
The letters still have
their seals intact.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.560
The seals represented actually
the failure of communication.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.450
They seals were never broken,
seals were never opened.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.980
And I actually arrived to the
National Archives in London

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.280
to study medieval seals to try

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.680
to understand how a person marks
their identity onto a document

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.970
that leaves them and goes into
these networks of communication

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.060
to try to reach a distant other.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.360
How do you mark your body?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.070
How do you communicate
your identity

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.170
when the networks were
uncertain for a delivery?

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.830
That was my interest in there.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.650
So, seals initially were
used as an adhesive to shut,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.280
a letter that was meant to be
of confidence, a letter close.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.610
So you would have a parchment
rolled up, string wrapped

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.490
around it, wax poured
over the string and marked

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.860
with the sender's matrix.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.730
So it was destroyed
after it was opened

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.980
so very few of those
still exist.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.630
But this practice actually
changed very early onto.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.750
So Edward the Confessor
didn't want his seal

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.580
to be destroyed every
time somebody opened a

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.880
confidential letter.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.380
He wanted the seal
to remain intact,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.710
as evidence of his authorizing
power over the document.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.050
So what he would do is
to create a pendant seal.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.330
So on the parchment you
would have a couple of slits

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.530
where a thin piece of
parchment would be woven through

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.660
and then wax poured
where they met.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.010
So regardless, the
seal remained intact,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.530
as an authorizing object related
to the document for a person

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.300
to connect their identity
with that particular document.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.430
Alternatively, some of the
seals that I worked with,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:36.420
this was Henry I seal from 1115.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.760
They would cut the bottom of the
parchment away and let it dangle

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.150
as sort of this pendant seal

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:50.420
that would hang from
the document.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.310
So the seals here that
I studied and worked

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.960
with represent both the power
and the problem with distance.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.850
There's tremendous power in the
ability for us to send messages

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.970
across vast geographic
distances.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.610
It let us keep in touch
with distant others,

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.870
with business contacts
who were not nearby

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.940
but they also allow us to share
ideas beyond even our lifetime

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.040
or our specific geographies.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.170
But the problem with
documents that are sent are

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.240
that we're not face to
face as we exchange this.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.000
The body is removed from the
active communication here.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.240
So, seals address this problem
by becoming a symbol of the hand

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.650
that stamped it, both
metaphorically and literally.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.350
So, seals often incorporated the
imagery of the person actually

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.770
into the design, the body, the
person represented in the design

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.270
but making the seal impression
also links the human body

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.370
to its intentions
with the document.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.040
So the act of sealing
represented the hand enacting

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.690
that symbol.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.930
There's a saying from the
English King Alfred the Great

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.280
in the 9th century.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.100
"Consider now, if your lord's
letter and his seal came to you,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.230
whether you could say that
you could not recognize him

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.530
by this means."

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.300
So seals are instantly
recognizably even

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.550
by the illiterate within a
culture so many have argued

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.260
that there actually this
bridge object between literate

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.560
and illiterate culture

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.810
as documents begin circulating
largely within the everyday life

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.330
of common people, for the
illiterate, the seals serve

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.520
as this bridge to documents

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.210
that begin becoming a
part of everyday life.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.880
So kings and queens had great
seals that were double-sided.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.540
So on one side it's often
showing the sovereign

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.270
and some sort of military
power riding on a horse,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.020
very powerful, a
knightly kind of figure.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.660
And then on the other side
typically showed them sitting

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.840
on the throne in power,
holding a staff and orb.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.530
And these are massive in size.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.870
So this is King Henry VIII great
seal, which is-- that's my hand.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.820
I was-- So all of
these, you know,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.070
you must taken this entire
talk is within the context

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.460
of me being a digital media
scholar, sitting there looking

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.960
at this going, what in the
world, this is massive,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.240
holding Queen Elizabeth
I great seal.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.220
These are huge, the amount
of wax that they take as sort

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:29.130
of a mixture of beeswax
and resin to make these.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.100
So this kind of seal, for
example, you have the obverse

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.290
and the reverse of
it are pressed

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.750
with a mechanism that's a little
bit similar to printing press

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:43.610
that puts both impressions-- the
impressions on both sides of it.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.360
So the uncertainties
of geography

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.840
of message exchange require
verification of bodies

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.810
that aren't there and
some kind of symbol

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.500
that attaches the
body, links the body

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.630
with the documents
in some kind of way.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.600
So the seals on the HCA Prize
Papers that I've first mentioned

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.590
and even these highlight
the uncertainty

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.770
of long distance communications
as documents begins being center

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.730
around the world in abundance.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.980
So before post offices or
international infrastructures

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.920
in place for message delivery,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.650
you had essentially a creative
combination of commerce,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.660
transportation, and
ad-hoc messengers

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.200
that would get these
messages delivered.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.460
So these create a social network
founded on uncertainty and also

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.090
and even expectations for reply.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.870
In today's culture, we have
reciprocity and feedback design

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.660
into the very systems
that we used.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.220
So a text message that you might
send will often say delivered

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.690
or read, attached to it,
which becomes instant feedback

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.050
that message delivery
has been successful.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.990
And it creates this back
and forth, the reciprocity

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.570
that links us with the
people in our lives.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.020
However, when the
infrastructures

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.870
and pathways ships mailbags

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.930
and trade routes made a
reply uncertain, I'm--

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.650
my driving question is how does
that change how we communicate?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.950
How does that change
how we write?

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.160
How does that change our
relationship to documents

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.130
when a response might
never come, when our delays

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.630
for reciprocity might
be infinite?

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.860
The rise of a literate
public and the exchange

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.940
of documents really require the
available tools for writing,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.830
literacy, methods of
exchange for these messages,

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.640
and also really require massive
cultural shifts, I think,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.790
which are very familiar to this
group, you know I'm thinking

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.310
of Michael Clanchy saying,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:40.210
the documents did not initially
inspired trust and memory

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.820
to written record where oral
testimony is well established

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.810
and it's easier to cross
examine somebody than it is

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.670
to trace the provenance
of a document.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.510
But the power of documents
eventually overwhelmed these

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.060
by seas where documents
allow the letter writer to be

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.250
in multiple geographies also

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.330
across multiple times
beyond your own life,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.940
yet things like plague
and war, seizure of mail

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.530
from these ships create
uncertainty for the networks.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:17.270
So there are political and
cultural contacts which shaped

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.650
and influenced the speed
of message delivery,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:22.000
how quickly a message
can deliver--

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.560
it really is impacted
by the context of it.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.230
So these are never
neutral pathways.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.960
There's instead the speed of
message exchange is influenced

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.780
by a sociopolitical landscape
or the events at the time.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.720
And I think this
applies even to our own

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.810
as we're discussing net
neutrality as we're thinking

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.050
about the speed at which we
can exchange messages and data

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.030
across that network is
very much influenced

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.030
by our sociopolitical
moment and whether

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:52.350
or not we will regulated
message exchange.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.710
And seals were one way that
letter writers were able

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.140
to exert influence
across distances

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.380
when they couldn't
be there face to face

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.900
when your body is
removed from message.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.420
How do you, as someone
in the position of power,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.490
exert that power when your body
is not there, with seals attempt

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.920
to communicate that
power in a visual way.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.420
And so the very first centuries
of sealing in Britain--

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.570
and this is all in a British
context that I'm discussing--

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.600
seals were marks of power and
used by those with status alone.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.150
So King Henry the II's chief
justice Richard de Lucy said,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.540
"It was not formerly the
custom for every petty knight

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.880
to have a seal, which
benefits only kings

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.470
and important people."

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.850
So to have a matrix for a seal
meant that you are literate,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.300
meant that you either were
in business or politics,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.650
that you understood the
complexity of documents.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.580
So just having a seal in

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.570
and of itself represented
a certain level

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.870
of status within the society.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:55.790
It communicated the
importance of the person.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.240
And thus, when you-- when
a document arrived to you

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.840
with a seal, which
is recognizable

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.780
and a response is expected
for that particular document,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.590
a delay should not--
response should be delayed.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:13.000
So urgency was a
key part of that.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.380
So how seals exerted
their power--

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.700
the power of their
owners as they went

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.620
out was especially
important to women with seals,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.530
who in a medieval context

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.500
for example didn't
necessarily carry power

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.790
but could exert a tremendous
influence over society.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.090
And I went to look at
some of the seals of women

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.060
in the medieval period at
the Society of Antiquaries

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.880
of London, Burlington House.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.120
And I was here with
a scholar of seals,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.310
a sigillographer named
Elizabeth Danbury and she went

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.640
over to these long thin
drawers and pulled them out.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.530
This is the archive of
seals that the Society

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.320
of Antiquaries has
been collecting

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.390
over the last 100 years or so.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.280
And many of the women's
seals that we looked at draft

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.000
on the status of the
men in their lives

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.600
to communicate their
power, their own status,

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.660
their own right to
a certain level

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.770
of status within the society.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.620
So there's iconography
drawn from husbands or sons

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.720
or fathers within them.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.520
And this contrasted
interestingly Empress Matilda's

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.640
who was a 12th century
claimant to the throne who--

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.730
her grave site for example
says great by birth,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.390
greater by marriage,
greatest in her offspring,

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.880
here lies daughter, wife
and mother of Henry.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.390
Her seals, however, don't ever
use any of the men in her life

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.310
to communicate in
any kind of status.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.430
She's holding an orb and a
staff and here is her great seal

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:53.140
that I study while
at the archives.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.650
In order to study the seal,
it was an interesting process

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.420
that you have to study it
in their invigilation room.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.050
So, there-- what's fascinating
about the national archives,

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.240
especially working with the
archives here in DC in contrast,

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.620
if you're over 60, you
got a reader's card

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.280
and you get the whole medieval
seals in your hand, you know?

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.490
They bring them out to
your reader's table.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.230
Some of them, they were marked
as being able to only be seen

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.550
in the invigilation room
which are their best specimens

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.330
or perhaps the only
remaining specimen.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.810
And this one is Empress
Matilda's great seal,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.400
one of the only remaining ones.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.970
So you know, they check
your bags and you get buzzed

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.710
into this locked
room, you sit down,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.710
their surveillance camera is
all around you, and they bring

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.190
out the box with this object.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.310
And for me, it was-- I
have studied the seal

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.560
and so did others through
books and digitized forms.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.730
I took the seal out
and I flipped it over.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.490
There are no-- There's no
photographs or digitization

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.400
of the reverse of these seals,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.810
unless there's some kind
of impression on it.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.550
And there were all these
fingerprints on the back,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.000
which were made at the time of
impression when the wax is hot.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.240
And there-- it was fascinating

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.250
to trace how the body
interacting with these seals.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.130
And sometimes intentional ways

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.830
and sometimes unintentional
ways,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.730
like the fingerprints
on the back.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.220
There's sigillographers now
doing some really interesting

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.800
forensic studies on
the fingerprints.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.050
We were actually the people
that are sealing these things

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.640
of the fingerprints
common across.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.280
So for me, the-- I began
looking for this in these ways,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.720
you know, what can't I get
through digitize means,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.220
what's missing from a lot of
the documentation of these seals

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.230
and it's the marks of
the body on these seals

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.180
that I found fascinating.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.480
It traces it back to--

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.570
in one sense, William
the Conqueror said

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.230
that he would seal the document
with his fang tooth, you know?

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.210
He would mark it-- instead
of using a matrix, I bite it,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.580
you know, I bite it
and that's my mark.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.180
So the marks of the body, you
know, go back to very early

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.860
on when it was really important
for us to imagine the seals

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.080
as how connecting to the
physical body of the person.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.480
And many of the seals
that I was working

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.940
with have these knuckle marks
of deep fingerprints in the back

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.950
of the seal as a
mark of the body.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.610
And these to me capture-- what
interest me about the seals is

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.070
that in what they're
meant to symbolize.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.580
They symbolize the presence
at the document of the body

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.960
of the person sending
the message.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.570
So when uncertainty of
message exchange is present,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.990
what you have often is a removal
of non-verbal cues, eye contact,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.690
of gesture, sort of physicality.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.730
So how do you mark your body
when the body is removed

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.030
from that interaction?

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.520
So seals communicate authority,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.240
physical embodied
authority going out--

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.410
my body is not with you so I
send this mark in its stead.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.910
So the seal is a mechanical
reproduction, though,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:16.150
which as someone who studies
media is an interesting thing

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.730
where mechanical reproduction
creates what Walter [inaudible]

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.710
has talked about as sort of
this troubled relationship

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.310
over the aura of the object
or that the significance

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:31.060
of an object that gives it
its power and its rarity.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.000
And this was understood within
this context throughout sealing

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.150
and sealing practices in
Britain, there was an--

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.580
a troubled relationship between
this idea of reproducibility

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.880
and someone's identity.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.240
Especially as the bureaucracy
moved along, kings and queens

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.100
at some points rarely
impress their own seals,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.370
they didn't use their own hand
to do it, they had people to do

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.790
that for them and the
seal matrix gets further

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.410
and further away from the
body of the sovereign.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.810
And then you have
the introduction

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.990
of signet ring seals, which are
worn by the person at all times.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.240
It's a way of connecting
that to the body.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.540
It doesn't leave the body.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.640
It's not used by other people.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.040
So, there's a-- within
this context,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.100
also at early Christian context,
around the active impression

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.630
that I find fascinating where
within the Christian ideology,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.970
we are made in the image of God,

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.130
and the active impression
is similarly a godlike act

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.980
of creation of impressing
yourself onto the document.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.110
So you're connecting,
you're making in the image

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.850
of especially quite literally
sometimes where your body is

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:46.630
on that matrix, you are
making your identity impressed

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.220
into the wax the same way
we are made in the image of.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:57.040
Miriam Bedos-Rezak, who is a
scholar of seals at NYU told me

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.350
that documents-- there's
always been a relationship

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.500
between identity
and reproducibility.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.590
For us, our signatures
are recognizable

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.640
because we do them
over and over again.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.980
They're not identical
but they are recognizable

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.890
in the reproducibility.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:20.860
And for documents, they are seen
as authentic because in a sense

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.880
because of this reproducibility.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.770
For Bedos-Rezak, she says
reproducibility is the condition

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.320
of authenticity.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.390
So as we send out
word to distant others

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.300
and these delivery routes
move from precarious

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.920
to less precarious, there are
wait times for the delivery

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.740
of messages that are slow
either because of interception

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.540
like the HCA Price Papers or
the document will come to you

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.640
and have been-- it's
either accepted completely

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.170
or it arrives to you
with a broken seal

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.550
that is a visual mark

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.350
that a letter close
has been intercepted

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.520
and can no longer be
trusted as private

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.540
or changed along those lines.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.190
So, concerns about privacy
and how that term changes

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.780
across history and within
its particular moments are

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.010
characteristics of
these uncertain networks

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.310
of message exchange.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.420
So there's a middle ground that
deliver it out and fascinated

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.250
in throughout the book.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.330
And part of what this-- happens

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.060
in this middle ground is
what I call surveillance

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.670
from the middle, where it's
intercepted in some ways

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.850
and either the message is
lost or the message comes

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:42.390
with visual cues that somehow
it has been intercepted

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.010
during transit.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.950
So I came across a really
interesting example of this

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.590
as I was working in wartime
correspondents out at

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.960
in Orange County,
California, there's a Center

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.260
for American War Letters.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.760
And one of the letters I-- sets
of letters that I was working

00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.960
with was from a cadet from World
War I who is stationed in France

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.010
and he would-- his
name is Walter Boadway

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.160
and he would write a ton
of letters back to his wife

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.970
in Pasadena, California.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.930
And the letter started arriving
with these strange holes in them

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.600
and she would write back to him

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:19.270
that your letters are being cut
apart, sometimes huge sections

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.570
of them just cut away.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.730
So these weren't military
sensors that were blocking

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.490
out sensitive words, they
were taking razors or scissors

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.600
and cutting out complete
sections of his letters back

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.050
to his wife, taking out any
sort of classified information.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.750
And Walter Boadway didn't quite
know what classified meant

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.660
because it was changing
from moment to moment.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.090
So at one point, he
couldn't talk about what kind

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.710
of plane he flew, so
that was taken out,

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.060
cut out of the letters.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.930
At other points, he
was no longer allowed

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.230
to date-mark his letters.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.800
So instead of November 11, 1917,
he just had to write Sunday.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.070
So he used both sides
of the letters here

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.580
as he would communicate
with his wife back home.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.000
And then as these
words or sentences

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.860
or paragraphs were
literally erased or taken

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.060
out from the material, pieces
of paper, that practice

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.440
of interception was revealed.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.860
So for Boadway he knew a sensor
was going to read his letters.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.920
You just know that
that's the pathway.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.700
However for Betty, his wife,
these physical transformations

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:29.150
to the paper evidence of the
flow communication, from Walter,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.300
to sensor, to her in
Pasadena, California.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.510
So the system of
interception is revealed

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.850
and perhaps ways analogous

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.650
to a seal being broken
on the letter close.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.040
So when people become
aware of the consequences

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.650
of these interceptions,
they engage in tactics

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.000
to avoid these consequences.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.950
So Boadway at first just
tries changing what he writes.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.200
I'm going to-- I will try to
avoid classified discussions.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.500
I'll keep it everyday.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.480
But it still, he ended up having
his letters cut to pieces.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.660
So eventually he's like, I
have to write on one side

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.530
of the sheet of paper because
otherwise, it's going to get cut

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.890
out and on the reverse
it's going to--

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.620
she won't be able to read what's
on the other side of the paper.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.430
So you absorbed the cost of
sending more sheets of paper

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.540
because he wasn't quite sure how

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.680
to avoid surveillance
from the middle.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.360
And he knew about this
through reciprocity,

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.190
through his wife writing
back to him, and say,

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.150
your letter came in
shreds, you know?

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.630
I could not even read
the last thing you wrote,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.150
this entire section was cut out.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.190
So reciprocity is one of
those ways, historically,

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.420
we've known that
our letter arrived.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.360
We get word back.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.480
We get some kind of confirmation

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.920
that it was delivered
successfully.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.310
And in Civil War letters-- I
have a chapter that focuses

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.630
on Civil War letters
exclusively.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.630
And like many times, people--
you know, the genre dictated

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.810
that you began your letter
with some kind of time,

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.110
narrative time stamp

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.450
like I received your letter
September 22nd yesterday.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:04.190
Or like this letter which
is a little hard to read

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.690
but he writes, "The
last letter you wrote

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.990
to me did not reach here

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.940
until yesterday owing
to being missent."

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.280
So time stamping it, you are
probably expecting a response

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.070
to that letter, it didn't
arrive until yesterday

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:20.250
and he's got a date
mark on his letter.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.360
The soldier that I focused

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.090
on most is Joseph
Choreal [assumed spelling]

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.620
who was a part of the 24th
Michigan who left DeWitt,

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.250
Michigan to come out here
to the DC area to fight

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.550
with the Army of the Potomac.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.560
And he writes to his wife
in this letter, you know,

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.600
I've been gone for over a month
and I still haven't had any word

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.280
from home, there's
been no letters.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.840
I don't know if you're
getting my letters.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.380
Please just write often
so that hopefully some

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.680
of them will arrive.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.980
Some of them will get through.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.580
Because again, that
network of message exchange

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.720
in this era especially,
is so fascinating

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.130
because you're having those
moments starting in 1847

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.430
with the introduction of
postage stamps and sort

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.190
of standardized postage systems,
you have people writing in mass.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.900
So here is the first
American conflict

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.760
where people are writing
at an unprecedented level

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.090
and the networks for message
delivery are precarious,

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.500
unknown, they get letters get
stolen all the time especially

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.450
trying to find money
within those letters.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.590
So he says, please just
write often, hopefully some

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.400
of them will get through.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:24.400
And within the context of the
book and my focus on time,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.180
it's been interesting to trace
how some people can actually

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.570
withhold their response
as a power maneuver.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.990
And this is true
throughout history.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:37.120
We still do this today where
you can make somebody wait

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.190
for a response a little bit
longer as a way of, you know,

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.250
exerting your own power
within that relationship

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.550
and that power dynamic.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:50.630
And an interesting example
came in July 13th of 1533

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:55.080
when a letter arrived to
Pope Clement VII asking him

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.960
to grant dispensation to
annul Henry VIII marriage

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.260
to Catherine of Aragon.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.150
So on that document, there are
81 pendant seals attached to it

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.370
of the lords and archbishops
who authorized the document.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:15.840
And these were-- these seals
were essentially a visual

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.800
communication of their
authority to the pope to say

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.820
if you don't do this, we
will find means elsewhere.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.410
So, it was sent to
the pope, Henry waited

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.300
for a response and
the pope delayed.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.600
The pope decided to wait.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.900
He is going to wait it out.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.340
He communicated his
power in that situation

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.110
to Henry VIII by waiting.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.460
He was using it as a tactic
to emphasize his own power,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.190
however that strategy
infuriated Henry VIII

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.440
who felt he was too
powerful to wait any longer

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.970
and then he had an active
parliament advertised

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.890
to Roman Catholic Church and
install him as the supreme head

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.420
of the Church of England.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.380
Tactics of delay
cause uncertainty

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.980
in our own era as well.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.620
So you can imagine similar sort
of power maneuvers and tactics

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.040
that carry out across
history and different moments,

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.680
how people use delays
and wait time

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.290
to exert power or influence.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.990
And in the digital age,
this is true as well.

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.170
Again, going back to those
text messages that are marked

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.740
as read, they are
verified to the sender

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.480
and it provides a correspondent
with immediate feedback,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.170
your message has been delivered.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.720
And once it has been
read, like here,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.660
the feedback that's
given then is

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.980
that there should
be a quick response.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.930
And if there isn't a quick
response, people are left

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.490
to interpret that silence
and we do in many ways,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.860
it shapes our interpersonal
interactions with another

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.420
and becomes an interpretative
moment of trying

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.060
to understand the relationship
and the power dynamics

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.560
within that relationship.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.810
In Japan, most of the
population within the country,

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:57.120
95% of them use a
messaging app called Line.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.670
And this is a Line
screenshot right there.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.820
And within Line, every message

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.830
that is sent comes
with a re-received.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.130
You can't turn it off.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.460
So everybody who's back
and forth with each other

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.000
on their phones, when the
message pops up and is read

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.010
by the person, it marks it read.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.310
You can't turn it off.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.610
You can't.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.030
Within the United States, a
lot of us use iMessage which is

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.380
over here, you know, you
have delivered and read.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.740
But a lot of people
turn this off.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.530
So you don't want
people to necessarily see

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.830
when you read the message.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:32.830
In Japan, there's no
option, everybody knows

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.130
when their messages
has been read.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.570
So I met with the executives
and designers at Line in Tokyo

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.470
in their Shinjuku offices
to talk about this.

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.890
And one of the key aims for
them was that this app was built

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:49.920
in the aftermath of the
Tohoku 9.1 earthquake.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.250
When people are trying
to send messages

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.530
to each other connect
right after the earthquake,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.700
message infrastructures
were down and slow

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.860
and people weren't sure if their
messages were getting through.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.440
So they said we're
going to build an app

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.830
that lets people know as soon
as the message has been read.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.720
And that is enough, you know,

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.710
just to have your message marked
read, I know you're there,

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.960
I know you got it, you
may not be able to respond

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.670
but that feedback is
enough for me to know

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.530
that the message has been
successfully delivered.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.500
It's read, it's a
different kind of feedback

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.120
and reciprocity there.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.250
And what's emerged
out of that, however,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.630
is really interesting two terms

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.280
in Japanese kidoku-through
and miduko-through.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.310
So ki means already, and doku
means read and then they borrow

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.610
from the English word through.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.490
So kidoku-through is a message

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.120
that is already been
read through.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:42.190
Midoku-through, mi means not yet
so midoku-through is a message

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.550
that has not been
marked as read.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.020
And with the Japanese college
students that I talked to,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.550
this shapes their experience
of time in extraordinary ways.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.910
So if a message is marked
kidoku-through, you've read it

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.770
and you don't respond to
me in a timely manner,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.930
that is either seen as a
sign of disrespect or again,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.370
going to back to
that power maneuver,

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.540
I'm withholding a
response to reiterate

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.890
that my time is more
valuable than yours

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.290
and you can wait for it.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:16.180
So, waiting is-- for
messages, is often a result

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.810
to these geographic distances
when people are far apart

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.110
from each other and on-- the
only motive communication

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.500
that they have require
significant wait times

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.140
or within that, wait times due

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.260
to this distance will often
efface the bodies of the people

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.490
who are communicating
unless there's some kind

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.460
of visual marker
that attach that.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.680
So seals, reinsert the
body into those exchanges.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.410
They mark and authenticate
documents

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.500
when people can't
be there together.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.820
And in the digital age, we
require similar authentication

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.910
in an era where much of our
exchanges are based on messages.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.230
Again, we use our mobile
devices more for messages

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.550
and voice communication.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.970
We're using email, we
exchange documents.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.340
So the digital ages, is one
where we privilege messages

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.600
and those messages continue to
require proof of authenticity.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.130
So we have passwords, we
have two-step authentication,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.400
we memorize pass codes to unlock
our mobile devices or even now

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.910
with facial recognition
where you look at it

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.650
and your body actually
unlocks the phone,

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.470
or with your thumbprint, my
thumbprint unlocks my phone,

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.250
so your body as a means of
authenticating who you are

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:30.410
to allow you to send
the message.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.980
And seals haven't disappeared
altogether within society.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.820
In fact they're widely used
still today around the world.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:42.830
In United States, we-- each
state has its own seal,

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:46.210
we use them to authenticate
legal documents, official pieces

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.440
of legislation, cultural
institutions,

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.000
universities have seals,
there's an interesting story,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.100
Victor Mair who's a professor of
Chinese Language and Literature

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:02.340
at University of Pennsylvania
was working with a director

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.220
of an archeological institute
in China and they were going

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.040
to transfer some artifacts
to him so he could use them

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.550
in his studies, he could
carbon-date them, but in order

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:15.860
to carbon-date them, he had to
have a document that authorize

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.460
and told people these artifacts
now belong to Victor Mair.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.840
So the director

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.990
of the archeological institute
said we've just undergone a

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.770
renaming and a reorganization
and we're still waiting

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.850
on our seal so I can't send you
document until our seal comes in

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.320
and the seal kept getting
delayed and delayed

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.950
and then eventually,
Professor Mair said,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.960
I can't wait any longer, can you
please just send authorization

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.260
with your signature?

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.560
And the director
laughed and said

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.860
that such a document
would be worthless.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.820
And he finally acquiesce
and sent the document

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.240
with his signature and was
absolutely surprised and stunned

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.010
to see that that was accepted
and that was actually just

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:55.990
as valuable as having a seal
on that particular document.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.410
And seals are very common in
Asian countries and are used

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.650
by most citizens
to sign their names

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.170
on government documents as well.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.550
So every person I spoke within
Japan carries their own seal

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.830
with them, called hanko or
more formal version, inkan.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.700
So the seal is carried on
you at all times and it's--

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.140
you sign every document with
it using ink instead of wax.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.190
You'll have five different hanko

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.480
within your lifetime,
for example.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.780
And if you're in
particular lines of business,

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.580
you might have to carry
three on you at a given time,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.890
so the practice started in the
country in the 1870s with rise

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.650
in and bureaucracy and
the need for people

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.360
to authenticate things.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.930
And then what should now
be a familiar trajectory,

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.170
people in power had
them initially

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.300
and now they can be bought
and in the neighborhood shop

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.430
as seen in this picture here.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.930
So there is a long lineage of
authentication that's been born

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.160
out of the way times and
geographies of communication.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.530
So those wait times in
geographies [inaudible].

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.260
We continue to create
modes of linking our bodies

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.560
to our messages, finding
ways to connect our bodies

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.290
across these distances as we
send messages across them.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.310
So wait times makes as
communicate differently,

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.120
how they shape the
way we communicate,

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.200
they shape the way we
interpret messages and we seek

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.740
to create messages adapted
to these particular networks

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.370
and the times of those networks

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.880
and the expectations
of response.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.390
And the possibility
of interception

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.870
at a message might not arrive.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.160
So waiting for me is this really
interesting and important lens

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.100
to understand different
societies

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.310
and their message technologies.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.160
So how they connected, how they
define things like intimacy

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.770
and connectivity, the
local, their geographies,

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:47.430
but also ultimately how waiting
and has been a silent force

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.780
that shapes these societies
at each ear as a technology

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.070
through sharing messages
shape the human experience

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.370
at the time.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.170
Thank you.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.360
[ Applause ]

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:07.510
&gt;&gt; We have time for
questions and discussion.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.810
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:13.090
&gt;&gt; Well, my area of expertise
is slightly different area

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.200
but I just want

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.880
to add [inaudible] the
question I've written my book is

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.180
Anthony [inaudible].

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.040
And he was a postman
for 37 years.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.370
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Nice.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.600
&gt;&gt; And in his novel
[inaudible] he uses letters.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.900
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.340
&gt;&gt; And he has particular
epistolary situations

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.320
and he makes great--
and unlike other people

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.020
who have [inaudible], he tells
you how the letter got there.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.320
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.750
&gt;&gt; And what could happen is
it's very-- yes, the wait time,

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.850
I'll just give one example
[inaudible] Frank goes to London

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.400
and Mary doesn't know
if he still loves her.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.700
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.150
&gt;&gt; He writes her a letter but
the letter doesn't get to her

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.450
and is left in the post office

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.750
because she doesn't
have the power

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.380
to have a [inaudible]
to pick it up.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.500
Meanwhile she can write
a letter and if it goes

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.260
to the other house, somebody
in the house will take

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.970
that letter to London.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.530
Meanwhile she suffers terribly

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.830
and she goes and
she's, you know--

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.130
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Exactly.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:05.200
&gt;&gt; -- it is all bout power who
can hold the letter [inaudible].

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.800
The pillar box is
a great [inaudible]

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.710
because then you could sneak out
the house and you could put--

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.160
and nobody-- once the letter is

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.840
in the pillar, you
can't take it.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.180
So [inaudible] uses this over
and over again just waiting,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.620
how the letter got
there, when it arrived,

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.510
what point in time it arrived.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.690
&gt;&gt; I was very struck by
the [inaudible] seals

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.310
that you have to stamp it.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.180
And of course, this
time the NP has a seal,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.070
to [inaudible] letter,
so the letter can go.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.110
But by [inaudible] time,
become more egalitarian.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.410
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.710
That's what drew me to this.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.710
And you see this over and
over again in literature,

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:49.100
in stories where, you know,
certain narrative plots play

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.830
out because of delays
or lost letters,

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.010
lost messages that get sent.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.350
And for my own work, within
my field of mobile technology,

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:01.700
we predominantly focused on
the words we have exchanged,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.070
the content, the
images, the videos,

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.450
and a few people have talked
about the infrastructures

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:12.020
that make that possible and
that temporality of that,

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.540
that's a part of that.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.180
So I think to understand
the documents,

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.060
it's been interesting working
with the sigillographers

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.030
in this sense because there's
been sort of this divide

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.740
between people who study
the document and people

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.330
who study the seals and they--
only within, I guess you know,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.780
the past several years that they
brought them together to think

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.990
of them as this whole, and
especially to think of them

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.320
within the larger
networks, infrastructures

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.150
that allow the delivery of
these things as being central

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.030
to understanding the
message in and of itself.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.150
And I think that that's
a really great example.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.700
And how generals play out

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.000
and how different
people are expected

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.890
to wait differently is also
very fascinating like, you know,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:55.880
the-- and I think this endures
as well who's expecting to wait

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:01.030
for a message and how that plays
out certain gender stereotypes

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.940
of waiting, who's allowed to
not wait, yeah, it's all, to me,

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:10.270
this really fascinating
lens on different societies

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:14.810
that I think opens up some of
the questions that definitely

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.740
in the field of media studies
have been asked enough.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.040
&gt;&gt; Just [inaudible].

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.300
&gt;&gt; What is that that Facebook
is undergoing such scrutiny?

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.160
But the original Facebook--
because years ago my husband was

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.850
on Facebook early on
when it first came on,

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.250
is his great innovation was
to have somebody's face.

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:37.380
At the early run, you didn't
put cat, you put your face.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:41.670
And the other one is that a new
group opened up to replace Yahoo

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.440
which doesn't work
very well [inaudible].

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.330
And I moved three groups
around that and the big thing

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.650
about that is instant
movement because no way

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.810
that everything comes quickly

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.690
and there's three different
lists where you can go and say,

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.350
oh, the message didn't
come and you can get help

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.810
to make sure it came, all about
delivery, speed [inaudible].

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:05.110
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.330
It's been really interesting
to trace the notion

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.600
of the instantaneous
across these eras,

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.230
especially from the nomadic
era where people were enchanted

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:19.170
with the speed of the technology
and it felt like you were living

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.060
in the modern moment,
you know, where--

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.990
because when the pneumatic
tube system first began,

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.640
you had mail delivery
through wagons and horses

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.990
in New York, for example.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.260
So all of a sudden,
you've got this, you know,

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.920
this hums of these canisters
flying under the city streets

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.690
of 30 miles an hour,
delivering mail, you know,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.710
to you within an hour, and
it could go all day long

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.010
where you can just
send messages,

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.750
and all of a sudden we're living
in this modern moment and sort

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.410
of tracing the promise of ever
accelerating means of connecting

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:50.900
with each other back
through history as we try

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.150
to really reduce the speed
so we can connect in faster

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:57.620
and faster ways imagining
that that might bridge the gap

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.950
of geography in a
sense, you know?

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.380
In that book, I ultimately
argue I'll always be waiting,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.170
you know, we'll never
close that gap.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:09.400
And actually the promise of the
instant is more of an allure

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.150
to connect us with
particular kinds of and future

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.180
and to truly understand
why we'll always actually

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.480
send messages.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.660
We'll always send messages
that can be responded

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.650
to whenever people get a chance,

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:26.230
rather than these synchronous
moments of communication.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.220
So waiting is often this-- it's
simultaneously, it's something

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.430
that needs to be
eliminated from society

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:36.390
because we think it's holding
us back from the things we want

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.760
or that relationships we want.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.950
It's also this opportunity
for companies to kind

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.900
of pitch something that's going

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.620
to be the next technology that's
going to bridge us instantly.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.630
It's more on mythology
than anything.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.900
I think we'll be waiting
forever so we don't have

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.100
to imagine what that means.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really
interesting.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:58.530
Thank you.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.570
So we have a bunch of
different questions for the--

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.540
I just wanted to kind of
share like looking at kind

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.990
of from an archival
perspective is very interested

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.130
in how you kind of bring into
a sense of body and embodiment

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:14.060
and how these messages are
constructed particularly

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.000
and then [inaudible] messages
you can see everything

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.500
because a lot of the attention
there is on diplomatic

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.020
and not necessarily
these sort of extra--

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:31.270
well, not extra but
integral parts [inaudible].

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:32.570
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes, exactly.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.870
Yeah.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.170
&gt;&gt; So it's-- I was really
fascinated on how you're kind

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:36.610
of bringing in that
sense of identity.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:37.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Great.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:40.170
&gt;&gt; And I'm kind of interested
if you can say something more

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.720
about personalization to sort

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.430
of what we're seeing
now with messages.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:48.610
But there's also this comment
that I just wanted to share

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.190
and thinking about like, what
we are sort of seeing now

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.050
with the ambiguity of messaging,
I think, versus [inaudible].

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.040
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Yeah, right, right.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.620
&gt;&gt; Using email-- I mean
these sorts of technologies,

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.150
the internet technologies
are not necessarily designed

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:06.660
with [inaudible] line, they're
designed to ensure sending.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.960
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Right.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.740
&gt;&gt; And so, I had this experience
using email where you get people

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.390
that want [inaudible]
receipts which is something

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.860
that some system
support now and I feel

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.440
like it's a kind of aggressive.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.740
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.090
&gt;&gt; It's [inaudible] that you're
ignore the message [inaudible].

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:27.680
So I was interested to
know if you kind of explore

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.190
that [inaudible] as well.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.570
But I'm kind of more
curious about personalization

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:33.040
of these little things.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah,
yeah, definitely.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.470
I guess to begin
with, the email thing.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.310
Yeah, when I have
described lines,

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.670
requirement of a read
receipt to college students

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:45.240
in the United States, I freak
out, like, oh, that is invasive,

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.400
you know, because it does
then set a certain burden

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.730
of expectation on relationships.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.890
So as we interface
with technologies,

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:58.260
the speed of communication
is built to have experience.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.320
So as you, you know,
look across eras,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.210
we set our expectations based
on our experience with this.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.350
So we send the message,
the time it takes

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.060
to come back sets a standard

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.460
and then we begin
shaping our temporalities

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.470
around that rhythm.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.290
So this is through
read receipts as well.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.760
So based on a particular
relationship,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.240
that read receipt would have
certain expectations, you know,

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.500
sending a text to your mother
versus your significant other,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.570
you have different sort
of temporal expectations.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:34.680
I remember when I was in
college as an undergrad

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.160
and got my first email address.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.610
The emails came as you
would send something,

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:45.460
it kind of had a little piece of
code that it was attached to it

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.130
that when the message is
open, I got responses to that.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.830
And this was I think
maybe a part

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.940
of my colleges email
system at the time.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.440
But for me as a first
time sort of email user,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.330
this sets standards for
expectations on replies.

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.520
And I think that people
want to be able to shape

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.380
that a little bit to their
context and to their moment,

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.910
which is why I think the
read receipts feel a little

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.610
aggressive, because instant--
it sets an expectation instantly

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:17.000
without you getting involved.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.850
The people at line said
that what's going on now is

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.420
that when you get a notification
on your phone from line,

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.880
what they'll will do
they'll press and hold it,

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:29.570
so it pops up on the screen
and they can kind of preview it

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:32.420
without opening and
breaking the seal on that.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.720
So they're coming up with
tactics to kind of shape.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was wondering.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.270
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.030
And so the second part of that,
personalization, the seals,

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.130
was again, I think a core
part of my interest in that.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:45.980
And then I came to
this out of looking

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.030
at the aboriginal message
sticks which as a mode

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:52.690
of authentication would
sometimes have the tribal

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.820
leader's hair attached
to the document--

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.460
actually a stick not a document.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.070
So as a way of verifying
and personalizing that thing

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.410
that this came from this
particular person and the seals

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.870
that I looked at in
terms of the relationship

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:14.150
between the identity and
the iconography on there,

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.600
I think was essential to
really the power of the seal.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.140
So they require a presentation,
but then you get into the,

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.840
you know, 17th century and
you can buy a seal, you know,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.040
at the corner shop and
you begin having seals

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.180
that aren't necessarily
attached to your identity

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.190
and they're not personalized
in any particular kind

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.010
of way unless you're
somebody with means

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.080
or very particular
kinds of power.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.450
So as it disseminates
and gets broader,

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:44.730
it becomes less personal and it
becomes more utilitarian rather

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:46.810
than linked with a
specific person's identity.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.470
So you have a sailor and
it's a ship, know, ship seal.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.120
&gt;&gt; And these ones-- like
the one you have up there--

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.420
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.720
&gt;&gt; -- I think those
were the seals

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.890
that you mentioned
[inaudible] using, I think?

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.490
Yeah.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:01.790
&gt;&gt; So are those the only sort
of oval-shaped ones that--

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.090
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: No.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:04.390
Yeah. You know, you
would have a lot

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:05.840
of religious officials
having the shape.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.000
This is a privy seal.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.820
So yeah, the shape-- yeah,
there-- it just depends.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.470
There were certain standards,
so you had great seals taking

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.190
on particular shapes,
sometimes privy seals, but--

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:20.700
so there were certain
expectations

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.610
but no, beyond that--

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.990
&gt;&gt; In all different sizes.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:25.290
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:26.590
Yes, all different sizes.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.950
&gt;&gt; Statement is smaller than
the privy so it's bigger

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.250
than the [inaudible] seal.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:31.550
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.850
Yes.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.150
&gt;&gt; It's bigger.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.450
&gt;&gt; Well, I just think it's
really interesting thinking

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.750
about this in terms
of like [inaudible].

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.050
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.350
&gt;&gt; It's very clear like when
it's a [inaudible] if you go

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:40.650
over to the national archives
and you see there's exhibitions

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:41.950
of trees, right, like they're
sort of ceremonial, symbolic,

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.250
and authenticating devices,

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.550
that sort of personal element
isn't something that's usually

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.850
like it's part of
the archival record?

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.150
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes, right.

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:56.450
&gt;&gt; But it's interesting
[inaudible].

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, exactly.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:00.920
Right, yeah, indeed.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.380
And I'm looking at a very
particular kind of message too,

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.830
where the dominant
documents that I looked

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.620
at are they're archives,
you know?

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.360
There's not a response
that's meant to take place.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:16.540
So I'm more interested in the
kinds of documents and messages

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.460
that expect exchange and
as a part of that exchange

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.870
and then press the
body into that.

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:24.510
So I think the body
is, is it important

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:29.110
for those documents becomes
this authenticating power

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:33.050
that is very personalized,
but in terms of interpersonal,

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.980
but there is no interpersonal
there.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.280
It's not about message
exchanges.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.410
It's about the archive
and the sense.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.160
&gt;&gt; It's your turn?

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.670
&gt;&gt; No, go ahead.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:49.400
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in the
idea of counterfeiting seals.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.700
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:57.210
&gt;&gt; I was watching the
film about Elizabeth I

00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:03.120
and her master spy
intercepting Mary,

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.390
Queen of Scots' letters
and [inaudible].

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:06.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Depending
on if it was private or not.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.010
So most documents
that would exchange,

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.780
there's no assumption
of privacy.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.430
So the uncertain
network and part is

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.690
that you've sacrificed privacy

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:16.630
to let this document
be out into the world.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:19.360
So unless it's a letter
close, that assumes some kind

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.650
of privacy, the seals
wouldn't have been broken

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:26.030
because it would have just
hung impended form from that.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:29.340
Seals were duplicated.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.990
There were forgeries
quite a bit, again,

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.970
with this reproducibility that's
the factor that's at play here,

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:38.370
impart to help offset that,

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.880
anytime a sovereign was
then removed from power

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.190
for some reason or died, their
matrix would be destroyed.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:47.380
And so with that-- you know,

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.970
trying to eliminate the
possibility of somebody using

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.880
that and sort of forging
documents from then on.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.390
So yeah, forgery I think is

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:59.060
at the [inaudible] the
reproducible technology

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.820
like a seal matrix and then,
you know, trying to find ways

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.510
to deal with that, and much
the same way that we're--

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.210
I think that we've always
dealt with these documents,

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.280
how do you authenticate them
and make sure that they're--

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.940
they aren't forgeries.

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:19.990
Yeah, it's fascinating tracing
how people have dealt with seals

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:25.780
that get lost or stolen and the
cost it's paid and all of these.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:31.080
It's a very interesting
topic to study.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, James II [inaudible].

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.190
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Right.

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.310
&gt;&gt; And you could-- you
know, they're waxed, right?

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.410
They're malleable.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.970
So there are stories about
people heating up knives

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:46.020
and things, and you can
take it off that way

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.550
and then you can
heat up the back side

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:49.850
of it and put it back on.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.150
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Right, right.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.450
&gt;&gt; Because it's malleable.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:54.690
But where-- This
is actually famous

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:58.220
by the way [inaudible]
things that sit

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.670
into my brain really,
really [inaudible].

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.970
So, reproducibility, right?

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:07.580
So when the printing press
comes along, matrix [inaudible],

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.210
printing press is
a whore, right?

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.040
It's promiscuous.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.640
That's right

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.940
&gt;&gt; It's not reproducible,
it's promiscuous.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.300
And then I work on manuscript
news in the early 17th century

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.630
in England and if it's
printed, it's suspect.

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.060
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Right, yes.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.820
&gt;&gt; Because there
is so much of it.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.120
It's impersonal.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.140
It's the letter that's
written with your own hand

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.100
that that's the most reliable
and the most verifiable.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.760
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Right, right, right.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.060
Yeah, indeed.

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.360
Yeah and that's the context.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.440
I think that that is the
context of understanding seals

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.160
and their problematic nature.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.850
And as someone coming to
this field as an outsider--

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:54.230
so my methods for this kind of
project are more like journalism

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.200
than they are sort
of deep archive work.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.970
I went to a lot of seal
scholars and I said,

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.010
teach me about this
thing, I'm interested.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.730
I want to make-- draw
all the connections.

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:11.720
So as someone-- As an outsider
coming into this field, I was,

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.930
you know, interested in
why is the seal valued

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.230
over this signature, when
these particular eras.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.900
There are times when they
are both used but why

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.750
at this moment is
this more authentic

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:26.400
than my cultural understanding
of a signature which has

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.410
to be done by your
hand, you know,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:31.540
can be forged the same
way a seal can be forged

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.850
but this is removed
from the body, you know?

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:39.290
You have these people doing
it on your behalf, you know?

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:43.810
That to me is a very strange
juxtaposition of trying

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.970
to understand, authenticating
at an attachment

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:52.420
to a person's identity with
the document and the role

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:57.820
of the written hand, you
know, as being there.

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.740
So I think they are suspect.

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:01.200
I think that they are--

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:06.410
they exist within
attention around authority

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:09.930
and reproducibility, but
I think from me anyway,

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:14.790
that piece that has settled that
is this notion of imprinting,

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:18.150
you know, of the act
of imprinting taking

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:24.470
on a certain sort of
Christian ideology onto the act

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:30.290
of authorizing a document which
had value above the written hand

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:33.970
in a sense, you know, the act
of making an impression link

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:37.900
to this longer notion
of creating something,

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.290
of bringing something
into being in a sense

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.230
which had more symbolic weight

00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:45.040
than simply signing,
if that make sense.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.400
&gt;&gt; It's what we call the
printing press for that matter.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.780
But there would have been a time
when people who were very elite

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.320
and the kind of people
who are privileged

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.040
and have seals couldn't
sign their names, right?

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.170
So in that case, it's
definitely authenticated

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.470
because there'll
be a secretaries,

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.320
scribers writing for them.

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.150
And it's a corollary
to the people

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:10.040
who then are not
writing [inaudible] who,

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.340
you know, they make their mark.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.640
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, exactly.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.240
&gt;&gt; And a lot of those are
drawn and it just ends

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.540
and so on and so forth.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.610
So there's a lot of
interesting connectivity.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:19.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Absolutely.

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:21.210
Yeah, that's right.

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:24.220
&gt;&gt; And the other one I want
to ask about is anxiety.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:30.490
You know, you're talking about
this moment of interpretation

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:33.020
and [inaudible] that
says you're waiting

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:36.100
to get the message creates

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:41.690
this anxiety in a society
and that, you know,

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.570
it's the bad side of anxiety,

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:48.310
it's not the anticipation
good side of anxiety.

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:49.610
What do you think about that?

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: I
think it's contextual.

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:52.940
I think it's dependent
on the context.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:58.330
So yeah, waiting means
so many different things

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.340
which is why it's so
rich to study I think

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.340
because waiting can
be something.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.820
One of the questions I ask
to get the answer for this is

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.850
who benefits from me waiting?

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.190
That's a question I begin with.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.490
So in one part, I can
benefit from me waiting,

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:20.490
where I am investing my time
and it becomes something

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:22.600
that pays back to me in
delayed response for--

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.790
or, you know, delayed
gratification.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:28.360
We often imagine waiting
as developing the virtue

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.790
of patience and we've-- you
know, we honor those kids

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:34.650
who waited for the researcher
to come back in the room

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:35.950
with a second marshmallow.

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:37.860
You know, they don't eat the
first marshmallow, they waited

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.160
and the researcher
brought them two.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.240
And those are the people very
successful in life, right?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.220
So waiting can benefit us.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.130
But then on the other hand,

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.400
it sometimes benefits
certain structures

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.910
that keep people
at disadvantages.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:55.620
And the thing that's emerged out
of this work is that as I look

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.320
at how people wait across
history and in our own moments,

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.190
it's obvious that time
is not distributedly--

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:07.780
distributed evenly and certain
people have to use their time

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.740
in different ways because
they're not [inaudible] the same

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.810
kind of time than others are.

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.530
So how we interpret that way,
time is very much dependent

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.910
on how time is distributed to
us within a particular moment.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:23.150
Do I have the ability to
wait and instead of anxiety,

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:25.250
I have hope and promise
and I'm--

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.550
and I use this wait time

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:29.070
to imagine a future
that is not yet.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:33.530
And that to me, I argue, in my--

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.500
in the chapter on buffering
icons, we're actually half

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.580
in love with these like symbols
of waiting because what's

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.220
on the other side
of those symbols

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.290
of waiting is this
other future, you know?

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.220
And it could be anything
and we hope--

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.260
we have a lot of hope that when
I'm refreshing my social media

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.680
feed that what comes on the
other side of that is going

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.480
to be the thing I'm
looking for, you know,

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.780
the thing that I desire.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.940
So if you look at people-- Apple
taps into the cultural ideas

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.350
around waiting in
really interesting ways.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:05.610
The iPhone will be launched this
day and we wait and we wait.

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:08.820
And then the day comes and we
wait in line and it connects us

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:12.870
to this product and it's
this tool that is used

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:16.290
to create attachment
rather than anxiety and fear

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:21.190
and it builds kind of a longing
and a relationship to something.

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.900
So it depends on who you are,
how time is distributed to you,

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.170
and within that particular
context how waiting gets

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.640
interpreted I think.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:37.540
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I was going to--
actually I have two questions,

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.420
one is kind of segue
on your comments

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.760
from the last question
you asked.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.780
I was going to ask the title--

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:49.640
the change of title because
you had waiting for word

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.060
and you just talked so much

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.630
about waiting there
and their response.

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:59.670
And you also talked about the
importance of conceptualization,

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.040
waiting for work [inaudible]
at delayed response ships.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.180
&gt;&gt; And I just wanted to say
the kind of change of title.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.730
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: You have to
talk to the press about that.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.640
That's actually a press change.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.660
&gt;&gt; Is it a press change?

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:14.960
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.950
Part of it-- the contemporary
I think misunderstanding

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:22.130
of that phrase of waiting for
word and how it's less used.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:26.210
People had thought I was going
to write about Microsoft Word

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:29.380
or they thought it
was a religious book

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.650
about waiting for
the word of God.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:32.950
&gt;&gt; OK.

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:34.250
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: So
there was confusion,

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:35.550
which I didn't quite understand

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.150
and I quite like
the first title.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.980
So this is a particular
kind of book for the press.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.990
So this is a trade addition.

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.760
So yeah, so this is meant
for a broad audience

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.600
and they want a book that
both communicates time

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.900
and messages, and
so that's, yes.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's--

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.500
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: But
I agree, I agree.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It was no [inaudible]
thinking actually, you know,

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.410
if you think of [inaudible]
change the title

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.310
and all the problems that came
in from [inaudible] change,

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:05.040
which is very different
from printing press

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.560
and the price tags were changed.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.150
So anyway, I've been
[inaudible].

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:12.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:16.880
Thanks. Do you [inaudible]
project like telegraphs

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.040
and things like that
sitting in between?

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.180
Yeah. So I'm not to the
telegraph and pneumatic tube.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.980
I decided not to write
about the telegraph

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:30.120
because I was looking mostly at
messages exchange on an intimate

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.250
in every day level while
the telegraph was, you know,

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.830
predominantly used by--

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:35.400
for business uses
and things like that.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.110
So you didn't have sort of the
massive use of the telegraph

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:42.230
to exchange intimate
messages on the scale

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:43.530
of the pneumatic tubes.

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.370
I thought the pneumatic tubes
serve as a better example.

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:49.360
But moving from the telegraphic
era to the pneumatic era,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.560
I think there's this
seamless cultural imaginary

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.480
around the instant that
emerges at this period of time

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.780
and I just felt that the
pneumatic tubes were the better

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.200
example of what I
wanted to talk about.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.500
&gt;&gt; Talking about
some [inaudible]?

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.800
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.300
Yeah, yeah indeed.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.750
&gt;&gt; Just what you were
saying about waiting,

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:17.060
like who has the
authority of power

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.310
to make someone wait [inaudible]

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:24.000
about like community
temporality--

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.550
state temporalities and who's--

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.990
who has the authority
to define time.

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.290
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Right, yes.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.190
&gt;&gt; And the state [inaudible]
thinking about things

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:38.340
like court dates, like for
permits and things like that

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.030
versus community and
individual temporalities

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:44.050
and what your time
availabilities

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.570
and who [inaudible]?

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:46.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.370
&gt;&gt; So that's an interesting
connection.

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:54.600
And also thinking about the
seals that we see as the sort

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.800
of like embodiment of
authority putting in line

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.010
of Twitter and we verify each--

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:04.310
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: The seal, yes.

01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:07.880
&gt;&gt; And the thing too,
the authorizing mark

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.240
that that serves for those
individuals on a platform

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.270
that quite by the way is also
the home for the [inaudible],

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:22.030
like thinking about what is
their obligation for a company

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:29.900
like that when negotiating
authority in unanimity that both

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.200
of which are [inaudible].

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.690
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Yes, right, right.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:37.140
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] what are their
obligations [inaudible].

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.870
&gt;&gt; That's great, great comments.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.170
I really appreciate that.

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:44.610
To the first point, this
dynamic about who gets

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:48.610
to define temporarily emerge
when I was in Australia working

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:51.030
with the Wurundjeri
tribe talking to them

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:53.500
about their histories
of the message sticks.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:59.170
And when colonizers first came
into both Sydney and Melbourne,

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.030
they imagine that they had
come across prehistoric people

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:04.870
that were without time,
that they didn't experience

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:07.960
that because you needed
technology to understand time.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.760
You needed some sort of
time telling technology,

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.040
and the message sticks were
that, because they were linked

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.050
to the geography of the space
that took a certain amount

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:20.280
of time to journey between
tribes and then to gather people

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.020
and often these sticks were used

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.730
for gatherings called
corroborees

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:26.910
where tribes would
come together.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.660
So they-- you know, here
you have this culture

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.230
that was sending long distance
messages, tens of thousands

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:35.870
of years before European
settlers were but they came in

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:37.840
and said these people
don't have any time.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.370
And that has persisted
to this day,

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.920
that notion that aboriginal
people are timeless

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.510
and without time.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:45.810
You know, I would talk to some

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:48.060
of the university professors
there and I say, yeah, I have--

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.000
I'm going over to
Coranderrk to meet

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.640
with some Wurundjeri elders.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.430
And they said, well, you
know, don't get there early,

01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:59.060
they're probably going
to be late, you know?

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.120
So these cultural notions
about lateness and sort

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.500
of how certain cultures are
temporarily challenged as a way

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.050
to create, you know,
this race's notions

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:13.980
about different societies
definitely emerged

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.280
in that example.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.580
And I think, yeah,
you definitely see

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.150
that throughout societies
today as well.

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:23.560
And in terms of the relationship
between the unanimity

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.690
and the authorization,
I think that that's--

01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:27.090
that is a fascinating ship.

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:28.640
I think that would be
interesting to the study

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.300
as a whole, you know,
specially the move

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.760
from early online
networks to notions

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.330
of authenticating certain
identities online today.

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:41.010
I think we have more
assumption around authenticity

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:43.980
than unanimity today that--

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.420
you know, when you go on to
a political post like looking

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.680
at the parkland students,
this is really interesting,

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.980
I've been doing this lately.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.370
Look at parkland students post.

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.860
Go into the comments
especially the negative ones.

01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:01.350
Most of those people have 5
to 11 followers and, you know,

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:05.380
you wonder who-- we assume
that somebody's got a picture

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.900
and a Twitter identity
that that is--

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.250
you know, this real life
person responding to this.

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:15.370
But I think the emergence of
bots and these other platforms

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:18.090
for replicating things bring
all of that into a suspect.

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:21.360
But I think we begin with the
certain assumption of identity

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:27.070
at some point in the online
world and then work our way back

01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:31.250
to realizing that there's
nobody behind this.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.320
So it would be interesting
to trace our relationships

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.680
between authenticating on one
hand and unanimity on the other

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.730
in our relationship, where
we're at, at this moment,

01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:41.030
I think it's really
interesting one.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.460
&gt;&gt; Just a small comment on that.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.410
In the early days, it
was favoring of unanimity

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:50.040
and now favoring
of authentication.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Absolutely, yeah.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.640
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] number one,

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.880
the social identity
[inaudible] social identity

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.540
and to hold you accountable
what you did.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: That's right.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.510
&gt;&gt; And the two should go back
and forth, whereas before,

01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:04.410
the idea was freedom
and now I discovered

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:05.810
that that was not a good idea.

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.110
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:08.410
&gt;&gt; So some places, I now go to.

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:09.710
I'll mention one, Future
Learn [assumed spelling].

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.110
It's a place I enjoy
its courses and so on.

01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:15.220
They prefer you to authenticate
yourself and I always do

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:16.550
because they want
to know who you are.

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.850
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: That's right.

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:19.150
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:20.450
&gt;&gt; And it makes it more
of a social experience

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.040
and actually a social community.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.100
So if you look at the
early days of the internet,

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.980
especially around 1997, NCI came
out with a series of commercials

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.760
that essentially said, you
know, race doesn't matter,

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.060
gender doesn't matter,

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.280
disability doesn't matter,
we are mind to mind.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.580
Is this utopia?

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.880
No, it's the internet.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.610
So it's the idea that you could
remove your body completely

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:46.580
and come up with an entirely
new identity independent

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.880
of who your-- what
your body was.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.640
And I think that mythology
played out and we saw

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.960
that the negative concept
that who's allowed to give

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.070
up their bodies and who among us
actually wants that, you know?

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:01.580
Yeah. I mean, you know, we
are primed by our bodies.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.560
Do we actually want to
get rid of these bodies?

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.890
We don't. And so we want
our bodies to be a part

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:12.000
of our message exchanges because
there's notion of intimacy

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.100
across message exchange
and that's, I think,

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.440
covered in that whole book
that message exchange is a part

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.180
of intimacies, how we maintain
intimacy across distances,

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.210
and our bodies are part of that.

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.050
We want our bodies
connected in these exchanges.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:29.820
So that's when I think we wanted
authentication to be a key part

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:31.120
of our social networks.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.030
And you saw that, you know,
with the rise of Friendster

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:37.820
and Myspace in 2002-2003,
identities were a part of it,

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.290
you weren't working
on those platforms.

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.780
You didn't want to
be because you wanted

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.080
to connect with people.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.750
And that defined social media
platforms from then on out

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:48.930
where you wanted who
you were as a person

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:52.090
to be present in
those exchanges.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.390
&gt;&gt; And I think-- I know people

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:54.690
who get paid to write
on internet.

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:59.010
And when you become a paid
blogger or a paid columnist,

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.640
you want to be authenticated,
you want to be accountable,

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.940
and you have a kind of energy.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.240
So whatever kind
of place you go to,

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.010
it's very important for that.

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:08.510
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, exactly.

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:09.810
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: Could
you say a little more

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.930
about the use the seals
that everyone has in Japan--

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.230
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:17.530
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: -- and why
at that comfortable moment?

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:20.250
And I had a certain image
where I saw the picture.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:23.490
And then it made me think when
we write a wrong [inaudible],

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:25.910
we got like 17, quite anybody--

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:27.210
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.510
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: -- who
gets a signal all of a sudden.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.810
It seemed more-- you just--

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.380
I mean, I found that really
interesting, why the--

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.830
you know, at this
moment do you think?

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.640
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: That people
have to carry seals on them?

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.490
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin:
Yeah, the seals

01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:40.320
and the moves to
that, you know--

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.620
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.920
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin:
-- [inaudible].

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.220
I mean--

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.820
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.120
So I think, you know,
it is fascinating

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.990
to trace even our use of
signatures in PDF documents and,

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.640
you know, click here to
sign in, it looks nothing

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.920
like your signature but you
were the one who made the click.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.910
And so the click is
an action, you know,

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:59.540
it's a performative act
that authorizes, right?

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:05.390
Yes but, you know, talking to
why people carry their seals,

01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:10.600
there is-- Japan is
really fascinating in terms

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.550
of its technological
advancements, how we imagine

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:17.100
to be one of the most
technologically advanced

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.400
countries in the world.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.120
You know, they had mobile
phones and mobile internet

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.240
and 3G long before we did.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.950
So then our mobile explosion,
you know, was predated

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.590
by Japanese culture
by many years.

01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:34.340
But then on the other hand,
you have this other desire

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.250
for physicality, for
materiality, and the honor

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:38.820
of having material and ways

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.390
that you cannot sign
things digitally.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:41.690
You got to go in person.

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:45.180
Nobody can take your seal on
your behalf and sign anything.

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.590
You have to go and stamp.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.280
So there is-- Yeah, I think--

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.350
And I think we as
a culture as well

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:54.470
in the United States are
circling back to that as well

01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:55.850
to understand that the digital

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:59.320
and the material are not these
distinct spaces that materiality

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.440
and material culture are
very much embedded in,

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.000
in a digital society.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.320
And yeah, it's interesting
in those kinds of ways.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.310
&gt;&gt; But I think that what you
just said too about being a kind

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.020
of the very close
intricate relationship--

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.370
integral relationship between
digital material is one thing

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.110
that I-- and there
are so many things.

01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:23.550
But one thing that
I greatly enjoy

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:27.390
about your talk [inaudible]
with the historical because--

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:28.690
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:31.130
&gt;&gt; -- you know, I think
it's just refreshing to kind

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:33.480
of see that trio in here--

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.780
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.080
Yeah.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.600
&gt;&gt; -- and to take things
back and not conflate them.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.900
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, right.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:41.020
&gt;&gt; Do you know-- I mean because
that sometimes how things

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.320
are done.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.620
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.920
For this kind of--

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.220
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: --
involve these other.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, for work.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.820
So this work is kind of
situated in the field

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.120
that could become
media archeology.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.420
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.720
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: So, you
know, making connections

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.150
and imagining genealogies
of media, you know, that--

01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:59.170
so which does counter this
disruptive notion of technology,

01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:01.240
you know, tech-- you know,
the digital media come in

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.650
and disrupt culture and
nothing is ever the same.

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:08.600
Rather, it's a tracing of
lineages and ideas across eras,

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:14.250
trying to find ancestors
among media that set the stage

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:16.570
for our contemporary moment
and trying to understand it

01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:19.360
within a part of historical
context rather than thinking

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.160
that this moment
is a disruption.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.750
Instead, it's very much a
long, long lineage of media

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.990
that have come before,
and cultural attitudes

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.230
that have come before that,
yes, must be understood

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.530
within their specific--

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:33.830
&gt;&gt; Within--

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.130
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: -- within a
moment that they're not the same

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.610
and their historical
moments are not the same

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:39.150
but we can still learn
something by layering them

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:41.450
on top of one another.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.130
&gt;&gt; Well, this isn't
really great.

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:48.890
But I was curious but I was
wondering if that's true

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.190
about the seals in Japan.

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:51.980
I mean, it's more like
a performance of power

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.280
of the state, you
know, when you said--

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.580
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.880
&gt;&gt; -- history, it does.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.240
I mean, but I'm just actually
making an observation,

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.380
is applying for visas
and passports--

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes, yeah.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.960
&gt;&gt; -- you have to like get the
stamps of the guy over there,

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.700
you can invite the person
in the window, et cetera.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.130
So I mean I think
there are some--

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.430
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah.

01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:11.730
That's very--

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:13.030
&gt;&gt; -- we've got nothing there
and I'm sure it's also happening

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.390
in digital and analog
as well but I feel

01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:16.690
like there's something--

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:17.990
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: It's very--

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.290
&gt;&gt; -- that sort of-- This
is what the state is,

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:20.590
this is how it works.

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:24.040
This is how you, you
know, recognize that.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.340
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
I think that's a--

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.640
&gt;&gt; Eleanor Shevlin: I know.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.940
That's-- But don't you think
too they're coming backward

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.370
with the digital and kind of a
state than this idea of desire

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.020
of the individual
comes back to itself?

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:38.700
It's kind of maybe the way
it's envisioned can almost be a

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.000
rhetoric, you know, kind of--

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.300
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman:
Yeah, that's true.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.150
So if you look at the different
seals that people carry

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:45.450
with them, they are
personalized.

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:46.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.050
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: So you've
got your name, you know,

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.930
on the actual seals,
albeit it can be, you know,

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.260
the handles are personalized.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.440
Depending on how much
money you've got, you know,

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.360
it can be very cheap materials
but some are very elaborate

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.560
and very personalized for that.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.760
But I think you're right that it
is bound up in this bureaucracy

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.400
that values that
particular relationship

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.970
to the physical rather
than to something else.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:11.150
And again, that may be
reproducible in different kinds

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.620
of ways that aren't
accepted by the bureaucracy.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:17.610
But I think it exists within
the context of the digital

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:19.910
and also the context of
value in certain kinds

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:22.940
of material culture as well.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.360
&gt;&gt; Just when you
go to the airport,

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.320
they'll photograph
you five times

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.780
and count [inaudible] five
different times you're

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.480
photographed and you're
kind of [inaudible].

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.090
They don't trust
one picture, they--

01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:36.890
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yeah, exactly.

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:45.570
[ Inaudible ]

01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:47.230
Yeah.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.530
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: Well, thank
you, everybody for coming--

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.080
&gt;&gt; Jason Farman: Yes, thank you.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.620
&gt;&gt; Sabrina Baron: --
[inaudible] my volume

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.680
and you'll get a
lot of attention.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.830
Our streaming stuff has been
getting a lot of attention,

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:58.850
so that will be really great.

01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:03.740
Anybody who wants to
hold on for drinks

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.040
and dinner, please join us.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.340
For listening to
Jason-- [Applause]
