00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:09.120
 Digital content usage is growing rapidly 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.460
 Developers must constantly search for ways 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.090
 To achieve the physical income of their product hold 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.876
 In providing a distinct user experience 

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.960
 In Viki, the subscriptions helped us 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.250
 To enhance and develop our business 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 The subscriber base is growing almost 3 times per year 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.530
 The availability of contributions was easier than we expected 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.010
 My name is "Alex Chan" 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.660
 I am a Senior Vice President of Products &amp; Engineering 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.450
 In Viki, a group company Rakuten 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.860
 We provide a global platform for entertainment video 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.310
 Focusing mainly on the content of Asia, both television programs 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.750
 Or movies, with the support of our dedicated fan community 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.700
 We started work 6 years ago 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.220
 A business model is based on advertising for material income 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.500
 We wanted to increase the chances of receiving profits 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.080
 And provide better use experiences for our service users 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.440
 So we launched the subscription feature through Google Play 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.700
 3 years ago 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.810
 It was very easy 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.590
 It only requires a few lines of code to take care of 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 Payment APIs with the rest of the tasks 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.100
 Subscription earnings increased by 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.550
 More than 200% last year 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.910
 We were impressed by the other positive results 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.380
 After launching the service 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.250
 Android vogue helped us in emerging markets and open platforms 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.410
 To succeed. Use a credit card 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.830
 Limited in these countries 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.170
 But make payments available through Google Play 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.730
 For example through gift cards and carrier billing 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.100
 Payment processes facilitate users in these markets 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.820
 The growth rate of our subscribers was from emerging markets 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.700
 Such as Latin America and the Middle East, exceeds 700% each year 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.110
 Subscriptions and Google Play invoices 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.700
 Help us expand the base of our service users who share a fee 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.000
 Around the world and earning new profits from emerging markets 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 We currently offer our special offers 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.720
 We support an active community of millions of users viewing content in more than 200 languages 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 Most importantly, our fans have expressed to us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.070
 How important our product and content are to entertain themselves and learn new cultures 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.460
 This kind of effect is 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 Evidence of our success at work.
