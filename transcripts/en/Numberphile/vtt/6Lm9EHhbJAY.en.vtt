00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.120
This is the straight edge, except... this is marked.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.280
So Euclid's straight edge is
just a straight edge. It's not a ruler...

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.820
And this is a compass...
And you can use it to draw circles.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.300
Straight edge can do the following:

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.760
if you have two points in the plane that you have previously somehow constructed or were given to you

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.420
then you can put the straight edge there
and connect them by this fine straight line.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.700
And the way to imagine it is that the straight line
is infinitely long...and the paper is infinitely big.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.220
- So you can't do a line of twenty centimeters...?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.620
- Well... sort of. So that's a very good question.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.460
Hum... if you're given a line of one centimeter...
by... you know... by god...

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.200
then you can do a line of twenty centimeters,
because you can draw one long line...

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.940
And then here is my line of one cm given by god.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.840
And then I can use the compass... to measure the 1cm.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.560
And then I can pick a starting point on my infinitely long line.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.340
And then I can put this 1 cm there twenty times.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.960
For now I'll just do it three times.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.260
So one of the central questions that people
have been interested in for a very long time is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.120
exactly what can of lengths you can construct
if you're given a line segment of one centimeter,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.840
or one inch... or one unit...

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.500
Today when you start learning mathematics
- even when you're two years old or three years old -

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.060
you always start with numbers... But for Euclid
and people in his time, it was the opposite.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080
They thought about Geometry
as being the basis of everything.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.520
And they thought about shapes, points, lines,
triangles, being the fundamental objects.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.740
And they thought of numbers only
as something that arise from the Geometry.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.600
So the questions that they naturally ask
were a little bit different.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.420
So first, I'll show you a few things that are possible.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.500
How about... I give you a line segment of some length...

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.280
and ask you to construct a perpendicular bisector...

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.900
meaning a line that's perpendicular to this line segment and cuts it in two equal pieces.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.040
'Have to open this compass quite wide
because I drew this long line segment.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.000
So I draw one circle arc... So I do two circle arcs...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.480
The important part is that the width of the... the radius of the circle... so the width of the compass was the same

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.420
when I do it from the left and when I do it from the right.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.700
And then... take the straight edge and just connect
the two points where those arcs intersect.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.480
and then they will intersect because I opened
the compass wide enough to be wider than half.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.700
And then this line is a perpendicular bisector of that.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.140
So why is that... I won't show you... maybe won't show you all the proofs, but I will show you this one.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.320
If you connect all of these points... 
then what is this shape?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.400
Well, all of these red lines are the radius of the circle, and... those are all the same...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.080
They are all the same length because I kept the compass the same width the whole time.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.780
And so, this shape is what's called the rhombus.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.640
One of the properties of the rhombus is that the two diagonals are perpendicular to each other

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.200
and cut each other in half.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.360
Another thing you can do... This is some angle - we don't know how big it is.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.920
We can't measure it, because we
don't have an angle-measuring device.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.380
But, whatever it is, I can bisector it - meaning I can construct a line which is right in the middle.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.780
So how do we do that? We take the compass, open it to whatever width - it doesn't matter.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:14.100
Draw a circle arc... and then, from where the circle arc intersects those two lines, we draw

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.140
another two circle arcs... and these two have
to be with the same radius as each other.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.120
And then, where those two intersect, we draw a line.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.160
And that line will bisect the angle. And again...

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.900
So... let me show you one last trick that's possible.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:41.420
So suppose you are given a unit square.
And I tell you that every side is of length 1.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:50.340
And I ask whether you can 'double the square' - meaning construct a square which is twice the area of the square.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.980
Okay, so how will that go...?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.800
Well... what we want is a square that has twice the area.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.100
Now what's the area of this square?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.740
- One. - One, because you get the area of the square
by just multiplying the side lengths.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.780
So the area of this is one.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.960
So if this has twice the area, then the area of this is 2.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.200
And that means that...we know that x squared is 2.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.360
And so we know that x is the square root of 2.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.960
So, how do we construct
the square that's double the size?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.620
It comes down to having to construct
lines segments of lengths square root 2...

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.720
And this is where Euclid's kind of question
starts to look more like your kind of question..

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.300
Uh, can you do a line segment of length 20.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.360
Now his quite kind of question - can you do a square that's twice as big - comes down to a question

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.100
which is our kind of question
- can you do a line segment which is of length root 2.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.140
- Can you do a line that's root-2 long?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.580
- Yes! So, how do you do that? You draw a line...

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.920
Okay, now we want a line perpendicular to it
- pretty much anywhere.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.820
And one way we know how to do that is
we can construct perpendicular bisectors.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.100
So if I just pick two points
 - doesn't matter at all where they are -

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.760
and then I construct a perpendicular bisector to that little line segment, that will be a perpendicular line.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.940
And then we forget about those points.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.440
What happens if I take my compass...

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.920
So I'm given this unit segment.
That's the key; I know what length-1 is.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:43.480
And then if I know what length-1 is,
what happens, if I put length-1 here...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.720
and the length-1 here... I'll mark those...

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.960
This is 1... This is 1.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.380
And you guess what's next...

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.700
- Yeah, you can do a hypotenuse.
- Exactly.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.360
So this is a hypotenuse and you can use the pythagorean theorem... So this is c...

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:19.900
Then c-squared equals 1-squared plus 1-squared.
So c-squared equals 2. And so c equals the root of 2...

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.260
To finish the job, well... you would have to
make a square that has this as a side length.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.320
So... Let's just make it a bit longer... We want perpendicular to it here and perpendicular to it here.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.880
And you know how to do perpendiculars...

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.940
You draw a circle arc... you draw another circle arc... ok?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.760
And then you'll believe me that I can
do that on the other side as well. - Yes.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.240
We have now three sides of the square.
We just have to measure the side lengths.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.840
So put this...in here... This is the length root-2.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.620
So I measure it on that side... and then I measure it
on that side... and 'have a square.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.420
- Well done! ... Job done! - Yeah.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.820
So you can double a square...

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.200
A question that you can try figuring out
is how to triple a square...

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:24.040
Uh... so uh...  it's very similar to this,
but it involves a little bit of extra trickery...

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.880
It's a fun problem to think about.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.400
What's the first thing I showed you?
It's uh... how to bisect a segment.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.280
So... instead of asking how to bisect a segment,
I could ask... can you trisect a segment...?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.840
So can you cut a segment into three equal parts,
as opposed to two equal parts?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.020
The answer to this is still yes...
And it's actually pretty simple.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:53.400
I won't like... do all the perpendiculars properly, cause now you believe me that I can construct perpendiculars.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.660
So I'll just do it the shortcut way...

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.500
So open up your compass to any length that you want.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.580
Put a... another line, which starts at the same point as the line segments,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.360
but what the angle is doesn't matter whatsoever.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.880
Put your compass at the end, and measure this...whatever length - doesn't matter - one time...

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.820
two times... three times.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:29.400
So now on this other side, I have constructed
a line segment which is trisected by this line.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.840
And then I connect these two ends.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.480
And then from this point draw a parallel to this red line.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.960
Now I haven't thaught you how to draw a parallel,
but a parallel is what's perpendicular to a perpendicular.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.160
So what you would do... is you would draw a perpendicular to that red line... here...

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:59.520
And then you would construct a perpendicular from this point to that... hum, and that would be parallel.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.860
And then another one... from over here.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:12.360
And magic! Where it intersects, 'trisects that origin only.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.520
So the next thing - next natural question -,
I showed you how to bisect an angle...

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.540
Can you trisect an angle?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.480
So, I give you some angle - you dont know what the measure is cause you don't have any measuring device -

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:34.940
Can you come up with a construction which would result in two lines which divide that angle in three equal parts?

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.700
- Based on everything you showed me so far,
I would have said yes...!

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.640
- Well... Euclid couldn't... And then, for about two thousand years people thought about this problem...

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.180
Before I tell you the answer
let me give you another problem.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.020
So I told you that you can triple a square.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.200
That's one kind of generalization
of the problem of doubling the square.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.320
Hum, it's going up in the ratio
by which you want to multiply...

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.040
What you could also try - going up in dimension...

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.460
So a square is a 2-dimensional thing.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.220
So instead of doubling a square,
you can ask about doubling a cube...!

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.800
So what does that mean? Well...
You're given a unit cube...

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.420
You need a cube whose sides are all length 1.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:29.140
And... what you want to try to figure out is how to construct another cube which has twice the volume.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.100
Now what's the volume of the unit cube?
- One.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:39.000
- One, because you get the volume of a cube
by multiplying this side-length, this side-length,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.700
and this side-length, which are all the same
because it's a cube. So that's 1 times 1 times 1 is 1.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.220
So if you doubled it, then the
volume of the new one would be 2.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.000
So we don't know what the side-length is,
but we can figure it out.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.560
If the side-length is y, then I know that the volume - which is 2 - is y times y times y... so it's y-cubed.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.920
To get y, we have to get the cube root.
So y equals the cube root of 2.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.540
- Can we do a cube root of 2? Can you do a cube root using a compass and a straight edge?

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.280
- Well, who knows? Euclid couldn't. And then people thought about it for two thousand years.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.520
- So both of these problems Euclid couldn't crack...?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:24.920
- Both of them Euclid couldn't crack. People were very curious about them, and many many smart people.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.940
And then, in the early eighteen hundreds
came along this ingenious guy called Gallois.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:38.360
He died at age nineteen in a duel. But before that
he essentially revolutionized algebra...!

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.380
- Before he was nineteen?!
- Before he was nineteen, yeah...!
- Waw...

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:51.940
- So this theory - Gallois' theory that he came up with,
is now... if you're in any math program in university

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:57.500
you're thaught this in year... say fourth year of undergraduate or first year of graduate studies.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.980
- I hope they also teach you not to have duels!

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.800
- So that gave people the tools
to eventually practise problems.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:13.460
And they were... well, not solved...
but it was proven in the eighteen thirties

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.740
that both of these are impossible...

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.800
And the guy who proved
both of these is called Pierre Wantzel.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.120
And you can see why they were so much harder,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.340
because, when something is solvable,
all you need to do is come up with a solution.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.980
These solutions still are tricky,
but they are not that hard.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.860
But to solve that something is impossible... that's
- to prove that something is impossible - that's hard,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:42.100
because you can't... you know, saying that I thought about it for ten years and couldn't do it is not a proof;

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.860
maybe you're just not smart enough...!

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:52.120
So you have to come up with something explicit
- that proves that they are absolutely impossible.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:59.820
And what it came down to is exaclty your kind of question, i.e. what kind of length you construct

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.060
if you're given the unit segment.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.900
So I, for example, show'd you how to do a square root-2.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.620
I showed you how to do 3. I showed you how to do 1/3.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.220
It turns out that you can do all numbers
that just involve fractions and square roots,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.900
and additions and subtractions.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.380
But there's a problem with cube roots...!

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.780
So what this guy proved is that
you will never be able to do cube roots.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.100
And that can also be used to crack this problem, because trisecting an angle somehow

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.020
comes down to cube roots through trigonometry.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.120
- So cube roots are the problem.
- Cube roots are the big problem.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.720
- But, the same question arises:
how do you prove you can't do a cube root...?!

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.480
How do you prove that you can't do cube roots?
That's a very good question!

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.960
'What do you use to translate from geometry
to numbers?' is the main question.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:56.440
And the answer is analytic geometry, which you probably encountered in high school - so coordinates...

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.920
You always start out with the unit segment - somehow
the unit segment is always given to you -

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.400
to begin with.
And then you want to construct other stuff.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.480
You can translate everything to the question...

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.760
if you start out with the unit segment,
you can construct a coordinate system,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.080
that has unit segment as length on the x-axis.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.320
And then which points can you construct
from there, starting from there...?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.680
- So cube roots are like an island you can get to...?
- Exactly! So the question is...

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.580
you can think about... instead of which points
exactly you can construct, you can ask...

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.120
what are the coordinates
of the points that you can construct.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:38.620
And each basic step - I told you what the basic steps are... It's like drawing a line between two points or

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.700
drawing a circle... How our news points pour in...

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.500
They are the intersections of lines
or intersections of circles.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.260
And you might remember from high school that when solve for the coordinates of intersecting things,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.960
this comes down to solving equations.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:01.320
And all of those equations will come from
equations of lines and equations of circles,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.100
which, uh... - also you might remember from high school, or from calculus if you ever took calculus -

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.980
an equation of a line is a linear equation,
and an equation of a circle is a quadratic equation.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.320
So when you solve those,
you're never going to get cube roots...
