a public health insurance plan competing
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229
a public health insurance plan competing
with private plans and they're all

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
with private plans and they're all
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.689

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.579
addressed in the legislation that's been
discussed on Capitol Hill I mean my

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589
discussed on Capitol Hill I mean my
 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.919
discussed on Capitol Hill I mean my
proposal is argued for a level playing

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929
proposal is argued for a level playing
 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.110

field which means that the private and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
field which means that the private and

the public health insurance plan plans

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
the public health insurance plan plans
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529
the public health insurance plan plans
have to abide by the same rules that the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
have to abide by the same rules that the
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.000
have to abide by the same rules that the
public health insurance plan can't be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
public health insurance plan can't be
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.040
public health insurance plan can't be
funded by taxpayer dollars it has to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050
funded by taxpayer dollars it has to
 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.690
funded by taxpayer dollars it has to
receive all its funds from the same

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
receive all its funds from the same
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399
receive all its funds from the same
sources that the private insurance plans

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
sources that the private insurance plans
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.040
sources that the private insurance plans
receive such as the subsidies for lower

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050
receive such as the subsidies for lower
 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.570
receive such as the subsidies for lower
and middle-income people who get

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
and middle-income people who get
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490
and middle-income people who get
coverage and the premiums that people

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
coverage and the premiums that people
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649
coverage and the premiums that people
pay and finally I've argued that there

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
pay and finally I've argued that there
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.450
pay and finally I've argued that there
really should be strenuous efforts to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
really should be strenuous efforts to
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580
really should be strenuous efforts to
make sure that there's adequate

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
make sure that there's adequate
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219
make sure that there's adequate
adjustment for plans that take on a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
adjustment for plans that take on a
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.160
adjustment for plans that take on a
higher risk population in fact to me

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
higher risk population in fact to me
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510
higher risk population in fact to me
that's one of the concerns that the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
that's one of the concerns that the
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160
that's one of the concerns that the
public health insurance plan is probably

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
public health insurance plan is probably
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569
public health insurance plan is probably
going to be more attractive to people

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
going to be more attractive to people
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.950
going to be more attractive to people
who really need care because they want

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
who really need care because they want
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.330
who really need care because they want
to have a transparent plan that's going

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
to have a transparent plan that's going
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980
to have a transparent plan that's going
to be there when they're sick and if

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
to be there when they're sick and if
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.330
to be there when they're sick and if
that's the case we need to really work

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
that's the case we need to really work
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.620
that's the case we need to really work
hard to make sure that those how the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
hard to make sure that those how the
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.959
hard to make sure that those how the
playing field isn't tilted against the

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969
playing field isn't tilted against the
 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.480
playing field isn't tilted against the
public health insurance plan so you know

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
public health insurance plan so you know
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370
public health insurance plan so you know
the other thing to say and I think this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
the other thing to say and I think this
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.990
the other thing to say and I think this
is really crucial that people understand

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
is really crucial that people understand
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910
is really crucial that people understand
is that what the private insurance

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
is that what the private insurance
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.380
is that what the private insurance
companies are arguing against really is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
companies are arguing against really is
 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090
companies are arguing against really is
choice I mean they're arguing against

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
choice I mean they're arguing against
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.410
choice I mean they're arguing against
the idea that there should be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
the idea that there should be
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690
the idea that there should be
competition and people should be able to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
competition and people should be able to
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399
competition and people should be able to
vote with their feet between private

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
vote with their feet between private
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.990
vote with their feet between private
insurance plans and the new public

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
insurance plans and the new public
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429
insurance plans and the new public
insurance plan you know the polls

suggest that people want to have that
choice but I think a lot of people are

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
choice but I think a lot of people are
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289
choice but I think a lot of people are
going to choose private health insurance

talking about Medicare taking the lead

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
talking about Medicare taking the lead
 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.289
talking about Medicare taking the lead
in reforming the delivery of our

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299
in reforming the delivery of our
 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.209
in reforming the delivery of our
healthcare system well I think that we

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219
healthcare system well I think that we
 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.379
healthcare system well I think that we
should have a public health insurance

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389
should have a public health insurance
 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.479

contributing to that reform as well so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
contributing to that reform as well so
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.309
contributing to that reform as well so
to me you know the best argument for it

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319
to me you know the best argument for it
 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.780
to me you know the best argument for it
is the private surance companies are

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790
is the private surance companies are
