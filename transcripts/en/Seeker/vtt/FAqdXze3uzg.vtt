00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.649
A famous rapper once asked the poignant question,
what’s your fantasy?

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.970
A recent survey has the answer and it’s
not what you think.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.150
Hey everyone, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.490
Let’s be honest, most people fantasize about
sex.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.720
These mental images can be a quick flash in
a pan picture or a long drawn out narrative

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.810
of a picnic and romp on the beach.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.750
But contrary to a recent popular novel-turned-movie,
most people’s fantasies are really tame.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.390
The most common fantasy for both men and women?

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.300
Having romantic feelings for someone while
engaging in sexual activity.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.680
Yeah you heard me right, FEELINGS are the
most common fantasy.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.010
So says a study from the Journal of Sexual
Medicine.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.120
But to be fair it was a self-reported Canadian
study and surprisingly no maple syrup was

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
involved.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.379
But men and women are for the most part on
the same page.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.809
The three top fantasies for women

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.769
Having sex in a romantic location like on
a deserted beach.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.190
(84.9%)
Having sex in an unusual place, such as in

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.550
the office or a public toilet.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.659
(81.7%)
Taking part in oral sex.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.659
(78.5%)

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:02.659
Top Three fantasies for men

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.710
Taking part in oral sex.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.220
(87.6%)
Having sex with two women.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.810
(84.5%)
Having sex with someone that I know who is

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.810
not my spouse.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.810
(83.4%)

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.810
Yeah, pretty vanilla.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.810
Other findings?

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.640
Both straight men and women frequently fantasize
about having sex with the same gender more

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.799
than scientists previously thought.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.219
Domination and submission also proved common.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.479
What’s interesting about this survey, it
reinforces how women very much separate the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.000
fantasy from desire.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.420
While some admitted to imagining scenes of
domination, they would NEVER want that to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.039
happen in real life.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.240
Women love to read about it, but would never
want to actually meet Mr. Grey in an elevator.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.600
While most men on the other hand tend to equate
fantasy with desire.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.719
So why do we fantasize at all?

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.880
Sexual fantasies for a long time were considered
sinful or a sign of illness.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.619
Sexual fantasies in women were once a sign
of Hysteria!

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.909
Oh Victorian social norms, how wrong you were.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.109
Well, now we see fantasies as healthy and
important parts of the sexual process.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.719
For both men and women fantasizing starts
the sexy juices flowing.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.270
Which might help women who feel like they
have trouble getting into sexy time.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.069
The more sexual fantasies you have, the more
sexual desire you feel.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.750
Fantasies can be a great way for couples to
build trust and intimacy, either through sharing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.520
them or acting them out, and half of all couples
do discuss fantasies.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.670
It’s a great way to mix up a marriage without
messing up the monogamy.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.030
Talking about fantasies leads to better communication
and better sex, which can lead to a happier

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170
relationship, which can lead to greater life
satisfaction.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.690
The trouble with fantasy comes when people
use it not as a way to intimacy but as a way

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.030
to create distance between them and their
partner.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.000
Let’s say you imagine someone else other
than your partner or imagine you’re not

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.600
there in order to dissociate from the experience.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.040
No matter what your fantasy is, well unless
it’s harmful to other people, children and/or

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.870
animals, it can be good for you!

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.280
A study published in Personality and Social
Psychology Bulletins suggests that fantasizing

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.310
about sex improves analytical reasoning!

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.950
Daydreaming about love stimulates creativity.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370
Which explains all the poems, songs and art.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.180
And we know from previous research here at
DNews how daydreaming is good for the brain.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.510
So give a boost to your biggest sexual organ,
your brain.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.730
Go forth and fantasize!

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.780
Guys, I am NOT gonna ask you about your sexual
fantasies so just keep ‘em to yourself,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.710
but tell me this: Is there a science topic
you want us to cover?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.130
Any questions you want us to answer?
