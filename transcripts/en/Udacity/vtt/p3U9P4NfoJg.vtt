00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:04.708
Well, we can determine the number of blocks simply by looking at the dimensionality of the grid.

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:07.511
We are launching this kernel with a grid of blocks

00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:10.314
and the dimensionality of the grid is 8 in the x-direction,

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.950
4 in the y-direction, and 2 in the z-direction.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.061
So we have 8 X 4 X 2 blocks, which is 64 blocks.

00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:19.090
How many threads per block?

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.761
Well, we can look only at the configuration per block of threads.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:28.101
Here, we have a 16 in the x-dimension, 16 in the y-dimension of each block of threads.

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:35.560
So, that's 256 threads per block. The total is 64 blocks of 256 threads per block.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.744
That's 16,324 threads that we launched with this kernel call.
