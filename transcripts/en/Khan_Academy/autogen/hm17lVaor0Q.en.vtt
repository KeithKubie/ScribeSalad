00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:03.434
 If we have a rectangle with base length b 

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.257
 and height h, we know how to find his face. 

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:11.193
 His face will be simple 

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:14.682
 the base on the height. 

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:16.594
 The height base. 

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:19.412
 This is a rectangle face revision. 

00:00:19.412 --> 00:00:21.570
 We simply multiply the base to the height. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.104
 Now let's look at a parallelogram. 

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:28.128
 In this parallelogram, the base also has a length b. 

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.471
 And we also have a height h. 

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.121
 When we talk about the height, 

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.810
 we do not mean the length of those countries that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.906
 at least in the way I've drawn them, are positioned diagonally. 

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.074
 We mean what's going to happen if you leave this country up here 

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.287
 and go straight down, 

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:44.979
 as you move at an angle of 90 degrees, 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.254
 if you descend perpendicularly straight down, 

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:48.831
 you get to this country and that 

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.173
 will be the height. 

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:53.708
 In a situation like this when you have a parallelogram, 

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:55.108
 where you know the base and the height, 

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:58.207
 how much should his face be? 

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:02.014
 At first this may not seem so obvious, 

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:03.920
 as if we had a rectangle. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.606
 But we can do a bit of illustration that I think will help. 

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:11.289
 I'll take a piece from the face on the left, 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.967
 this is the triangle on the left, 

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.647
 which helps to form the parallelogram, 

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.554
 and move it to the right. 

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:21.405
 And then we will see something incredible. 

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.747
 Here, I will take this, 

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:26.264
 I will take this little piece. 

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:28.712
 Actually let me do it a little better. 

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:33.334
 I'll take that piece right there. 

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.789
 I will cut it off and put it here. 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.960
 It is still the same parallelogram, 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.257
 but I will just move that part of his face. 

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:42.472
 Remember, we're just looking, 

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:45.991
 what is the space inside the parallelogram, 

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.556
 taking this area here 

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.558
 and I will move her to the right. 

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:53.656
 And what happened just now? 

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.280
 What's going on now? 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.051
 Just to see if I can move it a little better. 

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:59.195
 What happened when I did this? 

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:04.100
 Look, now the shape looks exactly like the rectangle. 

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.490
 It just happened to take a small part 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.943
 from the face of the parallelogram on the left 

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:09.293
 and we moved it to the right. 

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:11.237
 I rebuilt this rectangle, 

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:13.017
 therefore, they have the same person. 

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:14.897
 The face of this parallelogram, 

00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:16.325
 this former parallelogram that was 

00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:19.221
 before moving this triangle from left to right, 

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.952
 will also be the height base. 

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:26.815
 So the person here is also 

00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:29.513
 the base on the height. 

00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:32.303
 I just took this piece of the face that was there 

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:33.943
 and moved it to the right. 

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:35.438
 Yes, the face of a parallelogram, 

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:38.754
 let me make it look like a parallelogram again, 

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.767
 the face of a parallelogram will be simple, 

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.438
 if you have a height base, 

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:47.867
 will be just the height base. 

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.949
 So the faces of both figures 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:54.285
 are just the height base.
