00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] Now we're ready for our first quiz about append, plus, and len.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The question is to answer what is the value of len of P--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
--the length of P after running the following code?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These are the 3 statements:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the first one creates a list 1, 2 and assigns that to the variable P.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Then we use append, passing in 3 as the value to append,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
invoking append on the variable P, and then we have an assignment

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that assigns the P the result of P + the list 4, 5.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The question is after running those 3 statements,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what is the value of len of P?
