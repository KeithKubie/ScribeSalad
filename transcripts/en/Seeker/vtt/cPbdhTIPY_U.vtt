00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.570
Step aside, L'Oreal - cause space travel is
the new breakthrough in anti-aging.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.599
Hey guys Tara here for DNews - talking about
an interesting new study from NASA, designed

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.520
to study the effects of long-term space travel
on the human body.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.640
The guinea pigs they're using are Scott and
Mark Kelly - two identical twin brothers,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.930
who also happen to be astronauts.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.770
In March 2015, NASA will send one of the twins,
Scott, on a one-year mission to the International

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.190
Space Station, where he will spend a full
365 days circling the earth at 17,000 MPH.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.519
His twin brother Mark, a now retired astronaut,
will stay behind, as the control subject.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.320
NASA's Human Research Program will take samples
and measurements of the twins before, during,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
and after the mission.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.109
And they've selected 10 different research
proposals, each studying a different biological

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.659
effect of space travel.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.379
One of the proposals focuses on the immune
system, which is typically suppressed in space.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.920
So for that experiment, Mark and Scott will
be given identical flu vaccines - and then

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.450
examined to see how their immune systems react
to it.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.950
Some of the other proposals focus on things
like gut health, vision - which typically

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.920
changes in space - and a phenomenon called
"space fog", which is a lack of mental clarity

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.040
typically experienced by astronauts in orbit.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.730
They'll also be looking at the effects of
space travel on aging, and specifically, telomeres

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.180
- which are the little caps on the end of
your chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.040
or fusing with other chromosomes.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.410
The loss or shortening of telomeres is typically
associated with more rapid aging, and it's

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.100
theorized that exposure to cosmic rays in
space - could shorten these telomeres, causing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.990
someone to prematurely age while in orbit.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.900
This harkens back to Einstein's "Twin Paradox"
theory, which is an old thought experiment

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.540
that says if one identical twin travels into
space on a high-speed rocket, and the other

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.910
stays home, the twin who went into space should
actually return younger than his brother - according

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.360
to the theory of relativity.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.630
We already know that clocks traveling at a
high speed, measure time differently - that's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.180
called "time dilation" - so it's only logical
that that should apply to humans as well,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.730
since we're are all governed by our own internal
clock.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.679
Unfortunately, the Twin Paradox theory only
holds - if the twin in space, is approaching

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.230
the speed of light - which is around 40,000
times faster than what the ISS currently travels

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.230
at.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.790
So, NASA may never be able to test that.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.310
Which is why for this experiment, they're
focusing on more realistic aging effects,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.310
like the telomere one.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.480
Either way, I think this is a fascinating
experiment - and I'm especially looking forward

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.650
to seeing what cognitive effects a year of
space travel has on you - if only to feel

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.560
better about my own rapidly deteriorating
mind.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.750
And hey - if you have any interesting theories
about what might happen to these guys - let
