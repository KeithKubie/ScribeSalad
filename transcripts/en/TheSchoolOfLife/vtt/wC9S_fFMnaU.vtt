00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.020
Liking ourselves,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.900
having high self-esteem as we tend to put it.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.560
Is crucial to any feeling of well-being.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.540
What's odd then is just how unpredictable

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.180
the allocation of esteem often turns out to be.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.440
There are people with modest jobs

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.300
unspectacular bodies

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.840
and unglamorous friends

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.160
confidently nevertheless, they claim to buoyant levels of self-esteem.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.700
They seem to like themselves.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.240
Despite the absence of any vigorous signs of

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.120
approval

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.640
from the world at large.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.340
And then there are others.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.540
For who no amount of achievement

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.480
prestige and financial security

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.340
ever seems to do the trick.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.500
They anxiously challenge despise and critique themselves.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.960
Always feeling that they have under performed

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.860
Never quite trusting that they really deserve to exist.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.280
Having sound levels of self-esteem

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.460
Ultimately appears to have precious little to do

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000
with hitting any verifiable benchmarks .

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.900
It seems connected up with a stranger.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.960
More internal, more subjective kind of logic.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.700
With factors immune to stand at notions of achievement.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.860
Three factors stand out in particular.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.800
Firstly

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160
The single greatest determinative of how much you will esteem yourself

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.380
is how you compare with your same-sex parent.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.100
Whether you've achieved more or less than mom or dad.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.320
Rather brutally it seems that comfortable levels of self esteem

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.140
are only available to those who've managed to outpace their same-sex parent.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.000
Those from a poor backround have a big unwitting advantage here.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.200
You might only be driving a beaten-up old taxi around Manhattan and living in one room in Harlem,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.900
but if your same-sex parent was a subsitence farmer from Easten Burkina Faso

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.760
you will at times feel princely nevertheless.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.520
Similarly yet more darkly you might have grown up in ostensibly privilege circumstances,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.280
but if you same-sex parent made a few hundred milion and you're only managing to pull in a midlle-class salary

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.720
you're liable never quite to shake of haunting feeling that you're a disgrace

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.160
Secondly

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.360
We don't feel inadequate in relation to everyone who has more than US

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.780
only those who we'we come to see as belonging to another crucial determinative self-esteem.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.220
Our peere group.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.220
By this we mean the people who we're educated with us, who are around our age

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.240
and who live in our part of the world.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.820
These people matter infinitely more to our sense of well-being than the population at large.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.000
It's a piece of extreme bad luck and matter for particular commiseration and assistance

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440
if ever on peer group produces someone who starts a bilion dollar company

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.940
or god forbid ends up runnin the country.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.960
Everytime someone we went to school with does better than us a small part of us will die

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.640
we should therefore take immense care to attend very ordinary schools

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.200
and after graduation 
to throw all invitations to reunions straight in the trash

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.680
Thirdly

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.260
A lot depends on what kind of affection we were the recipients of in childhood

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.600
in particular how many conditions our love came attached with.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.700
Some of us had parets who only knew how to give out the conditional kind of love.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.640
It was all about the grades and the school reports.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.020
We therefore grow up of course to be high achievers but it's not so easy, running around

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.540
your whole life long desperate to put out the raging fires of self-hatred

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.900
striving to impress everyone you meet in search of an unsatisfied desire for a parental approval you never knew.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.700
But others the blessed ones who've know unconditional love, from the start

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.620
will be ok just to be, they won't have to do quite so much pushing they have an inner basic

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.440
buoyancy quaranteed by the knowledge that they once mattered immeasurably

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.060
A big reversal like being fired will be unpleasant it won't necessarily have to be a tragedy.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.320
Knowing about the odd internal origins of self-esteem is crucial

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.920
because of how often we pursue goals in the belief that success will at last

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.120
give us the keys to feeling good about ourselves. It seem the truth is slightly darker

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.740
you might ostensibly be doing very well at work but if your dad was a big shot

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.540
or your school buddy became president or your parents didn't tank you up

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.840
with the right unconditional sort of love no amount of striving, goalscoring

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.760
and medal-winning is ever really gonna do it.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.420
This changes where we should imagine our challenges
lie

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.820
feeling good about ourselves isn't ultimately something we can bring about trough

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.380
professional or economic achievements alone.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.940
In huge part it's going to be about coming to terms with ourselves.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.780
The result of understanding our past and the dynamics of shame, conditionality and humiliation that might lie there

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.800
it turns out that high self-esteem seems largely to be apprised of psychology rather

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.220
than the fruit of anything we might achieve out in the world in relation to the economy.
