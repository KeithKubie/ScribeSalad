00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.890
Hey, I'm Sterling Tadlock, and I'm from

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.700
North Carolina, and I was adopted after birth.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.610
&gt;&gt; I'm Ryan Salvador, I'm from Maryland, and I'm lactose intolerant.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.640
&gt;&gt; I'm Carol Kushnir, I'm from Woodside, California, and I had the BROCA two

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.980
mutation. Which predisposes me to the possibility of breast or ovarian cancer.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.790
&gt;&gt; I

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.750
am Kagure Kabue, I'm from Kenya and I have dark skin,skin

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.010
pigmentation as well as being preliminary that has a high frequency of sickle

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.000
cell. I am Ginny Foos originally from Boston, but now from the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.160
Bay area. I have achondroplasia which is the most common form dwarfism.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.800
&gt;&gt; Great thank you so much for being here you know,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.850
as we go throughout the course we are going to talk a lot

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.610
about in depth the biology of the traits that you

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.440
guys are here to represent for us. We are going

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.120
to teach gene regulation. We're going to teach inheritance patterns and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.890
dominance. We're going to teach about mutations and complex traits, as well

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
as how to trace our lineage and family ancestry. and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.500
as we get on this journey to do this, it's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.230
probably a good idea for us to maybe better define

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.430
the traits that we have. And that's not an easy process.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.360
Sometimes we have traits and, we may think they fit neatly

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.330
in certain categories, but then we start thinking about them in

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.530
different ways. And we think it's not so simple anymore. So,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.880
for anyone who's interested, I want you to sort of take

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.830
the trait that you're sort of here to talk to us

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.242
about in this course. And I want you to try to

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:36.322
tell me, first if you think your trait is visible or

00:01:36.322 --> 00:01:41.315
hidden, and then physical or behavioral, and then innate or learned.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.265
And let's start with Jenny over here. What do you

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:45.041
think about that? Do you think you're what's a what's a

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:45.382
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:45.382 --> 00:01:48.758
&gt;&gt; I think my trait is visual, visible.

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:49.758
&gt;&gt;

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:48.963
[LAUGH]

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:49.539
Visible, huh?

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.818
&gt;&gt; Visible, yes. I think that my, it, it's a physical issue. And at

00:01:56.818 --> 00:02:04.040
times an emotional issue. and I think it has shaped who I am, in a good way.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.650
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Kugaray, what do you think? Tell us about let's focus on

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.970
skin pigmentation. Would you classify that as a visible or a hidden trait?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.860
&gt;&gt; Visible.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.670
&gt;&gt; Visible,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.210
in general.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.025
&gt;&gt; Yes, a visible trait

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:17.960
[UNKNOWN]

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.120
Physical or behavioral?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.240
&gt;&gt; Physical.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.000
&gt;&gt; And innate or learned?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.280
&gt;&gt; It's innate.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.845
&gt;&gt; Innate. Right.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:25.900
[CROSSTALK]

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.690
So, pretty, that's more of a, I guess, more of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.040
a straightforward kind of like, achondroplasia and dwarfism. You know,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.050
they sort of fit into more easily defined categories. Carol,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.325
tell us a little bit about a BRCA 2 mutation.

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.066
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:44.020
&gt;&gt; Well, BRCA2 mutation is invisible, and I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.304
didn't know I had BRCA2 mutation. And I, it's invisible.

00:02:53.304 --> 00:02:54.870
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.552
&gt;&gt; And I did take steps once I found out. Took,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.410
I took steps to address

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.860
the issue.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.960
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Are there any would you describe, obviously this seems

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.250
to be an innate trait, right? It's not anything you could change.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.700
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.780
&gt;&gt; And and is most likely a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.655
physical trait. And it manifests physically, not behaviorally.

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:21.253
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:21.620
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.210
&gt;&gt; In any real way.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.490
&gt;&gt; It could manifest, basically.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.370
&gt;&gt; It could. Exactly.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.730
&gt;&gt; Right now, it doesn't.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.820
&gt;&gt; Right, so it's sort of a little unclear, like,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.080
whether or not it will have an effect or it won't.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.460
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.880
&gt;&gt; All right. Ryan, what about lactose intolerance?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.710
&gt;&gt; So in terms of visibility, that's a little trickier

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.440
because it's not, you can't tell by looking at me that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.230
it, that I'm lactose intolerant. But if you watch me, you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.390
can, you can tell, kind of by my choices that I make

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.400
while I'm eating. If I'm at a restaurant with friends,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.990
then you might be able to see, why aren't you eating

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.920
that pizza. Or why are you taking a pill while

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640
you're eating your food. So that sense it's visible and hidden.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.370
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.550
&gt;&gt; But it's definitely.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.140
&gt;&gt; What about physical or behavioral as sort of the.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the same thing. So it's. Definitely the trait itself

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.330
is physical, but it can manifest beha, it, it changes your behavior.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.660
&gt;&gt; Very interesting. And this is something learned or innate?

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.492
&gt;&gt; it's definitely innate, but you learn that you have it.

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:17.492
&gt;&gt;

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:17.831
[LAUGH]

00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.540
Exactly. And Sterling, what about adoption, that's

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.962
sort of a tricky kind of trait.

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:22.962
&gt;&gt;

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:22.710
[LAUGH]

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.990
Wow, it, it's hard to define that as as a trait, because I have a whole host of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.760
traits that are all physical, hidden, innate, learned

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.240
they fall into both categories, from all the traits that

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.840
I have, I just don't know. You know my biological

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.670
relatives, if they also had those traits and what, how

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.860
their genetics contributed to the traits that I'm now expressing.
