00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.020
FOUR YEARS Y'ALL.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.430
FOUR YEA-- FOUR YEARS!

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.410
Four years.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.400
FOUR.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.380
FOUUUR YEARRRS.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.370
FourYears...

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.350
Wow.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
Hello for the roughly twenty-seven hundredth
time, I'm Trace, and you are all incredible

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.730
humans.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.640
Four years ago on December 5th of 2012, we
started DNews -- and my first video that day

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.030
was about THE ROBOT TAKEOVER!!

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.030
Let's do an update, shall we?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.040
Over the last four years, there have been
a lot of advances in robotics, but the scariest

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.350
and most amazing robot is ATLAS.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.140
Yeah.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.550
That's Atlas, Boston Dynamics' awesome humanoid
robot.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.290
It was first introduced in mid-2013 in a partnership
with DARPA!

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.910
At the time, it was loud, clunky, and dragged
around a massive tether, but now in 2016 oh

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.910
crap.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.420
We're screwed.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.620
In 2016, it was announced that ATLAS can walk
outside, without a tether, with "sensors in

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.880
its body and legs to balance, and LIDAR and
stereo sensors" with the goal of [quote] "making

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.960
robots that have mobility, dexterity, perception
and intelligence comparable to humans and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.549
animals, or perhaps exceeding them; this robot
is a step along the way."

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.549
Dammit.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.549
Dammit.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.549
DAMMIT.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.939
The legs of ATLAS are 3-D printed to include
"arterial fluid routing," which is just creepy.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.130
And in case Atlas isn't freaking you out,
the US Navy and Virginia Tech has created

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.830
the Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot
(SAFFiR) which also has two arms and two legs…

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.060
and it can walk on a ship.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.810
Can YOU even walk on a ship?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.560
Especially, one that's on fire?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.030
Guess what, it's 2016 and robots can!

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.220
But don't show your fear, because soon robots
could soon use emotions to manipulate your

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.880
meat brain into trusting them.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.880
In a conference paper by researchers from
Mississippi State University explored how

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.259
people could sense emotions from a robot named
Mary…

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.170
The robot displayed anger, calm, fear, happiness
and sadness; with success rates as high as

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.490
about 70-percent for calm and as low as 18
percent for happiness.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.489
Apparently, they weren't awesome at displayed
emotions, yet… but, a separate (more successful)

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.569
emotional robot is being tested with children
in the Boston area.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.269
The robot is talking with kids as they learn
Spanish by reading their emotional cues and

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.650
responding as if the robot is a fellow child.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.659
If the kid needs help the robot creates a
motivational strategy based on their emotional

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.159
state… wow creepy.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.469
But if robots learn emotions, those emotions
could help them override their own programming.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.529
For example, a Raytheon scientist named James
Crowder invented robots that were taught to

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:45.040
avoid light, but they also run on solar power
-- this is a pretty serious conflict.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.669
He told the Washington Post that even though
they've been programed to think that light

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:54.000
"hurts them… they have to balance the instincts
of ‘light still hurts, but if I don’t

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.489
find light, I die.’".

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.620
All these advances have some pretty interesting
implications… robots are learning to read

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.959
and respond to our emotions and keep some
for their own.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.559
And they can now walk outside in the sunshine,
AND can defy their own programming… but

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.049
robots are still a long way off from a full-blown
'take over.'

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.829
In 2012, I quoted Sir Martin Rees of the Center
for Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge,

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.930
and he said we'd have about 50/50 chance of
wiping ourselves out before 2100 -- with others

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.799
believing robots would be one of those things.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.389
But then, in 2015, he said "[Robots] can’t
tie your shoelaces or cut your toenails…”

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.579
[but] they're getting better…

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.120
He admits they'll probably take some routine
jobs, and not just manufacturing, even in

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.689
medical and legal professions.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.540
He goes on to say it's "likely that during
this century our society and its economy will

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.760
be transformed by autonomous robots, even
though the jury’s out on whether they’ll

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.839
be ‘idiot savants’ or display superhuman
capabilities."

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.069
Look, it’s inevitable that robots will eventually
become intelligent.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.739
To perform better at some tasks than we humans,
but whether we'll start a war for the planet

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.189
is still up in the air.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.010
In reality, maybe we'll transform our economy
and none of us will ever need to (or really

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.319
be able to) work again.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.689
Or, perhaps, robots will begin to colonize
space for us, while we are stuck on Earth

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.219
thanks to radiation.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.579
It's hard to know, but with the advances in
the last four years, it's going to be a wild

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.989
ride for the next four.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.790
Some of you have been with us at DNews since
the beginning, thank you.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.389
Some joined today, thank you.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.750
Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, thank
you so much for supporting us over these last

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.970
4 years.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.509
2017 is going to be BIG!

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.729
So this was an update to one of the very first
videos I did for DNews.

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.400
It aired on the very first day of DNews, December
5, 2012, watch it here and lets us know down

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.539
in the comments what you thought of this video
