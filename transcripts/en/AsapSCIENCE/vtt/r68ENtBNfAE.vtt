00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
Whether you're thinking of having kids today or becoming a parent in the future

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
Many are aware that fertility declines as you age

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.680
so when should you have kids,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.380
and is there anything you can do to beat your biological clock?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.260
A woman's first period is generally around age twelve or thirteen,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.180
but most ovaries don't start releasing eggs until a few years after this

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.700
In fact, a woman's peak fertility

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.140
isn't actually until her early or mid twenties

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.940
Unlike males who are constantly producing new sperm

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.780
females have a finite number of eggs, but don't worry

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.580
By puberty you have around 300,000

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.060
way more than the 300 to 400 you will release in your lifetime

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.820
However popular statistics show that after trying to conceive for one year,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.920
A thirty-year-old woman has a 25% chance

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.900
of not conceiving a life birth

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.620
This increases to a 44% chance at 35,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.320
and 66% chance at 40 years old

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.420
But most of this data comes from a 2004 journal

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.700
looking at French birth records from 1670 to 1830

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.280
it's safe to say that a lot has changed

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.460
for the lives and health of women since before the age

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.720
of electricity, antibiotics, and reliable food supply.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.880
It also does an account for the amount of sex

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.520
couples were having and the fact that sex drive tapers off as you age.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.080
Modern studies present a more optimistic look

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020
with the percentage of women unable to conceive

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.200
within a year of unprotected intercourse at 13% to 14%

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.800
for women aged 27 to 34

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.660
and 18% for women aged 35 to 39.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.800
Still showing declining fertility but much better odds

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.860
than the historical data suggest. Another study found that among

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.220
38 and 39 year olds who have been pregnant before

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.900
80% were able to become pregnant naturally within

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.680
six months. And this points to another flaw in the studies

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
Nearly half of all pregnancies in America are

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.340
unintended. This means highly fertile women are more

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.180
likely to become pregnant accidentally  when they're younger,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
while those purposefully trying to have kids for the first time

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.900
in their late thirties are already disproportionately

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.940
less fertile regardless of age creating an overestimate

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.920
for the effect of biological aging.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.760
However, older eggs may not fertilize normally and there is an increase

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.720
of chromosomal abnormalities with age. A woman who is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.640
thirty has a 1 in 800 chance of having a baby with

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.620
Down Syndrome, but the probability goes up to 1 in 100

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.380
when she's forty. Granted, that's still only

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.120
a 1% chance. But what about men? Many assume

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.340
male fertility is limitless with some famous examples like

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.180
Charlie Chaplin having kids up until his seventies.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.640
And while men do continually make new sperm, the more cell divides

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.480
the higher probability of genetic mutations.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.060
By the time a man reaches 50, the cells that create his sperm

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.400
have gone through over 800 rounds of division and replication.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.080
As a result, older fathers carry increased

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.800
risk of children with schizophrenia, autism, cancer

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.960
a form of dwarfism, neurofibromatosis, and even skull and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.240
facial abnormalities. On top of this, even among young men

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.420
in the Western world, sperm counts have dropped over 50%

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
in the last 40 years

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.660
The impact and importance of this

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.340
is yet to be determined though

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.640
Of course, there's more to raising children than biology

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.500
anecdotal accounts points to younger parents having more energy, but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.520
older parents having more maturity and financial stability.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.780
Of course, more income does not mean better parents

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.880
but research has shown that higher family income is linked to higher

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.360
SAT scores. Not to mention in low to middle

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.380
income countries the risk of death per birth for women between

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.400
15 to 19 years old is 28% higher

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.060
than for women 20 to 24 years old. Studies have

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.040
also found that in some Sub-Saharan African countries

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.020
Up to 25% of girls and young women drop out of school

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.260
because of unintended pregnancies.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.520
Preserving young female eggs by cryogenically freezing them

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.180
has also become more common but isn't a guarantee

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.900
with increasing age still affecting pregnancy success rates

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.780
and researchers finding that the freezing process degrades

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.540
the quality of the eggs. Additionally, this isn't a viable

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.640
option for most women, as the cost of freezing alone

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.180
is 10,000 dollars, and one round of in vitro fertilization

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.940
can cost upwards of 12,000 dollars.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.980
Overall, yes, conceiving a baby becomes more difficult

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.020
as both men and women age, but it is not the level of

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.940
baby panic that is so often discussed in the media.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.960
Individual fertility is very variable

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.180
based on genetics and lifestyle, and the best time to have kids

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.440
is a very personal decision as is having kids at all.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.980
Special thanks to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for supporting this episode.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.800
Even though the world is on an incredible path of progress,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.460
it's important to remember that progress isn't inevitable.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.460
That's why the Gates Foundation has created a Goalkeepers Report

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.540
which will help raise awareness, accountability, and drive action

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.460
for a better future.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.960
Did you know that the number of mothers who die during childbirth

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.020
has been halved in the past generation?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.440
The Gates Foundation wants to ensure continued healthy lives

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.220
and promote well-being for all ages.
