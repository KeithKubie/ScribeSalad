HENRY SHACKLETON: I don't know.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.461
I think Junior Lab was a
really great experience.

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:11.620
I like that it gave people room
to figure things out and come

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.170
up with their own ideas,
come up with their own ways

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.460
of proceeding with analysis.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.680
For example, in my
first experiment which

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.320
was relativistic dynamics,
you take electrons,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.240
you accelerate them
in magnetic fields

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.610
and measure the kinetic
energy which ultimately proves

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.370
relativity, there was
sort of this error

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.940
that I ran into which was a
very strange sort of error that

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.600
wasn't really well documented.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.850
So I did a lot of
independent reading.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.580
I talked with my lab professor
for like two hours after a lab.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.910
And by the end, it really felt
like I had independently came

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.600
to like a very deep
conclusion on this matter.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.450
It was a good experience of
sort of independent learning

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.900
and figuring things
out for yourself.
