&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.650
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Kevin Merida.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: Good afternoon.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.970
We have quite a treat.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.510 position:56%
We have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with us.

[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.750
So as you know it's a clichÃ©
but he really is somebody

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450
who needs no introduction.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.430
He is the NBA's all
time leading scorer

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.110
and a Basketball Hall
of Fame Inductee.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.840
Well since retiring after 20 years

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.650
in NBA he has been an accurate
basketball coach and the author

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.810
of 11 books, many of them
New York Times Bestsellers.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.090
We're here today to talk
about "Writings on the Wall,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.540
Searching for a New
Equality beyond Black

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.930
and White" which is his latest.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.490
Kareem also is a columnist for
Time and The Washington Post,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:21.350
where I work for 22 years, writing
on a range of topics including race

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.570
and politics, age and pop culture.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.940
In 2012, he was selected as
the US Cultural Ambassador.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.820
But I kind of come
to look at him now

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.850
as really quite the public
intellectual, a brilliant man

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
with brilliant insights
on these times.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.760
In 2004, I was still
at the Washington Post

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.130
and I'll just tell
you a brief story.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.010
Right now, I am editor-in-chief
of the undefeated ESPN's new--

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.650 position:56%
relatively new digital platform that
focuses on race, sports and culture.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.060
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.110 position:56%
When I was working on a book in 2004

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.300
and Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas and I went

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.760 position:56%
to the NBA All-Star Game in Los
Angeles and I wanted to get athletes

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.950
with cultural insights, thinking

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.370
that that might add a
dimension to the book.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.780
I came up with just Kareem, I
didn't have any schedule interview

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.320
and I asked him about
Justice Thomas.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.830
And no offense to athletes
in general,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.890
but I wasn't expecting this
really cogent assessment.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.260
There was a Leon Higginbotham
is the late federal judge

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.530
and he had written this really
tough critic of Justice Thomas

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.750
that had been circulating in
among law students and as one

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.410 position:56%
of my lawyer friend said it was like
fire on the wild prairie catching on

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.690
and burning and people
were talking it.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.040
And here was Kareem who knew about
that and he gave quite a critic

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520
which include-- was included
in my book and, you know,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.180
I left that All-Star game thinking

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.920
that this was a really
well read man.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.190
I'm really proud to be here
and to have this conversation

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.510
with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and let's get going.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:04:04.770
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.230
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.530
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: I'm
doing very well, thank you.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.380
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: Thank you.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:19.350
So this book, "Writings on the
Wall", why this book and why now?

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.300
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
this book is basically my take

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.360
on what's going on in
our country right now.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.020
We're going through a very
divisive time in our republic

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.910
and it concerns me because it seems
like Americans are not talking

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.670
to each other, they're talking past
each other, and that's not part

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.180
in our tradition and it's not
very healthy for our nation.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.970
So I am very concerned about
that and I decided to put pen

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.830
to paper and talk about it.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.790
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: You
writing the book that a lot

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.830
of the world's misery
can be attributed

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.380
to people being ill-informed,
uninformed, misinformed.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.600
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Well absolutely.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.790
People who have problems
to solve really need

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.370
to know what the facts are, right?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.060
When you don't take the
time to equip yourself

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.380
with what is actually going on,
not what people's opinions are

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.580
but what actually are the
facts, when you're not

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.650
in fact racist it's hard to
find your way out of the woods.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.280
You really keep running into
misinterpretations of things

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.410
and situations that
have to be dealt with

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.660
and it makes it very
difficult to get anything done.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.460
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: But we're
at the National Book Festival

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.270
so we know there are
lots of readers here.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.450 position:56%
I know you mentioned that, you know,
you read all the time, you know.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.600
You would read, you know, when
you were a high school athlete

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.670 position:56%
and college athlete and pro-athlete,
leaving games on planes,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.500
reading books, is that kind of
the foundation of, you know,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.300
that that something is missing
you think in this country?

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.190
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: I think
even people who don't have the time

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.220
to read can be informed
just by turning on the TV

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.210
and making sure they look at
a couple of news broadcast

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.880
and get a few different
takes on what's going

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.460
on with the current events.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.480
And that really should
prompt people to do

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.390
like a little bit more in-depth--
ask a few more in-depth questions

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.080
about what's going on and
why and it enables them

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.820
to figure what their take
on the solution should be.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.650
But people who don't
know what's going on

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.330
and who can't really describe
how things are affecting America,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.190
it's impossible for
them to contribute.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.740
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: So
we're in the final months

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.890
of this historic presidency,
the first African-American

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.520
to be president of this
country, Barack Obama.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.050
You talked about something
you called the Obama Effect,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.830
maybe explain that?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.130
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.500
what I could call the
Obama Effect is the fact

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.090
that when President Obama
was elected, people thought

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.810
that that was the end of
racism in America, after all,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.670
we picked our chief executive,
the person who is our leader.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.540
We picked an African-American
and people thought that,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.950 position:56%
geez that means that racism is over.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.790
And it was a significant
milepost but it is--

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.250
was not a sign that said
that we've reached the end

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.810
of the road and racism is over.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.990
We still have a lot of work to do.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.920
Do check out what Dr. King
said about looking forward,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.070
some of the things
we had to deal with,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:00.650
they are still very much affecting
life in America and we still have

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.100
to deal with these issues.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.770
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: You know recently,
we've seen protests certainly

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.150
in Charlotte and in
other places related

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.580
to police shootings
of African-Americans.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:22.140
How do we get past the
tension that we're seeing here

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.130
in this country related
to that subject?

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.430
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Well, I think,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.600
the only way that we can
get past the tension is

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.980
to acknowledge a few things that
historically we have not been able

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.400
to deal with because they're
very disturbing issues.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.710
The fact that blacks and other
minorities are often dehumanized

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.760
in the eyes of the average
citizen, the average white citizen

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:57.090
and that stereotypes and
generalizations about people

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:03.820
of color, different factions of the
minority communities around here,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.890
they don't really understand
them as people.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.370
They see them as objects.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:13.200
They see them as exotic creatures
but they don't see them as people

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:22.010
that have the same tendencies and
the same desires as anyone else.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.230
They kind of see them
as exotic creatures.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:31.490
Too often, black people
are seen as piece of burden

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.160
who now have become citizen.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.840
Well, we were brought here to
pick cotton and work on farms.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.000
We were not brought here to
participate in American society.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.550 position:56%
And once that happened, it created
a situation that we are still living

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.330 position:56%
with and still having problems with.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: You know there's
an interesting debate that seems

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.250
to have taken place now, at
least in the political sphere,

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.700
where there have been
these shootings, of course,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.760 position:56%
of unarmed black men and then
there's a whole other people saying,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.080
"What about black-on-black crime?"

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.100
You addressed that, I just
want to read something briefly

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.900
which I thought was
really smart, you know.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.530
And you said, "The current
card trick of politicians

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.760
and pundits is black-on-black
crime, which they use

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.670
to show the real problem
isn't white racism

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.610
but blacks attacking each other.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.100
The not-so-subtle suggestion is

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.050
that black problems are
black society's own fault

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.430
because they can't
control their own people.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.420
Black-on-black crime actually
makes the opposite point

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.710
because it's a by-product
of centuries

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.780
of interning blacks
in economic gulags."

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.080
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Exactly.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.850
The fact that black Americans
cannot access the mainstream

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:57.560
of society means that they
are forced to desperation

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.110
and the only equal
opportunity employer

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.200
for desperate people is crime.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.580
You don't have to have
any qualifications.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.760
All you have to do is be
willing to do something illegal

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.170
and maybe you can make
a few bucks doing that.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.040
And too often, blacks
and other minorities,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.050
that's the only access they have

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.100
to making any money and
this is unfortunate.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.170
It's a failure of the
educational system to prepare them

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.640
to participate legally
in our society.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.870
It's also the effect
that the destruction

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.930
of the black family has had.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.430
Black parents spend so much
time trying to keep a roof

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.550
over their family's heads
and food on their table

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.200
that they don't have time to
go to parent-teacher meetings

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.150
or help junior and little
miss with their homework.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:56.370
And again, the educational system
fails these children and they end

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.600
up having kids too early and seeing

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.820
that crime is the only
way out for them.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.690
And that this situation
repeats itself.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.290
There's more or less a pipeline

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.910
from the public school
system to the present system.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.340
This is very unfortunate and
very unnecessary but it's going

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.360
to take a supreme effort
to actually cure it

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.060
and eliminate it from our society.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.610
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: You know, you,
you know, everybody knows you

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.180
as this great athlete,
you know, leading scorer.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.550
I know some people have-- some
of your records have been broken

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.600 position:56%
but that one hasn't been broken yet.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.900
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Right.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.200
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: And--

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.970
But yet you've spent all
of these years really kind

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.760
of in the world of
the mind, you know.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.480
I've been always struck by
your perspective as an athlete

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.730
and I can't really think of
many athletes who have that kind

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.720
of deep perspective on
the subjects of the day.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:04.070
You talked about the issue of
class and inequality in your book

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.530
and specifically that, you
know, there was this passage

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.070
where you said, "If I
have been a foot shorter,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.610 position:56%
I might have been a history teacher,
trying to figure out at the end

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.580
of my career if I'm going to have
enough money and can I retire now."

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.630
When as a basketball player,
you know, in your last year,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.670
people showered you with applause
and gifts and gratitude and all

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:34.100
of these appreciation and just
that sense of does everybody here

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.610
in this country have this
same shot at success.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.290
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, that
is a very real issue and people

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:50.690
who don't have that shot at success
really have to struggle to figure

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.440
out how they're going
to make ends meet,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.850
that this is a very commonplace
issue for too many people.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.040
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: How
do we solve that?

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.620
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, I
think the only way to solve it is

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.930
to see to it that you cannot
make equality as something

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:13.980
that we champion and
something that we support.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.660
There have been a number of
studies more recently that it show

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:22.920
that the increasing of the minimum
wage really has benefited a lot

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:29.070
of people and enable a lot
more families to do better.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.990
And I think that's something that
really needs to continue to happen.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:38.880
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: What do you think
about today's athletes and the role

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.150
that they play or should
play enforcing social change,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.600
the kind of influence that they can
have we've certainly been having

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.180
this discussion ever since
Colin Kaepernick, you know,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.140
first set out the national
anthem and then took a knee

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.880
and we've been debating the
role of athletes in influence.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.600
What's your perspective on that?

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.900
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.370
I think that professional
athletes have a great platform

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.800
to use especially if they
want to use it positively.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.530
I remember when I was a kid,
so many of my heroes and people

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.640
that I look up to were athletes.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.310
And in those days, they didn't
have anything to say politically.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.910
But, you know, that's changed
and I think that doesn't have

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:28.450
to be a bad thing as long
as those athletes understand

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:34.550
that they have a responsibility,
they are role models, and whether

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.010
or not they've been listening
to Charles Barkley say

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.530
that he's not a role
model, that doesn't matter.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:45.930
They have to understand that
they have a responsibility there.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.540
But if they get that,
they can do a lot of good.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.710
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: Who were the
athletes you admire the most today?

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.430
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
I'd-- at the ESPN Awards,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:05.330
I was really happy with what
Lebron and Carmelo, Chris Paul--

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.000
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: There must
be some frenzy ESPN out there.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.300
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yeah.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.000
And D-Wade, they got up on
stage and made a very poignant

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.970
and effective statement
and they were not--

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.200
they didn't do it in a
destructive or hostile manner.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.910
I think that's the only way

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.360
that this platform can
be used effectively

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:31.700
because when people ignore what
the message is and just focus

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.660
on the fact that they had
a very hostile attitude

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.870
that that destroys the
effect of the message.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.940
So I'm really was pleased
with what they did.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.590
One of them, Dwayne Wade,
he just lost a cousin

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.460
to gun violence in Chicago.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: Yeah.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.060
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
It's a real issue.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: It was the
day after we had a Town Hall.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.520
The Undefeated sponsored
a Town Hall and--

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.820
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Right.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: --
he participated on.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.420
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yeah.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.720
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: And it was just
five minutes from that Town Hall.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.020
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Right.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.340
Michael Jordan has become involved
after sitting out for so long.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.270
He's decided to get involved.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.250
He's donated money and spoken up.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.070
Again, someone that a lot of
Americans admire and respect

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.880
and they'll listen to him.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:29.820
So I think that this platform
can be a very useful tool

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.890
in helping change take place
by giving young people an idea

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.870
of what they can do and
the best way to do it.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: You know, I kind of
wonder there's an iconic photograph

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.590
and this surfaced a lot
particularly after Ali died

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:52.100
of the Cleveland's Summit, and you
and Jim Brown and Bill Russell,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.320
Bobby Mitchell and others
gathering around Ali.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.690
This is after he'd
resisted the draft, 1967.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.990
And everybody remembers
that scene, you know.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.960
It was kind of a representation of
really prominent athletes gathering

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.260
around a prominent athlete.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.070
I kind of wondered whether
we would see something

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.720
like that after Colin Kaepernick.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.790
What are your thoughts,
prominent athletes gathering

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.740
around in a similar--

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.040
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.640
I think what Colin did really
has given a lot of the players

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.690
in the NFL an idea about
how to use their platform.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.910
So you saw demonstrations
on a number

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:42.140
of NFL fields last
Sunday of the teams.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.420
For example, the Seattle Seahawks,
they came out locked arm in arm,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:50.270
black and white players showing
some solidarity and some--

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.600
and voicing their concerns.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.800
So, you know, Colin's
example really--

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.970
has really served as a wake-up call
for a lot of professional athletes

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:05.680
to maybe think about doing
something of that nature that--

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.140 position:56%
on issues that concern them and that
they feel needed to be discussed.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.120
And I'm very happy
that that happened.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.980
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: For the early
part of your life and that goes

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.350
up to college, people
knew you as Lew Alcindor,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:31.940
and you write about
your conversion to Islam

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:37.170
and I thought maybe I would
just read a short passage.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.680
You said, "The transition from Lew
to Kareem was not merely a change

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.050
in celebrity brand name, like
Sean Combs to Puff Daddy to Diddy

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:49.760
to P. Diddy, but a change
of heart, mind and soul.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.300
Mine was not just a
simple conversion

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.480 position:56%
but also a spiritual transformation.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.750
I used to be Lew Alcindor,
pale reflection

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.620
of what white America
expected of me.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.030
Now I'm Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
the manifestation

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.020
of my African history,
culture and beliefs."

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.820
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Exactly.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:15.300
[ Applause ]

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.520
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: What has been,
to carry that a little further

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.450
for the audience, what has been
the impact of that transition

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.760
for you to where you are now?

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.270
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, in
going through that transformation,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:35.620
I felt that I assumed an
identity that was actually me

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:44.400
and that related to what I saw
was my history and my heritage

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.700
and my American heritage.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.190
Muslims took part in
the Revolutionary War.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.660
A lot of people don't understand

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.830
that because they don't have
accurate records but a lot

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.870
of the slaves that joined the
Revolutionary Army were Muslim.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.670
And some of them gained
their freedom by fighting

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.970
in the Revolutionary War.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.910
And also there were Muslims that
fought with the Camp Lafayette,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.780
Moroccan Muslims that fought
with the French contingents

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.160
of soldiers that help win the war.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.690
So, you know, Muslims
participated in America

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.580
from its very first inception.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.230
The very first country to
recognize the United States

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.590
as a sovereign nation was
the Kingdom of Morocco,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.300
and people don't realize that.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.530
So, you know, Islam has had
an interaction with our nation

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:44.020
and Muslims had been part
of our nation from day one.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.370
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: History,
you really love history.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.490
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Absolutely,
history is a great teacher.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:54.370
If we don't-- what Mr. Santayana
said-- Mr. George Santayana said,

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.100 position:56%
"Those who do not understand
history are condemned to repeat it."

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:05.830
And we'd made a lot of faux pas in
our historical efforts at times.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.690
So, you know, we have to
pay attention to the--

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.770
to what we have done in the past

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.310
because we can use these
successful efforts as a template

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:19.750 position:56%
and we can also use the unsuccessful
efforts as a warning not

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.280
to repeat those mistakes.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.720
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: So,
you as a writer,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.180
and certainly you write your books
but you write columns and some

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.840
of them are very provocative and
you become a journalist like me.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.140
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yeah.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.170
Well, I was a journalist
starting way back in 1964, right?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.690
I actually worked on a newspaper--
community newspaper in Harlem

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.370
but I was between my
junior and senior year

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.350
in high school and I was writing.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:55.620
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: And you also--
did you note on that end of it,

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.420
you said your Facebook
page is like a magnet--

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.650
a super magnet for racial
slurs, that there's a lot of--

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.950
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Oh yeah.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: -- that
kind of feedback in.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.550
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Oh, I
get a lot of negative feedback

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.330
but if you're an author
and you express opinions

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:16.040
that people feel are controversial
or not exactly according

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.080
to their taste, they're going
to let you hear about it.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.680
But I must say I get a
lot more positive feedback

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.510
than I do negative feedback.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:33.720
[ Applause ]

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.150
&gt;&gt; Kevin Merida: What's
your next book?

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.770
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: My next
book, my next book is going

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:44.940
to be a discussion of my 50-year
relationship with my high--

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.630
with my college coach, John Wooden.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.510
We had a very long and
wonderful relationship

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.650
that lasted up until he died.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.770
I was with him just three
hours before he passed away.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:03.770
And I've known him since 1965
and it was a wonderful experience

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.420
and I'm going to share it.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.340
The book is in the process
now of being written.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.400

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.790
[ Applause ]

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.840
I think we want to go
to some questions now.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.480
Do you have some line up
and Kareem will take them.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.580
&gt;&gt; I'll start, OK.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.730
You spoke that-- You say that if
you hadn't been still set foot to

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.720
or whatever, you've
been a foot shorter,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.580
you may have been a teacher.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.010
I think if you've been a foot
shorter with your intellect,

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.910
you might have been an All-Time
point guard doing great sort of.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.890
But with that being said,
you mentioned earlier

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:57.910 position:56%
about our school systems failing our
young people, what's your thoughts

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.060
on the chartered school systems?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.470
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, I
think that the school systems here

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:09.130
in America had American high
school students number one

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.740
in all the really crucial
and important disciplines

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.960
that schools teach up
until somewhere in the '60s

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.190
and then we started to fade
away when people decided

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:29.480 position:56%
that they did not want to spend the
money to support integrated schools.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.070
And that's when the public
school system started to fail.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.870
And we've got to get over that.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.080
[ Applause ]

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.550
We have to get back to
where we spend the money.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.120
There are so many great
teachers who don't teach

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.190
because they can't support
their families on the salaries

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.830
that they're offered and now
they're working for Google

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.480
and Microsoft and places like that.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.940
[ Applause ]

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:01.020
So it's my sincere hope that the
school systems start paying the

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.420
teachers what they need to be paid
because they've done a great job

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:10.730
over so many years and
given us so many capable

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.690
and wonderful people coming
out and doing all the things

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.770
that people do here in
America because we have--

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.130
this is the land of opportunity.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.110
So we got to get back to
that and not be afraid

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.840
to support these efforts
because they've been successful.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.140

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.710
&gt;&gt; It's a real thrill,
at least for me.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.470
You mentioned that you're
a student of history

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.670
and I would be really
intrigued you know who were some

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.090
of the history biography writers
that you admire and respect

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.080
and have been your
favorites over the years?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.700
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Oh
geez, that's a tough one for me

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.780
because I read so much, I don't
know where to start with that one.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.850
Well, I'm sharing those
book on Alexander Hamilton,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.810
who is probably the most
recent one that I've read

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:07.850
that really enlightened me and
helped me understand a lot more

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:12.910
about our nation and
how it was formed.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:18.810 position:56%
I go back to that one because it was
just-- it's was brilliantly written

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:24.580
and it really explained
so much about America.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.460
I've read a really good
biography on Jefferson

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.080 position:56%
and I'm forgetting the author's name
so you have to forgive me on that.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.410
"The Autobiography of
Malcolm X" was a book

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:41.800
that really helped me understand
my place here in America

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.260
and it started me my
interest in Islam.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.830
So those would be a couple
of books that I've read

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:54.100 position:56%
about historical figures that really
have helped me and grow and learn.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:00.090
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Thank you for your question.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.390
&gt;&gt; Two questions.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.580
First, are we going to get
another Mycroft Holmes novel?

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.250
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yes, we are
because my publishers begging me

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:15.360
to do another one so I got to work
on that one and I'm going to have

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.080
to wear a couple of hats to get
all these work done but yeah,

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.800
we're going to have to
do something about that.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.660
&gt;&gt; OK. And then my second
question is with there being

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.460
such a rich tradition of
African-American detective novels,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.810
when writing a detective novel, why
did you choose to base it on the--

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:42.530
like Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes
area of detective fiction?

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.830
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:50.880
I really enjoyed Chester
Himes writings about Harlem

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:57.940
and the two detectives that he
wrote about in some of his works

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:07.270
but the very first detective
novel that I read was the

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.480
"Complete Works" of
Arthur Conan Doyle.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.430
So I kind of started
on that and then I kind

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.690
of graduated to other things.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:21.030
And I just felt that I
pay no much to Mr. Doyle

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.960
because he really started it all.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.940
Well, actually Edgar
Allan Poe started all with

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.190
"The murders in the Rue Morgue".

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:32.260
But Arthur Conan Doyle
got on that train

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.100
and did a great job so that's why.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.700
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
You're welcome.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:45.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was just wondering
as a mother of teachers

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.360
and my son-in-law got
his PhD in Appalachian.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.900
I began to read history books.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.470 position:56%
I'm a product, I graduated from high
school in 1964 and at that time,

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.200
I remembered elementary
school how I was thought

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.240 position:56%
about the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.410
And then I read book
"Slavery by Another Name"

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.600
and I was very disturbed
with the misinformation

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.110
that was taught to me in my youth.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:21.070
Because slavery did not end at
with the Emancipation Proclamation,

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.570
slavery didn't end
until the mid 1940s.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.160
And I was just wondering,
how do you feel

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.950
about that the way we were taught

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.750
and what we were taught it was
slanted for the white history.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.520
And the black history
was really taught

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.120
to us the way it should have been.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.910
So, how do you feel about
that the misinformation

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.050
that was taught to us in our youth?

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.350
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.340
I think that misinformation really
is based on just a reluctant

00:30:54.340 --> 00:31:00.920
of Americans to call a spade
a spade because they would say

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.230
that once the American-- the
Emancipation Proclamation came

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.500
into effect the slavery ended.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.600
Well, certain type of slavery ended

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.870
but after the civil
war black people--

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.250
black Americans were
arrested and incarcerated

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.980
and then made to work
on chain gangs.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.070 position:56%
And it was the same cheap labor that
had existed prior to the civil war.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.960
But they're working as
convicts instead of slaves

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.830
but it was the same deal.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:39.180
And that's when you referring to
that lasted up into the 1940s.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:48.480
And then there's still
arraignment of that happening

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.640
and it's you don't do-- the way

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:56.510
that the school systems now just
channel kids to go from failing

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.630
at school to our present system.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:05.180
That's still happening and there's
no more need for cheap laborer.

[ Applause ]

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.350
So, you know, it's the same thing.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:16.510
They put a different mask on
it but it's the same phenomena

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.970
and it's something that
has to end on our country.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.860
And I think that this type

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:26.430
of institutionalized racism is
something we have to let go of.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.200
It's like a drug for our nation
that we just can't let go of.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.460
We can't allow all of
the potential from all

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.670
of the different ethnic groups
in our country to blossom

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:40.970
until we get rid

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.510
of this institutionalized
racism and I hope we do that.

&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is
Brittany [assumed spelling].

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.180
You said that your inspiration
for writing this book was

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.040
because you felt like given
the national conversation

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.110
that we weren't actually having
conversations with to each other

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.900
that we're talking past each other.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.200
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yes.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.100
&gt;&gt; And I feel that in my group
there are a lot of people like me

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.240
who are very to willing to
have that conversation at first

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.630
and now I have a lot
of frustration and find

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.470
that my Facebook friend
count is significantly lower

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.250
that it used to be.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.890
So, my question for you is
how do you recommend we have

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:33.260
that conversation and are there
some people and some situations

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.990
where the conversation
is not worth having?

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.570
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, I
would just tell you to be patient

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.140
and I would just remind
you that when we try

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.350 position:56%
to form the constitution the various
factions from the various states

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.660
at times hated each other we
wouldn't talk to each other.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:58.110
And they were totally frustrated
with the ignorance and lack

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.560
of awareness of some
of the other factions.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.440
The people from Vermont
thought that the people

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.210
from South Carolina did not
know anything and vice versa

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.110
and that could have been said about
any of the different factions.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.160
But finally, they got around
and talking to each other

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.690
and listening to each other.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.020
And you have to be able to listen
and you have to be able to speak

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.210
with respect and patience
until the other side listens.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:26.640
And if they don't want to let
go of the ideas that they have

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.670
that are destructive then
there's not much you can about it.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:37.430
But it requires patience and it's
amazing how long it takes before

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:41.880 position:56%
consensus is achieved but it's
somethings that's worth waiting for.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.710
If we hadn't done it we would
not have this coordination

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.590
and the incredible document

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.180

States Constitution.

as a fan I view it as
have sat out things.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:22.600
And I guess my questions is in the
'60s as an athlete you're a brand

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:27.980
and speaking your mind can damage
that brand especially if you're,

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.750
you know, an athlete of color
and whatnot or at least it seems

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.980
like there is that possibility.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.820
So, when you did joined up with the
other athletes in the late '60s,

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.420
early '70s and you spoke your mind.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.090
Were there any costs to you as far
as that goes and what is the cost

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.970
to athletes who do set it out.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:54.040
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, you
know, athletes who have the nerve

00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:01.230
and the courage to speak out, their
brand is affected in so much is

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.800
that people who don't
appreciate their point

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.830
of view like not support them.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:12.960 position:56%
But also in addition to those people
you will get support from people

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.500
who realized that you actually
have said something meaningful.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.140
So, you know, you lose on one end
but you also gain on another end.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:30.300
I lost the line of access to
let's say commercial viability

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:37.100 position:56%
because I was known as maybe being
a troublemaker or somebody who spoke

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.930
about issues that most
people found uncomfortable

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.660
and difficult to speak about.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.730
But we have to speak
about these things.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.530
Someone has to talk about them.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:52.540
And if you're going to be able to
affect any change you have to take

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.140
that risk, you have to be
able to risk what's going on.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.510
Muhammad Ali risked his career.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:04.430 position:56%
He lost three of his most productive
years where he could not fight

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.430
because he was stripped
of his title.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.920
But what do you had to say about
the Vietnamese War became what our

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.130
country ended up standing
up for and the fact

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.330
that the Vietnamese War
was unjust and illegal

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.280
and we finally got
behind them on that issue.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.510
So, it takes that.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.240
[ Applause ]

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.540
Yeah.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I believe it'd
be refreshing if some

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.930
of our elected officials showed
more intellectual prowess

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.550
in this relationship.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.020
And I was wondering
whether you have other--

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:45.280 position:56%
ever considered or would you
consider running for elected office?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.080
Also--

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.210
[ Applause ]

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.600
Also, would you care to comment

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.010
on the current contest
going on for the president?

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.520
[ Laughter ]

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.630
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: I comment
regularly on that in my column

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:06.210
in the Washington Post,
so you could read that.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.400
[ Laughter ]

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:15.890
And I think that we're coming
to a very crucial election here.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.490
Americans are going to make
a decision about who's going

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.510
to lead their country and I
hope that they inform themselves

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:28.010
and vote their conscience in a
meaningful way and do what's best

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.680
for the country and not
what's good for partisan game.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.530
I think if Americans are
really concerned about that

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.590
that they will do that and I
hope that's how it's works out.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you sir and
I loved your game.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.670
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Oh, thank you very much.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.120
[ Applause ]

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.040
&gt;&gt; Hi, Kareem.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.040
So, I go to school in the south
and I'm pretty visibly Muslim.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.370
So, I was just wondering how do
you deal with day long when people

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.380
with not only questions about your
blackness and about how you deal

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.040
with racism but also
about your Muslim-ness

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.860
and how you deal with Islamophobia?

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.870
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Well, for me I just--

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.660
if people are interested I explain
to them what Islam is all about

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.060
and how its helped me, how is has
been a moral anchor in my life

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.810
and enable me to tell right
from wrong and how the Prophet--

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:23.480
one of the things that Prophet
Muhammad said was seek knowledge,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.340
if you have to go from here
which was Arabia to China

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.410
which was the farthest
place away from Arabia

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.260
that the Arabs knew about.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.450
So, we have to go to great
lengths to educate ourselves

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:40.660
and that's how Islam has
affected me and its enable me

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.850
to have a moral anchor that
have served me very well.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.710
And that's all you have
to explain and your life

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.740 position:56%
and your presence will speak all the
rest to people that they'll be able

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.540
to see what your worth
is and your value just

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.040
by the way you conduct yourself.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.250
So just follow your moral compass

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.820
and I'm sure you're
going to end up being OK.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.920
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
You're welcome.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.270
[ Applause ]

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:21.310
&gt;&gt; About 30 years ago, way back
when I saw you, I heard you speak

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.140
in Auburn University
in Auburn, Alabama.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:32.300
I don't know if you remember way
back when [laughs], never mind.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:39.530
But anyway, I asked a particular
question and I don't know

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.980
if you remember the question,
if you remember the experience

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.090
and I'm going to ask
the question again.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:50.420
With you traveling around the
country and seeing certain kinds

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.770
of things over the
years and experiencing,

00:40:53.770 --> 00:41:02.740
let say down in Atlanta, the
Sweet Auburn district in Atlanta,

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:09.230
the Black Wall Street in Chicago
and The Harlem Renaissance,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:19.940
all of these experiences have
been diminished with the advent

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.530
of I would say once we
decided to integrate

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.620
into mainstream American society,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.380
we lost a lot of those
historical values.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:37.680
And what in your opinion is
the legacy of those districts

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.220
that we lost the Sweet Auburn
district, the Black Wall Street

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.510
and things of that nature?

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.710
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
I think that those things

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.560
that you just referred to, you
know, Harlem and Sweet Auburn

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.210
and the Black Wall
Street, they were result

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.920
of the segregation of our society.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:07.610
And now that our society has
partially enabled people of color

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:13.540
to succeed, those neighborhoods
have become abandoned and all

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.440
of the most successful people in
those neighborhoods have left.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.960
So that's really what the decline
of those neighborhoods represents.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:29.360
And I don't think we're going to
go back there until, you know,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.970
unless and until Americans want
to re-segregate themselves.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.800
I don't think that will happen.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.100
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.690
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: So I think
that's just a nostalgic thing.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.990
I miss Harlem.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.290
You know, I was born and--

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.890
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
-- and raised there.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.490
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: And I
know what you're talking about.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:52.090
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: But
I think we have to move on.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.390
&gt;&gt; Move on, that's right.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.690
Thank you.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.990
Thank you very much.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.290

&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Yes.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.190
&gt;&gt; A few months ago in June,

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.240
the Supreme Court heard a case
called the, "Fisher Versus Texas"

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.180
which had the potential to end
the affirmative action policies

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.480
in this country.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.530
But by a mere one vote margin, they
upheld the constitutionality of it.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.590
So affirmative action
is allowed to continue.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.090
What are your thoughts
on this decision?

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.390
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Well, I think that some type

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:24.940
of affirmative action is necessary
to heal some of the wounds

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.480
that have been inflicted on
people of color in this country.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.640
It doesn't necessarily
have to come at the expense

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:37.380
of denying other people
opportunities.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.450
But I think the affirmative action

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.750
in this country should
be an educational effort

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:48.550 position:56%
in poor communities, especially
poor communities of color where lack

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.800
of educational opportunity
really is something

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.790
that is damaging those communities
and does not allow them to thrive.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:04.120
So, you know, we can't hold people
who are alive today responsible

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.870
for things that happen
50 and 150 years ago.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.030
That's why I've never been
an advocate for reparations

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.620
but we can educate the people
who are the survivors of that,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.650
who are the descendants of people
who were victimized in those times.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:23.730
We can get them up to
speed educationally

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.330
so that they can participate
in the American society

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.970
and raise their families
and do the good things

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.510
that they have the potential to do.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.470
&gt;&gt; Hello my name is Ran
Allen [assumed spelling]

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.200
and I'm a freshman
Sports Medicine major

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.630
at Howard University,
minor in Journalism.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.570
And I read earlier or what the
years ago about how you said

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.870
that basketball was more
of a hobby and writing was

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.890 position:56%
like what you were really passionate
about and that was your career.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.250
And that's something that I'm
really interested in as well,

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:58.700
and so in doing that I
watch a lot of sports shows.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.990
And I was watching the podcast of
Undisputed where Skip Bayless said,

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:08.870
he spoke about major league
baseball player Steve Clevenger.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:13.110
And he said that he felt he
hated the fact that he had

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.710
to share the same skin tone as
him because of his comments,

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.220
the Twitter comments he made
yesterday or two days ago.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.770
And I was going to
asks you, isn't that--

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.770
this question isn't about
how to feel about those

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.780
who say the wrong things but
about the people like Skip

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.830
who actually understand that
what is being said is wrong.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.650
What was going on the
situation is wrong

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.580
but they aren't the
ones experiencing.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.440
So I was asking you, how important
do you think it is for those

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.850
who are not African-American
to speak out and be more bold

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.920
about the injustice
that is going on around?

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.560
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
I think that what you have

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.800
to understand is that
injustice affects us all.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.730
And you don't have to worry
about the color of the people

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.230
who are ignorant about that.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:01.220
So if you are-- if you understand
something, you have an obligation

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.990
to educate that person or
let them go on and continue

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.730
to be ignorant and destructive.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:16.230 position:56%
So that's on you as an individual to
impart that knowledge that enables

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:20.200
that person to correct their
course and start talking

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.580
about things that do make sense.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.880
So that's on you.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.640
That's on you as an individual
and you ask someone who cares.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.290
If you care about these
issues, you have to speak out.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.060
And don't worry about the color
of the people that you talk

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.110
to because we're all
neighbors here whether--

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.410
whatever color that you are.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:42.810
The people around you are your
neighbors and fellow citizens

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.920
and someone will need
to be educated.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.900
So you have to take that
person with responsibility

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.510
and accept the consequences
and, you know,

00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:54.360
if you don't get your
point across, you did try.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.920
And that's all you can do.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.220
&gt;&gt; Yes sir.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.020
Do you mind if I ask
one follow up question?

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.410
[ Applause ]

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:04.790
&gt;&gt; Could I ask my follow
up question?

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:09.880 position:56%
The national-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.160
The National African-American
Museum, the new one opened up today

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.410
and it's-- Matisse have
talked about it and I said

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.900
that it starts basically
with African-American slavery

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.500
and into the modern era but
everyone knows and understands

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.370
that African-American
history begins before slavery.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:29.510
And we see-- I see the museum
as more of trying to stick

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:33.210
to the political stigma of
museums as far as educating about.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.310
You start with what we think is the
worst into something that is good,

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.930
but we don't understand the
things or respect the fact

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.730
that there was more or
better things that were part

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.710
of African-American
culture before slavery.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.880
So I was going to ask you, what
do you think of the significance

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.660 position:56%
of the museum or do you believe that
there should be more added to it?

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.120
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
you know, I haven't had a chance

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.270
to check the museum out, so
I don't know what's in there.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:59.870
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
But just the fact

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.130
that they have an African-American
museum, if there are problems

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.330
with it that they can be fixed.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:10.340
That is a common thing, well, with
museums and any place that deals

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.300
in public education like that.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.600
So whatever is going on over
there, it can be fixed eventually

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.920
and if you find something wrong
with it make sure you go down there

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.180
and let your voice be heard.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.980
&gt;&gt; Yes sir, thank you.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.790
[ Applause ]

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:32.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in a recent conversational
in race, someone mentioned to me

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.550
that they felt with the election
of Obama, certain forms of racism

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.920
that were maybe covert
that people wouldn't talk

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.110
about were more vocal
on their opinions.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.510
And that kind of resonated
with me when I thought about it

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.130
and I didn't know if
what you thought

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:51.940
on that statement and
the impact of that.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, it
should be obvious, turning body look

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.350
at all the opposition
President Obama has had to deal

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.430
with trying to get things done.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.510
Look at how much he
could have gotten done.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:10.060
[ Applause ]

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.660

he could have gotten done

if he had not been opposed at every
turn by the Republicans in Congress.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.390
They really don't like him.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.740
They called him a liar
while he was trying

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.150
to address the combined
members of the House

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:30.080
of Representatives and the Senate.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.480
It's been pretty obvious
that they resent the fact

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.010 position:56%
that a black man whipped them twice.

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.810

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:45.320
[ Applause ]

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.270
And I think our country has
suffered because of that resentment

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:55.700 position:56%
and the way that they tried to speak
around the issue that, you know,

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.500
he has some good ideas and
they wouldn't work with him

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.910
so they decided they
would work against him.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.870
It's very unfortunate but
that's what we're dealing with.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.100
We're going to have to
shut this down pretty soon,

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.040
so I'm going to take
four more questions.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.670
And then we'll going
to have to move on.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:21.850
I hope you can forgive me but we
do have time concerns here, OK?

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.040
So we'll do four more questions.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.340
Yes.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.030
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Erreo
Adams [assumed spelling].

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:32.080
I'm a freshmen legal communications
major at Howard University.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:36.880
And I just wanted to ask, I have
three siblings, they're all younger

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.700
than me and two of them are my
brothers and I don't know how

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.930
to get them to understand
what's going on in the world

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.220
because like you said,
they're products

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.650
of the public schooling
system in the south.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:53.690
So they don't know what's going
on or they don't understand it

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.480
and they really have no motivation
to educate themselves about it.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.900
And I don't know how to get
them to see it without--

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.550
I don't know like slamming
it in their face.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:07.200
So how do I, you know, just
explain to them and get them

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.810
to have some motivation
about doing better?

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.060
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: That's
a very difficult thing for me

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:16.960
to answer because I don't
know them personally.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.620 position:56%
And you make me-- you've reminded me

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.570
of this statement that
ignorance is bliss.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:27.520
That's a very unfortunate
thing for your brothers.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.120
So there has to be some way
that you can point out to them

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:38.850
through practical and obvious
examples how ignorant they are

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:42.040
and how that ignorance
is hurting them.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.760
That's the only way
that you can do that.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.840
And it's going to take
an effort on your part.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.460
I don't know the specifics
in your family,

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.340
so I'm not trying to generalize it.

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:56.040
But it's going to take a
significant effort on your part.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.080
But I'm glad you care about them.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:03.410
I have written-- the very
first book that I wrote

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:07.510
after I finished my basketball
career that had nothing to do

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:10.040
with basketball is called,
"Black Profiles in Courage"

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.310
and it is an overview of
African-American history.

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.850
And I think by putting some
knowledge in front of them

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:22.430
that they can relate to, that might
help them broaden their perspective

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.800
and get a better idea on things.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.390
So just, you're going to have
to put some books in the hands

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:34.240
and from what you describe,
they probably don't read or--

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.920
&gt;&gt; I know [laughs].

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.360
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: -- some-- a
lot of people who are very hostile

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:45.410
to education sometimes are dyslexic
and maybe you might want to check

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.660
that issue out with them also

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:50.360
because that affects
a lot of people.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:56.870
You'd be surprised how many people
who are jailed are dyslexic people

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.210
who are angry about the fact that
they couldn't learn in school.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.340
So that might be an issue
but good luck with that.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.250
And I hope that you
get some success there.

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.550
&gt;&gt; OK, thank you.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.850

I was in the elevator
with you, but [laughs].

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:21.920
My question is what would you say
to young African-American teenagers

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.890
like myself trying to
navigate in a world

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.320
where innocent black
people are being shot

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.760
and there are still a
lot of racism going on?

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.060
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well, I--

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.030
the thing I tell all
young people regardless

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:37.070
of race is that knowledge is power.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:42.020 position:56%
So do the best you can to get the
most thorough and complete education

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.720
that you can in whatever field
that you feel is appropriate

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.270
for you whatever your taste
dictate on that issue.

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:55.610
And just go out in the world and
do the best you can within the area

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:57.470
that you have some reach at.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:01.130
So the people that you encounter
and your friendly members

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:05.590
or all the people that you
work with or hangout with.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.750
Make sure that you spread that
light because knowledge is power.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:13.000
And just accumulate all
the power that you can

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.300
and share it with the world.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.600

&gt;&gt; Yes, my name is Susan Shapiro.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.350
Thank you very much
for speaking today.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.920
I am presently writing a book with
a law enforcement agent to try

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.780
to change the mentality
of police officers.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:39.000
And we want to get into a real--

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.020
the elephant in the
room and I was wondering

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:46.700
if you could give some
advice on what is the core

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.350
of the-- what we need to teach.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.550
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,
I think the elephant is--

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:59.380
in the room is the way that
they have stereotype people

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:04.000
of color especially black
Americans as being prone

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.230
to criminality and ignorant.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.890
And in addition to being
ignorant, being stupid,

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:18.620
and unable to learn anything it's
a process that dehumanizes people

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:23.810 position:56%
of color and the police force think
that they're not dealing with people

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:25.160
but they're dealing with animals

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:31.080
and that brute force is usually
the easiest and most effective way

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.260
of dealing with people of color.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.440
You have to get it-- get them to
the point where they understand

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.800 position:56%
that these are people, people who
have been victimized by the dictates

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:48.140
of our society that have been so
prevalent for over two decades--

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.310
for over two centuries now.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:55.180
Until they understand that and have
some compassion, they will continue

00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:00.100
to treat them like they are animals
that need to be rudely let around.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.980
&gt;&gt; But this one law
enforcement agent is determined

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:09.580
and he has the access to get it
into the schools and he is going

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:15.680
to be hopefully be a spokesperson
for this, so thank you very much.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:31.900
&gt;&gt; Which do you like better,
basketball or writing books?

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.470
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Oh, that's very easy.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:37.890
Right now I like writing
books because I'm in no shape

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.190
to play basketball anymore.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:40.990
[ Laughter ]

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:43.700
[ Applause ]

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.050
And if I write books I get
people like you comment

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.560
and they ask me questions and
some of them read my books,

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.860
so I'm very flattered that
you asked that question

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:56.510
and I hope you read
one or two of my books.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:01.440
[ Applause ]

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.240
&gt;&gt; Karrem, thank you so
much for coming today

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.100
and for contributing your voice to
these very important conversations.

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.130
It seems to me that our
society and the world

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.670
at large these times are becoming
more divisive and very vitriolic.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:18.850
And what I was wondering
is how do we do better

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.820
because there are people even on
the progressive side of the aisle

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:26.650
who claim to be for unity but
who seem on insight divisiveness.

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.100
And it's easy to point the
finger at the other side

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.860
but what can we do better as
individuals and as a movement

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.790
and as a society to close
that gap and to become better?

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:39.090
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Well,

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:45.410
my hope issue on that is just
have some compassion of people

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:48.750
who are just locked in to
their own point of view.

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:51.330
It takes a greater effort
to get through to them

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:55.640
because they don't want to
hear anything else and you have

00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.310
to be patient enough and persistent
enough to get through that wall

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.160
that be put up around their point
of view and they're going to hold

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.960
on to it no matter how much
evidence that they have

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:11.080
that that point of
view does not work.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.400
So you have to have the
patience and the determination

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.350
to work your way through there.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:23.600
And it takes time and sometimes it
doesn't happen but whoever that is

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.540
that you're referring to I
hope you get through to them.

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.570
Because it's really having a bad
effect on our country and we got

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.890
to do something about that.

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:33.190
&gt;&gt; Right. I mean-- I'm sorry.

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:38.080 position:56%
I was more referring to like we like
a unifying voice in our generation

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.220
like a Dr. King, a voice
for peace and a voice

00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.120
that brings people together.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.320
And it seems like most of our
national dialog is around who is

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.150
at fault and how can we point
the finger at the other side

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:54.570
and how do we get back
to that unifying voice

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:59.480
and how do we get back to that one
nation standing together against,

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.260
you know, the evils of the world
instead of one nation standing

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.960
in divisiveness against itself.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.260
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:
Well, you know,

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.620
Dr. King wasn't always
a unifying voice.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.300
Dr. King offended a lot of people.

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.590
[ Applause ]

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:19.940
But the people that Dr. King
offended were trying to hold

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.530
on to points of view that were
very detrimental to our nation

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:29.690
and you just have to be
able to break through that.

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.050
That's all it is.

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:34.270
It takes time and it
takes repeated effort.

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.240
But we can get there.

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:39.630
We would not be here at
this point, so if you look

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:44.680
out in the audience it's a rainbow
and we wouldn't be at this point.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:50.260
When our nation was founded it was
for white males that own property.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.650
Women weren't allowed.

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:53.570
People of color weren't allowed.

00:59:53.570 --> 01:00:00.180
And it was only about white
people who had owned land.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.060
So, we've gotten a great distance.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.570
We have a great distance
to go but we can get there.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.100
It's just going to take patience.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.570
This is-- Are we done here?

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:15.080
Pause, another short
person there, all right.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.150
[ Laughter ]

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:19.630
How you doing?

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.630
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
part about writing?

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: My
favorite part about writing is

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:27.860
when I get the book finished.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.160
It's--

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.960
[ Laughter ]

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.690
[ Applause ]

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.910
It takes a lot of effort
to write a book

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:41.410
and when you finally get finished
it's like you've had a baby.

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:46.600
But this baby can live a much
longer than the average baby

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.090
and hopefully people will read
it and be motivated by it.

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:54.500
So thank you for your questions.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.300
Thank you very much.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:16.280
[ Applause ]

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.920
