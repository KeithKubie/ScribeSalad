00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:10.886
&gt;&gt;Student: The solar panels
would kind of be spread

00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:13.286
out between the west,
the east and the south.

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:14.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's that
gonna do to the aesthetics,

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.106
to the look of your
dome, these big panels?

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.556
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, can I show
you something on the computer?

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:20.116
&gt;&gt;Absolutely.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the
past several years,

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.846
students in Eeva Reeder's
geometry class

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.156
at Mountlake Terrace High School
have faced a severe challenge

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:29.506
at the end of the school year.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.286
&gt;&gt;Just like an open, inviting area.

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.686
&gt;&gt;Eeva: My students are engaged
in a five, six week project.

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.536
It's a culminating project
in a regular geometry class.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:41.116
They bring together everything
they've learned in the geometry class

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:43.946
and they're applying it to
solve a real world problem.

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:49.096
And the problem that they have to
solve is, how do you design a state

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:53.676
of the art high school in the year
twenty fifty on a particular site,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.556
and this is the site for this year.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.886
&gt;&gt;So you're gonna leave
the hills as they are?

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:58.696
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:00:58.696 --> 00:00:59.856
&gt;&gt;What are you gonna use them for?

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:00.746
&gt;&gt;All: Cross country.

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:03.576
&gt;&gt;Eeva: Oh, so you're just gonna
have a bunch of paths through here?

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:03.696
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:03.786
&gt;&gt;Nice.

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:05.786
&gt;&gt;Eeva: Students are in teams
of three to four and they're

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.626
in a design competition
for a contract to build it.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.186
&gt;&gt;Student: Thirty-five
by thirty-five feet long.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:14.406
The back wall is twenty feet
tall, with two ten foot pillars.

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:17.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the end of the
project, each team is required

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:18.986
to submit a site plan
for their school.

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:21.726
&gt;&gt;This actual area right here
has five buildings that act as--

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:23.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A scale model
of at least one room...

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:25.976
&gt;&gt;That the front row desk will
lower down into the ground--

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:29.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A floor plan, and a
cost estimate for construction.

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:32.826
&gt;&gt;Our total cost was eighty six
million, four hundred twenty thousand

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.846
and a hundred and twenty-two dollars.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:36.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teams submit
a written proposal

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:39.776
and give a final oral
presentation to a team of architects

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:43.496
who volunteer their time to judge
the relative merits of the proposals.

00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:46.226
&gt;&gt;Eeva: Football field, a
hundred yards, three hundred feet?

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:46.936
&gt;&gt;Hundred yards, three--

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:49.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Reeder created this
rigorous project when she realized

00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:51.396
that her students weren't able

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:53.206
to apply what they
were studying in class.

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:55.956
&gt;&gt;Eeva: It became immediately
apparent to me as a teacher

00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.936
that talking to kids didn't cause
them to really deeply learn concepts,

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:04.236
and they might learn
the material, learn it,

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:07.306
so that they could spit
back formulas and so on,

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:08.696
on a paper and pencil test.

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:13.396
But they weren't able to apply
it in a context that was outside

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:16.736
of that unit and outside of
that worksheet or book page.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:20.576
&gt;&gt;Why not have the whole side, this
wall be glass facing the water?

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:23.716
&gt;&gt;Eeva: It's when they can
use what they learn in class

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:27.406
to solve a problem that I know
that they've learned the material.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:30.046
&gt;&gt;We'd have doors leading to
the outside classroom, so--

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:33.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While students must draw
on their knowledge of everything

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:35.886
from math and English, to
the aesthetics of design,

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:39.056
they also learn an
invaluable lesson in teamwork?

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.536
&gt;&gt;Joe: We'll see how many we can
fit, we'll see how many we can fit.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.006
&gt;&gt;I'm thinking because--

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:42.886
&gt;&gt;Joe: When we finally started

00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:45.226
on the site model there was
constant little squabbling about,

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.196
"Oh, this should go there."

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.216
&gt;&gt;Student: Just the bottom row itself
just holds twelve hundred people,

00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:49.346
right?

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:51.336
&gt;&gt;Joe: No, no, no, this entire
thing holds twelve hundred people.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:52.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, the entire school.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:55.826
&gt;&gt;Eeva: They're faced with
this really complex problem

00:02:56.096 --> 00:03:00.176
that has certain constraints and
they have to figure out how to begin

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:03.866
to make the decisions and move the
process forward, and how do you do

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:05.576
that decision making within a group?

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:09.506
These are the things that are really
maybe the most powerful learnings

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:10.736
that come from it.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:16.366
The real life, problem solving,
communication collaboration skills.

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:18.836
&gt;&gt;Joe: I did learn how
to work with people

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:23.476
that didn't think the way I did,
thought nonlinear, didn't believe

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:24.726
in deadlines sort of thing.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.126
They really think out of the
box, which is not like me.

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:28.896
I'm a completely in
the box kinda person.

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:30.366
You gotta make sure
you work together.

00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:31.296
&gt;&gt;Man: You might be able

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:34.256
to just kinda quickly
build a little model of it.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Seattle architects,
Mark Miller and Kirk Wise,

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:40.346
have played a key role in the design
project for the last eight years,

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.416
acting as mentors, coaches,

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:44.696
and ultimately judges
of the students' work.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.326
&gt;&gt;There's also escalators--

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:50.026
&gt;&gt;Eeva: A hugely important piece
of a really effective project is

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:54.276
to have the audience for the
student work be someone outside

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:54.966
of the classroom.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.766
So I go out into the community

00:03:57.766 --> 00:03:59.866
and I find someone who's
willing to look at their work.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.306
&gt;&gt;Man: Which means that you
use the sunlight for daylight.

00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:07.526
&gt;&gt;Eeva: The quality of student work
really does go through the ceiling

00:04:07.596 --> 00:04:11.236
because they care about
these architects' opinions.

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:12.346
&gt;&gt;Man: And so these are great ideas.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:15.986
You're sort of dissolving
the concept of a wall,

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.516
dissolving this idea
of indoor, outdoor.

00:04:19.516 --> 00:04:22.836
&gt;&gt;Shaun: It felt so good
to do it and to present it

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:27.836
to like architects really boosted up
the confidence, and I really wanted

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:31.976
to put an impact on them,
and show 'em all I got.

00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:40.946
&gt;&gt;Girls: Hi, we're max.

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:45.396
We'll take you to the max-imum.

00:04:46.356 --> 00:04:49.836
&gt;&gt;Girl: In the beginning,
we decided to start

00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:52.186
with the floor plans and the designs.

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:56.876
Our school has one main building with
four buildings onto the side of it

00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:58.896
where it's connecting with walkways.

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:03.746
Can you guys imagine what it'd
be like just walking into a room

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:06.186
and all you see is just three
feet of wall with brick,

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:08.656
and then the rest windows,
even on top of you.

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:11.486
That's what we have in
our model right here.

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:13.616
&gt;&gt;Student: The classroom
is built down twenty feet,

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:17.586
so the back wall is
into the hill itself.

00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:20.146
The rest of the walls
are made of glass.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.986
The two side walls are
clear so you can look out

00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:25.926
and have no disruption
with your view.

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:28.746
The silver pad is a light projection

00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:32.916
and the little white
square is a three hundred

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.816
and sixty degree hologram.

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:36.636
This hologram is your teacher.

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.096
This hologram teacher can
change for your subject,

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.196
if you want math, you
can get Miss Reeder.

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:45.296
If you want physics,
you can get Einstein.

00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:47.076
It's all programmed in.

00:05:47.956 --> 00:05:51.106
&gt;&gt;Student: Education in the year
two thousand fifty is very different

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.326
from the way it was at the
beginning of the century.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:57.406
Class sizes are smaller,
school budgets are much larger,

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:01.126
and most importantly, students
are taught differently.

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.486
Education, it has become
project based.

00:06:04.926 --> 00:06:07.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Spending six weeks
on a single project at the end

00:06:07.626 --> 00:06:11.196
of the school year is a bold
teaching strategy, but for Reeder

00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:13.346
and her students, the
gamble pays off.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:17.036
&gt;&gt;Eeva: My colleagues ask me,
how do I possibly find time

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:21.586
for project based learning when
there are so many concepts to cover,

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:23.776
so much curriculum to
cover and the pressure

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.756
to get students ready
for high stakes tests?

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:30.236
And my answer to them is that applied
learning, or project based learning,

00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:34.536
is the most effective way
to deliver information

00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.576
and it's the most effective way for
students to understand concepts.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:42.376
Once they have learned a skill
by having to use it, it's theirs.

00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:43.726
You don't need to cram
for it on the test.

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.936
It's a way of learning
information that works.

00:06:52.386 --> 00:06:55.656
&gt;&gt;Hey, you guys, everybody wants
to direct their attention that way.

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:56.926
&gt;&gt;Yes, Whoa.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.656
&gt;&gt;You will see the Rainier Tower.

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:01.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On the final day of
the class architecture project,

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:05.016
Eeva Reeder's students went on
a field trip to check out some

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:06.836
of Seattle's landmark structures.

00:07:07.196 --> 00:07:12.556
&gt;&gt;The center of gravity for that
building is a giant concrete base

00:07:12.916 --> 00:07:14.386
below the building.

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:16.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But the most
eagerly anticipated stop

00:07:16.246 --> 00:07:19.786
on the trip was a visit to the
architectural firm of Wise Miller.

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:23.446
&gt;&gt;Man: Good morning,
glad you could make it.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.416
&gt;&gt;Man: These are sketches that
we did for the high school.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.366
You can see the light--

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:29.606
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students were
eager to learn about the work

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:31.786
of these two prominent
Seattle architects,

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:35.176
but they were also anxious to find
out what grades they were going

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:38.186
to get from them on this,
the final day of assessment.

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:42.316
&gt;&gt;Man: And then they had the library
rotating and they made a point

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.536
of saying that it needed
to be larger.

00:07:45.156 --> 00:07:47.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The architects'
judgment counts for forty percent

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.286
of a student's final
grade for the project.

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:52.656
It's just part of the
sophisticated rubric

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:54.866
that Reeder has refined
over the years.

00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:56.526
&gt;&gt;Eeva: I have to come up with ways

00:07:56.696 --> 00:07:59.826
to assess those products
and performances.

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:03.596
So I look at the site plan and
look at the perspective drawing.

00:08:03.596 --> 00:08:07.136
I read the proposal and I
have a scoring guide developed

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.276
for each one of those.

00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:13.366
But I think that the most powerful
assessment for this project is

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:14.546
that provided by the architects.

00:08:14.596 --> 00:08:17.906
&gt;&gt;Man: And again, you will remember
this activity your whole lives

00:08:18.696 --> 00:08:19.836
and it will make a difference.

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:22.646
What you've done is
very good and we want

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:25.426
to recognize the best of the best.

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:27.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With the moment of
truth at hand, students were able

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:32.346
to taste the thrill of winning,
or the agony of losing a contract.

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:36.216
&gt;&gt;Man: We have three groups
that we wanna recognize, ADP,

00:08:36.636 --> 00:08:39.916
SK and Max, if you'd come up.

00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:44.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This was also a time to
celebrate the diverse inspirations

00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:47.486
and surprising talents that emerge
during the course of the project.

00:08:48.006 --> 00:08:51.216
&gt;&gt;Man: You had a level of comfort
as you presented your work,

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:54.926
and when you know your work,
and you know what you're saying,

00:08:54.926 --> 00:08:57.196
and you believe it, it comes through.

00:08:57.586 --> 00:08:59.506
And so we wanted your building,

00:08:59.656 --> 00:09:02.986
because you were doing a good
job in your presentation.

00:09:03.756 --> 00:09:06.526
We're ready for best architecture.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:11.336
Best architecture category
goes to Yin Yang.

00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:21.116
Your architectural solution was
just very-- it's almost animate.

00:09:21.256 --> 00:09:21.906
You used that word--

00:09:21.906 --> 00:09:23.016
&gt;&gt;Eeva: Hearing the
architects, they said like,

00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:25.606
"Now this is a building I'd like
to work together with you on."

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:28.796
You can't duplicate that
experience in a classroom.

00:09:28.796 --> 00:09:33.536
&gt;&gt;Man: But we really like those
arms that reached down the hillside,

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:37.516
and we could see the classroom
learning going indoor and outdoor.

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:42.256
&gt;&gt;Eeva: It's so powerful for the
students because they have someone

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:45.526
who can deeply appreciate what
it is they've struggled with

00:09:45.526 --> 00:09:47.446
and gone through, and someone

00:09:47.446 --> 00:09:51.306
who can just really let them know
what a fabulous job they've done.

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:52.756
&gt;&gt;Man: Are we ready for the final?

00:09:53.416 --> 00:10:01.876
Best overall project for this
year, I have to tell you,

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:06.476
that the winner was won by one point.

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:12.126
The winner this year goes to SK.

00:10:12.426 --> 00:10:13.526
Come on up.

00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:24.246
&gt;&gt;Eeva: To hear someone honoring
their ideas, that gives me chills.

00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:26.926
&gt;&gt;Man: And their presentation
was very strong.

00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:32.846
Their educational concept
was just wonderful.

00:10:33.036 --> 00:10:35.996
&gt;&gt;Eeva: All of the little details of
the hassle of arranging field trips

00:10:35.996 --> 00:10:39.556
and making all this come together,
it's just completely worth it.

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:43.116
