00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.359
&gt;&gt;FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: We have had a bad banking situation.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt;MEHRSA BARADARAN: Banking has always been, and will always be entangled with the government.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.700
The state has certain either credit policies or monetary policies that they enact through banks.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.700
What the banks need from the government is that trust, right?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.800
Banks need the citizenry to entrust them with our deposits, our hard-earned savings.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.079
And so, that's what the government gives to banks, they guarantee our deposits.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.340
&gt;&gt;FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: We do not want--and will not have--another epidemic of bank failures.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.160
&gt;&gt;MEHRSA BARADARAN: So insofar as you have this federally supported banking sector,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.380
there's always been a recognition in banking policy that there has to be a place

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.059
for banks that have a soul, right, that bank to people of lower means, the low income.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
And so, throughout history, especially in the 1900s, you have this movement for the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.319
credit union, the savings and loan, Morris banks, things like that.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.560
And they're incredibly successful. But then, sort of, something happens to these banks

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.720
as banking transforms in the 1970s, where banking becomes much more competitive,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
and it becomes much more difficult for small banks that are regionally focused,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.160
or that deal primarily with small sums or just residential loans to survive against

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.420
the big money market banks. And so, it's either, you compete with banks for maximum profits,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
or you keep your mission of serving the low income. It ends up that you can't do both.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.160
And so, they sort of en masse leave urban areas, very poor rural areas,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.660
and they go into higher income areas.
And as they do, the fringe lenders come in to fill the void.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.460
Payday lenders, check cashers, title lenders, can gain a huge profit from banking to the poor,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.820
because the business model is such that you have to keep renewing the loan,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.399
and it keeps accumulating interest and fees before you end up paying it off.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.609
So, baked into the payday lending business model is this idea that you're going to be

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.649
indebted for a very long time. It's a trap that a lot of low income people get into.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.040
But it's a completely rational choice that the poor make. Before people go to payday loans,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.160
it's clear that they've tried every other alternative. They've tried, you know, bank loans,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.400
they've tried credit card loans, they usually have tried family. So this really is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.080
an act of desperation. Which is the reason why payday loans charge the absolute maximum

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.160
allowable by state, right? So a lot of times payday lenders say things like, "Well this is the market price."

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.600
There is no market for a desperate loan.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.000
And so the federal government is providing this very low cost credit, it's supposed to sort of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.600
go through the banks and get to the public, and insofar as it's not getting through the banks

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.040
to certain portions of the public, let's just send it there directly. The best way, I think, to do this is through

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.300
the existing post office structure. Not only because the post office exists in every zip code,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.240
but because the post office doesn't have an incentive to take advantage of the poor.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.420
You have an institution that is essentially responsible to the public.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.520
It's an easy solution to a massive problem.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.100
You already have public funds going into the banking sector, let's just let public funds

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.380
go directly to the poor,
and cut out the middle man.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.500
&gt;&gt;FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT:  And so it became the government's job to straighten out this situation.
