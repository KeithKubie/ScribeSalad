00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
 

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.700
What I want to do in this
video is prove to you

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.160
that the square root
of 2 is irrational.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.280
And I'm going to do this through
a proof by contradiction.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.970
And the proof by
contradiction is set up

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.690
by assuming the opposite.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.860
So this is our goal, but
for the sake of our proof,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.550
let's assume the opposite.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.330
Let's assume that square
root of 2 is rational.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.017
And then we'll see if we
lead to a contradiction,

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:31.600
that this actually
cannot be the case.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.516
And if it cannot be the
case that is rational,

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:37.330
if we get to a contradiction by
assuming the square root of 2

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.360
is rational, then we have to
deduce that the square root

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.760
of 2 must be irrational.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.500
So let's assume the opposite.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.220
Square root of 2 is rational.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.860
Well, if the square
root of 2 is rational,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.900
that means that we can
write the square root of 2

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.310
as the ratio of two
integers, a and b.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.250
And we can also
assume that these

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.654
have no factors in common.

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:07.820
Let's say that they did
have some factors in common.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.990
If we divided the numerator
and the denominator

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.660
by those same factors, then
you're getting into a situation

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.230
where they have no
factors in common.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.826
Or another way of saying is
that a and b are co-prime.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.200
Or another way of
saying it is we

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.060
could write this as a
ratio of two integers

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.590
where this is irreducible,
where these no longer share

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.690
any factors.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.180
If you can write anything as
the ratio of two integers,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.770
then you could obviously
simplify it further,

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.730
factor out any common
factors to get it to a point

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.600
where it is irreducible.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.400
So I'm going to assume
that my a and b,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.720
that this fraction right
over here, is irreducible.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.770
And this is important for
setting up our contradiction.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.483
So I'm going to assume that this
right over here is irreducible.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.960
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.909
a and b have no
factors in common.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.450
Let me write that
down because that's

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.120
so important for this proof.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.450
a and-- want to do
that same color--

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:11.135
a and b have no factors in
common, other than, I guess, 1.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:19.380
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.630
So this is irreducible.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.350
These two numbers are co-prime.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.590
So what does that do for us?

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.130
Well, let's just try to
manipulate this a little bit.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.810
Let's square both
sides of this equation.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.210
So if you square the
principal root of 2,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.040
you're going to get 2.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.520
And that's going to be equal
to a squared over b squared.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.930
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.970
And that just comes
from a over b squared

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.800
is the same thing as a
squared over b squared.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.020
And now we can multiply both
sides of this by b squared.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:02.370
And so we get 2 times b
squared is equal to a squared.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.210
Now, what does this
tell us about a squared?

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.230
Well, a squared is some
number, b squared times 2.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.170
So anything times 2 is going--
this is going to be an integer.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.890
We assumed b is an integer, so
b squared must be an integer,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.120
and so you have an
integer times 2.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.910
Well, that must give
you an even number.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.860
That must give you
an even integer.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.990
So this right over
here, a squared,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:35.830
must be-- so this tells us
that a squared must be even.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.240
Now, why is that interesting?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.890
Well, a squared is the
product of two numbers

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.810
or is the product
of the same number.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.260
It's a times a.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.850
So this is another way of
saying that a times a is even.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.160
So what does that
tell us about a?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520
Let's just remind ourselves.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.210
a is either going to
be-- we're assuming

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.960
a is an integer-- a is either
going to be even or odd.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.020
We just have to remind
ourselves if we multiply

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.120
an even times an even,
we get an even number.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.800
If we multiply an odd times
an odd, we get an odd number.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.710
So we have a number
times itself.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.700
We got an even number.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.140
Well, the only way to get that
is if that number is even.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:27.110
So this tells us that a is even.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.960
And another way of
saying that a is even

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.640
is to say that a
can be represented

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.210
as the product of 2
times some integer.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.510
So let's say some integer k.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.300
So where is all of this going?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.400
Well, as you'll
see, we can then use

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.100
this to show that b
must also be even.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.350
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.660
So let's go back to this
step right over here.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.122
If we say that a
can be represented

00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:58.830
as two times the
product of some integer,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.140
and that comes out of
the fact that a is even.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.280
Then we can rewrite this
expression right over here

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.980
as 2-- I'll do it
over here-- 2 times

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:17.600
b squared is equal
to 2k squared.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.230
Instead of a squared, I
could write 2k squared.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.160
We're claiming,
or we're deducing,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.790
that, assuming everything we've
just assumed, that a is even.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.920
So if a is even, it
can be represented

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.840
as a product of 2
and some integer.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.970
And then we can write
that 2 times b squared

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.670
is equal to 4k squared.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.190
 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.790
And then you divide
both sides by 2.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.655
You get b squared is
equal to 2k squared.

00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:58.790
 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.310
And this tells us
that, well, k squared

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.300
is going to be an integer.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.903
You take any integer
times 2 you're

00:06:04.903 --> 00:06:06.080
going to get an even value.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.970
So this tells us that
b squared is even.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.080
 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.020
So that tells us that
b squared is even.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.380
Well, if b squared is even, by
the same logic we just used,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.960
that tells us that b is even.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.470
 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.530
So here's our contradiction.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.950
We assumed, in the
beginning, that a and b

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.640
have no common
factors other than 1.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.360
We assumed that this fraction
right over here, a/b,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.960
is irreducible.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.577
But from that and
the fact that a/b

00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:42.160
must be equal to the
square root of 2,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.770
we were able to deduce that
a is even and b is even.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.670
Well, if a is even
and b is even,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.350
and they both have
2 as a factor,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.710
and then this isn't irreducible.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.810
You could divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2. a

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.050
and b have a common factor of 2.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.260
So let me write this down.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.960
So this is just
to make it clear.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:16.500
So from this and this, we have
a and b have common factor of 2,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.690
which means that a
over b is reducible.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.115
And so that's the contradiction.

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:24.350
 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.950
So you assume that
square root of 2

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.840
can be represented as an
irreducible fraction a/b,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.260
irreducible because you can
say ratio of two integers

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.870
right over here, that leads
you to the contradiction

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.000
that, no, it actually
can be reducible.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.080
So, therefore, you cannot
make this assumption.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.280
It leads to a contradiction.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.012
Square root of 2
must be irrational.

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:46.512
