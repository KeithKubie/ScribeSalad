LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.535
I'm Louis Gray.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:12.980
I'm joined here with John Hanke

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.620
from the Niantic Project.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.850
Welcome, John.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.700
JOHN HANKE: Thank you.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.750
LOUIS GRAY: Now the
Niantic Project

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.930
actually is really cool.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410
I think you guys have a couple
of games that are out.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.500
You've got "Project Ingress,"
and you have "Field Trip,"

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.480
which isn't so much a game.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.720
But both of them are really tied
to discovering the world

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.730
around you.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.320
So I want a couple questions
to start us off.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.250
First of all, what is
the Niantic Project?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.140
It is part of Google, right?

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.970
JOHN HANKE: Well, we try
to keep it a little bit

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.640
mysterious.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.990
But yes, it is part of Google.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.760
We're kind of like a little
startup in Google.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.200
And I guess the goal of the
Niantic Group is to explore

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.560
these kinds of applications in
mobile that use location and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.410
explore this area of ubiquitous
computing, things

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.460
that are telling you about the
world around you, helping you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.790
explore, but without necessarily
using an app in a

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.850
conventional sense.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.300
LOUIS GRAY: You have a
history of working

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.260
with startups, anyway.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.130
You came from Keyhole with the
Google acquisition of Keyhole

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.810
and really became the backbone
of Google Earth and a lot of

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.040
the other work that
we've done.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.510
It really seems you have
a passion for maps.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.990
Help us understand how both of
those projects, Ingress and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.760
Field Trip put together, are
helping Google's location

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.420
information get better or
helping users know more about

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.300
their world.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.040
JOHN HANKE: Yeah.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.170
I love maps, obviously.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.760
I came in in 2004 with Keyhole
and was the Product Lead for

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.960
that part of Google for
about seven years.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.090
During that time, I used to
daydream about other things

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.690
that we could do with
the mapping

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.390
data and the resources.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.580
And one of those things
was a game.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.800
And as smartphones started to
proliferate, I felt like the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.530
time was right to tap into all
of the mapping data that we

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820
have and to create an awesome
game for mobile that would

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.770
encourage people to really get
out and explore their world.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.390
And that's really the spirit
behind both "Ingress" and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.800
"Field Trip."

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.970
LOUIS GRAY: So let's talk a
little bit about Ingress.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.480
What is the deal, anyway?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.070
For those who haven't played
it, how do you describe it?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.250
And what's the difference
between the Resistance and the

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.500
Enlightened, for those
who don't know?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.280
JOHN HANKE: The story behind
Ingress is, it's a science

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.610
fiction themed story that really
puts a layer of reality

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.950
onto the world around you.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.160
So there's a mysterious energy
that's been tapped into in a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.420
lab in Geneva, Switzerland.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.510
And through the story of
Ingress, you begin to learn a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.960
little bit more about
that energy.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.150
It's called exotic matter
in our world.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.370
And as it turns out, it's
all around the globe.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.210
And it's concentrated in these
places called portals, which

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.010
often are pieces of public
art or museums

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.620
or historical sites.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.870
And you use the Ingress
application on your Android

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.050
phone to discover those places
in the real world and then to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.810
tap into them.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.210
And you can mine virtual
objects.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.050
You can interact with them and
you can try to take control of

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.405
those locations for one
of two fractions--

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:55.920
LOUIS GRAY: One of
the two teams.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.630
JOHN HANKE: --the Enlightened
and the Resistance.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.640
LOUIS GRAY: And so as a player,
you pick a team, and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.830
you go find these portals.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.850
And you have to blow them up and
use up your XM energy and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.690
all of that.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.080
Now poor me, I find myself often
trying to take my Level

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.730
3 or Level 4 skills.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.360
I just can't blow up
a Level 8 portal.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.510
When you look at Ingress, is
there room for the novice

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.500
player who's just starting it
now or wants to get into it?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.620
Or have all the places basically
been locked down by

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.550
the hardcore players?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.800
JOHN HANKE: Yeah.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.690
There's definitely room.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.040
One of the things that we didn't
expect with Ingress was

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.620
how much teamwork and
collaboration

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.900
would end up emerging.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.390
But we found that people really
love getting together

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.440
and playing in groups
and having meetups.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440
We're having one here in San
Francisco this week.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.670
But we have them all
around the country,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.880
all around the world.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.540
So it's a great way for a new
player to kind of get into the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.630
game would be to meet up with
other Ingress players.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.120
And some of the more senior
players really love taking a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.520
newbie under their wing and
showing them the ropes and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.530
also helping them level up in
the game and become powerful

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.680
enough to start affecting
the real global battle.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.930
LOUIS GRAY: And you have
something special going on

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.480
here at Google I/O.
Is that right?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.810
JOHN HANKE: Yeah.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.720
There's kind of a game
within a game.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.600
So we're doing two things.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.940
We're doing Operation Fan-Out,
which all I/O attendees are

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.180
able to take part in that.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.430
And if you level up during I/O,
you get a really cool

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.720
Ingress t-shirt.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.320
If you show up as a Level 8
already, we have a special

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.780
Level 8 t-shirt for you.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.019
And we have another thing
that's open to non-I/O

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.709
attendees as well.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.800
It's called Operation
Bowstring.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.829
And that's being played out
across San Francisco.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.980
And it culminates in an event
on Thursday night at Cupid

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.650
Span, which is down in the
Embarcadero, with a meetup

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.470
over at the Alchemist
bar later.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.850
LOUIS GRAY: "Ingress" right
now is Android-only.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.110
"Field Trip" is available for
both Android and iOS.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.350
How do you see that the users
of the different operating

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.830
systems use the apps
differently?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.320
JOHN HANKE: Yeah.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.620
I guess if you were to look at
Field Trip, it's available for

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.640
iOS and for Android.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.840
It's rolling out globally
today, actually.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.500
Initially, it was a US-only
launch and in the UK.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.800
There are subtle differences.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.590
We've noticed that Android
users tend to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.310
spike on the weekends.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.860
And they're out using and so
maybe exploring more than

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.670
their iOS counterparts.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.860
I don't know if that means that
Android users are more

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.820
into exploration
than iOS users.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.750
But yeah, there are
small differences.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.500
LOUIS GRAY: Should we expect
to see even more products

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.850
coming out of Niantic Project?

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.790
JOHN HANKE: Well,
you never know.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.570
We are looking at a range
of technologies

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.010
in this mobile space.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.860
We're very interested in
wearable computing and what

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.300
you can do with it.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.140
But the things that we're
putting all of our energies

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.500
behind right now are "Ingress"
and "Field Trip."

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.780
LOUIS GRAY: So I should expect
to have "Ingress" on my Glass

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.470
any day now is what
I'm hearing.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.090
JOHN HANKE: Well, I think Glass
would make an excellent

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.130
platform for some
awesome games.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.200
So we'll see about that.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.490
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.130
Absolutely.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.180
Now one last question
before we wrap.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.670
Niantic Project, as a startup
at Google, do you have more

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.930
freedom to do more things?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.220
What does that mean to be within
Google but also be

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.090
within this tiny
little enclave?

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.050
JOHN HANKE: It was a
great opportunity.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.660
It was set up with Larry's
support so that we could

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.310
pursue this area across ideas
and concepts, from mobile to

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.360
social to geo, and try to weave
those things together in

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.770
new ways to explore what could
be done to create apps that

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.460
were really native to the new
wave of devices that will be

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.860
coming, wearables.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.250
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.680
Well, I appreciate you taking
the time, John.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.670
I know we've been real quick
jumping into "Ingress" and

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.120
"Field Trip." For those of you
who haven't download those

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.250
apps already, definitely
check them out.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.240
We have more exclusive GDL
at I/O content coming.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.190
And we'll be talking about
Google Now with

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.640
Baris Gultekin at 3:25.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.790
So please stay on the stream
and enjoy your sessions.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.040
We'll be right back.
