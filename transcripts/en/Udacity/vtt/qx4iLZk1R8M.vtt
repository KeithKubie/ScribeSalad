00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.500
Let's look at the solution to the first part of our quiz. The question was,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.190
what is in these registers and in these RAT entries? And to answer that,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
we need to consider all of the things that can happen in this cycle.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.770
One of the things that happens is we will try to issue this instruction.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.100
That might update the RAT. Another thing that we need to consider is that this

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.990
instruction will broadcast its result, and that might also update the RAT and

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.850
write to a register. We can do this in either order, but

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.490
we have to figure out if they update the same thing, what happens. So let's see.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.558
Issuing this instruction results in looking at the RAT entries for

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:49.596
F0 and F1. And then, writing to the entry for

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:56.290
F1 the number of the reservation station where we put this instruction.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.070
Because there is an available reservation station,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.470
this instruction will issue there. So the entry for

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.940
F1 will be changed to point to a reservation station 2. The registers

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.450
are not updated when we issue an instruction. So they stay the same for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.550
now. The broadcast of the result might update both the RAT and the registers.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:27.110
Let's first see what happens to the RAT. We're broadcasting that RS0 is now 4.4.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.350
And that will be written to registers. So from now on, we will not be using RS0

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.740
as the name for this value. That means that this RAT entry will

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.730
from now on be pointing to the actual register, where we write this result, and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.990
that register is F0. So this RAT entry from now on points to the registry file.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.420
Because the RAT entry was pointing to RS0 and RS0 is broadcasting,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.220
that means that the register file will get value 4.4 for that register.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.560
So the register here will change and finally this register here,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.910
nobody wrote to it in this cycle, so it stays the same as it was.
