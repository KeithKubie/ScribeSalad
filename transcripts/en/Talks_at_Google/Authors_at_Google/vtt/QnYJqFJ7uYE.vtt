KEVIN VIK: Very
delighted to have

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.290
the writer and director of the
film "Screenagers," Dr. Delaney

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.790
Ruston.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.098
So let's welcome her.

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:16.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.930
So, Delaney, tell us about
just what the film is about

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.295
and where you got
this idea from.

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:23.170
DELANEY RUSTON: Sure.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.230
Well, "Screenagers"
is a film that

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.020
looks at my personal
story and the stories

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.010
of all different age groups
about the impact of all

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.830
this screen time on kids.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.550
And really, as a physician,
I was interested in this.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.980
But most importantly, as a mom,
with two young teenagers who

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.360
wanted more and
more screen time,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.350
I was really figuring
out, ah, what do I do,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.420
feeling really out of control.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.480
And often is the case
when I feel this way,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.130
is I start filming, and now
here we are with "Screenagers"

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.970
out for almost a year now.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.157
And it is just creating
a huge movement,

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:09.490
and I'm really excited about
that and excited to be here

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.510
at Google talking about it.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.010
KEVIN VIK: What has been the
response from parents, and even

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.610
from some kids or teenagers
that you've shown this to?

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.940
DELANEY RUSTON: Yeah, I mean
parents really want solutions.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.430
And so I really made sure
that the film was about that.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.190
And what I really
wanted to do is

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.220
get people talking,
because it was interesting.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.840
I had been doing films
on mental health issues,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.450
and I did one, for example,
on global mental health.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.060
Trying to find people
in China and India

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.370
to talk about mental
illness is not easy.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.050
I came back here.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.470
Trying to find parents to talk
about struggles in their home

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.740
was so much harder,
and I realized

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.300
how private parenting is.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.560
And so I wanted the film
to be shown in communities

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.285
and get kids, parents, teachers,
all of us talking about how are

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.190
we going to manage
this for our kids,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.380
how are we going to
get them to manage it.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.560
And the response has been,
that's great, I brought my kid,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.650
we had a great talk,
we're still talking.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.100
Educators are talking now with
their kids about these issues

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.200
more, so that's been great.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.860
Kids really like the
science, which has been fun.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.830
Sometimes they're defensive, and
then it's a great conversation

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.670
to have with them.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.110
What did this bring up with you?

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.400
What are appropriate
screen time limits?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.040
So it's been across the board
critical in making discussions

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.254
happen, and that's
really what my goal was.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:30.920
KEVIN VIK: Well, it's
a phenomenal film,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.790
and seeing it, and
seeing it's very funny--

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.350
we were laughing.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.230
I came in a group was laughing a
few times during the screening.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.210
I was laughing.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.827
What was so interesting was--

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.160
I guess, what were some of
the surprises that you found?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.850
Because I found a
lot of surprises

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.160
myself just from
listening to it.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.260
I'm like, oh, wow, that hits
the nail right on the head.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.970
But what were some
of the surprises

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.470
that you found that
you may not have

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.914
known before just outside
of your own child,

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:54.580
your own experience
with your own child,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.350
that other parents
were experiencing?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.300
DELANEY RUSTON:
Well, first, I have

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.840
to say when my daughter saw the
film for the first time, who's

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.340
in the film--

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.000
here I was.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.460
I had been making it
for a couple of years,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.266
and the first reaction
was, I didn't realize

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.140
other kids were dealing
with all these issues

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.059
around rules or not.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.350
I'm like, Tessa, what have we--

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.200
KEVIN VIK: Like
she's the only one.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.902
DELANEY RUSTON:
Yes, the only one.

00:03:15.902 --> 00:03:17.200
KEVIN VIK: The only
one dealing with this.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.240
DELANEY RUSTON: And
I think parents often

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.310
feel that way, too.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.035
And it's particularly
interesting

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:25.660
that parents feel self-conscious
about talking about solutions.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.940
You do hear parents
saying I'm struggling,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.570
but in terms of saying
what kind of rules

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.870
they've tried and haven't
tried, you feel really judged.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.555
And that's what I
really wanted to say.

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.680
We've got to get out there.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.480
We've got to be
talking about how

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.880
do we decide when tech should
be put away and in what spaces.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.550
And that's not
necessarily easy to do

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.779
when it is so dopamine-rich.

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.320
And to answer your
question, in terms

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.250
of surprises that I found
looking at the science,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.850
was first and
foremost that there

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.250
is no other age in our
life than our teenage years

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.220
when our pleasure
center is physically

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.250
the biggest, that you have
the most dopamine there

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.030
at any time.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.880
So it wasn't that it
was our first-time kiss

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.810
that it was so great.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.750
It was actually that we were
pumping dopamine at that time.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.240
And so what the
kids' experiences

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.460
are and their vulnerability to
that intense dopamine rushes

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.980
from some of the most
fascinating video games

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.380
and all sorts of things--

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.240
that's what we really
have to be aware of

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.620
and be responsible about
stepping up to the challenge

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.744
that we can create
balance around this.

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.660
KEVIN VIK: How did you
deal with your daughter

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.410
when you look at--

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.150
I mean, you came up
with this contract.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.441
I thought it was really funny,
where you made basically

00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:47.280
this four- or five-page
contract for her.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.480
And so but what is that
balance when you have--

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.604
because it was interesting.

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:54.010
What you asked your daughter
was, why do you want a phone?

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.260
Convince me why you need
this smartphone, why you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.550
need this iPhone or whatever.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.090
And she-- all my friends
have it and everyone has it.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.500
So I mean, as a parent,
how do you say no to a kid

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.180
when everyone else is doing it?

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.860
Because at that age it doesn't
matter what their parents say.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.230
It just matters everyone
else is doing it,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.640
so I should be able to do it.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.040
DELANEY RUSTON: Yeah.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.350
You know, it's interesting.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.950
One of the movements that
we've started with the film

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.280
is called Tech Talk
Tuesday, and it's exactly

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.530
about having these kinds
of conversations that

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.360
are easy to not have to do.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.220
Because you're just busy and
you just have a reactive answer.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.550
Well, I don't care
what everyone's doing.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.360
So Tech Talk Tuesday,
every week we

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.060
give discussion prompts
as part of the solution,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.950
how to have these conversations.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.330
And actually, today's
Tech Talk Tuesday

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.560
on the "Screenagers"
movie website

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.500
is exactly that
question of what age

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.150
is appropriate to get a kid a
mobile device, a smartphone.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.524
And there's a lot of
discussion about it.

00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:56.190
What I've seen over
making this film is,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.770
of course, kids at
younger and younger ages

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.110
are getting smartphones.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.440
One recent survey,
7% of four-year-olds

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.630
own their own smartphone.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.870
75% of four-year-olds own
their own mobile device.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.530
A lot of those are
some sort of an iPad.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.150
So if we don't stop and have
these discussions about what

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.757
do we do, there's a big trend
that we all see happening.

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:23.340
And I don't know if
we're always going

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.700
to get this right, when your
kid asks this and asks that

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.626
and you're kind of coming
up with what you feel.

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:30.750
I think there's two things.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.140
I think we have a lot more
data now in the past 10 years,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.210
so we need to be data-driven.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.860
Definitely, this is emotional,
so it's emotionally fueled.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.030
It's our kids.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.100
But it should be data-driven.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.670
And I think that when
we do that, we're

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.790
going to parent with
integrity, and that's

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.340
what we'll look back
and feel good about,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.165
rather than, it's too
late, nothing I can do.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:58.290
It's actually not too late.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.210
If you have a teenager and they
have devices in their bedroom

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.360
and you look at the study
that shows much more

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.780
convincingly how poor sleep
affects emotional development,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.950
academic development,
you might say,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.710
hey, I know you've
been pretty good,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.820
you've had your
phone there, I know

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.278
you put it on the other side
of the room where it's silent.

00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.020
But I'm just going
to feel better.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.640
Because self-control
goes down when

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.660
we're tired, all these things.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.840
Let's talk about
the science, but I

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.200
think we need to all have our
devices out of the bedroom.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.410
That's an example of having
these kind of conversations,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.620
doing them calmly,
weekly, Tech Talk Tuesday.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.782
And kids actually
really respect that.

00:07:39.782 --> 00:07:41.490
You're modeling to
them that you're going

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.290
to do this with integrity.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.330
And they might be
frustrated in the beginning,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.120
but actually they'll
feel the difference

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.461
and they'll be happy
that you did that.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:52.710
KEVIN VIK: Is your son getting
off a little bit easier

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.190
than your daughter?

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.810
Because she's kind of taking
the brunt of it, right?

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.435
Because she was 13, I guess,
when you do this whole contract

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:57.990
thing, right?

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.115
DELANEY RUSTON: It's
interesting that you say that.

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:01.980
My son's a senior
now in high school,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.310
and I really was kind of
thinking this issue of, oh,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.100
he's an older teenager,
what can I do now?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.860
And I notice he just was,
when we were in the kitchen,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.280
kind of as he was moving around,
just a lot more on his phone.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.230
And it just snuck up on us.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.240
And I said, what's
going on; it seems

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.050
like you're really always on.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.950
And he said, wow, you
know, you're right.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.050
And he went off his
phone for a week

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.517
just to kind of
see how that felt.

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:29.100
There was some
frustrating times where

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.052
he couldn't get
directions or some things

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.760
and we had to talk
about, OK, how are you

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.890
going to preempt that.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.840
And he said it's
helped him to reset.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.530
So it was a good reminder
to me that all of us

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.269
need sometimes just a little
poke and a little thing.

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:45.810
And it's ultimately
the goal, though,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.490
is really to get our kids
to have that mindfulness

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.040
that they can
experiment with this.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.550
Because it truly is just a
daily experiment about how do

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.680
we live to our fullest
when we have lots of things

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.650
that we want to do
online and offline.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.320
KEVIN VIK: So I'm going to open
it up to audience questions.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.486
SPEAKER 1: So one thing
I've heard about anecdotally

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:12.269
is teenagers having a lot
more ergonomic problems,

00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:14.310
like in their wrists and
neck, than they used to.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.290
I was curious if
you ran across any

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.900
of that in your investigations.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.160
DELANEY RUSTON: Yeah,
I mean, absolutely.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.370
Posture and other
thumb tendonitis

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.570
things are happening more.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.090
Also near-sightedness
is a discussion.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.850
We don't have a definitive,
but absolutely anybody

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.410
can be prone and get.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.592
It's not how much increased
risk that is per person.

00:09:38.592 --> 00:09:40.050
It's hard to say
because there's so

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.770
many genetic and other
factors going in.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.580
But with the different
game devices,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.860
in particular,
you have some kids

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.460
who are playing games six
hours a day, and some of them

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.840
are prone to having
pain in those regions.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.260
SPEAKER 2: Obviously, the
movie focused on teenagers,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.200
but I'm wondering.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.380
Younger kids are just
as much into technology

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.860
and they don't have the
ability to be rational

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.139
and to understand
data-driven explanation.

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:12.930
So what advice do you
have on younger kids?

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.780
I have a four-year-old nephew
who had a temper tantrum

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.140
when the iPad was taken away.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.310
So what can we as parents
do to deal with the younger

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.076
kids and technology?

00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:25.200
DELANEY RUSTON: I think
there's a lot of discussion

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.820
about how we set parameters
and have kids' involvement.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.360
And I think even at a young
age, that is reasonable

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.070
and a great approach.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.070
And so even in that
setting, would it

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.910
be more helpful if I gave you 10
minutes or five-minute warning

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.610
before your screen time is over?

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.430
And that will go a long
way in letting them

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.900
feel like they're involved.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.980
But absolutely.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.420
They might cry and say, no
rule will ever work here.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.260
And it's a question of
doing that kind of work now

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.300
versus paying a lot more later.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.390
And I'll give you an example.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.690
The same study I mentioned
earlier with young kids--

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.660
it turns out that
25% of those parents

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.160
are using devices for
kids to go to bed with.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.310
And over half of them
are using devices

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.330
when they are shopping or
want to get things done--

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.930
particularly also, obviously,
when a kid is upset.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.074
So one concern is that,
are we training them

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.740
when they're
uncomfortable, when they're

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.220
upset to go to a
screen as opposed

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.990
to self-soothe, talk to a
friend, exercise, other things.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.110
We're really giving
that dopamine quick--

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.820
screen right away.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.880
And what I mean by pay
later is that as they

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.070
get stronger and
bigger, and if they're

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.840
really prone to
this affinity, it

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.810
can be a lot bigger
struggles later on.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.810
So we do have a lot on
ScreenagersMovie.com

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.670
about addressing
the different ages.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.890
And I'd say I'm
just so fascinated

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.800
as a physician, and all of
us as individuals here, we

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.100
know that certain people
have strong reactions

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.160
to pleasurable stimuli.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.210
It's just a known thing.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.780
I do not like white wine at
all, but I know a lot of you

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.640
must really like wine.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.150
I love sugar to the--

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.100
I can't even put words.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.130
My husband, sugar-- could
totally live without it.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.680
And there's the
same thing going on

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.260
for a lot of people
with screens,

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.660
with video games, whatever
the different things they're

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.536
prone to.

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:35.910
And as a parent,
I would just say

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.640
to have a real wake-up
call in terms of if there's

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.850
a pattern where they're having
really extreme withdrawal

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.500
feelings and fighting and
aggression on screen time being

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.920
turned off, it's a
good time to say, OK,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.110
I need to get really
mindful about this

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.820
and how are we going
to manage this.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.710
I need to read about this.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.700
I need to talk to others.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.364
And it's going to go a long way.

00:12:59.364 --> 00:13:00.780
KEVIN VIK: We see
that in the film

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.160
with the single mother
who had the child.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.414
She was a single--

00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:05.580
DELANEY RUSTON: Grandmother.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.810
KEVIN VIK:
--grandmother, right, who

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.450
had a kid who she's just like,
he just likes his video games.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.720
But take them away,
he punches the wall,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.053
kicks the wall, stuff like that.

00:13:12.053 --> 00:13:13.030
And he's just like, no.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.876
And it's interesting
kind of seeing--

00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:17.250
DELANEY RUSTON: And one of my
favorite parts in the movie

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.040
is when she goes to see
that super cool social

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.870
worker/counselor.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.480
Because, again,
as a physician, I

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.010
work with a ton of counselors.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.910
Because the way that we
reframe and the outside help

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.300
is so critical that I really
wanted to put that in there.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.870
I think we really
need a movement.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.675
Lisa, my co-producer,
is here with me today.

00:13:38.675 --> 00:13:40.910
I'm so happy about that.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.310
We're talking about today,
we really need a crisis line

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.370
and restart where you saw that
deals with kids who really do

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.590
have addiction issues
around screen time.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.510
They get flooded with calls.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.230
But it doesn't even have
to be that high a level.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.910
But I have people
now call me a lot,

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.380
and I do kind of impromptu
ongoing counseling for them,

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.206
brainstorming and helping them
to get new ways of thinking

00:14:06.206 --> 00:14:07.080
and approaching this.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.630
Because it's intense.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.470
30% of families
in America report

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.990
that they are struggling
daily about screen

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.850
time with their kids.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.300
It's sad, but it's
also an opportunity.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.390
It's like if we can use this
opportunity of how we're

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.180
going to have resolution
of conflicts, that's

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.520
going to go a long way to
teach them in their work,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.930
in their relationships.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.420
It's the number one thing that
predicts for relationships,

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.630
is not how many cool
things you guys do together

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.040
or mountain biking in Marin,
but how you resolve conflicts.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.160
And so learning
how to do that with

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.810
small, frequent conversations
with really pinning yourself

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.310
down.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.440
What are a few
times that we don't

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.300
think that tech should be used
so that our relationships can

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.160
be stronger?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.610
Why is it that 70%
of parents allow

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.460
kids to use devices
in the car when that

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.580
can be really valuable time?

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.490
Like, let's wake up and
say, sorry, it's not safe,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.920
it's not great,
let's listen to music

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.300
together, let's be together.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.370
There are these
kind of discussions

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.890
we're having about rethinking
how we're going to create

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.095
these cherished moments.

00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:26.470
KEVIN VIK: It's
interesting, too,

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:31.297
because seeing the kids being
so attached to their screens

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.130
and go right to the
video game and try to be

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.250
immersed in these worlds--

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.670
I just think when I was
a kid, when we were kids,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.434
we would go play in
the forest and we

00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:40.600
would have to pretend like
we were the Ninja Turtles

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.700
or we were the Power
Rangers or whatever.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.570
And how would you suggest
a parent going after that

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.160
or going about that
with their child,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.342
saying, there is a world out
there, just in your head?

00:15:51.342 --> 00:15:53.050
And you can actually
pretend and play out

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.210
there versus just having
to immerse yourself

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.569
into World of Warcraft or
Minecraft or whatever it is.

00:15:57.569 --> 00:15:59.110
DELANEY RUSTON:
Well, I think that it

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.070
gets to a bigger question of why
do we care that kids not just

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.170
be on screens all the time.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.650
And as a parent, I think
that's really important

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.320
that we think about where our
kids are at-- or as a mentor

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.560
or teacher-- and where we
want to make sure that they

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.080
get to offline experiences.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.720
And I break it down
into three main things.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.782
Creativity, communication,
and competency.

00:16:24.782 --> 00:16:26.740
And what's really
interesting about what you're

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.560
saying about creativity,
like create with your mind

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.780
and be out there
in the world, is

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.780
it turns out when they survey
what kids are doing on screens,

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.050
only 3% of the time
is content creation.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.380
It's pretty amazing when
you can make videos,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.470
you can make music,
you can write blogs.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:56.530
And frankly, the reason
is to create and to work

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.960
is much harder than
to play and to watch,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.900
and so our brain
often will default,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.790
even though doing that
work, you actually

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.560
feel better after, the longer.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.450
You gain self-confidence
from what we do.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.760
So I think that
if your kid is not

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.740
spending a fair
amount of time doing

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.200
mental creation or
other creation as one

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.040
of those things--

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.250
creation, communication,
and competency--

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.750
I think that's a great
starting point to say, hey,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.609
I want to make sure you're also
creating offline and having

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.550
time to think with your
brain and write it down.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.370
And also, let's re-look at
what you're doing online.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.170
You're in this game;
that's fabulous.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.190
Hey, there's this program by
which you can develop a game.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:44.110
So I think having that mindset
can really be effective.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.380
SPEAKER 3: So first of
all, thank you very much.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.120
That was really
amazing and, I guess,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.050
probably a wake-up
call for many people.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.830
So I have two questions.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:18:02.100
First question-- since you also
touched on the digital identity

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.350
part and how we lead
and how we help kids,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.090
personally I found
it really brave

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.780
that you put your family, your
own family, in that movie.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.340
And I would like to discuss
what was the process of deciding

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.410
how many of those scenes
and how much of your family

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.530
you should expose to the world.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.200
And I assume this movie goes
really, really well, which

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.410
I really hope and wish.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.340
Your kids will probably become
celebrities through this movie.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:35.590
So how do you weigh this
thing of doing something

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.520
for the world that
is really meaningful

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.041
versus introducing risks
to your own family?

00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:43.540
DELANEY RUSTON:
Well, I have to say,

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.290
I wasn't at all intending to
put my family into this film.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.317
I thought it was just looking
at video games and social media,

00:18:51.317 --> 00:18:52.900
and I didn't think
it called for that.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.858
But it actually was,
because it was hard for me

00:18:54.858 --> 00:18:58.720
to find families who would
let me in in real time.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:06.090
Again, I think that we totally
crave true, real moments.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.660
And even reality TV is.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.830
So now we see it.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.360
It's so doctored.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.180
So ultimately, my kids have been
used to my filming in the home

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.450
for so long, and we didn't know
what the film would become.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.530
They didn't know.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.170
Fortunately, since
mainly it's my daughter,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.230
she has been OK and
happy with the film,

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.980
and she does a lot
of the Q&amp;As with me.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.001
She has moments
when she sees parts

00:19:32.001 --> 00:19:33.250
in there where she's like, oh.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.710
And recently, this
last week, I tried

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.630
to film her on some emotional
stuff that's happening.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.600
And she's 15 and
she said, I don't

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.319
know, I don't know if I
want to be filmed now, Mom.

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.610
It's great about "Screenagers."

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.359
I'm just not sure.

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:50.230
So it'll be interesting to see.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.090
I think it would be great
if everyone did this.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.340
Have your kids
film you about what

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.610
do you think you're struggling
with, with balance and screen

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.410
time, and film them.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.130
I mean, we use it
a lot in medicine

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.200
to see how we communicate
as physicians.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.680
We film the medical students
and then we evaluate that.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.160
And everyone can be creating
and have that self-reflection.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.010
Again, anything that
we can do to make

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.360
our kids more mindful, more
curious about all of this,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.540
as opposed to just
immediately pulled in, we're

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.950
doing half our battle.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.120
We really are.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.250
SPEAKER 3: How can we make
the most out of this treasure?

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.070
And what I mean
is, first of all,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.310
I would hope that
it will not become

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.420
like a compulsory screening,
but at least this movement

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.290
will go far away--

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.090
I don't know--
like 60%, 70%, 90%

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.930
of teenagers, students
in the US will

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.160
be able to watch it
with their parents.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.274
Hopefully, perhaps, legislators
also will have a chance.

00:20:55.274 --> 00:20:56.940
I don't know if you
can have a screening

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.550
at the Congress or something.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.780
If you could talk
a little bit more,

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.070
how we could take this movement
and move it along and also.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.030
And also, one more follow-up--

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.820
if you could have a
follow-up to that movement

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.630
to see how actually
having seen the movie

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.384
has affected the families
and the digital awareness.

00:21:20.384 --> 00:21:22.800
DELANEY RUSTON: So to answer
your first question about how

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.210
to build this
movement, how do we

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.000
get all families and kids to
see this movie-- because it's

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.710
one hour of their life.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.480
And yet screen time is
somewhere around seven hours

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.750
a day for kids and adults,
not including school work

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.810
and not including work.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.190
So with this one hour
to get us to think,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.200
what do we agree with,
what we don't, what

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.690
is the science, what
science do we need--

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.980
we are all for it.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.700
We have now almost
2,000 screenings

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.220
that have been booked
around the country

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.890
and in about 20
different countries.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.070
And we're working with many
different companies who've

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.140
brought it--

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:07.770
Pixar and LucasFilms and a lot
of tech companies and all over.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.320
But we really believe that it is
about bringing people together.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.940
And so at
ScreenagersMovie.com, anyone

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.860
can bring it to their church,
to their after-school activity

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.820
program.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.760
So I think that
all of you help us

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.890
in getting the word out to
bring it to schools and whatnot.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.100
And the other thing that
everyone can do today

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.410
is that Tech Talk Tuesday--

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.440
next week will be our
50th week of doing it.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.420
If you take a pledge to do
one of them on our website,

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.360
it's basically saying
to your kids, hey,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.340
I want to take a pledge
to not be reactive.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.940
I.e., what I always do is
I do the grab-and-stab.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.920
I grab my daughter's
phone and then I

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.350
kind of stare at her
in the eyes, like, ugh,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.850
I told you not to be on it then.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.460
And through doing these
Tech Talk Tuesdays, calm

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.510
conversations, I really become
less reactive and more curious

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.050
and am able to deal with that.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.580
So I hope people will do the
Tech Talk Tuesday pledge.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.970
In terms of a follow-up
movie, just a couple of weeks

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.320
ago the "Today Show"
had a group of teenagers

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.810
that they showed the
film to, and then they

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:17.190
had them give up their phone
and technology for a week.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.140
And they saw what happened.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.960
So it's on our website
and it's fun to watch.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.560
So we'll see what the next
full feature film will be.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.350
SPEAKER 4: So this is
really funny timing

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.960
in terms of the screening,
because actually I'm

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.940
a very recent teenager myself.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.340
And also, for the
past month, I've

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.330
given up social media, just
to basically disconnect, what

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.770
was mentioned in the movie.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.080
We are hooked and
addicted, but a lot of us

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.800
have a yearning to not be and
to not be controlled by what

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.170
we feel like is very addicting.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.080
So I just want to say, first of
all, this is such a great film

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.350
and really touched upon a lot
of very relatable experiences.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.350
Already, being off
social media, I'm

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.750
so much more productive at work.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.090
I'm actually doing things
that I enjoy outside

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.350
of just mindlessly scrolling.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.139
I don't know if you've thought
about this or have the answer,

00:24:18.139 --> 00:24:19.680
but something I'm
just thinking about

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.370
is the condition of the screens.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.810
So obviously, if we have
screens, it's very distracting.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.070
It's something we can look at.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.710
And wherever you go,
the cafe, the bus,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.300
everywhere, everyone is just
looking down at their screens.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.500
But more and more people now are
saying that the future of tech

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.700
is very quickly
becoming screen-less--

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.785
like Google Home, Alexa,
all those things, the watch.

00:24:44.785 --> 00:24:46.410
Or I guess the watch
is still a screen,

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.450
but you get what I mean.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.800
So do you think that the problem
lies in the screen itself,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.700
or is there something
just about technology

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.650
that is the real challenge?

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.900
DELANEY RUSTON: I think
you've really hit on something

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.040
that is key, is what you
did is you replaced it.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.540
And as a physician that works in
primary care, half of what I do

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.070
is behavior change.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.085
And it's not, OK, you got
to stop smoking cigarettes.

00:25:14.085 --> 00:25:16.950
It's, what are we going to
do in place of that urge

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.150
when you have it.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.450
It never works to replace
with a vacuum, so fantastic

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.650
that you are doing other things
that you're excited about.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.960
I would say that the
other thing that I'm

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.420
excited that you're talking
about is that you're modeling.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.280
You are here in
the cafe and you're

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.350
probably having a
better conversation,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.450
or you're just breathing.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.070
I know you do a
lot of mindfulness.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.220
You're taking that moment to
kind of refresh your brain,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.310
and that modeling is key.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.440
I just learned
that 80% of parents

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.810
think they actually
are good models.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:52.540
If you are highly educated, you
are more likely to think that.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.870
And I think it's in
part because we justify.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.290
I have to do it for work, and
kids, well, it's different.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.930
We need to figure
out how to model

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.545
in terms of change
one behavior--

00:26:02.545 --> 00:26:04.170
like, you know what,
I'm going to work.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.711
I'm going to say to
my kids, I really

00:26:05.711 --> 00:26:07.260
am checking too
much during dinner.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.080
And I'm going to say to them,
I'm going to work on this.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.730
Guys, help me.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.380
Because to change
behavior, it takes

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.570
a lot of different issues.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.700
Again, on the
"Screenagers" movie site,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.120
I spent a lot of time on that.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.060
Because you made it seem easy,
but it's often not so easy.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.060
Your real question, though,
is in terms of screen time,

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.875
is it the screen, what is it--

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:30.630
I think a big thing
that we have to know

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:35.197
is that our brain does
not like to be bored.

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.530
And I don't know if you just
saw the study that came out

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.450
in "Science Magazine,"
when they put people

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.990
into a room with nothing
to do for 15 minutes.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.520
Over a quarter of them
chose to give themselves

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.370
an electric shock rather
than just sit there, even

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.550
though prior they had paid
experimental money to not be

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.210
shocked.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.350
They didn't like the shock.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.880
It was just being
bored and sitting

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.340
there was nerve-wracking.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.191
And when we give kids now
these devices in the car.

00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:04.690
The car.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.230
There's so much cool
things driving by.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.280
If that's not cool to be
thinking and daydreaming,

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.280
have the music, whatever,
we're really setting them up

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.580
to be more uncomfortable
having those moments

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.100
where there's boredom,
and then our brain ideally

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.029
will find new ideas to go to.

00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:25.320
Because "Bored and Brilliant"--
there's a whole concept

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.590
that a lot of creativity
comes from those moments.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.510
But in the moment,
in the immediacy,

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.077
we get scared of those moments.

00:27:32.077 --> 00:27:33.910
KEVIN VIK: Well, thank
you so much for being

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.620
here, Dr. Delaney Ruston.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.970
[APPLAUSE]
