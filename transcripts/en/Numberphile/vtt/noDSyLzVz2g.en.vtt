00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.920
JAMES CLEWETT: What we've done
is I've got a radiation source

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.450
which is emitting a constant
stream of electrons.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.830
As neutrons are decaying into
protons, out pops an electron,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.190
and I'm counting not how many
it's giving out, but how many

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.760
of them are going into
the Geiger counter.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.170
That's a slightly different
number.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.008
MALE SPEAKER: And what kind
of ballpark figures are we

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:25.220
talking here?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.420
JAMES CLEWETT: Well--

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.825
MALE SPEAKER: You must know
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:28.150
JAMES CLEWETT: Yes.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.680
So it's about 20 per second
going into the Geiger counter.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.120
And then I'm feeding that into
this little box, which is just

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.000
turning that number
into a voltage.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.120
So these two wires are
collecting that voltage, and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.710
they're passing them into the
oscilloscope, where we can see

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.000
the pulses as they go by.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.310
Each pulse represents
one electron.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.780
And electrons are all the same,
so those pulses are all

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.820
the same height.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
And so as those pulses flash
by, I'm counting them, the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.410
computer is counting them.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.000
So the wire comes out of the
oscilloscope, it goes through

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.410
this little breakout box and
into the back of the computer.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.120
You can buy one of these
things for about 200

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.690
quid, by the way.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.760
They're worth having.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
Into the back of the computer,
and then I've written a little

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.560
computer program.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.790
And all the computer program
does is sit there for 10

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.920
seconds and count pulses.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.700
That's it.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.430
It's really simple.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.520
It's all graphs today.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.940
Here's time along here, and the
stream of electrons looks

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.510
something like this as they're
coming out, and they're

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.090
randomly distributed, which my
stream of electrons absolutely

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.630
isn't there.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.300
It's getting less random
by the second.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.910
And all I'm doing
is I'm counting.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.270
So I start with a value of 0,
and then I get to this time,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.200
and I'm adding 1.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.940
I get here, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, and so on.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.690
And this is where the
probability bit comes in

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.690
because the chances are
that over 10 seconds--

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.900
remember this graph?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.410
So the most likely number that
we're going to get here--

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.610
I measured this this morning--

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.345
is 216.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:17.260
MALE SPEAKER: Over 10 seconds?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.180
JAMES CLEWETT: Over
10 seconds.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780
And that's just an empirical
measurement.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.480
So I'm taking the number that
I've counted up, and I'm going

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.320
to subtract off 216.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560
What we've just seen, and
whether the answer was 13,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.600
then obviously either
I've come in here--

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.990
and I'm going to get
this right--

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.310
I've had 229, or it could
equally be that I've been here

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.210
and had 203.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.310
Both of those are going to
give the answer of 13.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.340
So the reason that's happened
is I wasn't interested in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.750
showing you a negative
random number.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.060
I wanted to show you an integer
value, a positive

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.450
integer value.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.782
So I just wrote a piece
of software where

00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:59.230
I squared it up.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.130
I took the square root.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.910
The square root's inevitably
positive, and so my software

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.570
is always going to give
a positive answer.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.790
I cheated.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.540
OK, I admit it.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.800
I cheated.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.020
But the answer is 13.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.320
So you want some more
numbers, right?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.060
OK, well I'll generate
a few more.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.066
MALE SPEAKER: Let's do 10
and write them down

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:16.640
as they come out.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.020
JAMES CLEWETT: All right.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.270
Yeah, good idea.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.430
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, a big one.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.498
Or is that big?

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:25.170
We don't know yet?

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.030
JAMES CLEWETT: We
don't know yet.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.200
So should we start with the 0
and the 13, or do you want to

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.000
just start with the 13?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.710
MALE SPEAKER: No, put them.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.600
So we've got a 0, a 13.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.790
JAMES CLEWETT: So we have
had 0, we've had 13.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.810
Now, we have 27, 5.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.190
MALE SPEAKER: They should do
the lottery like this.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.970
JAMES CLEWETT: They really
should use radiation sources

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.460
for the lottery.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.860
Nobody would be cheating,
for sure.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.830
It doesn't quite have the
razzmatazz of the lottery.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.590
44, last seen three
weeks ago today.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.350
MALE SPEAKER: Hang
on a second.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.805
This would be a bad way to do
the lottery because some

00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:12.130
numbers here are more likely
than other ones.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.350
JAMES CLEWETT: Right.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.658
That's a really good point
that you've made.

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:18.980
There's some maths which I left
out of this video because

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.829
I thought it was going too
far, where you can turn a

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.240
Gaussian distribution into
a uniform distribution.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.510
So you can take your Gaussian
distribution of random

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.380
numbers, and you can flip it
around and give them all a

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.770
uniform probability.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.350
Now, I don't want to do the
maths for you because that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.690
would be painful for everybody,
but it works.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.830
And so you can, then, generate a
uniform probability sequence

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.740
of numbers.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.700
MALE SPEAKER: But we
haven't done that.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.430
JAMES CLEWETT: That's
absolutely

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.340
not what we've done.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.350
What we've done is we've taken
a Gaussian distribution, and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.090
so some numbers--

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.010
0, basically-- are going to be
more likely than others.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.340
I'm really quite
enjoying this.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.590
It's very satisfying.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.070
3.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.140
I'll run another one.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.670
We'll count up.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.780
So the computer, again, is
counting 200ish electrons, and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.670
this is the deviation.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.060
6 is the deviation
from the mean.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.260
And because it's got a Gaussian
distribution, the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.720
smaller numbers are
more probable.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.930
So if we keep doing this, what
we're going to end up with is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.740
very heavily weighted to
the small numbers.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.450
It's actually quite surprising
to me that we haven't

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.720
seen 0 again yet.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720
I should say this morning--

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.030
9, excellent.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.640
This morning before you arrived,
I ran thousands of

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.490
these just to check that it was
Gaussian, not that nature

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.640
was suddenly going to do
something different.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.750
So the computer is counting the
number of electrons that

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.610
strontium's putting out, and in
this case, it's either put

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.000
out 20 more than the average
number of electrons, or it's

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.910
put out 20 less.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.020
I can't tell because I've
hidden that in my code.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.720
But it's 20 away from
the average.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.030
So in the science of statistics,
this is--

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.890
10, excellent.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.440
In the science of statistics--

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.860
sorry.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.330
MALE SPEAKER: That's
all right.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.310
Can you have George [INAUDIBLE]
something?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.240
JAMES CLEWETT: On your
head be it, George.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.490
Thank you.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.050
19.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.940
So that's 19 more or less
electrons than the average

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.550
value that the strontium's
putting out.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.900
So in this case, it's been quite
an active 10 seconds for

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.660
the strontium.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.410
OK, 13.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.150
MALE SPEAKER: We've
got 13 again.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.950
We haven't got a 0 again.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.330
JAMES CLEWETT: No,
it's surprising.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.310
Anyway, so this is
the proof of it.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.410
It could well be that I got the
mean in the wrong place.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.450
That would explain it.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.290
And eventually, that
would show up.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.050
So there's one last thing I'd
like to show you, and that is

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.760
essentially--

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.420
well, let me just show you, and
then I can talk about it.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.820
I'm going to run the experiment
1,000 times over,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.430
and let me make that
nice and big.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.580
So each one of these pulses that
you can see appearing,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.260
that's one number that
we've generated.

00:06:54.196 --> 00:07:00.160
And as you can see, we're
generating more and more

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.790
numbers, and each time, I'm
adding 1 to this pulse.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.600
And so the most likely number
at the moment is 20.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.495
MALE SPEAKER: It's not 0.

00:07:10.495 --> 00:07:12.250
What does this tell us?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.730
JAMES CLEWETT: This tells us
that I got the mean wrong.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.860
So if I had got the mean
right, then this

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.000
value would be 0.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.842
What this means is that I got
the mean wrong probably

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.140
by 20, which is--

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.400
MALE SPEAKER: The
mean being what?

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.910
JAMES CLEWETT: What this means
is that I've got the mean

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.260
number of electrons that this
thing's giving out in 10

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.380
seconds, I got that completely
wrong, which is a bit

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.330
embarrassing.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.720
But you can see now that
it's starting to take

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.070
this Gaussian form.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.470
So it started off just as a
couple of pulses, and you'd

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.030
never have known that
there was a Gaussian

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.560
distribution to that.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.200
But over time, it grows into
a really nice, bell-shaped

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.450
graph, and we can see that the
most likely number that we're

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.040
going to generate has moved
up a bit from 20

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.770
now, it's about 22.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.490
MALE SPEAKER: That also means
when we ran the experiment

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.280
earlier, and we got 0 as our
first result, that was

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.560
actually quite an
unlikely result.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.690
JAMES CLEWETT: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.300
So that would mean that
effectively, 0 was more like a

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.015
20 result, and all of the 20s
and 19s that we got and the 27

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:24.240
that we got before, these
were much more likely.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.280
So it wasn't perfect, but it
was all right, I think.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.634
And I think that we got a nice
random number from it, so I'm

00:08:32.634 --> 00:08:32.880
pretty pleased.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.590
MALE SPEAKER: So that
was still random.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.150
This doesn't effect the
randomness of the numbers.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.105
JAMES CLEWETT: No.

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:42.030
Again, this goes back to
the semantics of it.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.370
It's random, yes, but it has
a particular probability

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.780
associated with choosing
that number.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.970
So at the moment, the
probability of choosing

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.800
something less than about 8 is
0, and the probability of

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.060
choosing something more
than 38 is 0.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.540
If we go for a very, very long
time, an infinitely long time,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.730
then these numbers will become
nonzero, but they're going to

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.945
be very close to 0.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:07.025
MALE SPEAKER: We've got a little
outlier there down near

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:08.040
40, don't we?

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.790
JAMES CLEWETT: It's quite
satisfying just watching this

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.170
graph draw itself over time.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.750
The question is, how much
time do you have?
