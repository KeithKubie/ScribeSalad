00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.874
SALMAN KHAN: I'm here
with Professor Laurence

00:00:01.874 --> 00:00:03.590
Baker at Stanford
Medical School.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.000
And what we're going
to talk about now

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.510
is the overview of the
health care system.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.575
LAURENCE BAKER: What is
the health care system?

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:10.610
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah,
and who's in it?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.200
LAURENCE BAKER: And who's in it?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.980
And what are they doing?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.480
SALMAN KHAN: I think I
could give a go at it.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.070
LAURENCE BAKER: Go for it.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.680
SALMAN KHAN: And
then correct me.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.060
Expose my ignorance.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.070
So clearly, you
have your providers.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.447
Those would be your doctors,
and nurses, and all the rest.

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:26.030
LAURENCE BAKER:
Hospitals, pharmacies,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.780
all kinds of people
are your providers.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.750
SALMAN KHAN: OK, so everyone
who's providing health care.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.000
So that's right over there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.120
So that's hospitals, doctors,
pharmacies, all the rest.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.284
And then they are providing
the health care to someone.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:38.575
So those would be the patients.

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.402
Let me do that in another color.

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:41.860
LAURENCE BAKER:
Call them patients.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.340
Yeah, sometimes
you get the details

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.580
like people become patients
after they need health care.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.840
But some people just
have a question.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.430
They're not really patients,
they're just asking.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.710
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.610
What would you call them then?

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.700
LAURENCE BAKER: Call
them population.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.110
SALMAN KHAN: Population.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.401
So just the population of
the world, or of the country,

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:55.860
or whatever-- people.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.830
And then someone
has to pay for this.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.117
And so for the most
part, this is insurers.

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:02.950
LAURENCE BAKER: Yup.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.780
Insurance companies.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.250
In the olden days--
like if you go back

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.041
100 years-- we didn't
really have insurers.

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.834
We had patients and providers.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.500
And patients would-- if they had
a question, they had a concern,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.250
they go to the provider.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.041
They'd make some deal,
pay them some money,

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.755
do some service for
them and work it out.

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:18.130
We got insurance
companies really

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.580
only in the last
100 years, maybe.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.160
Really starting in
the US in maybe 1930.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.020
1940, they started
to become popular.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.540
So that's kind of
a new renovation.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.110
And those three
things work together.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.820
SALMAN KHAN: And the
general term-- and this

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.000
is a word I've seen a
lot, and sometimes it's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.520
a little confusing because
it's very close to payer,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.020
you hear of these payors.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140
And that would be
including anyone

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.470
who's paying for the
paying for the service.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.524
And insurance companies
would be included there.

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:43.440
LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.562
So we have-- we
call them payors.

00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:47.020
Sometimes we call
them health plans

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.670
because they arrange for some
of the care that people get.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.040
And payors could be private
insurance companies,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.160
or they could be government
payors-- government insurance

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.370
companies like Medicare.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.530
SALMAN KHAN: And the insurance
companies themselves,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.946
they're not doing this out of
the goodness of their heart.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:01.969
Someone is paying them.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.760
And for the most part
in the United States,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.802
it tends to be employers.

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:05.843
LAURENCE BAKER: So right.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.139
So if we made another
arrow on your diagram here,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.130
it would be from
the population--

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.604
or maybe from the patients--
to the insurance companies that

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.520
provides the money for
the insurance companies

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.290
to use to pay for the provider.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.362
So patients might buy
an insurance company--

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:22.570
or not an insurance company,
buy an insurance policy.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.200
SALMAN KHAN: Only if
they're very well healed.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.241
LAURENCE BAKER: Some of
them buy the whole thing.

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.117
But they just might
buy their own policy.

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:29.450
Go buy an insurance policy,
pay them a premium directly,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.200
the insurance company
collects that money.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.914
Or, for most people, they
work for an employer.

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:35.330
The employer makes
the arrangement

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.690
to buy that insurance and
then implicitly charges

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.364
the population, the
patients for that.

00:02:40.364 --> 00:02:42.030
Maybe directly by
having them contribute

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.905
some of their salary.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.426
Maybe implicitly by just
reducing the amount of cash

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.050
they give them every
month, and instead

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.960
giving them this
insurance policy.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.817
So people do that.

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:51.900
And the other piece that's
floating around in here

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.670
is that in some cases,
the population pays taxes

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.855
to the government that
then functions essentially

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.850
as an insurer, like the
Medicare program, where there's

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.327
insurance provided to people
that's paid for by taxes.

00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:05.660
So there's some different
funds flows going around here,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.330
but always money
going from patients

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.790
to insurers, through employers
from taxes, by direct payments.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.500
Those insurers
collecting the money

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.700
and then paying for a
bunch of the care that's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.100
provided by the providers.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.690
And that's the
basic arrangement.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.870
There's one more
tiny piece, which

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.120
is that sometimes patients pay
the doctors or the hospitals

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.640
directly.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.840
You go you have
a $20 co-payment.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.610
And so there's a small payment
that goes back and forth.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.710
SALMAN KHAN: Your
copay is kind of there

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.900
just so that-- it kind of makes
the insurance company feel

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900
good that you're not just
using it willy-nilly--

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.566
that you have to
pay your $10 or $50.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:35.690
LAURENCE BAKER: Absolutely.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.360
So insurers know
that once they start

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.500
paying the providers
for the care,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.124
and the patient says
it's totally free,

00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:41.760
people might use
stuff that might

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.260
be worth a little tiny bit, but
it costs a lot for everybody

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.850
to pay for.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.080
So if you put a
co-payment on there,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.620
it makes people think
twice about using things

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.570
that they don't really need.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.040
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.220
That makes complete sense.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.181
And then within this ecosystem--
we hear a lot about HMOs.

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.430
My perception is that's a
combination of the insurance

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.545
company and the provider.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:59.045
It's kind of in one package.

00:03:59.045 --> 00:03:59.961
LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:02.485
So over time, the US has had
different kinds of insurers

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:03.390
out there.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.140
In the private market,
especially, there's

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.070
been a lot of innovation
in the last 30,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.140
40 years in types of
insurers that are out there.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.520
So we have different
insurers that

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.590
have behaved in
different ways as we've

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.220
gone through those
evolutionary cycles.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.970
So one version of that is
what we call an HMO-- a health

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.050
maintenance organization.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.404
And that's really just jargon.

00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:23.570
You have to dig into it to
figure out what it means.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.460
But in a lot of
cases, what that is

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.610
is a company that's
acting as insurance.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.220
So you pay a premium to them if
you're a patient or a person,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.660
and you buy some coverage.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.362
And then they'll
cover your care.

00:04:34.362 --> 00:04:36.570
But they'll do that by trying
to integrate themselves

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.361
with the providers.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.140
And so the
organizations either are

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.660
integrated because the HMO hires
doctors directly, or maybe owns

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.640
the hospitals-- like Kaiser
Permanente, for example.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.340
Or, in some cases it's a
contractual relationship.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.770
It's not exactly the same.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.810
SALMAN KHAN: So not all of them
is tightly linked as a Kaiser,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.750
where it's like, you go
to this building that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.970
says Kaiser on it.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.580
And that's where your doctor is.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.517
It could be doctors just
have their practices,

00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:00.308
but they're tightly
linked with a-- I think

00:05:00.308 --> 00:05:01.200
that's how, what Blue Shield?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.007
Or one of those.

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:03.840
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah,
Blue Shield, or Aetna,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.590
or some of these
different companies.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.430
And you can start to
dig into the details

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.930
and every one will be a little
bit different from the other,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.740
but they're contractual
relationships.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.130
SALMAN KHAN: And
the difference--

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.200
I think this is something
everyone faces when they sign

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.460
up with insurance
with their employer--

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.293
I had to do it recently--
is-- they all say,

00:05:17.293 --> 00:05:20.360
you have to pick HMO versus PPO.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.120
And they're within
the same policy.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.030
And so my perception is HMO is
you have set list of doctors

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.826
that they probably
pre-negotiated pricing with.

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:31.700
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.840
So the difference
between HMOs and PPOs

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.194
gets a little bit
into the details

00:05:36.194 --> 00:05:36.860
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.980
I don't want to get too into--

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.910
LAURENCE BAKER: We can sort
of think about it in the way

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.118
that you're talking about it.

00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:43.074
So an HMO will have
a list of doctors

00:05:43.074 --> 00:05:44.240
that you're supposed to see.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.512
And you'll have to go see
the doctors on that list.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.720
And a stereotypical one, if
you don't see the doctors

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.059
on that list, the
insurance company's

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.600
not going to pay
for you care, you're

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.683
going to pay for yourself.

00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:55.240
And in the stereotypical
HMO, there's

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.010
going to be a fairly
tight management

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.910
between the insurance company
and the doctors about what's

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.820
going to be done, what's
allowable, and so on.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.260
SALMAN KHAN: And in the
most tightly linked case,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.290
they'll be the same.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.520
They doctors will be
employed by the company.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.510
That's like Kaiser.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.180
LAURENCE BAKER: As you think
about it as a spectrum,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.340
if you move a little bit
away from that to a PPO.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.560
What's happening in
a PPO is you're still

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.910
going to get a list,
so you're going

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.360
to be encouraged to
see those doctors,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.110
but maybe it'll be a
little more flexibility.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.360
Like, if you decided not
to see someone on the list,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.229
the plan would still
pay some amount.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.770
Maybe not as much as they would
if you saw someone on a list,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.430
but something.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.540
Whereas in an HMO,
maybe nothing.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.670
And the plan will probably
work a little less hard

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.630
at managing what those doctors
are doing to try and limit

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.460
access to, say,
high cost services.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.885
HMO will tend to
work harder, PPO

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:35.260
tends to work a
little less hard.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.718
So it's a little
bit of a spectrum.

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:40.310
You're kind of moving from more
managed and more concentrated

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.980
to a little less managed, but
still more so than the system

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.660
we had, say, in
the '50s or '60s,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.480
where anybody went
to any doctor,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.340
and any doctor did
whatever they wanted.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.214
And the insurance company
just paid the bill,

00:06:51.214 --> 00:06:52.440
and there was no integration.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.280
So it's a little bit of a--

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.370
SALMAN KHAN: So that's
the main motivation

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.786
why insurance
companies are trying

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:58.580
to get more integrated
with the providers,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.710
is because-- just like you
said, in the '50s and '60s,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.760
you have the provider
providing a service.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.750
And obviously the
patient like the service.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.666
And then you have a third
party paying for it.

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:09.669
And so there's no check
on-- the person deciding

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.210
and the person getting it says,
yeah, let's get more service.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.250
And someone else is-- right.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.000
LAURENCE BAKER: So we
created a big issue.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.730
Insurance companies are
kind of an interesting thing

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.771
in a health policy world.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.157
Because we have to have them.

00:07:20.157 --> 00:07:22.240
We have to have them to
manage the risk associated

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.910
with getting sick.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.534
You get sick today
and get a huge bill.

00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:27.040
And so we can't leave people
on their own for that.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.950
We got to have
insurance companies.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.550
But as soon as you create
insurance companies,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.560
and I can have, implicitly,
all my neighbors

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.340
pay for the health
care that I want, then

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.530
I might start using things that
turn out to be an efficient.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.260
And so you got to have
them-- insurance companies.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.790
But you got to manage what
happens when you have them

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.290
also.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.248
And so that's the
integration between providers

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:47.030
or co-payments and utilization
review, and all these things,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.510
are basically attempts
by insurance companies

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.244
to try and manage
what economists

00:07:51.244 --> 00:07:52.410
would call the moral hazard.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.925
The using additional services
that you don't necessarily

00:07:54.925 --> 00:07:57.383
need because everybody else is
going to pay for it for you.

00:07:57.383 --> 00:07:58.900
SALMAN KHAN: It
makes complete sense.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.399
Well thanks.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:01.840
That makes a ton of sense.
