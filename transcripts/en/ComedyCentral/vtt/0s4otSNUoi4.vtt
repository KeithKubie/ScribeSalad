Back in the mid-nineties,

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:03.570
Microsoft wanted Windows 95 in

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.738
every home.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.039
That's why they hired "Friends"

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.341
stars Matthew Perry and Jennifer

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.408
Aniston to teach people about

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.043
the sexy, fun world of the PC

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.612
operating system.

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:12.746
And could it be any more

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.882
hilarious?

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.883
&gt;&gt; Okay, now let's load up the

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:16.884
task bar.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:17.885
I'll show you what it does.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:18.886
&gt;&gt; Task bar?

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:19.887
Is that anything like a Snickers

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:20.888
bar?

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.456
Does that have nougat?

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.657
&gt;&gt; What is nougat?

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:24.658
Does anybody know that?

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:27.160
(silly tune plays)

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.195
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Aw, Jesus.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.196
(laughter)

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.197
This lady's like, "Goddamn it!

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.198
I knew we should have gotten

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.199
Frasier.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.200
Why did we do this?"

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.201
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.002
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Ah, it's not their

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.003
fault.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.004
Comedian, "Friends" ep...

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.005
I mean, you know, they did this

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.039
corporate gig.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.873
They probably got paid a shit

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:40.707
ton of money, and they were

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.508
like, "Well, no one's ever gonna

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.509
see this."

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.777
&gt;&gt; This looks like it's 50 years

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.778
ago.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.679
Like, Jennifer Aniston looks

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:46.647
like a Puerto Rican bank teller

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.648
bad at math.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:48.649
(laughter)

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.650
Like, what is...?

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.918
She looks so different now!

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:51.919
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: I know.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:52.920
&gt;&gt; She used to eat.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.921
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: I know.

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:54.922
Comedians, "Friends" episodes

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.523
were always titled things like,

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.524
"The One Where Joey Moves Out,"

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.525
or "The One with the Chicken

00:00:58.525 --> 00:00:59.526
Pox."

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.594
What is this episode called?

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.595
Jamie.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:02.596
&gt;&gt; Uh, "The One Where Rachel

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:03.597
Dates a Nigerian Prince."

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:04.598
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yeah. Points.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.599
(laughter)

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.600
&gt;&gt; Ooh!

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.601
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Just to help him

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.602
transfer the money. Yeah.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.603
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:10.604
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:11.605
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Michelle.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:12.439
&gt;&gt; Um, this is the one,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.273
actually, where she finds out

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.274
that Jon Voight's daughter is

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.275
gonna steal her man later.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.276
(audience groaning)

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.277
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Oh. Shit!

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.278
&gt;&gt; What? Baba, baba, baba, boom!

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.279
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Oh! Yes.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.447
&gt;&gt; Boom, boom, boom!

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.448
Close your legs to married men,

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.449
bitches!

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.450
(applause)

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.451
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: And...

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.452
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.453
&gt;&gt; Rachel Donovan.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.287
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: We all know that

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:27.988
