00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
We're talking about Langton's ant, which is a really interesting kind of

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.860
conceptual idea that someone's had.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.500
It's an example of what's called a "cellular automaton"

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.280
Hello. Hello tiny dog.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.180
Oh, it's a different person

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.980
[Brady] Sorry about that interruption.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.460
Langton's Ant is an example of what's called a "cellular automaton".

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.800
So it's a bit like "Game of Life".

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.460
Um... So you've got a grid of squares, the squares change colour depending on what's going on

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.180
in the thing. In the Game of Life, it's slightly different because the whole thing has a set of rules,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.860
and everything changes at the same time.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.680
But in Langton's Ant there is a specific, there's an ant that lives on the grid, and it walks from square to square,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.000
and as it moves, it changes what the squares are doing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.500
It's an example of something which has a very simple rule,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.540
but ends up being really, really complex.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.620
So this is a grid, a grid of squares, and I guess--

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.120
[Brady] Show me how you made it. Show us, give us all your secrets.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.360
Uh, okey. Well I got a paper bag, and cut one side of it, and then I printed it on to that,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.580
and it didn't break my printer, which I was very happy about, and then I've laminated that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.680
so I can rub off.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.820
There's the handles of the paper bag.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.640
It's simple rules. Basically so you start off with a completely blank grid, that looks nothing like an ant.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.340
I'll give it another couple of legs. There we go.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.700
So essentially what he does, every turn, is he either turns left 90° or turns right 90°,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.660
steps forward, and changes the color of the square as he leaves.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.600
What he does depends on what color the square he's on is.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.860
So if he starts off on a white square,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.920
He will turn 90° to the right, and step forward, so now he'll be over here,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.660
and as he leaves that square, he will change it from white to black.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.880
So that's now a black square.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.000
Now he's on a white square, so he will turn right again.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.720
And he'll end up on this square facing this way, and he'll change that square to black as well.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.100
And then he'll keep doing that, so he'll move, turn right from there, and then end up here facing that way.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
And we'll change this one to black. And this is where it starts getting interesting because now he turns right

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.300
and goes back on to that first square again. So he's now on there,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
facing that way, and you can't quite see him. If he's on a black square, it'll turn left.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.980
So he'll now come off this way, and go this way, and as he leaves that square, he changes it from black back to white again.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.920
So, essentially, you can keep moving like this, as long as you like, and just continue changing what happens

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.420
on the board. And if you start with a completely blank square, it's kind of interesting, so he will

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.960
start off by making quite simple patterns, and, kind of, things that look a bit symmetrical sometimes,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.540
But all, kind of, fairly simple, fairly self-contained.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.320
[♫]

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.080
After a few hundred steps, he starts to just become more chaotic,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.740
and eventually what he's doing looks completely random, and you're thinking "Is this just going to carry on like this forever?"

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:57.880
[♫]

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.120
And when he get's to, it's something like 10000 steps, it's a number just a bit more than 10000,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.640
he suddenly becomes completely regular. So he will start doing, like a column of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.400
a diagonal column of things that moves offwards.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.780
[♫]

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.720
It's like 104-step cycle that repeats and just continues moving diagonally off to a corner.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.440
He will carry on to infinity doing that.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.100
[♫]

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.580
And it's what's called an attractor. So this diagonal column that he does

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.900
is something that he will always end up doing. They tried loads of different initial states,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.280
loads of setting up the board to start with. He always ends up, eventually, getting to this weird diagonal

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.480
column thing, and just carries on doing that forever. And I just love that. That's it's a thing that he's drawn to do.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:04.660
[♫]

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.920
You can start with any grid you want, so you can almost program it like a computer because you know that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.540
it will do, you know, whatever it was going to do, given the particular starting configuration.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.920
And, I think it was about 2000, someone actually discovered that you can use this to run any computer

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.320
program. So you can build, kind of,  computer logic gates, and that kind of thing within this system.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.760
And it is a Universal Turing Machine.
