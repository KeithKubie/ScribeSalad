00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:03.097
- [Instructor] As we go further
in our statistical careers,

00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:05.088
it's going to be valuable to assume

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:08.603
that certain distributors
are normal distributions

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:11.818
or sometimes to assume that
they are binomial distributions

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:13.596
because if we can do that,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:17.293
we can make all sorts of
interesting inferences about them

00:00:17.293 --> 00:00:19.447
when we make that assumption.

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:22.169
But one of the key things
about normal distributions

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.866
or binomial distributions is
we assume that they're the sum

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.790
or they can be viewed

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.920
as the sum of a bunch
of independent trials

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.003
so we have to assume that

00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:35.024
trials are independent.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.756
Now that is reasonable
in a lot of situations,

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.373
but sometimes let's say you're conducting

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:44.461
a survey of people exiting a mall

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.489
and in that case and
let's say you're saying

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.788
whether they have done
their taxes already.

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:50.451
If they're exiting the mall,

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.514
it's hard to do these
samples with replacement.

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:54.355
They're leaving the mall.

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:55.325
You can't say, "Hey, hey, wait.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:56.580
"I just asked you a question.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.008
"Now you've answered it.

00:00:58.008 --> 00:00:59.417
"Now go back into the mall

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.860
"because I want each trial
to be truly independent."

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.897
But we all know it feels intuitive

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.728
that hey if there are
10,000 people in the mall

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:10.215
and I'm going to sample 10 of them,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.396
does it really matter that
it's truly independent?

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:15.139
Doesn't it matter that we're just

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.603
close to being independent?

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:19.116
And because of that idea

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:21.385
and because we do wanna make inferences

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:24.425
based on things being close
to a binomial distribution

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.955
or a normal distribution,

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:29.455
we have something called the 10% rule

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:35.354
and the 10% rule says that if our sample,

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:39.521
if our sample is less than or
equal to 10% of the population

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.487
then it is okay to assume
approximate independence

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:54.442
and there are some fairly
sophisticated ways of coming up

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:56.410
with this 10% threshold.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.954
People could have picked 9%.

00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:00.234
They could have picked 10.1%,

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:02.523
but 10% is a nice round number.

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:04.907
And if we look at some tangible examples,

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:07.657
it seems to do a pretty good job.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:11.390
So for example right over here,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.557
let's let x be the number
of boys from three trials

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:19.583
selecting from a classroom of n students

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:21.688
where 50% of the class is a boy

00:02:21.688 --> 00:02:24.485
and 50% of the glass is a girl

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:26.485
and so what we have over here is

00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:27.954
we have a bunch of different n's.

00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:29.426
What if we have 20 students in the class?

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:30.259
What if we have 30?

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.166
What if we have 100?

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.122
What if we have 10,000?

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:34.548
And so we could find the probability

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:37.677
that we select three boys with replacement

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.123
in each of these scenarios

00:02:39.123 --> 00:02:40.393
and we could also find the probability

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.735
that we select three
boys without replacement

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:43.740
and then we could think about

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.557
what proportion is our sample
size of the entire population

00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:49.390
and then we could say,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.540
"Hey, does the 10% rule
actually make sense?"

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.304
So this first column

00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:57.360
where we are picking three
boys with replacement,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.498
in this case because we are replacing,

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:02.862
each of these trials are independent,

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:04.695
are truly independent.

00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:07.989
And if our trials are independent,

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.841
then x would be truly a binomial variable.

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:16.146
Here, we aren't independent
because we are not replacing,

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:17.729
so not independent,

00:03:19.964 --> 00:03:22.160
and so officially in this
column right over here

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.370
when we're not replacing,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.236
x would not be considered
a binomial random variable.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:27.271
Let's see if there's a threshold

00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:30.909
where if our sample size is
a small enough percentage

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.291
of our entire population
where we would feel not so bad

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:38.161
about assuming x is
close to being binomial.

00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:42.377
So in all of the cases where
you have independent trials

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:46.099
and 50% of the population
is boys, 50% is girls,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.957
you're going to amount to
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2

00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:53.718
so in all of those situations
we have a 12.5% chance

00:03:53.718 --> 00:03:56.870
that x is going to be equal to three

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.919
and in this case x would
be a binomial variable.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.254
But look over here.

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:06.421
When three is a fairly large
percentage of our population,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.628
in this case it is 15%,

00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:14.505
the percent chance of getting
three boys without replacement

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.672
is 10.5% which is reasonably
different from 12.5%.

00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:23.766
It is 2% different but
2% relative to 12.5%

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:27.413
so that's some place in
between 10 and 20% difference

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:29.533
in terms of the probability.

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:31.960
So this is a reasonably big difference.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.532
But as we increase the population size

00:04:34.532 --> 00:04:37.034
without increasing the sample size,

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:38.612
we see that these numbers

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.856
get closer and closer to each other

00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:42.505
all the way so that if you have

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:44.688
10,000 people in your population

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:46.932
and you're only doing three trials

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:49.293
that the numbers get very, very close.

00:04:49.293 --> 00:04:52.426
This is actually 12.49 something percent,

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:54.589
but if you round to the
nearest tenth of a percent,

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:56.342
you see that they are close.

00:04:56.342 --> 00:04:58.329
So I think most people would say,

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:00.510
"All right, if your sample

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.933
"is three ten-thousandths
of the population

00:05:03.933 --> 00:05:05.702
"that you'd feel pretty good

00:05:05.702 --> 00:05:08.003
"treating this column without replacement

00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:11.762
"as being pretty close to
being a binomial variable."

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:12.695
And most people would say,

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:14.593
"All right, this first scenario

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:18.509
"where your sample size
is 15% of your population,

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.629
"you wouldn't feel so good treating this

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.766
"without replacement column as
a binomial random variable."

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:26.916
But where do you draw the line?

00:05:26.916 --> 00:05:29.955
And as we alluded to earlier in the video,

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:33.316
the line is typically drawn at 10%.

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:34.870
That if your sample size

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.569
is less than or equal to
10% of your population,

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.561
it's not unreasonable to
treat your random variable,

00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:45.179
even though it's not
officially binomial to say,

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.695
"Okay, maybe it is.

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:49.095
"Maybe I can functionally
treat it as binomial

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:49.955
"and then from there

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:52.236
"I can make all of the
powerful interferences

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:54.529
"that we tend to do in statistics."

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.194
With that said, the lower the percentage

00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:00.692
the sample is of the
population the better.

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:01.733
Now to be clear,

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:04.971
that's not saying that small
sample sizes are better

00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:06.702
than large sample sizes.

00:06:06.702 --> 00:06:10.206
In statistics, large sample
sizes tend to be a lot better

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.717
than small sample sizes.

00:06:11.717 --> 00:06:15.774
But if you wanna make this
independence assumption,

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:18.485
so to speak, even when
it's not exactly true,

00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:19.923
you want your sample

00:06:19.923 --> 00:06:22.874
to be a small percentage
of the population.

00:06:22.874 --> 00:06:25.737
So the ideal, let's say you're
doing a survey at the mall,

00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:27.725
you might wanna survey 100 people

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:29.606
but you would hope that there's at least

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:33.338
1,000 people in the mall
in order for you to feel

00:06:33.338 --> 00:06:35.739
like your trials are
reasonably independent.

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:37.231
If there's 10,000 people in the mall

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:38.872
or somehow 50,000 people in the mall,

00:06:38.872 --> 00:06:42.166
which would be a very large
mall, well that's even better.
