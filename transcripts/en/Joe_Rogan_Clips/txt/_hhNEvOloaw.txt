Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, and I go into the issue of Iowasca, uh, in, in this book because I, first of all, I [inaudible] is itself another example of Amazonian Science. Um, as you and I, and many of the listeners and viewers know, uh, the active ingredient of Iowasca is DMT dimethyltryptamine, but dimethyltryptamine is not normally accessible through the gut. Uh, we have to smoke it or, or vape it to get that rocket ship to the other side of reality. And the journey lasts what, 10, 12 minutes, not much more than that, and sometimes, sometimes quite a lot less. What Iowasca does is it makes DMT available through the gut. The reason it's not available through the gut is because of an enzyme in the gut called monoamine oxidase. And that switch is off DMT on contact, the Iowasca Vine, which is one of the two ingredients of the IOWASCA brew.

Speaker 1:          00:56          The other ingredient is leaves that contain DMT. The IOWASCA vine contains Amano Amy [inaudible] oxidase inhibitor, which switches off the enzyme in the gut and allows the DMT to be accessed orally, which produces a rather different journey from the smoked or vaped DMT trip is a much longer journey. It's four or five hours. It allows you to integrate and to, and to interrelate with the strange landscapes in which you find yourself amongst and the entities that you encounter. I'm not making any claims about the reality status of those entities, but what I am saying, and it's a fact, is that people who work with DMT and Iowaska do encounter what they construe to be entities, uh, who, who communicate with them intelligently. So somebody in the Amazon, out of 150,000 different species of plants and trees selected two that are not psychoactive on their own, but when put together, create an extraordinary visionary brew, uh, and Iowasca means the vine of the dead and what it's connected to, uh, in South American religious and spiritual thinking, uh, is what happens to us when we die.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Uh, and, and, uh, the Takano who are an Amazonian people who work regularly with Iowasca. I mean the, no, actually we'll give a teaspoon full of Iowasca to a newborn infant. They feel I ask is so important that there is a hidden realm around us which we are not normally aware of and we need to be aware of it. Um, and I'll ask it as an important part of that. In their IOWASCA journeys, the Tucano Schamens experience visions and they will then come back to an alert, normal problem solving state of consciousness and they will paint and depict their visions. And what's intriguing, and I, I go into it in the book, is the quite a number of the tacamo paintings of the other world of the afterlife realm of the entrance to the other world are geometrical and they look exactly like the vehicle glyphs.

Speaker 1:          02:47          So I'm beginning to wonder whether these geoglyphs we're part of a system of spiritual ideas concerning what happens to us after death and what we need to do in this life to ensure a beneficial outcome. And oddly enough, that same system of ideas is found in the Mississippi valley, in the Amazon. It involves, uh, particularly Iowasca and the belief that the IOWASCA journey takes you to the afterlife realm and a journey along the milky way in the Mississippi Valley. Um, the mound builder sites up and down the Mississippi Valley, particularly Mountville in Alabama, exactly the same system of religious ideas associated with geometrical constructions that on death the soul, they're very specific ascends to the constellation of Orion transits from the constellation of Orion to the Milky Way makes a journey along the Milky Way, which they call the path of souls and encounters challenges and or deals where the soul must account for the life that it has lived.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Then we got to Egypt and what do we find the same system of ideas. The soul must rise up to the constellation of Orion. There's a narrow shaft cut through the southern side of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which targets directly the lowest of the three stars of Orion's belt, widely accepted as a star shaft or a sole shaft. The soul would rise up through that shaft, get to the Constellation of Orion, which stands by the banks of the Milky Way. It would then transit to the Milky Way, which they engined to Egyptians called the winding waterway. And it would make a journey along the milky way where it would be confronted by challenges and or deals, very similar idea to the Chicano, very similar idea to the Mississippi valley as far as we know. None of these cultures were in contact with one another. Either we're dealing with a huge, unbelievable, extraordinarily detailed coincidence involving architecture and ideas.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Or we're looking at the legacy that was inherited in all of these different places from a remote common ancestor. And, and I believe that that's what we're looking at. What do we think the people from the ancient Mississippi Valley though, that culture, what do we think they were using if they weren't using Iowasca or do we think that's what they were using? Well, that's, that's, that's an interesting question. Whether, whether visionary substances are the only way to get into altered states of consciousness. And, and, uh, I would say they, they, they are definitely not a, of course there are visionary substances which are, which are used in native American, uh, vision, vision quests. I've, I've, I've had the privilege of Payoti ceremony, uh, with the native American church. Um, I've never done that. What does that look like? I loved it actually. I thought, I thought it was, I thought it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          05:22          It, it doesn't overpower you in the way that DMT and Iowaska does. Uh, it's, it's, it's much gentler. It's much more, you feel much more integrated and connected with, with, with nature. Your thought processes are quite, quite clear. It felt, it felt just like a very beautiful and healing experience. And I loved the ceremony that I'm in. I'm inside a teepee with, with 30 or 40 other people and that there, there are specific roles that are assigned to those different individuals. One, we'll keep the door, another will be responsible for the fire, which is a work of art in itself. Just gazing into that fire. And the glowing, the glowing embers is enough to induce an altered state of consciousness on its own. Incredible drumming, which, which drives your state of consciousness into a kind of peak peak experience. This is a technology for accessing other levels of experience and other levels of reality.

Speaker 1:          06:09          And it's clear that the native Americans had a number of advanced technologies in this area. The Sundance doesn't use a substance, but it uses austerity. It uses pain to drive an altered state of consciousness. The objective in every case seems to be, let's just for a while, get ourselves out of the narrow, rigid frame of the alert, problem solving, state of consciousness. We all need that. It's incredibly useful. Hunter gatherer is needed just as much as people in cities need it, but it's not the only state of consciousness available to human beings. And maybe that's one of the big mistakes that we're making in our culture. Um, and was not made in, in shamanistic societies.
