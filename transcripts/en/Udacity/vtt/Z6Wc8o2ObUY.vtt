00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.620
Let's suppose that two autonomous systems connect

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.440
in two different cities, San Francisco and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.860
New York. Let's further suppose that AS1 wants traffic to destination d to enter

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.870
via New York City, rather than via the peering link in San Francisco. Well

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.710
remember that all things being equal, routers

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.350
inside AS2 will select the BGP route with

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.770
the shortest IGP path cost to the next

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.510
hop, resulting in hot potato routing. So some

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.720
routers will select the San Francisco egress, and

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.940
other routers might select the New York egress.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.480
To override this default hot potato routing behavior,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.290
AS1 might advertise its BGP routes to AS2

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.000
with MED values. For example, if the MED

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.350
value on the route learned, at the border router

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.510
in New York, was 10, and the MED value

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.730
from the route learned from the router in San Francisco

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.800
was 20, than instead of performing hot potato routing, all

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.150
of these routers that would ordinarily be closer to the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.430
San Francisco egress, would instead pick the route learned via

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.150
the New York egress. Because the preference for a lower

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.990
MED value comes before the preference for a next hop

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.470
with the lower IGP path process. So all of these

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.680
routes would instead be carried over AS2's

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.580
backbone network and exit via New York.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.090
Thus MED overrides hot potato routing behavior

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.630
allowing NAS to explicitly specify that it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.250
wants another neighboring AS to carry the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.460
traffic on its own backbone network, rather

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.280
than dumping the traffic at the closest

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.320
egress and forcing traffic across the neighbor's backbone.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310
MEDs are typically not used in conventional

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.010
business relationships, but they're sometimes used, for example,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.670
if AS1 does not want AS2 free riding

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.030
on AS1's backbone network. So effectively MED allows

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.280
AS1 to say, yes, I will connect or peer with you, but it is your

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.650
job to carry the traffic long distances across

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.990
the country. This mechanism is sometimes used when

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.880
a transit provider peers with a content

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.880
provider, and the transit provider doesn't want the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.550
content provider essentially getting free transit through

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.180
the neighboring AS. In the absence of MED

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.030
overriding any behavior, typically what will happen

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.670
is a router inside the AS2 would learn

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.930
multiple routes via internal BGP to different egress

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.120
points for the same destination d, and it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.590
would simply pick the next hop or, the egress router, with the lowest IGP path

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.970
cost. In this case, 5. It's very common practice to set these IGP costs in

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.710
accordance with distance, or propagation delay, thus

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.370
resulting in routers inside the AS picking shorter

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.300
paths. Now one problem with this notion of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.380
hot potato routing is that a very small

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.470
change in IGP path cost can result in

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.250
a lot of BGP routing changes. Remember that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.140
it's probably not just one destination that's being

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.870
routed through the San Francisco egress, but maybe tens

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.080
of thousands of routes. So a single IGP

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.600
path cost change can result in rerouting of tens

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.840
of thousands of IP prefixes in BGP. People

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.240
have looked at various ways to improve the stability

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.960
of BGP routing, by decoupling the IGP and the

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.290
BGP, in this part of the route selection process.
