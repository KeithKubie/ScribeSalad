00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.536
My inbox is full of hate mails
and personal abuse

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.920
and has been for years.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.336
In 2010, I started answering those mails

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.760
and suggesting to the writer
that we might meet for coffee and a chat.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.280
I have had hundreds of encounters.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.120
They have taught me something important
that I want to share with you.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.576
I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.280
and we moved to Denmark
when I was a young child.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.136
In 2007, I ran for a seat
in the Danish parliament

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.080
as one of the first women
with a minority background.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.536
I was elected,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.536
but I soon found out
that not everyone was happy about it

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.760
as I had to quickly get used
to finding hate messages in my inbox.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.936
Those emails would begin
with something like this:

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.800
"What's a raghead like you
doing in our parliament?"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.616
I never answered.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.736
I'd just delete the emails.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.920
I just thought that the senders
and I had nothing in common.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.936
They didn't understand me,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.280
and I didn't understand them.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.976
Then one day, one of my colleagues
in the parliament said

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.040
that I should save the hate mails.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.360
"When something happens to you,
it will give the police a lead."

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.856
(Laughter)

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.136
I noticed that she said,
"When something happens" and not "if."

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.800
(Laughter)

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.520
Sometimes hateful letters
were also sent to my home address.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.976
The more I became involved
in public debate,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600
the more hate mail and threats I received.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.576
After a while, I got a secret address

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.920
and I had to take extra precautions
to protect my family.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.776
Then in 2010, a Nazi began to harass me.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.280
It was a man who had attacked
Muslim women on the street.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.160
Over time, it became much worse.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:27.200
I was at the zoo with my children,
and the phone was ringing constantly.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.520
It was the Nazi.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.536
I had the impression that he was close.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.760
We headed home.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.576
When we got back,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.576
my son asked, "Why does
he hate you so much, Mom,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.520
when he doesn't even know you?"

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.920
"Some people are just stupid," I said.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.320
And at the time, I actually thought
that was a pretty clever answer.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.760
And I suspect that that is the answer
most of us would give.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.760
The others --

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.520
they are stupid, brainwashed, ignorant.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.360
We are the good guys
and they are the bad guys, period.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.616
Several weeks later
I was at a friend's house,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.560
and I was very upset and angry
about all the hate and racism I had met.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.856
It was he who suggested
that I should call them up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.080
and visit them.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.120
"They will kill me," I said.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.096
"They would never attack a member
of the Danish Parliament," he said.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.136
"And anyway, if they killed you,
you would become a martyr."

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.296
(Laughter)

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.896
"So it's pure win-win situation for you."

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160
(Laughter)

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.656
His advice was so unexpected,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.936
when I got home,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.216
I turned on my computer

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.720
and opened the folder
where I had saved all the hate mail.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.600
There were literally hundreds of them.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.056
Emails that started
with words like "terrorist,"

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.696
"raghead,"

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.200
"rat," "whore."

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.600
I decided to contact the one
who had sent me the most.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.680
His name was Ingolf.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.840
I decided to contact him just once
so I could say at least I had tried.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.576
To my surprise and shock,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.920
he answered the phone.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:33.896
I blurted out, "Hello, my name is Ã–zlem.
You have sent me so many hate mails.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.656
You don't know me, I don't know you.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.136
I was wondering if I could come around
and we can drink a coffee together

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.416
and talk about it?"

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.760
(Laughter)

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.200
There was silence on the line.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.760
And then he said,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.096
"I have to ask my wife."

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.496
(Laughter)

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.736
What?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.176
The racist has a wife?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.056
(Laughter)

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.136
A couple of days later,
we met at his house.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.416
I will never forget
when he opened his front door

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.880
and reached out to shake my hand.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.896
I felt so disappointed.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.136
(Laughter)

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.240
because he looked
nothing like I'd imagined.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.296
I had expected a horrible person --

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.456
dirty, messy house.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.720
It was not.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.496
His house smelled of coffee

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.520
which was served from a coffee set
identical to the one my parents used.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.320
I ended up staying
for two and a half hours.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.960
And we had so many things in common.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.936
Even our prejudices were alike.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.856
(Laughter)

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.936
Ingolf told me
that when he waits for the bus

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.416
and the bus stops 10 meters away from him,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.400
it was because the driver was a "raghead."

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.016
I recognized that feeling.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.320
When I was young

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.056
and I waited for the bus

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.136
and it stopped 10 meters away from me,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.600
I was sure that the driver was a racist.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.696
When I got home,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.160
I was very ambivalent about my experience.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.720
On the one hand, I really liked Ingolf.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.160
He was easy and pleasant to talk to,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.976
but on the other hand,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.696
I couldn't stand the idea
of having so much in common

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.920
with someone who had
such clearly racist views.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.296
Gradually,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.016
and painfully,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.296
I came to realize

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.200
that I had been just as judgmental
of those who had sent me hate mails

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.080
as they had been of me.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.600
This was the beginning
of what I call #dialoguecoffee.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.056
Basically, I sit down for coffee

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.896
with people who have said
the most terrible things to me

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.736
to try to understand
why they hate people like me

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.600
when they don't even know me.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.160
I have been doing this
the last eight years.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.176
The vast majority of people
I approach agree to meet me.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.536
Most of them are men,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.040
but I have also met women.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.896
I have made it a rule
to always meet them in their house

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.320
to convey from the outset
that I trust them.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.776
I always bring food
because when we eat together,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.216
it is easier to find
what we have in common

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.720
and make peace together.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.896
Along the way, I have learned
some valuable lessons.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.016
The people who sent
hate mails are workers,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.336
husbands, wives,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.720
parents like you and me.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.856
I'm not saying that
their behavior is acceptable,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.616
but I have learned to distance myself
from the hateful views

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.240
without distancing myself from the person
who's expressing those views.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.296
And I have discovered

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.216
that the people I visit are just
as afraid of people they don't know

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.320
as I was afraid of them before
I started inviting myself for coffee.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.936
During these meetings,
a specific theme keeps coming up.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.296
It shows up regardless whether
I'm talking to a humanist or a racist,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.816
a man, a woman,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.896
a Muslim or an atheist.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.856
They all seem to think

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.016
that other people
are to blame for the hate

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.296
and for the generalization of groups.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.056
They all believe that other people
have to stop demonizing.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.856
They point at politicians,
the media, their neighbor

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.320
or the bus driver
who stops 10 meters away.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.200
But when I asked, "What about you?

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.280
What can you do?",

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.576
the reply is usually,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.376
"What can I do?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.456
I have no influence.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.160
I have no power."

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.336
I know that feeling.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.976
For a large part of my life,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.976
I also thought that I didn't have
any power or influence --

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.920
even when I was a member
of the Danish parliament.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.856
But today I know the reality is different.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.776
We all have power
and influence where we are,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.216
so we must never,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.520
never underestimate our own potential.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.096
The #dialoguecoffee meetings
have taught me

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.136
that people of all political convictions
can be caught demonizing

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.000
the others with different views.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.856
I know what I'm talking about.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.576
As a young child, I hated
different population groups.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.760
And at the time, my religious views
were very extreme.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.456
But my friendship with Turks,
with Danes, with Jews and with racists

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.840
has vaccinated me
against my own prejudices.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.456
I grew up in a working-class family,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.080
and on my journey I have met many people
who have insisted on speaking to me.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.680
They have changed my views.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.280
They have formed me as a democratic
citizen and a bridge builder.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.296
If you want to prevent hate and violence,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.736
we have to talk to as many
people as possible

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.056
for as long as possible

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.280
while being as open as possible.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.376
That can only be achieved through debate,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.296
critical conversation

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.320
and insisting on dialogue
that doesn't demonize people.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.640
I'm going to ask you a question.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.816
I invite you to think about it when
you get home and in the coming days,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.536
but you have to be honest with yourself.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.960
It should be easy,
no one else will know it.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.000
The question is this ...

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.120
who do you demonize?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.800
Do you think supporters of American
President Trump are deplorables?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.360
Or that those who voted for Turkish
President ErdoÄŸan are crazy Islamists?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.440
Or that those who voted for Le Pen
in France are stupid fascists?

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.576
Or perhaps you think that Americans
who voted for Bernie Sanders

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.216
are immature hippies.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.760
(Laughter)

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.840
All those words have been used
to vilify those groups.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.560
Maybe at this point,
do you think I am an idealist?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.776
I want to give you a challenge.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.576
Before the end of this year,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.296
I challenge you to invite
someone who you demonize --

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.376
someone who you disagree with
politically and/or culturally

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.720
and don't think you have
anything in common with.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.760
I challenge you to invite someone
like this to #dialoguecoffee.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.560
Remember Ingolf?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.416
Basically, I'm asking you
to find an Ingolf in your life,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.096
contact him or her

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.600
and suggest that you can meet
for #dialoguecofee.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.656
When you start at #dialoguecoffee,
you have to remember this:

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.776
first, don't give up
if the person refuses at first.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.800
Sometimes it's taken me nearly one year
to arrange a #dialoguecoffee meeting.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.856
Two:

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.256
acknowledge the other person's courage.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.576
It isn't just you who's brave.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.736
The one who's inviting you
into their home is just as brave.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.096
Three:

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.416
don't judge during the conversation.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.280
Make sure that most of the conversation
focuses on what you have in common.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.240
As I said, bring food.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.416
And finally, remember to finish
the conversation in a positive way

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.456
because you are going to meet again.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.280
A bridge can't be built in one day.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.456
We are living in a world where many people
hold definitive and often extreme opinions

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.696
about the others

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.320
without knowing much about them.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.176
We notice of course the prejudices
on the other side than in our own bases.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.200
And we ban them from our lives.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.760
We delete the hate mails.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.776
We hang out only with people
who think like us

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.520
and talk about the others
in a category of disdain.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.176
We unfriend people on Facebook,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.376
and when we meet people
who are discriminating

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.136
or dehumanizing people or groups,

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.640
we don't insist on speaking with them
to challenge their opinions.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.176
That's how healthy democratic
societies break down --

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.520
when we don't check the personal
responsibility for the democracy.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.160
We take the democracy for granted.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.400
It is not.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.880
Conversation is the most difficult
thing in a democracy

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.000
and also the most important.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.520
So here's my challenge.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.416
Find your Ingolf.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.456
(Laughter)

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.160
Start a conversation.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.296
Trenches have been dug
between people, yes,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.720
but we all have the ability to build
the bridges that cross the trenches.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.496
And let me end by quoting my friend,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.720
Sergeot Uzan,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.656
who lost his son, Dan Uzan,
in a terror attack

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.880
on a Jewish synagogue in Copenhagen, 2015.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.640
Sergio rejected any suggestion of revenge

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.520
and instead said this ...

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.360
"Evil can only be defeated
by kindness between people.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.720
Kindness demands courage."

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.776
Dear friends,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.616
let's be courageous.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.856
Thank you.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.440
(Applause)
