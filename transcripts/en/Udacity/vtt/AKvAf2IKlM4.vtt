[Peter] So on this web page, there are 3 clickable hyperlinks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first URL links to higher education.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The second URL links to Sebastian's Wikipedia page.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And the last one is the Digital Life Design Conference Wikipedia page.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
To go to the answers, here is the HTML page that you were given.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first option is this URL right here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Although it is a URL, it's not a clickable link.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's not encapsulated in this prefix

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that was described before.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The "a" means that this is an anchor tag,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and the href means that it's a hyperlink reference

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
specified by the URL.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So this is not the correct choice because it is not a link

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that you can click on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The second choice is a URL to the Wikipedia page on higher education.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It highlights this text as a clickable link.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The third option is Sebastian Thrun's Wikipedia page.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Again, for the same reason as before, it's a link that you can click on.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The fourth option is this quote.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Although it's encapsulated in quotes like the other URLs,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it's not in a tag at all.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's just plain text as displayed on the screen.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The last option is a URL to the Wikipedia page

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
on the Digital Life Design Conference.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Like the other 2 URLs, it is a link that you can click on.
