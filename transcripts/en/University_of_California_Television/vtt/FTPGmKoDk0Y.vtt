00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:12.740
- We are the paradoxical ape,
bipedal, naked, large brain, long the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.580
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:30.140
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.540
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shake the future from our shared

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.900
understanding of the past. Carta brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.070
to exchange insights on who we are and
how we got here. An exploration made

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.615
possible by the generosity of
humans like you.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.255
- If you go to Nicaragua today, you
can see these deaf children

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:08.128
hanging out in their
school playground using

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:12.116
a rich natural sign language to
communicate, and 40 years

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:17.073
ago this language didn't exist. Forty
years ago, deaf children in Nicaragua,

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:19.995
children just like these kids,
didn't have the ability

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:23.901
to communicate effortlessly with
one another like they do.

00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:27.840
So how did their language, how did
this language get into

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.250
the hands of these children? If we think
about that, if we really think where does

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.190
any language come from, where does the
language come from. Languages really

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.510
central to human nature. It's universal.
Not every community has writing or numbers

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.130
or using the wheel, but every community,
every human community has a language.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.880
Language is not something that we've
discovered out there in the world.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.280
Languages come from us. They're product of
humans connecting and interacting in a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.870
social network generation after
generation. So to see where this language

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.800
came from, I'm going to take you on a
little journey and retrace the path of

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.900
Nicaraguan sign language up to the present
day. When these children arrived at school

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.140
five years ago, they were already about
1,200 deaf native users of Nicaraguan sign

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.320
language, and there were hundreds of kids
older than them using this language around

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.389
them, in their school. These children
learned it from interacting with them.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.210
Now, if we want to know what those
hundreds of kids who were older than that

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.220
first, that current day generation of
children. What they looked like. We can

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.380
look at the kids who were teenagers at
that time when they entered. So this first

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.750
group here entered the school in the mid
1990s, and at that time there are about

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.140
800 signers of Nicaraguan sign language,
and two hundred of them were at the school

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.800
at any time. You know, you could
see that this is--

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.560
it's a fast, it's fluent. They can talk
about the non-hear now. This is a natural

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:22.110
human language that's used for what human
languages are used for. If we want to know

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.950
where they got their language from, we can
retrace the steps of the language further

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.710
back when these kids were four and five
years old, and ask who were the teenagers

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.700
then when they arrived at school. So we
can look at the people who were you know,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:49.160
10 years older than them. When these
guys-- These are the cohort that arrived

00:04:49.340 --> 00:05:00.350
in the 1980s. So when they arrived, they
were about 400 signers of Nicaraguan sign

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.720
language, again 200 at the school. You may
be able-- if you have an eye for it, you

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.150
may be able to see how as we're going
further and further back, the language is

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.250
a little bit more deliberate. The feedback
is a little more explicit and the signs

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.130
are bigger and more symmetrical, they are
more two handed signs. There are a lot of

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.120
differences like that in my, a lot of the
work I do is to try and quantify what

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:31.850
those differences are. But if you wanted
to know who they got their language from,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.740
so if I continue this retracing of the
steps. When they arrived at the school,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:49.790
the older people were these people who are
45 to 50 years old today. When these

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.320
people where four and five years old in
the 1970s, when they first came to the

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.070
school, there were no signers of
Nicaraguan sign language. This is where we

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.703
reach the end of our retracing.
Nobody taught these people to sign.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.840
The teachers at the school used Spanish
which they couldn't hear so this is really

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.850
where NSL begins with these cohort of 50
pioneers. They took the gestures and

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.720
actions that they observed as a raw
materials and wove them into a new

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.220
language. So we have this incredible
opportunity to see how languages are born

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.860
and evolve, and the rule that language
learners play in that evolution. I'm going

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.300
to start with the language of this
earliest first cohort of signers and walk

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.540
forward to the present day and start with
the most fundamental pieces of the grammar

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.660
that every language has, the structure of
the simple statement. So arguments and

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.510
predicates. How do you show who's doing
what to whom? So in English for example,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.870
we use word order to do this. If you take
a sentence like, "A man taps a woman."

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.240
And you change the order of the words,
"A woman taps a man." You change who's

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.290
doing the tapping and who gets tapped.
Now, other languages might stick

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.830
inflectional endings on the end of the
verbs or even on the nouns to show which

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.760
person is the tapper and which is the
tappee, and to figure this out my

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.030
colleagues and I used non-verbal materials
to list sentences that can compare these

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.880
different aspects of the sentence. So I'll
show you how different signers respond to

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:35.020
stimuli like this. So in event like this,
giving event or this tapping event. Here's

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.090
what the first cohort's signs is looked
like. They have a very strict noun-verb,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.960
noun-verb word order. So to say that a
woman taps a man, you've got woman tap,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.280
and then tapped. Here's what this looks
like when the first cohort signer signs it

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.080
So I want you to see how he produces
that noun-verb, noun-verb order for

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:02.830
signing who tapped, and the sign for woman
which is produced like this, and who is

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:09.130
tapped, the sign for man.
So he's going to sign these nouns, man and

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.350
woman, and in the neutral area, in front
of his chest. Know that there's this

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.750
movement in the verbs away from and toward
the body in a way they can reflect sort of

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.770
iconically the way that movement happens
in the world. But they're centered in the

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:29.320
signer's body. He keeps this body centered
and neutral. So here's what it looks like.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.660
Woman, tap man, get tapped. Right? So this
is all very nice, clear and orderly, but

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.590
the interesting thing is that it wasn't
reproduced this way in the next second

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:46.110
cohort. So starting in about 1983 or 84,
the second wave of kids who're coming in

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.570
took this direction in which signs are
produced and started giving that job in

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:57.450
the grammar. What they did was start
modifying where they produce their signs

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.840
as a way of showing who did what to whom.
So in this example in the first panel, we

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.400
have the words see and pay produced in
this neutral area in front of the chest.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.830
Then in the second panel you can see the
signs have been modified so the direction

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.000
is to the left. So if these signs were
together in one sentence produced by a

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:23.610
second cohort signer, it would mean that
that same person was both seen and

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.390
paid, right? So these inflections started
out with the verbs like this but soon

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:34.350
after in the mid 80s, you can also start
producing nouns in particular locations to

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.070
link them to verbs and more recently you
can even use it just a point to one

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.440
location or another to refer to the person
associated with that location. So now

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.220
you're using these locations and space not
to talk about where or something happened

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.600
but to show who's involved. So here's an
example where the second cohort signer

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.980
does, and you can see how these
developments really changed the basic

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:04.590
structure of the sentence, right? So, here
is the woman giving to the main event, and

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:09.190
you'll see we get the nouns now being
produced in particular locations that

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.050
correspond with the direction of movement
in the verbs to show you what the object

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.170
or recipient is. There are the steps
with the addition of

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.040
the spatial modification on the signs that
came in changes in the world or whatever.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.130
So now the verbs move to the end of the
sentence. So you're going to see, first

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.330
she actually talks about-- remember those
three people in that scenes. So she starts

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.490
talking about the woman on the right just
looking straight ahead then she touches

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.160
her chest, that's a switch reference
device, then you'll see she does woman,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:48.820
man, your nouns, and give, receive, your
verbs. Woman look and then self, woman,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.970
man give receipt. Okay, if we move to the
third cohort, we're going to see the

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.240
introduction of the space, saw you. So you
use your points linking the verbs with the

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:07.160
doer and the done too. So this is an event
where a woman pushes another woman, woman

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.310
in a black shirt, and a woman in a green
shirt. So he's going to index the black

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:18.230
shirt to his left and woman in green to
the right. Then come the verbs, remember

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.870
now they're at the end, push, be pushed.
Finally you'll see this verb respect at

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.100
the end, and what I love about this
example, the respect sign here. Is that

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.100
even the respect isn't something that
moves from one person to another and know

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.250
who's telling. Here we're going to see the
space and the movement of the verb linking

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.150
it to the nouns. So you can say green
tells black, the black should show green

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:48.320
some respect and you do all that with one
word using the space. So black, green,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:57.790
push, be pushed, respect. See? Okay, so we
can measure three structure in many ways,

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.440
and here's one. If you plot how frequently
points are used in that way that shows who

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.820
rather than where, you get this pattern.
So starting in the left with home signers

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.970
who are deaf people who were never exposed
to a sign language, and then the first,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.730
second and third cohorts. You can that
they all use points to show where about

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.080
the same amount that something would stay
pretty stable. But this nominal use that's

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.690
used to show who, that's linking the noun
with the verbs. This use really increased

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:33.370
with the second and third cohorts of
signers. So the questions why this changed

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.290
and if children are so good at learning
language and someone has already developed

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.200
the perfectly good way to mark subjects
and objects. Why didn't the second cohort

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.710
just learn to sign it the same way that
the first cohort had been doing it. I

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.580
mean, it's one thing to gradually drop
whom from your English but this is a total

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.270
restructuring of the language here. So to
answer that question, I think we really

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:05.460
need to take seriously this idea of
language as an organism.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.050
Language is an organism, so this isn't
just a metaphor when we say this is-- A

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.660
language is an abstract thing, it's
abstract but it's still real. It's a

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.450
bundle of structured material. It's self
replicating and we each live in that

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.930
symbiotic relationship with that language,
like the microbes in our gut. Like we

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.950
can't survive without it and it can't
survive without us. Language changes and

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:38.850
adapts to the humans that host it. So the
social network of people that learn it and

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.490
pass it on are the environment in which
language evolves.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.620
Now, the different versions of Nicaraguan
sign languages that we see signed by

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.480
different aged cohorts today represents
this living record of the evolutionary

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:58.150
path of the language. So you know, the way
that I've been doing my work that I

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.080
described is you know, I look at the slice
today, right?

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.540
If we start with the 1970s in this figure
over to the left and you have the first

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.880
cohort coming in, and then in the 80s the
second cohort joins, and then the third

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:18.130
and fourth. We can look at today at the
differences between the cohorts, but we

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:25.120
can't forget that the action and moment of
change is over there, right? As we add

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.910
each new wave, and that's where the
language, that's when the language

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.920
reproduces, right? So the first cohort
builds the language as children in the

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:40.460
70s, and then they pass it on to this next
cohort in the 80s, and that second cohort

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.490
acquires it with sub-fidelity but they
don't copy it exactly. And so on in the

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.820
90s and today, and we know these changes
occurred when their children-- because the

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.230
path is uni-directional, right? So stuff
can get passed on to later cohorts, but

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.290
not the other way. It doesn't go back. So
things that adults initiate or learn, they

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.900
would be the same for everyone, and there
are things like that, that you see, that

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.110
are the same across all of the cohorts.
But these core ethics of the grammar, how

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.400
the sentence structured. How you do
agreement, how you show who's doing what

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.430
to whom. Those kinds of things, they're
changing just in that one direction, and

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:27.600
they don't get passed on back up. So this
change from one to two, then there's

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.920
where, that where, got re-interpreted as
who. So to take our questions about, "Why

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.880
change it?" We have to really think about
how languages replicate, right? What's the

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.890
mechanism that copies that code? The rules
and patterns of Nicaraguan sign language

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:50.380
and passes it on to the next generation of
NSL, right? Just because the organism

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.560
let's say 1980s NSL developed some cool
characteristic, doesn't mean you get to

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:03.530
pass it on for free. If we don't have a
really good understanding of the mechanism

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.700
of reproduction. We'll start to see
parallels between

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.310
development and evolution that don't
actually explain the nature of the change.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.890
So most of us are more familiar with
Lamarck's second law here. This idea that

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.160
adaptations made by an organism in
response to its environment get inherited

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.790
by its offspring, right? So the sons of
the blacksmith must have bigger biceps, or

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.050
the daughter of the giraffe gets a
slightly longer neck than her mother

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:37.720
started with. But Lamarck also had this
first law that much as we developed from

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:43.100
simple cells to complex systems that all
organisms have a natural drive to

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.550
complexify. These are great ideas but they
don't work out, right? They don't work out

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.720
because now we know that reproductions
doesn't work that way. You don't just pass

00:16:52.900 --> 00:17:00.060
them the useful stuff or the more complex
stuff, or the exercise parts. What we've

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.280
learned from Darwin, and since Darwin is
that we have to pay attention to

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.310
reproduction and selection processes,
right? Organisms send along everything,

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.190
they send out everything, not just the
useful stuff, but they do it with their

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.690
ability and noise. So the environment is
what's determining what will survive,

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:23.050
right? So now we really have
two evolutionary processes on really,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:28.050
really different time scale. So we've got
human reproduction and selection on one

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.570
hand, and language reproduction and
selection on the other. It's not that one

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:38.130
recapitulates the other, it's each of them
is evolving in a shape by the processes of

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:42.880
reproduction and selection. In human
reproduction we pass on what kind of

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:48.280
patterns we can learn and it may be very
slowly and very long ago that more

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.780
effective and more powerful pattern
learning devices would prevail. But we all

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.000
came in to the world with brains that a
product of that process. On the other

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.660
hand, when language is reproduce, they
sent out you know, all this accumulated

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.050
symbols and patterns of combinations, but
it's a blurry and blended its signal,

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.450
right? It's just the output of someone's
own language, and it isn't copied

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.160
perfectly. In the process of selection,
it's not the useful stuff but the

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.920
learnable parts of the
language that survived.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.760
So what we've got then is this
co-evolution of humans and their

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:32.960
languages. Each of them is serving as the
environment for the other, and each cannot

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:40.810
survive without the other. So, the thing
is though, that we don't set out to create

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:44.960
languages to grow languages, right? This
isn't done with an intention to make a

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:50.660
code. Humans grow languages because our
social connection is so critical, right?

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.700
When we pass a language from one
generation to the next, the goal isn't to

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.170
create something or to organize your
message. The goal is to connect, and the

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:07.300
drive is a social one that the idea is to
get your message into someone else's mind

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.240
and to understand what message someone
else is sending to your mind. In that

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:16.460
process of communicating back and forth
and actually forth and forth, that's how

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.652
we weave the fabric of language with
the machinery of our minds.

00:19:21.712 --> 00:19:23.590
So thank you very much.
