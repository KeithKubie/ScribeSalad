he was a huge smash for a game that
 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.490 align:start position:0%
he was a huge smash for a game that
essentially<00:11:00.510><c> at</c><00:11:00.600><c> its</c><00:11:00.690><c> core</c><00:11:00.870><c> still</c><00:11:01.140><c> just</c><00:11:01.290><c> not</c><00:11:01.440><c> a</c>

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
essentially at its core still just not a
 

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.890 align:start position:0%
essentially at its core still just not a
runner<00:11:01.770><c> but</c><00:11:02.250><c> they</c><00:11:02.640><c> pushed</c><00:11:02.850><c> the</c><00:11:03.060><c> genre</c><00:11:03.600><c> forward</c>

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
runner but they pushed the genre forward
 

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.090 align:start position:0%
runner but they pushed the genre forward
so<00:11:04.020><c> that's</c><00:11:04.170><c> definitely</c><00:11:04.320><c> something</c><00:11:04.560><c> we</c><00:11:04.770><c> look</c>

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely something we look
 

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.980 align:start position:0%
so that's definitely something we look
forward<00:11:05.279><c> to</c>

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:05.990 align:start position:0%
