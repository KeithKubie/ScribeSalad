00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.800
We have the equation 20 minus
7 times x is equal to 6

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.650
times x minus 6.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.680
And we need to solve for x.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.180
So the way I like to do these
is we just like to separate

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.950
the constant terms, which are
the 20 and the negative 6 on

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.200
one side of the equation.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.710
I'll put them on the
right-hand side.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.610
And then we'll put all the x
terms, the negative 7x and the

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.260
6x, we'll put it all on
the left-hand side.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.590
So to get the 20 out of the way
from the left-hand side,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.130
let's subtract it.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.030
Let's subtract it from
the left-hand side.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.690
But this is an equation,
anything you do to the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.960
left-hand side, you also have to
do to the right-hand side.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.930
If that is equal to that, in
order for them to still be

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.160
equal, anything I do to the
left-hand side I have to do to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.350
the right-hand side.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.510
So I subtracted 20 from the
left, let me also subtract 20

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.990
from the right.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.390
And so the left-hand side
of the equation, 20

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.880
minus 20 is just 0.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.660
That was the whole point,
they cancel out.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.940
Don't have to write it down.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.510
And then I have a negative 7x,
it just gets carried down.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.530
And then that is equal to the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.489
right-hand side of the equation.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.420
I have a 6x.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.500
I'm not adding or subtracting
anything to that.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
But then I have a negative
6 minus 20.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.260
So if I'm already 6 below 0 on
the number line, and I go

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.690
another 20 below that, that's
at negative 26.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.175
Now, the next thing we want to
do is we want to get all the x

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:25.420
terms on the left-hand side.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.060
So we don't want this 6x here,
so maybe we subtract 6x from

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.936
both sides.

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:34.860
So let's subtract 6x from the
right, subtract 6x from the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.200
left, and what do we get?

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.080
The left-hand side, negative
7x minus 6x,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.860
that's negative 13x.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.470
Right?

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.220
Negative 7 of something minus
another 6 of that something is

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.450
going to be negative 13
of that something.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.475
And that is going to be
equal to 6x minus 6x.

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:56.400
That cancels out.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.110
That was the whole point by
subtracting negative 6x.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.520
And then we have just a negative
26, or minus 26,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.500
depending on how you want to
view it, so negative 13x is

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
equal to negative 26.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.060
Now, our whole goal, just to
remember, is to isolate the x.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.470
We have a negative 13
times the x here.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.630
So the best way to isolate it is
if we have something times

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.270
x, if we divide by
that something,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.480
we'll isolate the x.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.510
So let's divide by
negative 13.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320
Now, you know by now, anything
you do to the left-hand side

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.230
of an equation, you have to
do to the right-hand side.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.890
So we're going to have to
divide both sides of the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.880
equation by negative 13.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.730
Now, what does the left-hand
side become?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.770
Negative 13 times x divided
by negative 13, that's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.560
just going to be x.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.650
You multiply something times x,
divide it by the something,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.670
you're just going to
be left with an x.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.880
So the left-hand side
just becomes an x.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.240
x is equal to negative 26
divided by negative 13.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.260
Well, that's just positive
2, right?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.300
A negative divided by a negative
is a positive.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.240
26 divided by 13 is 2.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.740
And that is our answer.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.270
That is our answer.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.140
Now let's verify that
it really works.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.330
That's the fun thing
about algebra.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.470
You can always make sure that
you got the right answer.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.760
So let's substitute it back into
the original equation.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:28.580
So we have 20 minus 7 times x--
x is 2-- minus 7 times 2

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.590
is equal to 6 times x--
we've solved for x, it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.310
is 2-- minus 6.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.940
So let's verify that this
left-hand side really does

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.690
equal this right-hand side.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.750
So the left-hand side simplifies
to 20 minus 7 times

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.390
2, which is 14.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.930
20 minus 14 is 6.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.270
That's what the left-hand
side simplifies to.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.400
The right-hand side, we have 6
times 2, which is 12 minus 6.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.580
12 minus 6 is 6.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.040
So they are, indeed, equal, and
we did, indeed, get the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.620
right answer.
