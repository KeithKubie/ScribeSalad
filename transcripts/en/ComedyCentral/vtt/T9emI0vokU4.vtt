kudos to this girl, okay?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.576
She's willing to admit in front
of a group of strangers

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.211

"Oh, by the way,

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:16.416

- About two years into--
into comedy,

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.472
I get a headliner gig,
which is insane.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.074
There was a dropout,
and they needed someone.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.876
They got me.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.712
It's a casino in Temecula,
California.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:23.082
Now, if you don't know where
Temecula is,

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.285

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:27.653

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.224
You'll end up in Temecula,
okay?

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.660
You just get there eventually.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.462
So I'm doing the gig there.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.264
It's the night after my first
show.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:39.432
It goes really well.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.267
This is a Friday night.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.604
And then I get a phone call,
and--and it's some organizer

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.640
from a golf tournament saying,
"Hey,

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.976
"I run a celebrity charity golf
tournament

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.611
"that's playing here tomorrow.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.246
"One of our celebrities
dropped out.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.582
Do you want to play
in the golf tournament?"

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.317
Now, you might be thinking,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.355
why is he calling a midget
to play in a golf tournament?

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:05.291
He was probably thinking that
same thing, but I play golf.

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:06.926
I freakin' play golf.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.961
And before you make the joke,

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.964
fuck you, not miniature,
okay?

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:13.633
Not miniature!

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.802
[cheers and applause]

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.105
I play actual golf!

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.807
I'm not there,
"Oh, it's the windmill hole!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.643
Isn't this great?"
Like, I'm not doing that.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.479
I play real golf, okay?

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.147
My dad started me playing golf

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.116
when I was two years old, all
right?

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.351
So I'm actually kind of good at
it, and--

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:37.323
but I think the only reason why
my dad started me playing golf

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.492
is not because he wanted to
spend time with me

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.028
or because he wanted to advance
my character or nothing.

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.131
Like, he just wanted to make
dad jokes.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.300
He just wanted to make dad
jokes; that's it.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.135
Like, my dad's not a dwarf.
He's tall.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.537
So he loves making dad jokes,
and, like,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.039
so when we'd go play golf,

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.341
he'd make the same one every
time.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.343
His name's Pete, and all his
friends would be like,

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:00.179
"Hey, Pete, you takin' your kid
out to play golf.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.547
Is he any good?"

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.482
And his response would always
be,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.052
"He's okay, but he's got a hell
of a short game."

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.387
Every time.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.356
Not some of the time.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.991
Every time.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:14.026
To the point where I would be
mouthing the joke

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.697
along with him just standing
behind him.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.700
And you think that's bad, but I
started to like it, all right?

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.535
I started to like it.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:24.704
I started to like the game,
and I started to like dad jokes

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.039
to the point where I would
write my own,

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:29.041
where I would show up with my
dad,

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.544
and people would be like, "Hey,
Pete, your son plays golf?

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.079
What's his handicap?"

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.048
And I would yell out,
"Dwarfism, you asshole."

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:41.120
[laughter]

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:44.690
So I play golf, and I had my
clubs with me that weekend,

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:47.059
so I was like, "Yeah, I'll play

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.794
"in the celebrity golf
tournament.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.229
That sounds awesome."

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.299
By the way, I am not a
celebrity.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:54.734
I don't think I'm one now.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.569
I certainly wasn't one back
then.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.905
But they wanted me to play, so
I said, "All right, cool."

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.974
He said, "All right, meet us
down here tomorrow."

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:03.976
So I go down to the course the
next day.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.078
I got my little golf outfit on.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.214
And I'm not gonna lie to you,

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:12.385
a midget in a golf outfit
is adorable, okay?

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.253
It's--it's awesome.

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:16.956
Like, I look like the top
of a four-year-old's

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.560
birthday cake, okay, like,
it's pretty incredible.

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:23.262
So I walk,
and I've got my clubs.

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.665
Now, for the celebrities,

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.167
they all have their names
on their carts,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.236
and then they have
non-celebrities

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.104
playing with them,
so you know where to meet up,

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.773
they meet
at their celebrity's cart.

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.641
So I'm looking for my cart.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.276
And I don't see my cart.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.577
I'm looking, and I'm like,
"All right,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.812
"there's Bill Engvall.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:41.280
"That's cool.

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:42.448
There's Screech."

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:44.450
True.
He was there.

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:47.253
And then there was the guy who
played Carlton

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:49.255
on "Fresh Prince,"
Alfonso Ribeiro.

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:52.625
He was there, and yeah, okay,
so not the best celebrities,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.927
all right, like...
[laughter]

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.129
But I--I can't find my cart.

00:04:57.162 --> 00:04:59.632
I'm looking all over.
I cannot find my cart.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.867
So I go to this tournament
organizer, and I say,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.637
"Hey, my name's Brad Williams.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.838
"I'm a celebrity.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.606
I don't have a cart."

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.208
By the way, if you ever have
to say, "I'm a celebrity,"

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:11.444
you're not a celebrity,
all right?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.646
Don't go, "Take my picture.
I'm a celeb"--no, you're not.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.482
Okay, I'm aware that I'm not a
celebrity, so I go,

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:17.983
"I can't find my cart."

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:20.219
He goes, "Oh, I know where your
cart is."

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:24.790
And he takes me to this cart,
and there it is

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:28.661
right there on the name tag:
"Wee Man."

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:31.630
[audience groans]

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:34.367
[laughs]

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.502
For those--

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:40.172
for those of you who don't
know, I am not him.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:41.374
[laughter]

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.310
But that is something
that has happened

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:48.013
to every dwarf
their entire life, okay?

00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:51.050
We always get mistaken
for other little people.

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:52.885
Usually, it's the midget
of the moment,

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:54.387
whoever that is.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.523
So, ten years ago,
we were all Wee Man

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:59.492
from "Jackass," all right?

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:00.993
And that sucked.

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:03.262
That sucked!
People think you're Wee Man.

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:05.064
They run up,
they kick you in the balls,

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:08.000
they toss you
into shopping carts.

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.502
It's horrible.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.404
Now it's not so bad.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.572
Now everyone just thinks
I'm Dinklage

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.541
from "Game of Thrones," okay?

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.109
That's not that bad.

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.577
I don't mind when people think
I'm Dinklage.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.045
That's cool.
Like, he's funny.

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:21.747
He's a great actor in the show.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.249
He bangs a lot of hookers.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.717
Like, I feel like

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.385
he's so popular,
I can just run up

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:28.087
to a random woman, start
humping her leg, and be like,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.525
"I always pay my debts,"
okay, and I can do that.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:36.762
[laughter]

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:39.298
If you watch the show,
that's hilarious.

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.100
If you don't watch the show,
you have no idea why

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:42.435
everyone's laughing right now.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.069
That's funny to me.

00:06:44.102 --> 00:06:47.973
So most people if this happened
to them would get

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:50.409
really pissed off, very angry.

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:53.145
Me, I'm a sick freak comedian,
and I go,

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:54.547
"This is gonna be a great
story."

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.282
Like, I don't freak out.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:07:00.553
I just look, and I go, "All
right...I'm Wee Man today."

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.255
[laughter]

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.124
Now.

00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:07.293
I was gonna tell my group

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:10.563
of non-celebrities
the whole story,

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.765
'cause I didn't want them
to be disappointed.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:14.066
All right?

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.668
But then,
as soon as they saw me

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.603
standing in front of the cart,

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.138
they lit up, and they're like,

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.974
"Oh, my God! We got Wee Man?

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:24.443
"Yes! We got a good celebrity.

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:28.681
Our friends gotta play with
the ShamWow guy, that sucks!"

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:29.949
[laughter]

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:32.017
And so, like, they're psyched.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.853
They're beyond thrilled
to be playing

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:37.356
with "Wee Man," and I'm like,
I can't break their hearts.

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.926
I can't be the guy that's like,
"I'm actually a comedian.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.461
"You don't know who I am,

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:44.663
but maybe I'll be on Comedy
Central one day."

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.800
Like, I can't--I can't do that,
so I go, "All right,

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.468
I'm gonna be Wee Man."

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:52.505
And God damn it, I was Wee Man
that day, all right?

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:55.441
I was--when we were playing,
I'm telling them stories

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.976
about the show.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.611
This was when "Jackass" was in
its heyday.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.113
It was in its prime, and
they're asking me questions.

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.816
I'm answering them.
I don't know the answers.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.150
But I'm just, like,
saying stuff.

00:08:05.183 --> 00:08:06.819
They're like, "Is Steve-O
crazy?"

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.821
I'm like, "Let me tell you a
crazy Steve-O story."

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:11.357
And I start--they're like,
"You guys get a lot of girls?"

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.993
I'm like, "There's STDs named
after Steve-O.

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.494
It's insane."

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:17.663
By the way, I'm friends with
Steve-O now,

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:18.964
and I've told him this story.

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:20.533
He loves it.
We're cool.

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.569
Side note: when I'm hanging out
with Steve-O,

00:08:23.602 --> 00:08:26.672
it's impossible to convince
people I'm not Wee Man.

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:28.240
[laughter]

00:08:28.273 --> 00:08:30.676
They're just like, "You can't
know two."

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:32.478
Yeah.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:37.182
[laughter]

00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:39.518
So we start playing,
and we're having a good time.

00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.887
And these
guys--they're drinking.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.856
We're--we're playing holes,

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:45.224
and we're donating money to
charity.

00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:47.192
I'm getting them to donate
more.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:49.528
Oftentimes in these special
tournaments,

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:52.231
holes will be sponsored by
certain corporations.

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.700
They're trying to raise more
money for whatever charity

00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:56.335
you're playing for.

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:59.538
We pull up to a hole
that's sponsored by Hooters.

00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:00.873
All right?

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:02.007
And there's
these Hooters girls.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.375
They all got wings.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:05.177
We're gonna eat.
We're gonna do all that.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.946
And one of the Hooters girls--
now, remember,

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.682
I'm driving up in a cart that
says "Wee Man" on it, right?

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:11.684
I'm driving up.
We see the Hooters girls.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:12.918
We're all excited.

00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:14.720
One of the Hooters girls
jumps up,

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:17.856
walks towards me with
her finger pointed, and goes,

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:19.892
"That's not Wee Man!"

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:22.861
[laughter and groans]

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:26.398
And now everyone's like,
"What?"

00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:27.733
[laughter]

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.034
And I'm like,
"What are you talking about?

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:30.736
"Of course I'm Wee Man!

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:32.237
"Look, I'll kick myself
in the head right now, bitch!

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.739
Like, I can do that shit.
Like..."

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:35.474
[laughter]

00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:38.577
And then she goes, "No, no, no.
That's not Wee Man.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.746
"I fucked Wee Man.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:42.414
That's not Wee Man."

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:45.718
First of all,
kudos to this girl, okay?

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.454
She's willing to admit in front
of a group of strangers

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.422
and her coworkers,
"Oh, by the way,

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:54.593
I fucked a midget,"
okay, like, kudos to her.

00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:56.595
And when that happens,
I immediately, like,

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:58.764
run over to her, and I kind of
grab her by the wrist,

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:00.332
and I pull her aside,

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:01.734
and I kind of explain
the situation to her.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.736
I go, "Listen.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.771
"I know I'm not Wee Man.

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:07.573
"They think I'm Wee Man.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.508
"I'm not a--I'm just a
comedian.

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.276
"They put my name on the
thing,

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:13.512
"'cause 'all midgets look
alike' to these assholes,

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:16.081
"And then--I'm not him, but I'm
playing along

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:17.616
"so they donate to charity.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.251
"They think they're gonna have
a good time.

00:10:19.284 --> 00:10:20.686
Like, I'm just--
just play along with it."

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.488
And then, like,
I peeled off 60 bucks,

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.156
and if you're a Hooters
waitress in Temecula,

00:10:24.189 --> 00:10:28.460
that's a lot of
fucking money to you.

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:30.129
And I gave her the 60 bucks,

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.263
and she's like,
"All right, cool,"

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:32.631
and then she goes like,

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:34.967
"Oh! Oh. My mistake.
That is Wee Man.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.436
That is Wee Man, guys.
That's Wee..."

00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:41.273
Once again, kudos to this
woman.

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:45.010
Not only does she say what her
sexual life is like

00:10:45.043 --> 00:10:46.545
to these strangers.

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:48.380
Now she's saying, "I'm so much
of a whore,

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:51.650
I could fuck a midget and
forget about it."

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:54.953
[laughter]

00:10:54.986 --> 00:10:58.023
So...problem solved, right?

00:10:58.056 --> 00:10:59.491
We're all back to normal.

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:01.360
The guys start teeing off.

00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:03.962
I kind of slink to the back
to talk to this girl.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:08.333
I go like, "So you really...
you fucked Wee Man?"

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:11.070
And she's like,
"Yeah, I slept with Wee Man.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.739
"He came into my Hooters,
and we hit it off,

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:16.008
"and then he said he had a
hotel room nearby,

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.511
so I went to the hotel room,
and we had our fun."

00:11:19.544 --> 00:11:21.246
I was like, "That's awesome."

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.048
She was like, "Yeah,
he was such a nice guy.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.851
Like, he took pictures with
all the staff and everything."

00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:27.886
And he's like--and she's like,
"Here, I'll show you."

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:30.589
She pulls out her phone,
and she pulls up a picture,

00:11:30.622 --> 00:11:32.524
and she goes,
"Yeah, there's us."

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:36.261
And then my mouth dropped,
'cause I'm like,

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:39.164
"That's my other dwarf friend
Sean."

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:42.401
[laughter]

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.677
[laughs]

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.781
How many people
has she told this story?

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:58.383
I don't know, but from that day
on, oh, God,

00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.919
I love golf even more.

00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:04.289
And that's one more dwarf joke
that I can make on the course.

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:05.891
I'm Brad Williams.

00:12:05.924 --> 00:12:07.459

for coming out tonight.
