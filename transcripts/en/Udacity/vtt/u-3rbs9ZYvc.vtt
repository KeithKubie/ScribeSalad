Okay, that was a ton of detail. Really

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.650
I recommend you, just sketch out your design, and

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.800
then party on it with Flux Box. Flux

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.250
Box is super powerful, and it's really super easy

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.840
to use. Incidentally, I did mention, Flux Box

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.760
is still making its way into all the browsers

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.050
out there. So ,there are some Flux Box

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.390
polyfills out there, that can help you, like Flexy.
