00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
I have this matrix A here that I
want to put into reduced row

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.450
echelon form.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.160
And we've done this
multiple times.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.670
You just perform a bunch
of row operations.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.470
But what I want to show you in
this video is that those row

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.520
operations are equivalent to
linear transformations on the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.450
column vectors of A.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.490
So let me show you by example.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.450
So if we just want to put A into
reduced row echelon form,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.860
the first step that we might
want to do if we wanted to

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.580
zero out these entries right
here, is-- let me do it right

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.890
here-- is we'll keep our
first entry the same.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830
So for each of these column
vectors, we're going to keep

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.010
the first entry the same.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.590
So they're going to be
1, minus 1, minus 1.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.360
And actually, let me
simultaneously construct my

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.800
transformation.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.340
So I'm saying that my row
operation I'm going to perform

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.690
is equivalent to a linear
transformation

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.630
on the column vector.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.160
So it's going to be a
transformation that's going to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.880
take some column vector,
a1, a2, and a3.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.130
It's going to take each of these
and then do something to

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.239
them, do something to them
in a linear way.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.330
They'll be linear
transformations.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.470
So we're keeping the
first entry of our

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.090
column vector the same.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.670
So this is just going
to be a1.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.330
This is a line right here.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.250
That's going to be a1.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.050
Now, what can we do if
we want to get to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.780
reduced row echelon form?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.610
We'd want to make
this equal to 0.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.360
So we would want to replace our
second row with the second

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.230
row plus the first row, because
then these guys would

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.500
turn out to be 0.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.140
So let me write that on
my transformation.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.490
I'm going to replace the second
row with the second row

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090
plus the first row.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.400
Let me write it out here.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.410
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.810
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.950
3 plus minus 1 is 2.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.070
Now, we also want
to get a 0 here.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.360
So let me replace my third
row with my third row

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.900
minus my first row.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.320
So I'm going to replace my third
row with my third row

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.690
minus my first row.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.240
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.660
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.100
4 minus minus 1 is 5,
just like that.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.790
So you see this was just a
linear transformation.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.390
And any linear transformation
you could actually represent

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.280
as a matrix vector product.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.140
So for example, this
transformation, I could

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.150
represent it.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.230
To figure out its transformation
matrix, so if

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.600
we say that T of x is equal to,
I don't know, let's call

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.220
it some matrix S times x.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.740
We already used the matrix A.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.110
So I have to pick
another letter.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.160
So how do we find S?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.570
Well, we just apply the
transformation to all of the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.370
column vectors, or the standard
basis vectors of the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.240
identity matrix.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.460
So let's do that.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.760
So the identity matrix-- I'll
draw it really small like

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.080
this-- the identity matrix looks
like this, 1, 0, 0, 0,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.900
1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.880
That's what that identity
matrix looks like.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.580
To find the transformation
matrix, we just apply this guy

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.660
to each of the column
vectors of this.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.286
So what do we get?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.270
I'll do it a little
bit bigger.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.140
We apply it to each of
these column vectors.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.370
But we see the first row
always stays the same.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.250
So the first row is always going
to be the same thing.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.850
So 1, 0, 0.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.180
I'm essentially applying it
simultaneously to each of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.290
these column vectors, saying,
look, when you transform each

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.710
of these column vectors, their
first entry stays the same.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.890
The second entry becomes
the second entry

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.910
plus the first entry.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.730
So 0 plus 1 is 1.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.510
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.350
0 plus 0 is 0.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.440
Then the third entry gets
replaced with the third entry

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.690
minus the first entry.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.660
So 0 minus 1 is minus 1.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.500
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.930
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.510
Now notice, when I apply this
transformation to the column

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.010
vectors of our identity matrix,
I essentially just

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.760
performed those same
row operations

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.730
that I did up there.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.160
I performed those exact same
row operations on this

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.330
identity matrix.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.520
But we know that this is
actually the transformation

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.110
matrix, that if we multiply
it by each of these column

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.769
vectors, or by each of these
column vectors, we're going to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.430
get these column vectors.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.240
So you can view it this way.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.990
This right here, this
is equal to S.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.510
This is our transformation
matrix.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.350
So we could say that if we
create a new matrix whose

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.320
columns are S times this column
vector, S times 1,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.420
minus 1, 1.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.540
And then the next column is S
times-- I wanted to do it in

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.670
that other color-- S times
this guy, minus 1, 2, 1.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:02.930
And then the third column is
going to be S times this third

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.180
column vector, minus 1, 3, 4.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.950
We now know we're applying this
transformation, this is

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.920
S, times each of these
column vectors.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.890
That is the matrix
representation of this

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.630
transformation.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.300
This guy right here will
be transformed

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.070
to this right here.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.580
Let me do it down here.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.670
I wanted to show that stuff that
I had above here as well.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.310
Well, I'll just draw an arrow.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.440
That's probably the
simplest thing.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.900
This matrix right here
will become that

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.430
matrix right there.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.610
So another way you could
write it, this is

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.570
equivalent to what?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.520
What is this equivalent to?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.900
When you take a matrix and you
multiply it times each of the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.400
column vectors, when you
transform each of the column

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.970
vectors by this matrix, this
is the definition of a

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.270
matrix-matrix product.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.440
This is equal to our matrix S--
I'll do it in pink-- this

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.920
is equal to our matrix S, which
is 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:15.790
minus 1, 0, 1, times our matrix
A, times 1, minus 1, 1,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.090
minus 1, 2, 1, minus 1, 3, 4.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.630
So let me make this
very clear.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.430
This is our transformation
matrix S.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.440
This is our matrix A.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.130
And when you perform this
product you're going to get

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.720
this guy right over here.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.450
I'll just copy and paste it.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.230
Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.210
You're going to get that
guy just like that.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.480
Now the whole reason why I'm
doing that is just to remind

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.710
you that when we perform each of
these row operations, we're

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.600
just multiplying.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.170
We're performing a linear
transformation on each of

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.090
these columns.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.730
And it is completely equivalent
to just multiplying

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.790
this guy by some matrix S.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.710
In this case, we took the
trouble of figuring out what

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.150
that matrix S is.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.550
But any of these row operations
that we've been

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.300
doing, you can always represent
them by a matrix

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.550
multiplication.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.045
So this leads to a very
interesting idea.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.700
When you put something in
reduced row echelon form, let

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.950
me do it up here.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.180
Actually, let's just finish what
we started with this guy.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.230
Let's put this guy in reduced
row echelon form.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.080
Let me call this first S.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.400
Let's call that S1.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.730
So this guy right here
is equal to that

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.050
first S1 times A.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.580
We already showed that
that's true.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.040
Now let's perform another
transformation.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.170
Let's just do another set of
row operations to get us to

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.000
reduced row echelon form.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.860
So let's keep our middle
row the same, 0, 1, 2.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.190
And let's replace the first row
with the first row plus

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.630
the second row, because I
want to make this a 0.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.980
So 1 plus 0 is 1.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.310
Let me do it in another color.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.810
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.620
Minus 1 plus 2 is 1.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.640
Now, I want to replace the third
row with, let's say the

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:28.210
third row minus 2 times
the first row.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.300
So that's 0 minus 2,
times 0, is 0.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.820
2 minus 2, times 1, is 0.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.350
5 minus 2, times 2, is 1.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.130
5 minus 4 is 1.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.549
We're almost there.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.870
We just have to zero out
these guys right there.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.220
Let's see if we can get this
into reduced row echelon form.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.900
So what is this?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.880
I just performed another
linear transformation.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.800
Actually, let me write this.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.710
Let's say if this was our first
linear transformation,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.390
what I just did is I performed
another linear

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.660
transformation, T2.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.940
I'll write it in a different
notation, where you give me

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.100
some vector, some column
vector, x1, x2, x3.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.650
What did I just do?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.390
What was the transformation
that I just performed?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.380
My new vector, I made the top
row equal to the top row plus

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.325
the second row.

00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:15.690
So it's x1 plus x2.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.500
I kept the second
row the same.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.580
And then the third row, I
replaced it with the third row

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.920
minus 2 times the second row.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.290
That was a linear transformation
we just did.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.450
And we could represent this
linear transformation as

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.300
being, we could say T2 applied
to some vector x is equal to

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.120
some transformation vector
S2, times our vector x.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.340
Because if we applied this
transformation matrix to each

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.590
of these columns, it's
equivalent to multiplying this

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.940
guy by this transformation
matrix.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.430
So you could say that this guy
right here-- we haven't

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.270
figured out what this is, but
I think you get the idea--

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.200
this matrix right here is going
to be equal to this guy.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.310
It's going to be equal
to S2 times this guy.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.670
What is this guy right here?

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.805
Well, this guy is equal
to S1 times A.

00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:12.510
It's going to be S2
times S1, times A.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.760
Fair enough.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.200
And you could have gotten
straight here if you just

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.940
multiplied S2 times S1.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.250
This could be some
other matrix.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.610
If you just multiplied it by
A, you'd go straight from

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.070
there to there.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.670
Fair enough.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.595
Now, we still haven't gotten
this guy into reduced row

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.010
echelon form.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.220
So let's try to get there.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.125
I've run out of space below
him, so I'm going

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:35.270
to have to go up.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.520
So let's go upwards.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.650
What I want to do is, I'm going
to keep the third row

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.790
the same, 0, 0, 1.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:54.700
Let me replace the second row
with the second row minus 2

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.150
times the third row.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.680
So we'll get a 0, we'll get a 1
minus 2, times 0, and we'll

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.250
get a 2 minus 2, times 1.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.100
So that's a 0.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.500
Let's replaced the first
row with the first row

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.280
minus the third row.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.970
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.880
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.310
1 minus 1 is 0, just
like that.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.470
Let's just actually write what
our transformation was.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.686
Let's call it T3.

00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:26.490
I'll do it in purple.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.225
T3 is the transformation of some
vector x-- let me write

00:11:30.225 --> 00:11:34.710
it like this-- of some
vector x1, x2, x3.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.290
What did we do?

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.050
We replaced the first row with
the first row minus the third

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.300
row, x1 minus x3.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.580
We replaced the second row with
the second row minus 2

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.970
times the third row.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.870
So it's x2 minus 2 times x3.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.960
Then the third row just
stayed the same.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.510
So obviously, this could
also be represented.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.840
T3 of x could be equal to some
other transformation matrix,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.230
S3 times x.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.040
So this transformation, when
you multiply it to each of

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.090
these columns, is equivalent to
multiplying this guy times

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.910
this transformation matrix,
which we haven't found yet.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.560
We can write it.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.430
So this is going to be equal to
S3 times this matrix right

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:27.150
here, which is S2, S1, A.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.330
And what do we have here?

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.000
We got the identity matrix.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.070
We put it in reduced
row echelon form.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.580
We got the identity matrix.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.530
We already know from previous
videos the reduced row echelon

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.750
form of something is the
identity matrix.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.830
Then we are dealing with an
invertible transformation, or

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.140
an invertible matrix.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.350
Because this obviously could be
the transformation for some

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.580
transformation.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.670
Let's just call this
transformation, I don't know,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.970
did I already use T?

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.420
Let's just call it Tnaught for
our transformation applied to

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.130
some vector x, that might
be equal to Ax.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:04.390
So we know that this
is invertible.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.170
We put it in reduced
row echelon form.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.850
We put its transformation
matrix in

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.560
reduced row echelon form.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.130
And we got the identity
matrix.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.880
So that tells us that
this is invertible.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.990
But something even more
interesting happened.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.130
We got here by performing
some row operations.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.620
And we said those row operations
were completely

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.080
equivalent to multiplying this
guy right here by multiplying

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.890
our original transformation
matrix by a series of

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.080
transformation matrices that
represent our row operations.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.150
And when we multiplied all this,
this was equal to the

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.990
identity matrix.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.930
Now, in the last video we said
that the inverse matrix, so if

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.450
this is Tnaught, Tnaught inverse
could be represented--

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.850
it's also a linear
transformation-- It can be

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.450
represented by some inverse
matrix that we just called A

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.070
inverse times x.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:02.610
And we saw that the inverse
transformation matrix times

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.580
our transformation matrix is
equal to the identity matrix.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.540
We saw this last time.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.060
We proved this to you.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.710
Now, something very
interesting here.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.750
We have a series of matrix
products times this guy, times

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.010
this guy, that also got me
the identity matrix.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.640
So this guy right here, this
series of matrix products,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.750
this must be the same thing as
my inverse matrix, as my

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.170
inverse transformation matrix.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.720
And so we could actually
calculate it if we wanted to.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.100
Just like we did, we actually
figured out what S1 was.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.560
We did it down here.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.520
We could do a similar operation
to figure out what

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.370
S2 was, S3 was, and then
multiply them all out.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.810
We would have actually
constructed A inverse.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.240
I guess, something more
interesting we could do

00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:00.820
instead of doing that, what if
we applied these same matrix

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.020
products to the identity
matrix.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.370
So the whole time we did
here, when we did

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.950
our first row operation.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.500
So we have here, we
have the matrix A.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.120
Let's say we have an identity
matrix on the right.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.050
Let's call that I,
right there.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.930
Now, our first linear
transformation we did-- we saw

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.240
that right here-- that
was equivalent to

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.910
multiplying S1 times A.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.330
The first set of row operations
was this.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.510
It got us here.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.520
Now, if we perform that same set
of row operations on the

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.630
identity matrix, what
are we going to get?

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.050
We're going to get
the matrix S1.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.580
S1 times the identity
matrix is just S1.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.490
All of the columns of anything
times the identity times the

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.760
standard basis columns, it'll
just be equal to itself.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.930
You'll just be left
with that S1.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.820
This is S1 times I.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.290
That's just S1.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.090
Fair enough.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.310
Now, you performed your next row
operation and you ended up

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.320
with S2 times S1, times A.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.710
Now if you performed that same
row operation on this guy

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.820
right there, what
would you have?

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.430
You would have S2 times S1,
times the identity matrix.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.300
Now, our last row operation we
represented with the matrix

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.800
product S3.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.690
We're multiplying it by the
transformation matrix S3.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.990
So if you did that, you
have S3, S2, S1 A.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.550
But if you perform the same
exact row operations on this

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.940
guy right here, you have
S3, S2, S1, times

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.360
the identity matrix.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.510
Now when you did this, when
you performed these row

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.690
operations here, this got you
to the identity matrix.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.310
Well, what are these going
to get you to?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.800
When you just performed the same
exact row operations you

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.270
performed on A to get to the
identity matrix, if you

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.110
performed those same exact row
operations on the identity

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.630
matrix, what do you get?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.990
You get this guy right here.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.790
Anything times that identity
matrix is going

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.930
to be equal to itself.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.350
So what is that right there?

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.600
That is A inverse.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.850
So we have a generalized way
of figuring out the inverse

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.630
for transformation matrix.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.819
What I can do is, let's
say I have some

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.160
transformation matrix A.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.420
I can set up an augmented
matrix where I put the

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.750
identity matrix right there,
just like that, and I perform

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.000
a bunch of row operations.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.060
And you could represent them
as matrix products.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.069
But you perform a bunch of row
operations on all of them.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.180
You perform the same operations
you perform on A as

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.119
you would do on the
identity matrix.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:31.340
By the time you have A as an
identity matrix, you have A in

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.250
reduced row echelon form.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:38.950
By the time A is like that, your
identity matrix, having

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:42.290
performed the same exact
operations on it, it is going

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.300
to be transformed into
A's inverse.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.340
This is a very useful tool for
solving actual inverses.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.150
Now, I've explained
the theoretical

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.180
reason why this works.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.740
In the next video we'll
actually solve this.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.610
Maybe we'll do it for the
example that I started off

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.740
with in this video.
