00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:13.950
The 
process of hard-boiling an egg involves denaturation.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.830
During this process, the amino acid chains
found in the proteins in the egg are altered

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.519
from their original, raw egg state, with the
denaturation temperature varying somewhat

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.460
depending on the specific protein in question
(see chart here).

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.269
But in a nutshell, adding heat to these proteins
initially causes the proteins to partially

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.870
unfold or otherwise change their normal organized
spatial structure.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.200
As this is happening, the proteins begin to
aggregate and coagulate together.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.340
As heat continues to be applied, additional
bonds are formed in these clusters, creating

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.250
a relatively dense protein network, which
in turn results in the rubbery egg whites

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.089
and solidified yolk you find in hard-boiled
eggs.

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.890
As to why if heat is applied long enough,
you’ll get a greenish colorization around

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.940
the yolk, to begin with, the proteins in the
egg white contain sulfur.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.270
That sulfur combines with hydrogen during
the denaturation process and produces hydrogen

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.320
sulfide, a toxic gas that produces an unmistakable
“rotten egg” smell.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.050
Due to being heavier than oxygen and nitrogen,
which make up the vast majority of Earth’s

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.960
atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide can normally
be found collecting in spaces like wells and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.780
caves, and it is not only poisonous but also
flammable, corrosive, and explosive.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.360
Fortunately for egg lovers the world over,
the amount of hydrogen sulfide released in

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.000
the egg is so small that it does not pose
any health risk whatsoever.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
When you cook an egg, heat is (obviously)
applied from the outside and works its way

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
in.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.610
This is important to the topic at hand because
the solubility of the egg white decreases

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.540
as it heats up, forcing the hydrogen sulfide
inwards, towards the yolk.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.420
Also notable to the topic at hand is the fact
that egg yolk contains iron, which is ultimately

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.850
set free from the phosvitin in the yolk via
heating the yolk sufficiently.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.060
When these iron cations come in contact with
the hydrogen sulfide around the area where

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.280
the yolk meets the egg white, a resulting
chemical reaction produces iron sulfide.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.510
Iron sulfide has a greenish, gray coloring,
hence the green/gray tinge around the yolk

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.190
of a hard-boiled egg.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.560
The longer you cook the egg, the more iron
sulfide is produced and the more discoloration

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.060
you’ll see in the yolk.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.090
You will also see a similar discoloration
happen when cooking eggs in an iron skillet

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.630
for the same reason.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.340
Likewise, if you find that you still get this
greenish yolk ring in a hard-boiled egg even

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.730
when not overcooking it, it is likely the
case that the water you’re boiling the egg

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.420
in has a relatively high amount of iron in
it, resulting in iron sulfide being produced

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.200
more rapidly than you might otherwise see.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.450
And if you’re wondering, aside from not
being terribly aesthetically pleasing, it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.460
is perfectly safe to eat this green part of
the yolk.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.750
Dr. Seuss wrote Green Eggs and Ham as a result
of a bet with his publisher, Bennett Cerf.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.880
Cerf bet Seuss that he could not write a book
in fifty unique words or less.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.500
The proper pronunciation of “Seuss” is
actually “Zoice” (rhymes with “voice”),

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.150
being a Bavarian name.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.319
However, due to the fact that most Americans
pronounced it incorrectly as “Soose”,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.910
Theodor Geisel ultimately gave in and stopped
correcting people over the pronunciation,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.020
even quipping this was a good thing because
it is “advantageous for an author of children’s

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:30.639
books to be associated with—Mother Goose.”
