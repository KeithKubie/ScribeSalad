00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.239
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:15.720
You know, one of
the things that's

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.000
interesting about
human beings is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.310
that we talk about
living in the moment.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.601
We want to live and experience.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.700
Yet at the same time, when
an experience is rapturous,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.290
it feels as though
the experience

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.820
is owed a poem
rendered in real time.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.125
The experience is
asking to be captured.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.750
And I think one of the
quotes that really distills

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.740
the human desire to capture the
world, to take a picture of it,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.445
to snapshot it, and make it
fit, so that it can hold it

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:40.370
in a kind of stasis
is the quote that

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.906
says, "To see the world
in a grain of sand,

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:46.550
to see heaven in a wild
flower, hold infinity

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.370
in the palm of your hand
and eternity in an hour."

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.810
That desire to capture
and arrest in permanence.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.620
Faulkner used to talk about
the writer's futile yet noble

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.780
efforts to fit the world
inside of a sentence,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.040
to capture the world and code it
and store it inside of a page.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.890
The photographer tries to take
a still frame of the universe.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.150
The filmmaker who distills
truth 24 times per second at due

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.870
persistence of vision
and psychic continuity

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.950
can externalize the human
mind and capture the world

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.580
on celluloid.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.420
Or the engineers who built
the Hubble Space Telescope

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.340
that maybe can
mainline space and time

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.160
through the optic nerve,
as Ross Anderson says,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.139
inducing ontological awakening
in the receiver's mind,

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.180
the person who looks at
the deep field photograph

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.070
as he has a forceful
reckoning with what is.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.915
In all of these
different technologies,

00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:47.415
all of these different
tools that we

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:52.870
have created to capture and
encode reality as it's lived.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.470
To arrest that just passing of
the moment with nothingness,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.870
and that is the human condition.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.320
That's what we do.
