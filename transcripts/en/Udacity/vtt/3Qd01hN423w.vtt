00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.817
The previous problem brings up a useful little formula from topology called the

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:08.116
Euler-PoincarĂŠ Formula for connected planar graphs. V is the number of

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.647
vertices. F is the number of faces. E is the number of edges, and g is the

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:17.763
genus. The genus is the number of holes in the object. As an example, a sphere

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:21.231
and a cube have genus zero. A doughnut and a coffee cup with a handle have

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.200
genus one. There's an old joke about topologists not being able to tell their

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.946
coffee cup from their donut. An edge collapse is a reversible process, so let's

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:33.334
show how it affects the formula. First we know we're going to have a vertex

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.157
created, so that's one. We can see that as the point moves up, two faces are

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:42.575
created, so that's two faces. We can also see three edges are created. The

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.048
genus doesn't change. There are no holes created or destroying. We can see this

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:50.161
sums up to zero, the delta. In other words, this formula applies to this mesh

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.272
and this mesh, and they both must come out to be the answer too, so the delta

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:58.910
must be zero, the difference between them. So this equation says we subtracted

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.910
a vertex in two faces. To balance the equation, 3 edges must also be removed.
