00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.767
- [Voiceover] So in the
last video, I introduced

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:04.262
transformations and how you
can think about functions

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:07.107
as moving points in one
space to points in another,

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.823
and here I want to show an
example of what that looks like

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:12.668
when the input space is two-dimensional.

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:14.526
So this over here is the input space.

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:16.325
It's just a copy of the XY plane,

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:18.925
and the output space is also
two-dimensional, so the output

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:22.026
space, in this case, also
a two-dimensional plane.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:25.079
And what I'm gonna do,
I'm just gonna first play

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.378
an example of one of these transformations

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:29.920
and then go through the details
of the underyling function

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.067
and how you can understand the
transformation as a result.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:35.446
So here's what it looks like.

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:37.977
Here's what we're gonna be going towards.

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:40.381
Very complicated, a lot of points moving.

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.204
Lots of different things happening here,

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.468
and what's common with this sort of thing,

00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:46.360
when you're thinking about moving from

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.043
two dimensions to two dimensions,

00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:50.145
given that it's really the
same space, the XY plane,

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:53.268
you often just think about
the input and output space

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:55.439
all at once, and instead just watch

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.504
a copy of that plane move onto itself.

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:00.698
And by the way, when I
say watch, I don't mean

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:02.637
that you'll always have
an animation like this

00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:04.320
just sort of sitting in front of you.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.747
When I think about transformations,
it's usually a very

00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:09.185
vague thought in the back
of my mind somewhere,

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:10.961
but it helps to understand what's

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:12.540
really going on with the function.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.957
I'll talk about that more at the end,

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.465
but first let's just go
into what this function is.

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:19.739
So, the one that I told the
computer to animate here

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:24.324
is f of x,y is the input, is equal to

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:27.726
x squared plus y squared,

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:30.165
as the x component of the output,

00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:32.603
and x squared minus y squared

00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:35.098
is the y component of the output.

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:37.746
So just to help start understanding this,

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.706
let's take a relatively
simple point like the origin.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:42.923
So here, the origin, which is zero, zero,

00:01:42.923 --> 00:01:45.060
and let's think about
what happens to that.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.999
f of zero, zero.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.164
Well, x and y are both
zero, so that top is zero.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.126
And same with the bottom,
that bottom also equals zero.

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:58.551
Which means, it's taking
the 0.00 to itself,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.407
and if you watch the
transformation, what this means

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:05.354
is that the 0.0 stays fixed,
it's like you can hold

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:07.885
your thumb down on it, and
nothing really happens to it.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.985
And in fact, we call this a
fixed point of the function

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.516
as a whole, and that kind of terminology

00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:15.316
doesn't really make sense unless

00:02:15.316 --> 00:02:17.673
you're thinking of the
function as a transformation.

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:19.936
So let's look at another example here.

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:22.873
Let's take a point like one, one.

00:02:22.873 --> 00:02:25.614
f of one, one.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:28.516
So in the input space, let's just kind of

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.790
start this thing over so we're
only looking at the input.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.169
In the input space, one,
one, is sitting right here,

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.409
and we're wondering
where that's gonna move.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.952
So when we plug it in,
x squared plus y squared

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:44.515
is gonna be one squared plus one squared,

00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:46.848
and on the bottom, x
squared minus y squared,

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:49.693
one squared minus y squared.

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:51.794
Woop, (laughs) minus one squared.

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:54.411
I'm plugging things in here.

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.705
So that's two, zero.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.420
Two, zero.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.436
Which means we expect this point to move

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:07.457
over to two, zero in some way.

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:09.836
So if we watch the
transformation, we expect

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.903
to watch that point move over to here,

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:13.435
and again, it can be hard to follow

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:15.014
because there's a lot of moving parts,

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:17.058
but if you're careful as you watch it,

00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.937
the point will actually land right there.

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:22.735
And you can, in principle,
do this for any given point

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.883
and understand how it
moves from one to another,

00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:27.216
but you might ask, hey Grant,

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:28.900
what is the point of all of this?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.780
We have other ways of
visualizing functions that are

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.254
more precise, and kinda less
confusing, to be honest.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:35.634
Factor fields are a great
way for functions like this,

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.700
graphs were a great way for functions

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.558
with one input and one output.

00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:42.054
Why think in terms of transformations?

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.143
And the main reason is conceptual.

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:46.001
It's not like you'll have an
animation sitting in front

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.021
of you, and it's not
like you're gonna by hand

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.819
evaluate a bunch of points
and think of how they move.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.733
But there's a lot of different
concepts in math, and with

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.102
functions, where when you
understand it in terms of

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:59.620
a transformation, it gives you
a more nuanced understanding.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.336
Things like derivatives, or the
variations of the derivative

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:04.600
that you're gonna learn with
multi-variable calculus,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.679
there's different ways of understanding it

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.780
in terms of stretching or squishing space

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.695
and things like this, that doesn't really

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:13.098
have a good analog in terms
of graphs or vector fields.

00:04:13.098 --> 00:04:15.374
So it adds a new color
to your understanding.

00:04:15.374 --> 00:04:17.801
Also, transformations are a super

00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.821
important part of linear algebra.

00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:21.493
There will come a point
when you start learning

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:23.455
the connection between linear algebra

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.359
and multi-variable calculus.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.737
And if you have a strong
conception of transformations,

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:30.792
both in the context of linear algebra

00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:32.998
and in the context of
multi-variable calculus,

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:35.355
you'll be in a much better
position to understand

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:37.827
the connection between those two fields.
