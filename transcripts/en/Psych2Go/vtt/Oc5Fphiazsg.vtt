00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.889
I was officially diagnosed with generalized
anxiety disorder at the age of 24 when I finally

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.690
disclosed the symptoms I was experiencing
with my doctor. But I knew I always struggled

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.029
with it.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.000
For any of you who're out there who experience an anxiety disorder, I know how scary and threatening

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.870
it can be; when your breath shortens, your
heart races and your throat tightens.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.810
For some of you, especially those of you who
have panic attacks, it might feel like you're

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.199
about to die.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.720
And the worst part about anxiety is that you
never know when it's going to rise again or

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
worsen; it's invisible, quiet and unpredictable.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.530
We don't get warnings ahead of time, not like
flashing ambulance lights to let us know there's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.900
an emergency with a blare of a sound alarm.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.320
Often it will sneak up on us and breathe negative
thoughts into our headspace.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.061
Ever since I started meditating more and shifting
my self-talk in a better direction, my anxiety

00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.799
no longer has as much control over my life
as it used too.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.910
But sometimes all it takes is one unfortunate
event to get my heart racing.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.400
For the most part, my childhood was cloaked
in chaos.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.930
Every day it felt like I was walking on eggshells,
I never knew where the next bomb was going

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.930
to set off.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.299
I became fearful of many things; death, being
yelled at, eating in front of others, socializing

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.560
and not being good enough.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
The list goes on but I don't want to bore
you.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.320
My experience with anxiety isn't necessarily
a fairy tale. I still have a long way to go

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.200
and I'm not sure if they'll be a happy ending,
but I'm curious enough to find out and keep

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
going.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.479
It's funny, my relationship with the unknown
used to be a cumulus [sp] one; I would

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.360
often get thrown into unpleasant situations
one after the other.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.939
And if I felt like I wasn't performing well,
I was quick to blame myself, but never the

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.600
person who had a choice in guiding me in a
healthier fashion.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.360
Nowadays however as I'm navigating a streets
of adulthood, I'm beginning to welcome change

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.380
with open arms.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.609
I'm not telling you the water work will stop,
and that there won't be days where you won't

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.110
feel like getting out of bed because this
still very much exist for me.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.980
But I can say with confidence, there is so
much for me to live for.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.500
My boyfriend the Cat likes crawling up on the
couch with me.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.110
I've yet to experience and try thousands of
recipes on my list.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.830
And I know there are people my life who care
about me and want me to succeed.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.280
Instead of playing the victim and asking myself
why anxiety chose to haunt me, I stopped feeling

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
sorry for myself.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320
Yes, I recognized that if they didn't have
anxiety, maybe my high school years wont have

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.820
been as traumatizing for me, and maybe I would
have developed relationships with people I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.430
would want to talk to, but was too afraid
to approach.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.810
But looking back with regrets isn't something
that will propel me forward.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.750
Instead, that's like giving into anxiety and
saying; OK, you win.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.290
You can continue controlling my life.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.360
I know these things are always easier said
than done.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.280
Believe me, I was not able to achieve this
overnight and there are things I still need

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.310
to work on.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.000
But anything that's worth having in life is
always worth the effort.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.980
Anxiety is an ongoing battle for me, but it's
no longer threat to me.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.420
