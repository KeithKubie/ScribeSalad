so we were talking a little bit about
 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.250
so we were talking a little bit about
the data API which for you that don't

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260
the data API which for you that don't
 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.110
the data API which for you that don't
know is basically the API that lets you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120
know is basically the API that lets you
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.299
know is basically the API that lets you
do most everything you do on YouTube but

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309
do most everything you do on YouTube but
 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.270
do most everything you do on YouTube but
via the API I wanted to get your feeling

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280
via the API I wanted to get your feeling
 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.950
via the API I wanted to get your feeling
from the last year what was a feature

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960
from the last year what was a feature
 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.049
from the last year what was a feature
that that launched that you found the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059
that that launched that you found the
 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.779
that that launched that you found the
most interesting so I think we the one

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789
most interesting so I think we the one
 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.520
most interesting so I think we the one
that immediately had the biggest

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530
that immediately had the biggest
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.100
that immediately had the biggest
potential was the in-video programming

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110
potential was the in-video programming
 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.690
potential was the in-video programming
where you can specify particular

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
where you can specify particular
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.580
where you can specify particular
thumbnails particular links that you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
thumbnails particular links that you
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.470
thumbnails particular links that you
want to come up to other videos at the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480
want to come up to other videos at the
 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.899
want to come up to other videos at the
end of all the viewer videos oh yeah

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909
end of all the viewer videos oh yeah
 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.060
end of all the viewer videos oh yeah
that's that's a good feature for user

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
that's that's a good feature for user
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.469
that's that's a good feature for user
don't know it gives a nice little

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479
don't know it gives a nice little
 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.080
don't know it gives a nice little
overlay where you can feature video or

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090
overlay where you can feature video or
 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.880
overlay where you can feature video or
your channel was there I guess when

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890
your channel was there I guess when
 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.200
your channel was there I guess when
you're integrating with it was there any

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210
you're integrating with it was there any
 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.770
you're integrating with it was there any
surprises and so just how well it works

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780
surprises and so just how well it works
 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.080
surprises and so just how well it works
across devices compared to some of the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090
across devices compared to some of the
 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.480
across devices compared to some of the
older annotations that's been out for a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490
older annotations that's been out for a
 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.959
older annotations that's been out for a
while where it took a very long time for

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969
while where it took a very long time for
 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.020
while where it took a very long time for
them to starts work on mobile and and on

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030
them to starts work on mobile and and on
 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.330
them to starts work on mobile and and on
different platforms this just seems to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340
different platforms this just seems to
 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.510
different platforms this just seems to
work very cleanly yes yeah and they yeah

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520
work very cleanly yes yeah and they yeah
 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.910
work very cleanly yes yeah and they yeah
that's true so for you don't know in the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
that's true so for you don't know in the
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.539
that's true so for you don't know in the
UI you can create free form annotations

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549
UI you can create free form annotations
 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:52.950
UI you can create free form annotations
where you can put them wherever you want

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960
where you can put them wherever you want
 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.149
where you can put them wherever you want
but like you said those weren't

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159
but like you said those weren't
 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.740
but like you said those weren't
supported across every device so so we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750
supported across every device so so we
 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.630
supported across every device so so we
covered the surprises do you have any

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
covered the surprises do you have any
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.039
covered the surprises do you have any
feature requests or anything you'd like

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
feature requests or anything you'd like
 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.709
feature requests or anything you'd like
to see in that API then um so I'd love

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719
to see in that API then um so I'd love
 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.469
to see in that API then um so I'd love
to see that widen more and enable some

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
to see that widen more and enable some
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.230
to see that widen more and enable some
of the other uses for the freeform

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240
of the other uses for the freeform
 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.140
of the other uses for the freeform
annotations to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
annotations to
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.520
annotations to
and my my kind of favorite one is the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530
and my my kind of favorite one is the
 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.130
and my my kind of favorite one is the
