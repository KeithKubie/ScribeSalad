00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.130
The function f of x
is shown in green.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.840
The sliding purple window
may contain a section

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.900
of an antiderivative of
the function, F of x.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.760
So, essentially it's
saying, this green function,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.110
or part of this green
function, is potentially

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.080
the derivative of
this purple function.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960
And what we need
to do is-- it says,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.835
where does the function
in the sliding window

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.730
correspond to the
antiderivative of our function?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.729
The antiderivative of f of x,
usually, write as big F of x.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.980
This is just saying
that, lowercase f of x

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.360
is just the derivative
of big F of x.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.777
So, at what point
could the derivative

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:44.360
of the purple
function-- and I'm going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.710
to move the purple
function around-- where

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.150
can the derivative of
that be the green stuff.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.752
So let's just focus on
the purple stuff first.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.376
So the derivative--
we can just view it

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.990
as the slope of the tangent
line-- between this point

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.130
and this point, we see that we
have a constant negative slope,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.370
and then we have a
constant positive slope.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.490
So let's see, where here do we
have a constant negative slope?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.430
Well, now here the slope is
0, and it gets more negative.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.450
Here we have a constant
positive slope, not

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.006
a constant negative slope.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.630
Here we have a constant
negative slope,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.800
so maybe it matches
up over there.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.480
So here we have a
constant negative slope,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.660
but then on the purple function,
we have a positive slope,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.710
but where the potential
derivative is here,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.220
we just have a slope of 0.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.940
So, this doesn't
match up either.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.440
So it looks like in this case,
there's actually no solution.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.200
Let's see if this works out.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.990
Yes, correct.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.580
Next question.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.190
Let's do another one.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.470
A function f of x
is shown purple.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.020
The sliding green
window may contain

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.750
a section of its derivative.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.942
So now we're trying
to say, at what

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:49.400
point of this purple
function might

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.530
the derivative look like
this green function?

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.340
So in this green
function, if this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.540
is the function's
derivative, here the slope

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.200
is very negative.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.180
It goes to 0, and then
the slope gets positive.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.520
So let's think about it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.420
So over here, the slope is
just a constant negative,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.830
so that won't work.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.150
If we shift it over
here, our slope

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.440
is very steep in the
negative direction

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.940
and then it gets
less and less steep

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.065
in the negative direction,
and it goes all the way,

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:19.912
and then over here
the slope is 0.

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:21.620
And over here, if this
is the derivative,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.811
it seems to match
up, the slope is 0.

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.310
And then it gets
more and more steep

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.410
in the positive direction.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.340
So this matches up.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.640
It looks like over
this interval,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.060
the green the function
is indeed the derivative

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.350
of this purple function.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.930
So let's see.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.700
Let's check our answer.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.250
Correct.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.010
Next question.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.885
Let's do another one.

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:41.430
This is exciting.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.222
A function f of x
is shown in green.

00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:45.180
The sliding purple window
may contain a section

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.690
of an antiderivative of
the function, F of x.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.580
So, now we say, let's match
up this little purple section

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.460
to its derivative.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.587
So the green is the
derivative, the purple function

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:00.420
is the thing we're
taking the derivative of.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.795
So if we just look
at the purple,

00:03:01.795 --> 00:03:04.290
we see that we have a
constant negative slope

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.324
in the first part of
it, then our slope-- so

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:09.990
let me just look for where I can
find a constant negative slope.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.370
So here, this is a
constant positive slope.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.380
This is not a constant slope.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.120
This is a constant positive.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.860
Here's a constant
negative slope.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.230
Let's see if this works.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.200
So over this interval, between
here and here, my slope

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.270
is a constant negative,
and indeed, it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.660
looks like a constant negative.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.680
And you see it's a
constant negative 1.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.960
And over here, you
see the derivative

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.070
is right at negative
1, and it's constant,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.537
so that part looks good.

00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:36.370
And then when I look
at the purple function,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.610
my slope is 0
starting off, then it

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.470
gets more and more steep
in the negative direction.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.800
And so my slope is 0, and it
gets more and more negative,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.440
so this is indeed
seems to match up.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.710
So, let's check our answer.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.740
Yes, got it right.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.740
I could keep doing this.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.890
This is so much fun.
