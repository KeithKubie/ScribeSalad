00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.540
 Vatican City: The capital of the Catholic Church, in addition to being the home of the Pope, also brings many magnificent art and history to the world. 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.030
 Collected among the countries with the smallest borders in the world: 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.240
 It's even small enough to walk around its border in 40 minutes. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.980
 How is this small country that can't be smaller? 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.079
 The short answer is: because Mussolini, and the long answer is extremely complicated, 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.199
 So I will give you a simplified medium length answer now: 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.669
 The Pope ruled a country called the Papal State long ago, and its territory was covered at the time. 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.960
 Currently part of Italy. It was under this rule of a thousand years that the Popes built the largest church in existence. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.199
 St. Peter's Basilica -- and the mountain where the main hall is located, called the Vatican Hill 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.449
 A wall was built around the mountain base. 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.320
 However, the Italian kingdom around the Papal State believes that the Roman city will be a kingdom for their kingdom. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.829
 Awesome capital, so the kingdom was destroyed. 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.829
 The pope, who was destroyed, hid in the walls of the Vatican Mountains and contradicted contradictoryly. 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.949
 The existence of the Italian kingdom, and at the same time complaining about becoming 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.100
 The prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy - but he just finished saying that the country does not exist. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 The Italian king, who did not intend to eradicate the Pope and risked a religious civil war, decided to wait for the Pope to come out himself. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.729
 And think that the Pope will give up sooner or later -- but if religion is so easy to yield, it is not religion. 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.440
 -- After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 60 years, the situation has not changed. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.970
 And this led us to Benito Mussolini, the then Italian Prime Minister. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.120
 And the Pope kept complaining to Italian Catholics about their self-imposed imprisonment, 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.000
 Therefore, Mussolini wanted to add points to his achievements in this matter, so he reached the following agreement with the Pope at that time: 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.550
 a) Italy gave the Vatican’s territory to the Pope; 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.910
 with... 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.380
 b) Italy gave the Pope a lot of compensation. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.900
 In return 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.530
 a) The Pope recognizes the existence of Italy; 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.780
 with... 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.840
 b) The Pope promises to remain neutral in politics and war. 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.210
 Because Mussolini is afraid, this may cause some troubles. 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.190
 After the agreement was signed, a new country, the Vatican City, was born. 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.880
 Today, this mini country on the mountain has everything you expect to see in the country: 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 She has a government that sets her own laws and enforces the law by her own police. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.280
 And imprisoned those who violated their laws in their own prisons. 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 She has her own bank, prints her own stamps, and issues her own license plate. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.910
 But only her citizens can drive in her territory, probably because they are terrible 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.820
 Parking 埸--but like many self-respecting countries: she has her own 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.800
 Unique top-level domain name: .VA 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.000
 But even with the symbols of these countries, the Vatican City is very different from other countries. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.190
 Take your beautiful hat, because it will become more and more strange next: 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.060
 To understand the Vatican City, you must first understand two kinds of people and things: 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.600
 The famous Pope, the fascinating Holy See, the Vatican City itself and 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.410
 The Vatican City King, who was basically unknown to her. 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.530
 The first is the Pope: he has a throne to sit on and become a Roman city on the throne. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.530
 Bishop of all Catholics 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
 In fact, all Catholic bishops have their own thrones but because 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.010
 The bishop of Rome is the Pope, so he has a special throne and has its unique name: the Holy Land. 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.860
 Every time the Pope dies or retirees, there will be a throne power game and decide which one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610
 The bishop can then enter the Holy See. 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.280
 So although the bishop came and went, the Holy See is eternal. So the name of the Holy See is not just 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.920
 The throne, but also refers to all the rules that make the Catholic Church a Catholic court. 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.000
 In the case of Mussolini’s previous agreement, he technically took the Vatican’s territory. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.240
 To the Holy See - and, believe it or not, it is a regular legal person in international law. 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.510
 Basically, every time you hear the word of the Holy See, you think of it as a Catholic company. 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.450
 The Pope is the chairman. 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.970
 Now let's talk back to the king. The Vatican City King is within the border of the Vatican City 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.520
 Have absolute, uncontrollable power and his presence makes the Vatican City one of the only six absolute monarchies in the world. 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.010
 These include Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Swaziland. 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.690
 The absolute power of his king is why the Vatican City cannot join the European Union because only 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.060
 Only a democratic country can join. 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.600
 Although the Vatican City, strictly speaking, has a legislature -- by the Pope 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.130
 The appointed cardinal composition - but the Vatican City King, can reject his decision at any time for any reason. 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.180
 But why have you never heard of a king in the Vatican City? Because although the king and the pope 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.700
 Are two different characters, but they happen to be the same person at the same time. 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.950
 And thus caused a wonderful phenomenon: because the pope was elected and the king 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.599
 They have absolute power but they are the same person, thus making the Vatican City the only election-determined, non-hereditary 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.930
 Absolute monarchy. 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.120
 It is this dual identity that makes it difficult to solve the mystery of the Vatican City because of the Pope. 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.300
 As the situation changes, it can be the king of the Vatican City or 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.030
 The Pope of the Holy See. 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.400
 do you understand? do not understand? Ok, let me make a metaphor: 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.300
 Imagine an international organization with a lot of power, called Grey Industry, and a chairman. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.439
 He persuaded the United States to give one of its islands to the industry, and it turned the island into 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.779
 A new country -- the Grey city -- is made by the absolute monarch as its government, while 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:27.849
 Set up a constitution to define the king of Grey City for the chairman of the Grey industry. 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.099
 Obviously, he should now move his industrial headquarters to 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.569
 This new country -- and the industry benefits from the laws of the country 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.680
 Internationality can also benefit the country. And as a middleman sometimes do 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.930
 The chairman is better; sometimes it is better to be a king. 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.879
 This is exactly the same as in the Vatican City. 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.550
 But if you still feel confused, don't worry, because even other countries have analyzed it in a mess. 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.770
 For example, the United Nations has a legal person as a member of the Holy See - but there is no 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.449
 The Vatican City itself is a country. And the passport issued by the church to the citizens of the Vatican City 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.180
 Although it is issued from a company, not a country, it is accepted by other countries. 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.909
 And when it comes to the citizens of the Vatican City, they may be because of the Pope’s religious leaders and the king’s 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.740
 The strange result caused by the dual identity. 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.789
 Although other countries produce new citizens through famous human reproduction, 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.240
 But the Vatican City is not like this. No one in the Vatican City is a native of the public - and that is not because 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 Under the rounding, there is no female citizen there. 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.870
 To become a citizen in the city, you must ask the king to designate you as a citizen. 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.490
 The king will only designate you as a citizen if you work for the Pope and at the same time. 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.409
 And because of the absolute power of the king, your national identity is completely under his control. If you quit as the Pope 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.550
 The service work, the king -- and also the pope -- will abolish your national identity. 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.330
 These rules make the Vatican City not a permanent permanent resident: 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.389
 There are only 500 citizens there - even less than a few in a few countries 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.409
 The number of people living in the skyscrapers - and these citizens act as cardinals, 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.479
 Diplomats, Pope's bodyguards or other Catholic-related work, etc. 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.630
 So the best analogy for the Vatican City is a corporate headquarters with sovereign independence. 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.330
 And give their staff temporary citizenship; not a real city-state like Singapore: 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.030
 Because it has a self-propagating population and participates in a series of economic activities. 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.349
 And the Vatican City has nothing. 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.960
 But in the end, the reason why the world cares about the Vatican City is not because of its citizens in its walls. 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.469
 It is because of the billions of Catholics outside the city wall.
