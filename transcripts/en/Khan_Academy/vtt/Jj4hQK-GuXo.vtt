00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.970
- [Instructor] We've
already had several videos

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.410
where we talk about the types of markets

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.240
that we might look at in economics.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.580
At one end, you might
have perfect competition,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.630
let's write perfect comp,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.810
and this is where you have many firms,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.330
what they produce is not differentiated,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.630
there is no barriers to entry,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.950
and in that situation, we have looked at

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.270
that the market price,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.400
the firms just have to
take that market price,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.260
and that market price is
going to describe what

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.630
their marginal revenue is going to be.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.800
No matter how much each of
those individual firms produce,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.610
they're just going to
get that market price,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.070
so that marginal revenue
will be that market price,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.300
but then we looked at a whole

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.150
sort of what we could call
imperfectly competitive firms,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.240
imperfectly, imperfect competition.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.250
At the extreme, you have the monopoly,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.480
where you only have
one firm in the market,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.650
huge barriers to entry and

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.260
so that company or that firm
essentially is the market

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.660
and so their demand curve
for their product essentially

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.880
is the market demand curve.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160
But in between, you have things

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.370
like monopolistic
competition right over there,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.380
and in monopolistic competition,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.610
you have many firms that are competing

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460
but they are all
differentiated in some way,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.910
and there are some barriers to entry.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.960
A good example of monopolistic competition

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.050
or imperfect competition might
be the athletic shoe market.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.050
In the athletic shoe market,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.140
you have many competitors,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.740
you have your Nike, Adidas,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
Reebok, and I could keep listing names,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.360
and they are all differentiated
in their own way,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.110
they all have their own brands,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.750
which they have built up over time,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.940
they have associations with
certain sports figures,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.560
some their shoes might
be perceived as better

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.480
in certain categories, but they

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.620
are also competing with each other.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.950
So the competition is that they

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.940
are competing with each other

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.910
but you could consider
monopolistic competition

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.470
because only Nike can sell,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.210
well, Nike shoes, and so you
could imagine a demand curve

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.490
for say only Nike shoes,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130
so in imperfect competition,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.800
every firm would have their
own unique demand curve,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.330
and how much they produce
actually will affect the price

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.700
that they get for the
product or the service,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.680
and what we're going to
see in this video is when

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.880
we are dealing with imperfect competition,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.990
the demand curve, the price,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.010
isn't exactly what marginal
revenue is going to be,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.093
and to understand that, let's
look at a simple model here.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.600
So right over here, I
have a very simple model

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.570
of a demand curve for a firm

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.880
in an imperfectly competitive market,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.900
and you can see here that the more

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.420
that that firm produces of its goods,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.810
the lower price it can get for that good,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.590
and we can see very clearly this

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.600
is a classic downward
sloping demand curve,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.040
but what's going to be really
interesting is to think about,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.850
what is going to be the marginal revenue,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.810
especially the marginal revenue in a world

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.750
where if they sell one unit,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.000
they get 32.50, but when
they sell two units,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.610
it's not like they'll get
32.50 for one of those units

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.940
and then they'll get
25 for the second unit.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.150
If you have a market price
out there for $25, you're

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.380
going to get $25 on all two units,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.130
so even though someone was
willing to pay 32.50 for one,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.963
they are still only going

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:08.250
to pay $25, so let's think about what

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.520
that does to the marginal revenue.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.550
I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.610
and try to fill out this table

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.363
yourself before I do it with you.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.920
All right, now let's do it together,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.360
so our total revenue,
obviously when we sell nothing,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.310
we have, let me do this in another color,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.300
we have zero total revenue.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.580
Now, when we sell one unit at 32.50, well,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.810
then our total revenue is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.370
going to be 32.50, no surprise there.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.990
Now it's going to get interesting.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.610
When we sell two units,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730
what's going to be our total revenue?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.280
Well, both of those units
are gonna be sold at $25,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.640
it's not like, as I just said, it's not

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.130
like that first person is
still willing to pay 32.50,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.170
like hey, your market price is $25,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.690
that's what everyone is going to pay,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.520
so now your total revenue
is $50, two times $25.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.200
Now when you go to three,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.130
the market price that you
can get is 17.50, let's see,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.503
that is going to be, 52.50.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:01.950
52.50 of total revenue,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.550
and then if you, if your
market price was $10, you could

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.640
have a quantity of four.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.500
If you wanted to sell four,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.890
you could do so at a price

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.820
of $10, you can do it in either way,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.217
but then your total
revenue is going to be $40.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.920
Now, from this, we can think about, well,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.780
what's our marginal revenue?

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.520
Well, our marginal revenue
for that first unit

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.360
is the same as what the price

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.520
of that first unit is, we
went from zero to 32.50 with

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.440
that first unit, so that's
32.50 right over here,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.710
but what about as we go

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.900
from that first unit to that second unit?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.840
Well, our units go up by one,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.773
but our revenue from 32.50
to 50 goes up by 17.50,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.440
and so we are already seeing

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.670
that there is a discrepancy
between our marginal revenue

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.600
and our price, and we can going.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.590
When we go from two to three units,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.170
our revenue only goes up by 2.50,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.630
and so that's going to
be our marginal revenue,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.980
and then something very
interesting happens.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.270
As we go from three units to four units,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.420
our total revenue actually goes down,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.420
it goes down by 12.50,
negative 12.50 right over here,

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.450
and that's because when
the price gets that low,

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.770
you are taking a hit on all of the units

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.820
that you are selling, so
you'll actually get a lower

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.040
total revenue right over
here, and if we plotted,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.030
we'll see very clearly that
the marginal revenue curve,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.100
the parts from the demand
curve for that firm

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.100
that's competing in an
imperfectly competitive market,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.880
and so we can see here at one unit,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.650
our marginal revenue is
the same, but at two units,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.650
our marginal revenue is
17.50, at three units,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.980
our marginal revenue is 2.50,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.520
and so we have a marginal revenue curve

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.430
that looks more like this.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.900
So the big takeaway is here

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.480
that a firm that's operating
in an imperfectly market.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.110
It isn't just a price taker,

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.970
it's not that no matter
how much it produces it's

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.420
going to get the same price,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.730
it's going to have its
own unique demand curve,

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.910
because there is some
differentiation in the market,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.660
and so it's going to have a
downward sloping demand curve,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.390
and because of that downward
sloping demand curve,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.360
you are also going to have

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.560
a downward sloping marginal revenue curve

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.360
and that marginal
revenue curve is actually

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.570
going to be downward
sloping at a steeper rate,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.750
so when we start doing the firm analysis

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.870
of marginal cost and
where does it intersect

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.240
the marginal revenue, if
you're dealing with a firm

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.380
that's operating in a
perfectly competitive market,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.270
that marginal revenue curve
when we've seen it before

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.310
was horizontal, but when we think about

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.110
that marginal revenue curve for a firm

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.710
in an imperfectly competitive market,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.230
that's going to be downward sloping,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.250
it's going to be sloping downward faster

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.793
than its demand curve.
