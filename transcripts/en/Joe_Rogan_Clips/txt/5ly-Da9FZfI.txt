Speaker 1:          00:00          My one of my dad's favorite comics was a Stan hope. He loves Stan Hope I'll never forget. I did a show with Stan hope in Syracuse actually in in when my dad was sitting next to me while we're watching Stan hope and he leaned over, he was like, man, the mind on this guy. It's like one of the brightest, brightest people I've ever heard in my life. Dutch get out more. He, well, he's, he's in a grave now. He's only getting out was a ghost. He's probably a drunk ghost at some girl's house right now because he can't find, mine was getting ready to film another special. Yeah, very excited. Watch. Yeah, it's going to be great. Sandal was, he's like the, I don't know. He's like the equalizer when it comes to what's going on in society. It just has a way of being like, boom, this is what's going on with gun control and with people being offended by terminology and words.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Here's why it's ridiculous. Yeah. He's good like that. Well, he works. He's a guy that he and he works on his own schedule. He decides when to write, when to perform, when the tour, what to do. And he was always like, am I just fucking retire right back at it? And you're special coming out next year. He's always, he's always working. He always working. He has his own lane. Yeah, he's amazing. I love watching him. Glad he's out there cause he's just like, he's basically an older version of the guy. He was like 20 plus years ago. It's not changed at all other than like become more wacky. Was fucking goofy suits and Jay let's fucking suits. Every time I see him, what the fuck? But here's the thing, like that's one of the things like he owns the solution can wear the suit if you wear a goofy suit, like a really shitty suit like Stan hope were peach colored suit with ruffles.

Speaker 1:          01:40          He wears loafers. Like a old man from caddy shack. He looks like he used to sell cars 20 years ago and kept the outfit. Frazier Smith's long lost cousin. He looks like a 12 Toledo cousin from Toledo sells cars. He looks like a ghost from the titanic. He rents out clowns, shoes, those shoes I button. You're right. That's his, that's his thing. That's his look. No one can do suits and he's been rocking this look for quite a while now. Like he used to dress like a normal person. I mean there was a, there was always a level of uh, of eccentric. You have any, he can replace his entire wardrobe for $40.

Speaker 1:          02:27          Yeah, I mean you could get that jacket for $2 and it's amazing. Then he finds him all that seemed to be tailored. It's like he gets a fraud, he takes these things. He takes these shitty fabrics to like a real high end. Taylor. And he has them like slim fit it and he gets them for tens. He finds them. He doesn't, he find someone, me definitely get some nice tailored look at that shirt, bum jacket, the shirt. And it's not bombed though. It's all nice and killing. It's nice and clean. But I'm saying it looks like a bum that struck it rich real quick. Like he got money fast and didn't know what to do. So he just bought the same suits, but cleaner.
