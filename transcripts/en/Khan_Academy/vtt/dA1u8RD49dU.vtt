00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.700
We're on problem 87.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.270
Machine A produces parts twice
as fast as machine B does.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.470
So machine A produces 100 parts
twice as fast as machine

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.740
B, let me just keep reading,
machine B produces 100 parts

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:29.450
in 40 minutes.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.410
So that's equal to what?

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.160
100 divided by 40, that's
2.5 parts per minute.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.120
And they told us A produces it
twice as fast, so A is going

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.630
to be twice that,
so A is going to

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.920
be 5 parts per minute.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940
If each machine produces parts
at a constant rate, how many

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.670
parts does machine A produce
in 6 minutes?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.990
So 5 parts per minute
times 6 minutes.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.840
6 minutes is equal to what?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.040
Minutes cancel out, 6
times 5 is 30 parts.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.000
Choice A.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.140
88.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.910
A necklace is made by stringing
n individual beads

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.930
together in the repeating
pattern red bead, green bead,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.750
white bead.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.050
Let's see.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:24.380
So, red, green, white, blue,
and then yellow,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.680
and you keep repeating.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
If the necklace begins with a
red bead, and ends with a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
white bead, then n could
be equal to?

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.130
So let's think about it, it
starts with a red bead, and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.940
ends with a white bead.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.570
So let's think about this, if
it's exactly a multiple of 5,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.720
if n is equal to exactly the
number of beads in this

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.470
pattern, then it'll always
end with a yellow.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.720
So if n is equal to some
multiple of 5, it could be 5,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.310
it could be 10, or whatever,
then you're going to end with

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.229
a yellow bead.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.880
That makes sense.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.260
If you have 10, you'd just
have the pattern twice.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.520
If n is equal to some multiple
of 5 plus 1, then you're

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.280
always going to complete the
cycle completely, and then

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.260
your going to have one more,
and you're going to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.670
end with a red bead.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.390
I think you see the
pattern here.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.810
If n is equal to some multiple
of 5, and then it has 2 left

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.470
over, or when it's divided by
5, it has a remainder of 2,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.330
you're going to end
with a green bead.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.990
The multiple of 5 parts, you're
going to complete all

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.070
the way to yellow, and you're
going to have 1, 2 left.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.650
And so if n is equal to a
multiple of 5 plus 3, then

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.640
you're going to end
with a white bead.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.380
So a multiple of 5 plus 3 is
essentially any number that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.790
ends with either an 8 or 3,
because a multiple of 5 ends

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.580
with either a 5 or a 0.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.700
So let's see what choices
they give us.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.260
They give us 16, not a
multiple of 5 plus 3.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.920
32, not a multiple of 5 plus
3, 41 is not, 54 is not.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.750
68, that is a multiple
of 5 plus 3.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.870
It's 65 plus 3.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.180
65 is 13 times 5, that's equal
to 13 times 5 plus 3, so the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.270
choice is E.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.360
Problem 89.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:44.440
In the x-y coordinate system, if
a, b and a plus 3, b plus k

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.070
are two points on the line
defined by the equation x is

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:58.090
equal to 3y minus 7, then
k is equal to what?

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.770
Well I think an easier thing to
do is to-- well actually we

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.460
could just stay-- let's just
define y in terms of x.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:17.570
So you get x plus 7 is equal
to 3y, y is equal to 1/3 x

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.980
plus 7 over 3.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.840
OK, let's see what we can do.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.990
So the slope of this line is
1/3, if you remember from

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.780
algebra, this mx plus b form,
but this is how fast the line

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.420
goes up or down, this 1/3.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.370
Every move to the right
in x by 1, you're

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.380
moving up in y by 1/3.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.360
So what's the slope?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.490
If you give me two points,
what's the slope?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.350
What's the change in y
over the change in x?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.910
So I'll call this y1
and this is y2.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.070
Or point 1 and point 2, so you
could say change in y is b

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.290
plus k, the latter y point minus
the first y point, over

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.240
a plus 3 minus a.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.210
And what does this reduce to?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.680
b plus k minus k, b's cancel
out, a plus 3 minus a, a's

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.790
cancel out, I'm left
with k over 3, and

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.680
that equals the slope.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.720
We already know the slope
is equal to 1/3.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.630
k over 3 is equal to 1/3,
so k is equal to 1.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.550
It's choice D.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.670
Problem 90.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:38.700
At the rate of m meters per
second, how many meters does a

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.080
cyclist travel in x minutes?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.060
So remember, this is tricky.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.290
They said x meters per second,
how many meters does a cyclist

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.140
travel in x minutes, so let's
get x in terms of seconds.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.530
So x minutes is going to be 60x
seconds, because you have

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.230
60 seconds per minute.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.010
So 60x seconds.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.290
And distance is equal to rate
times time, hopefully that's a

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.900
little bit of intuition for you
now, but the rate is equal

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.170
to m meters per second, and
he's traveling for 60x

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.680
seconds, so you get m times 60x,
which is 60mx in seconds,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.390
times meters per second,
that's meters.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:34.490
So 60mx meters.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.750
How many meters does a cyclist
travel in x minutes?

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:45.370
x minutes is 60x seconds.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.290
How many meters does a cyclist
travel-- right, rate times

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.953
time, at a rate of m
meters per second.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.906
I think they made a boo-boo
here, because they have to

00:07:00.906 --> 00:07:13.580
have the 60m-- oh, I see
the mistake I made.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.110
Let me redo it, my bad.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:25.520
They said, at the rate of m
meters per s seconds, so the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.190
cyclist's rate is actually m
over s meters per second.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.260
That's confusing because they
said that s seconds, and I

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.860
thought they said, m meters per
second, but it's a rate of

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.930
m meters per s seconds, how
many meters does a cyclist

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.610
travel in x minutes, which we
know is 60, if it's x minutes,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.160
it's 60x seconds.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:57.210
So you multiply the rate times
the time, and you get 60mx

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.030
over s, which is choice E.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.830
And it saved me that my
original answer wasn't

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.560
anywhere in any of
the choices.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.260
Problem 91.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.290
If Sam were twice as old as
he is, he would be 40

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.530
years older than Jim.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.300
So 2 times Sam, so if Sam were
twice as old as he, so s is

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.220
Sam's current age.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.350
If Sam were twice as old as he
is, he would be 40 years older

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:32.020
than Jim, so he would
be Jim plus 40.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.169
If Jim is 10 years younger
than Sam, how old is Sam?

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.510
Jim is 10 years younger than
Sam, so we can say

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.189
Sam is Jim plus 10.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.420
We could've also said Sam
minus 10 is equal

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.090
to Jim, same thing.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.870
Let's see what we can do here,
let's see how best we can

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.520
solve this equation.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.190
They want to know
how old is Sam.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.710
We want to solve for s,
so let's do something.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.670
Let's subtract this equation
from that equation.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:09.310
So 2s minus s is s, j minus
j is 0, 40 minus 10 is 30.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.950
So Sam is 30, and we're done.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.250
And there's a lot of ways
you could've done that.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.040
You could have solved for j,
and substituted here then

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.860
solved, it would've taken a
little bit more time, but we

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.170
just subtracted this equation
from that, and you got s is

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.670
equal to 30, which
is choice B.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.870
And I think I'm about out of
time, so I'll continue into

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.650
the next video.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.060
See you soon.
