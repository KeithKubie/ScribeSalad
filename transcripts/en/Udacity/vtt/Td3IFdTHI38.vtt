00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.840
Scientific notation can be used for
very small numbers too.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.660
As we saw previously,
when we discussed standard notation,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.619
when we are working with numbers
that are much smaller than 1, for

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:18.515
example 0.000001 10 is
raised to a negative power.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:24.305
So, in order to write this
in scientific notation,

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:28.825
I would have to write 1.0
x 10 to the negative 6.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:34.444
That's because I moved my
decimal place 6 places

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:40.338
to the right to turn 0.000001 into 1.0.

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:41.398
Now you try.

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:44.478
Write this number in
scientific notation.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:48.660
Again, put the decimal in this box and
indicate the power here.
