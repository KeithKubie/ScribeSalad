00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.649
Ok, here we go-- Solid, Liquid, Gas,

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:03.649
Supersolid, superfluid

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.649
Or Bose-Einstein Condensate.

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:05.649
That one is super.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:06.649
cool.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:07.649
Plus, Plasma

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.649
But we haven’t even gotten started.

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:09.649
We truly live in the future.

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.090
You ready, T?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.800
Scientists have created, yet another state
of matter!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
YAY!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.859
It’s called a supersolid.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.460
And while it sounds like a solid.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
It’s… well.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.460
It’s not.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210
A supersolid is basically a superfluid that
got it’s crap together.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.150
Right, and by crap you mean molecules.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.150
Precisely.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.509
The researchers who created this new state
of matter took a Bose-Einstein Condensate,

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.739
made of sodium gas, and used lasers to cool
it to near absolute zero.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.620
The atoms are moving extremely slowly.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.899
A BEC is a special phase of matter created
in 2001 winning researchers the Nobel Prize

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:41.899
for Physics.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.149
Once cooled to a BEC, the sodium flowed with
zero friction.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.750
It’s like a Super.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.750
Fluid.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.750
A superfluid.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.750
Which is awesome.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.969
This BEC was also superconductive, meaning
its electrons moved through it with zero resistance.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.500
There are numerous scientific benefits to
these two conditions, but we’re not here

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.579
to talk about that.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.440
In this case, the scientists kept cooling
that sodium and at some point, it arranged

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.550
into a non-crystalline “solid!”

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.910
The scientists called it a superfluid flow
with “long-range spatial periodicity of

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.910
[a] solid.”

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.870
Those are some fancy science words.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.400
Essentially, think of it like a coffee cup
filled with a frictionless, superconducting,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.120
gel that if you could stir would never stop
going around.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
Delicious.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.770
The “fluid” didn’t suddenly become hard,
instead, it’s not exactly solid -- think

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.770
like… gel.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.500
It’s a fluid but it behaves like a solid.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.890
They’ve still got a lot to learn about these
fluids / solids, but according to their paper,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.410
their supersolid [quote] “establishes a
system with continuous symmetry-breaking properties,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.760
associated collective excitations and superfluid
behaviour.”

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.020
Let’s break that down.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.200
Superfluid behavior you get… frictionless
superconductor

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.980
Collective excitations is a fancy way to say
quasiparticles.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.990
Quasiparticles are a group of particles that
behave as if they’re one because their parts

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.520
are interacting somehow.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.820
And then there’s symmetry-breaking.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.090
That’s also describing particle movement,
normally in quantum mechanics symmetry is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.090
a big deal.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.090
Breaking it?

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.090
A bigger deal.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.179
At the moment, it continues the old saying
-- the closer you look the stranger things

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.179
get.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.600
But c’mon, do we have six states of matter
now?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600
Actually, no.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
We don’t.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.640
We have way more.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.250
The states of matter solid, liquid, and gas
that you’ve been living with your whole

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.780
life were never all there were.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.640
It’s kind of like when you’re learning
math.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.940
First you’re taught numbers, then they tell
you there are infinite numbers.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.870
Then (as if they’re just messing with you)
they tell you there are infinite negative

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.870
numbers too.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.790
And then you find out there are irrational
numbers, and imaginary numbers.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.620
And you can do calculations with infinites
and embed equations into each other and … yah.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.770
Matter is like that.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.500
So yes, solid, liquid, gas and plasma exist
-- and it’s really about molecular arrangement.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.030
Solids are interacting heavily, liquids are
loosey goosey, and gases are just barely interacting

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.260
while Plasma is “free” it can do anything.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.390
But on top of those four, there are several
more!

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.470
Cold ones like the Bose-Einstein Condensate
and Supersolid and hot ones like electron-degenerate

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.540
matter (free particles found in white dwarf
stars) or the theorized stranger matter (possibly

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.030
found in neutron stars).

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.640
Plus, of course, time crystals.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.700
Which have low-energy states and weird effects
across time symmetry.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
We should just do a whole video about states
of matter, right?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.200
Bottom line, we have a new state of matter!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200
YAY!

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.690
But we don’t now have six or seven, we have
at least a dozen, they’re just more… out

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.030
there, experimental, laboratory-only or extreme
kinds of matter!

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.690
Our universe is awesome.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.520
Boom de-yadda.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.240
Look everyone, if you want to know more about
states of matter, watch this video about Time

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240
Crystals.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.310
It will give you a nice headache, or maybe
it already has.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.630
Do you have an itch for a science answer?

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.810
That’s why we’re here.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.120
