it may be a little more than speculation

crossing of two senses almost like it's
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.060
crossing of two senses almost like it's
like a translation of one sense into

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070

I do not have that kind of synesthesia

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250
I do not have that kind of synesthesia
 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.750
I do not have that kind of synesthesia
but in a way I think many of us that

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760
but in a way I think many of us that
 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.680
but in a way I think many of us that
have that when we read you know when I

during my research for this book about

during my research for this book about
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810
during my research for this book about
something called mirror touch

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820

synesthesia and saying to myself well I
 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.429

have that and so that is when people

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
have that and so that is when people

look at someone or something is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
look at someone or something is
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649
look at someone or something is
happening to another person say you look

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
happening to another person say you look
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.209
happening to another person say you look
at someone being slapped on the arm and

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219
at someone being slapped on the arm and
 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.170
at someone being slapped on the arm and
then the the mirror touch synesthete has

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
then the the mirror touch synesthete has
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.060
then the the mirror touch synesthete has
a sensation in the arm not the same as

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
a sensation in the arm not the same as
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740
a sensation in the arm not the same as
being slapped at least not in my case at

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
being slapped at least not in my case at
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200
being slapped at least not in my case at
all but there is a kind of mirroring

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
all but there is a kind of mirroring

experience so that the visual looking

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539
experience so that the visual looking
 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.929
experience so that the visual looking
becomes the tactile impression in the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
becomes the tactile impression in the
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.999
becomes the tactile impression in the
body and I think you see again going

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009

back to behavior ism and talk of this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
back to behavior ism and talk of this

research into the brain people were very

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
research into the brain people were very
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.570
research into the brain people were very
reluctant to

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
reluctant to
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.320
reluctant to
do any studies about synesthesia because

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
do any studies about synesthesia because
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.540
do any studies about synesthesia because
it just seemed so wacky and so that's

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550
it just seemed so wacky and so that's
 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.700
it just seemed so wacky and so that's
what happens once researchers have some

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710
what happens once researchers have some
 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.150

kind of hypothesis about neural networks

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
kind of hypothesis about neural networks

in the brain and maybe that infants are

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
in the brain and maybe that infants are
 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.520
in the brain and maybe that infants are
all synesthetes and that these as the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
all synesthetes and that these as the
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.640

continues most people lose that crossing

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
continues most people lose that crossing
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.880
continues most people lose that crossing
over from one sense to the other and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890
over from one sense to the other and
 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.660
over from one sense to the other and
some people don't they retain it
