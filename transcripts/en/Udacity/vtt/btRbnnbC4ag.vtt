00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.330
Once the layout is mostly done,

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.678
you can start dealing with all the fun visual stuff like the background colors,

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:08.460
the margins, the padding, the borders, the fonts, etc.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.620
Colors and margins are pretty easy to test with Dev tools as we've seen so

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.280
far, but what about fonts?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.230
How do you find a font that looks close enough to the one that was

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.720
provided in the design?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.900
There's really no super easy way to do that apart from asking the designer to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.360
kindly use the free web fonts and then tell you which one they used.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.675
That might not work however, so you might be left with the task of going

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:32.710
online to find the closest web font that matches what you had in the design and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
one of the best places to get fonts is with Google at Google.com/fonts.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.190
It's fun to go on here and just browse around to see what you can find.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.100
You can look around, you can filter, and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.290
then find a font that looks closest to what you're given in the design.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.260
All right, I like this one.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.600
It looks kind of close to my handwriting, but not really.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.910
Anyways, let's click on this and we can go ahead and add it to our website.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.780
We'll scroll down and then all we have to do is add this code.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.920
So I'll click on it and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.990
copy it and then we'll come up here to the head of our document and paste it in.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.819
So the link that we just copied from Google tells browsers to download the font,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.840
but we still need to go into CSS and make sure the font is actually being used.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.770
Back in the Google Fonts page, I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
copy this code right here, and I'll paste this into our CSS file.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.750
In this case, I'm applying the font family Indie Flower,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.840
which we are going to download to everything on the page,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.270
and we know it's everything because of this asterisk.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.180
So I'll save the CSS and let's reload the page.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.760
When I hit refresh, we should see this font change and there we go.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.000
Our new font has now been applied to the page.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.620
Scrolling down, we should see it on everything.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.250
There we go, our featured work, appify, appify, and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.600
appify all have the cool new font now.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.810
Play around with Google fonts for

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.120
a bit and then see if you can answer this question.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.120
Which of these fonts is closest to the font that we see in the mock up?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.780
Is it Play, Rambla, Lato, or Orbitron?
