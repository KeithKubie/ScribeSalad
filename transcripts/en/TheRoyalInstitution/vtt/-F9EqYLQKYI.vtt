00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.609
ISIS, well, the first thing I should say is
that it's not a terrorist organisation.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.680
ISIS is a neutron and muon facility that's
designed to deliver neutron beams for users.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.160
So they put samples in the beam line to study
things like structure of materials, how they

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.849
work. All sorts of things from materials science
to biology to environmental science.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.750
So ISIS started operating in 1984 producing
the first neutrons.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.380
And the way we produce the neutrons is by
shooting protons into a heavy metal target

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.200
at very high velocity. The heavy metal contains
lots of neutrons because it has big atomic

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.710
nuclei. And the nuclei are quite unstable.
So if you hit them hard, you knock bits off.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.680
Obviously we had to build a particle accelerator
to do that. So neutrons are non charged particles,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.300
you can't accelerate those because you need
to use a charged particle in an electric field.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.060
So we smash the protons at high energy into
a target and then neutrons come out of that target.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.760
So around this so called target we have beam
lines for users. It happens 50 times a second.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.820
Four of those pulses go to this target station
and one of those five pulses goes to the other

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.920
target station.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.100
At it's full capacity we use about 10MW of
power. It takes many, many millions of volts

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.710
to be able to pull neutrons out of atoms,
you have to overcome the strong nuclear force

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.500
and that's why we have to smash them so hard
with a proton beam and it takes lots and lots

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.540
of energy to actually build the power in that
proton beam.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.210
My name is Suzie Sheehy and I design particle
accelerators for various applications.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.900
We are currently standing in the heart of
the ISIS neutron and muon facility in which

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.560
there is an 800 mega electron volt proton
synchrotron. There's two main systems around

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.680
a synchrotron like ISIS that need lots of
power. One of them is the accelerating system

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.010
which are these big, what we call, radio frequency
cavities which there's one just behind us

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.990
here. There's a radio frequency cavity. So
they use quite a lot of power to accelerate

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.260
the particles. The main magnets in this machine
repeat ten times around the circumference.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.859
And in each section you'll see one of these
big yellow magnets. It's about 4.5 metres

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.790
long, weighs about 35 tonnes and it's just
there to bend the beam. These green ones here

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.060
are called quadrupole magnets. They focus
and de-focus the beam to keep it stable and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.310
under control.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.950
Each of those magnets has a field inside it
but that field needs to change during the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.629
acceleration cycle. My name is John Thomason.
I'm accelerator division head for ISIS and

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.420
that means I'm in charge of all the equipment
that keeps the accelerators running and all

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.220
the people that keep that equipment running.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.420
Because effectively the magnets are bending
the particles around in the circle. It's a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.370
particle accelerator so you can guess that
the particles are going to go faster while

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.430
you're doing that so the field strength needs
to increase in the magnet.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.120
The beam goes around about 10,000 times in
it's acceleration cycle but that happens 50

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
times every second. As the beam gains energy,
we have to synchronise the increase in the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.610
magnetic field in order to keep that beam
travelling around the same circle the whole time.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.980
OK, you're in the main capacitor room for
the ISIS synchrotron. Basically this is part

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.790
of the system which powers the main magnets
in the synchrotron ring. I'm Steve West, I'm

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.070
an electrical engineer and I work in the ISIS
electrical engineering group.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.780
What we use to power the magnets there's a resonant circuit.
We use resonance to make it easier to get

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.900
the power into the magnet.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.059
So current oscillates back and forth in the
circuit and it allows us to very quickly move

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:09.049
energy in and out of the magnets. We can store
that energy efficiently within the circuit

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.420
and effectively kind of slosh it around rather
than pulling in new energy continuously from

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.430
the grid.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.340
You have ten what we call superperiods or
groups of magnets around the synchrotron and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.830
you have ten capacitor banks in here, one
for each superperiod. They're all part of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.030
this circuit which allows us to swing the
energy backwards and forwards.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.560
The resonant circuit has an inductance and
capacitance and a resistance. The part of that

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.840
that is called the choke is providing
the inductance in that circuit. We have ten

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.030
main sets of magnets, so in an ideal world
we'd have ten separate chokes but it so happens

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.740
that when we first built the machine, we inherited
a choke which can do ten different actions

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.160
all at the same time but it's an integrated
choke so it all looks like one big lump of metal.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.759
And it looks a bit like a transformer which
some people might be familiar with and it

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.849
stores energy in a magnetic field. Basically
it's a big lump of iron with a coil of wire

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:14.849
around it.

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.431
The square concrete building is the old choke
house and this is what you see here. There's

00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:25.520
a big steel tank. The choke is inside that.
The whole thing is oil cooled.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.819
So if any one part of that goes wrong it's
extremely difficult to mend. So we're trying

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.019
to move away from it now and have one where
we'll have ten separate chokes.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.139
The new system is being split so that instead
of it all being built into this one single

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.659
block of steel, it's being split into ten
separate ones.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.170
We need ten of these chokes. If you count
them you'll find there's 12. It'll be very

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.900
easy if one of these failed in some way, to
switch onto one of the spares and that can

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.720
be done in a few hours. That's one of the
reasons why we built this system is to add

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.360
that extra bit of safety.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.760
It's a bit like the kidneys. You need them,
you can't do without them but if you lose one

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.340
actually you'll still be alright.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.180
Not just the choke system, it's congruent
with a number of other components on ISIS

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:20.569
because a 30 year old accelerator is old enough,
many of the components are 50 or even 60 years old.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.680
So it's an ongoing worry that there are going
to be single point failures that wouldn't

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.469
just take you off, because we get that kind
of thing all the time and we have armies of

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.449
people that come and mend them, but would
take you off for a significant amount of time.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.960
The magnets teams are absolutely vital to
what goes on here. So we have scheduled maintenance

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.240
periods where we basically pick up all of
the problems that have accumulated during

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.219
a user run and deal with them. We're generally
off for between a week and four weeks depending

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:56.610
on what time of year it is. And this is all
scheduled at least a couple of years in advance.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.430
So I'm Aaron, I'm a third year apprentice.
Currently I'm working in the ISIS technical

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.460
support workshop. I'd say the maintenance
teams are probably the most important teams

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.879
that are here. Without them it just wouldn't
happen. I've always been hands on. I've been

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:19.050
able to fix cars, I've restored classic cars.
I've worked on motorbikes. ISIS is definitely

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.050
more complicated than a classic car. But I'd
say that when you're working on the system

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.830
for so long, and you've put so much hard work
into it, it's hard to not get a bit attached.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.389
Like us humans, we need care and attention.
That's the main part of the job, is to give

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.240
it care and attention just to keep it going.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.360
There's a relationship there between the people
and the accelerator and generally speaking

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.069
it's a very loving one. Possibly a bad analogy
but it's a bit like having an ageing parent

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.430
or something like that. That you owe it something,
it owes you something. It's almost like a

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.199
symbiotic relationship if you like.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.660
You know, we have a facility where there's
maybe a thousand people. There's users coming

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.479
from all over the world. They're trying to
understand how we can use particles from inside

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:08.960
the atom that we can't see with our own eyes
and then say save babies lives or make better

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.110
aeroplanes that don't fall out of the sky.
So that's an incredible human story because

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.909
we would not be able to do such amazing science
without both that technology and the people

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:21.549
behind it.
