1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,293
[inaudible].

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,700
You're listening to radiolab from
New York public radio, public radio,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,960
W C

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,390
[inaudible]

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,160
testing, testing. This is radio lab.
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,820
And since this hour we'll be talking
about brains and bodies and how they

7
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:25,451
communicate.

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:30,040
We thought we'd begin the program with a
guy with that we'd go to quite often he

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,170
knows about this sort
of thing. Oliver Sacks,

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,860
Oliver is a neurologist. As I
get closer to very famous author,

11
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:40,370
he took us to his study to show us
something that just fascinates him.

12
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,330
Um, I've become fascinated.
I'm incidentally, I hope you,

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,140
you have to be careful with
your watch or your computers.

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,080
[inaudible]

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,840
um, he showed us a silver ball.

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,950
I should just describe here I am looking
at a silver ball about the size of a

17
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:58,510
small, small ping pong ball,
which he handed to you, right?

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,640
Would you care to lift up
that little steel ball?

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,610
[inaudible] and as soon as he did,

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,760
I am trying

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,500
the ball flying through the
air, taking your hand with it,

22
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,720
smack into the nearest bit
of metal in the vicinity,

23
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:17,400
which was a plate Latier left
very fast and it hurt it.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,810
Wow. That'd be cool. I've got a cat. Okay.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,860
I don't put it too near your watch and
also you have to put it down very gently.

26
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:28,090
Otherwise it may fly with great violence
onto this nickel slam. What is that?

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,430
Um, and what are we
talking about it. Okay. Um,

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,630
well this is a little rare earth
metal magnet of great strength.

29
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,010
[inaudible]

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,010
these magnets orient themselves almost
violently to the earth's magnetic field.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,670
If you have a couple of these things,

32
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:51,350
say in your pockets and you go
for a walk, as you turn a corner,

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,520
you will feel them really at
themselves in your pockets.

34
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,350
I like like little animals.

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,670
So your, your pockets would tell you
whether you were going north, south,

36
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,600
east or west,

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,350
your pockets or wherever you,

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,930
you have the way with magnets and

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,840
how you have very weird man. How
would you propose to use this?

40
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:17,710
In what situation that you have imagined?
Would it be a happy advantage? Well,

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,020
I myself, I'm always
getting lost. I have no,

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,290
I have no sense of
direction. I would function.

43
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,040
Do you all ever come downtown to meet me?

44
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,000
You would know because of the pressure
on your thighs from these little balls

45
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:37,590
that you were carrying out, whether you
were going downtown or not downtown.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,050
See, and I may need things like
this. I am very bad at all.

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,670
Anting myself in space.

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
He's trying to do with the
birds too. Right? Bird.

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,870
Because birds have magnets in their
brains or something like magnets,

50
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,850
which lets them fly south. Yeah. Yeah. So

51
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,700
they know where they're going. They fly
in when they're migrating, right? Yeah.

52
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,250
He's trying to start a
conversation like a bird,

53
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:58,020
but he's cause he's choosing his thighs.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,680
He wants his thighs to talk to his
brain. I've often wondered as an aside,

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,410
uh, the extent to which
one, um, one could develop

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,580
the nuisance. That's what this hour
of radio lab is about. Human beings,

57
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,151
not just Oliver.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,151
All kinds of folks who are attempting
to add census and mostly to subtract

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
census. We'll have stories about
both adding and losing senses.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,640
And more generally, you look at
how brains and bodies communicate,

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,380
often fail to communicate
because believe it or not,

62
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,500
it's not an easy relationship
between your brain and your body.

63
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,260
There's a lot of
confusion, deception, even.

64
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,620
That's what new research shows
and we'll get into all of that.

65
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,890
So let's get into it. All right.
Okay. Ready? Yeah, we're first, well,

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,520
let's begin with an urologist.
Listen, my cell phone is ringing,

67
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,060
so let me pause until it stops.
So that's Robert Sapolsky.

68
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,950
He's a professor of biology at Stanford.

69
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,290
I've never figured out how to do voice
messaging or whatever it is even has done

70
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,900
in this century. Prisoners of our
machine is, okay, we're in business.

71
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,950
Okay, so to begin now,

72
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,870
I said to Robert Sapolsky just to get
my head around this, let's imagine it.

73
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:16,250
I decide to visit my best friend
in the world, Tommy, Tommy.

74
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,330
I walk over to his house. I have a
key. So I opened the front door, Tommy,

75
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,430
I walk into his apartment
and then I see him

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,240
sprawled on the floor, dead

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,720
[inaudible]

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,480
and in a horrible,
tragic, instant like that,

79
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,240
I wonder what would be
going on in my brain.

80
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,740
And I asked this because his
answers suppose gives the answer.

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,510
It was so we heard
according to supposed ski,

82
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,450
what happens happens
in the following order.

83
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,980
First Light bounces off Tommy's
corpse and Andrew's my eye. Okay?

84
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:55,580
It goes up some nerve from your
eyes and into one part of the brain,

85
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:59,160
which turfs it onto the next part.
And then the information keeps moving.

86
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:02,780
A couple of steps down. It gets into
what's called your visual Cortex,

87
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:06,440
which turns the dots into
lines and lines into shapes.

88
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,840
And that's just like a local train.

89
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:13,160
You're taking eventually that local
train carrying the image of timing,

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,200
chug and chug deeper into my brain, to
my cortex. And after a few more stops,

91
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,370
I will finally know, I will
consciously know that Tommy is dead.

92
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,060
But now here's the surprise.

93
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,920
Information can move through the brain
in different ways at the same time.

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,000
And there is a second route, it turns,
there's a second pathway into my body,

95
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,470
into my nervous system, which bypasses
all of that visual cortex stuff

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,630
like a bullet train and goes straight
to this area called the Amygdala.

97
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,340
And what the Amygdala does is instantly
it tells the heart to pound your heart

98
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,880
speeds up the stomach to clinch
stomach muscles, clench tears to flow,

99
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,270
and you're still a couple of seconds
away from like even consciously making

100
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,104
sense of what you're,

101
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,090
and by then already your
stomach is heading towards
your throat or your throats

102
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,950
in your mouth or whatever the cliche is.

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,390
So as I'm standing there in Tommy's
apartment looking at this figure on the

104
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,630
ground before I even know
what I'm looking at before,

105
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:14,360
I am consciously aware that Tommy is dead.

106
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,920
My body already knows. That's
exactly the punchline, right?

107
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,990
Your body knows that before
you consciously know it.

108
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:28,920
[inaudible]

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,500
which is an astonishing idea. It is

110
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,050
astonishing, but it's
not a new idea. Yeah.

111
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,760
This goes back to what was originally
viewed as this totally asinine theory in

112
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,700
psychology back around
1,901 of the, you know,

113
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,950
grand old Poop Oz of
psychology, William James James,

114
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,010
and he's trying to answer the
question where feelings came from.

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,250
That's Joan Alara science writer.
He really likes William James.

116
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,590
He's written a lot about him and
he says, a hundred years ago,

117
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,800
William James poses a thought experiment.
He gives the example of a bear.

118
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,980
He says, imagine you're
walking through the woods.

119
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,200
All of a sudden I'm behind a tree,

120
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,720
a bear attacks. Any wonder William
James did. Okay, so the bear attacks,

121
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,710
you're gonna feel scared.

122
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,240
But what exactly is that
feeling of fear made of?

123
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,060
Which seems like a strange
question to ask. Yeah, but,

124
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,770
but he was trying to
be empirical about it.

125
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,510
He was trying to be a good psychologist.

126
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,890
And his answer was that the feeling
is the perception of your body,

127
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,360
meaning step one, you see the bear, you
see a bear with his teeth and his claws.

128
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,650
Step two, your body responds
fast. Heartbeat, the adrenaline,

129
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:37,430
cursing in your bloodstream.
And it's only in step three.

130
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:42,350
When the brain sees the body respond,
does it then trigger the feeling?

131
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,263
Yeah,

132
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,950
a fear and the feeling of fear comes
from the perception of those changes in

133
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,950
your body. If you took away the
heartbeat, if you took away the body,

134
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,210
there'd be nothing left
to feel. Needless to say,

135
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:59,390
when William James proposed this idea,
people's got solutely crazy. He was nuts,

136
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,720
completely nuts. They said,
you know, if you're right,

137
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,560
then someone who's paralyzed from the
neck down and who doesn't get signals from

138
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,310
their body,

139
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,000
well that person would see the bear in
the woods and they wouldn't get scared,

140
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,330
which is ridiculous. Completely
ridiculous. So the critics said,

141
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,040
William James is wrong, dead wrong,
and that's the end of it. Well,

142
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,310
it's not quite the end of it. Hello,

143
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,480
we happen to bump into a
neurologist, Antonio Damasio,

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,250
director of the brain and creativity
institute at University of Southern

145
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:32,170
California. Wow. What a nice place.

146
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,740
So we're sitting near with demasio where
we happen to be talking about William

147
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,410
James and his critics, which we always
do always do on, you know, lunch.

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,770
We don't go into a luncheon at for
lunch and before we order a tuna fish

149
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,900
sandwich, we always mentioned
William James in his critics.

150
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,050
This is something we do. So I
said to the, I said, the Moscow,

151
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,130
you know the critics call James Wrong
because he said people who were paralyzed

152
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,260
couldn't feel anything,
and he says, you know,

153
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:56,910
it's funny you should mention this
because been a series of studies thinking

154
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:01,800
about James One more time and it's very
interesting because the first study that

155
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,880
was made in this area,

156
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:07,881
it was made by a paraplegic psychologists
who thought that he felt less

157
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:14,661
emotional than he was before and he
talked to others and others reported the

158
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:16,530
same.

159
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,970
The studies reported that people who had
once been able bodied and then became

160
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:25,560
paralyzed, felt less, less
happy than able bodied people,

161
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:30,561
less sad than able body people just
less our B is rooted in a body state.

162
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,470
If I would be able to remove from your
brain the representation of your body,

163
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,600
you would not know that you were you
and would I not be sorry at my friend's

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Daddy. You definitely would
not be sorry. At anything.

165
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,930
What is in fact the essence
of being joyful or sad?

166
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,360
If you don't hook those
notions on a changed body,

167
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,210
he's right. You know? I mean, if you
think about the last time you were sad,

168
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,750
like really sad, how would you
describe that feeling to yourself?

169
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,540
In fairness, when I guess I would,

170
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,480
I would say I felt dragged
out and heavy. Yeah.

171
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,040
That feeling is completely
rooted in your flesh. Wow.

172
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,870
Brain has nothing to do with that
thought. Made me say it and then my body,

173
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,340
hold on. Hello?

174
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,250
Oh, hi. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one second.

175
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,350
Is Your wife here

176
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,100
Robert? Yeah. I can't believe you're
still there. What are you doing there?

177
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,980
What do you mean you were
supposed to be home an hour ago

178
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,880
in the studio. We were
on the, I don't care.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,850
What do you mean you were
supposed to be home an hour ago.

180
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,530
I reminded you this morning. I
reminded you last night. I was pissed.

181
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,540
Not Important to you.
There's not such a big deal.

182
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,740
I'll be back and actually this just a
supplement example of what we've been

183
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:11,430
talking about. No, Robert's having
a fight with his wife, Tamar,

184
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:14,930
and while he's fighting inside his body,
his stomach is clenching his hardest.

185
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,720
Palpitating. Hers is doing the same thing.

186
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,490
Their brains are picking up these
signals. I'm thinking anger, feel angry.

187
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,590
Look at people who were just as important
as your WIC and you plan on screwed it

188
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:28,860
up. How did they screw it up? How
did I screw up [inaudible] job? No.

189
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:29,461
At a certain point,

190
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,420
Robert will probably realize he
has screwed up and just get home.

191
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,780
He'll apologize. I'll see if I get
home in 20 minutes. I'm really sorry.

192
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,700
I know this is horrible. Is Everything
okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just a sec.

193
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,950
Sorry. Okay. He'd be like, no.

194
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,780
When it comes to brains and
bodies and men and women,

195
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:50,070
the interesting thing is that when a man
and woman fight these systems in their

196
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,200
body, the heart palpitating,
the stomach clenching,

197
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,010
while these systems do turn on at

198
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,850
the same speed and it takes like two
seconds according to Robert Spolsky where

199
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,900
there's an interesting gender difference
is how long it takes to turn off the

200
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,130
system and ladies, sorry.

201
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,480
In advance and in general it turns
off more slowly in women than in men,

202
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,810
which may explain something that
happens to couples all the time. Okay.

203
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,280
I'm really sorry this
isn't right. I know. Oh,

204
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,150
I'm really sorry and like here we are.

205
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,730
Maybe like maybe at later we'll go
do something or I'm really sorry.

206
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,940
Robert Stomach is relaxing.
This was really stupid. I know.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,690
His heart is slowing versed where
he thinks the fight might be over.

208
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,523
Okay,

209
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,310
but you know this is something you
do all the time. We're going to be,

210
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,060
we're having a dinner right after we got
engaged and we went to the restaurant

211
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,520
and I was waiting for you and I've
made the reservation and that was

212
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,640
for like 45 minutes. You didn't even call.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,400
Did you hear what just happened there?

214
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,100
It's this William James stuff coming
back to haunt us a century later.

215
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,580
Topolsky says sometimes the
body actually tricks the brain.

216
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,270
Tamper knows the fight is over
mentally, but her body's still tense.

217
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,690
Her heart is still racing and
her brain thinks, Whoa, wait,

218
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,000
if my heart is still racing and I
consciously know that this issue has been

219
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:09,834
resolved,

220
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,190
it must be because I'm still pissed off
about that thing that happened in the

221
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,100
Carter Administration. Minimize
every day we made it goes for you.

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,750
The brain fills a vacuum. You
have a list, you have a list.

223
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,250
I do. I have a long list. Know How
often you do this sort of thing.

224
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,030
I do it like one. I can tell them
it's your, the babysitter calls.

225
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,380
I'm going to be out of town and says,
should I make dinner for Robert?

226
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,270
Because quickly you can't make
dinner for yourself and the kids. No,

227
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,980
I do make dinner. I haven't made much
of the anything Tito's. Last week,

228
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:41,130
Wednesday I made the baked
potatoes. That's just applying heat.

229
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,500
I want to thank my wife,

230
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,010
Tamer Lewin for what I think was a
pretty startling lead that really,

231
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,430
I mean I show performance,

232
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,740
which I don't know how she did that
because it's so unlike our rest of our

233
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,900
marriage. You know,
this story, by the way,

234
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:07,430
came from Robert Sapolsky and
he tells it about his wife too,

235
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:10,400
but they're not reporters. They're
scientists, so they do it differently.

236
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,260
My wife's in the same business as me,

237
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,100
so the very words we will
say to each other is, honey,

238
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,490
don't forget what the half life is
on the autonomic nervous system.

239
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,310
Then suddenly it's all over with.

240
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,310
That's such a rare exchange
between two people. You know?

241
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,660
I know we're just sentimental.

242
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:32,350
By the way, Robert Spolsky's
latest book is called Monkey Love,

243
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,890
which is where that
wife anecdote came from.

244
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,060
Speaking of brains and bodies,

245
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,880
let's put the science on pause for a
moment and take a brief detour because

246
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,660
often what gets you into these ideas
like take this kid. For example,

247
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,760
Christopher seals go to the Blake
high school isn't the science.

248
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,170
It's more basic than that.

249
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,150
It seems something disgusting
and not being able to look away.

250
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,820
You really just can't believe
that if something feels like this,

251
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,310
it actually came out of a real person
who just don't get the feeling.

252
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,960
When we bumped into Christopher, he was
gingerly holding a pair of human lungs,

253
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,850
but it is a real person,

254
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,600
but you just can't really associate it
with a real person because it's there in

255
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,360
front of you and it doesn't look like
a real person in case. That sense of,

256
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,460
whoa. That's why we originally went to
the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in

257
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:26,000
Washington d c but here's
what happened. Our tour guide.

258
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,860
Okay. Steven S. T. E. V. E. N.
Solomon, s. O. L. O. M. O. N. He showed

259
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,010
us a particular photo
that got us thinking.

260
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,540
So famous photo in our
archives. It's called field day.

261
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,260
It's a civil war photo
hanging in a sign gallery.

262
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,680
It's a picture of legs,

263
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,000
Heil of amputated legs, a
huge heap of severed legs,

264
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,290
some feet thrown sort of
haphazardly into a pile.

265
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,330
Wow. It's oddly beautiful in a way.

266
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,540
Drusen Skousen at the next time.

267
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,150
Immediately after was what
was happening at that moment.

268
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,400
Right to one side of the picture frame.

269
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:07,860
Must've been an operating
table and on the table,

270
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,100
soldier inhaling chloroform and at the
foot of the table must've been a doctor

271
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,303
signing away.

272
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,390
A circular amputation involve cutting
straight through the skin to the bone of

273
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:19,821
flap.

274
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:24,170
Amputation required the tissue to be
cut leaving two flaps of skin that were

275
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:29,171
used to create a stump and in fact
your typical army surgeon was basically

276
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,230
graded on how quickly they
could do an amputation.

277
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,820
That was one of the first orders where
you really had doctors being aggressive

278
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,700
in terms of taking off limbs. Like
I said, that photo got us thinking,

279
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:44,360
so we went back to Jonah Lehrer who has
written but a very ghostly side effect

280
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:48,200
that pops up during the civil war
as a direct result of all of that,

281
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,670
taking off of limbs, this,

282
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:54,671
this one astonishing syndrome that these
men who have had their limbs taken off,

283
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,740
they describe very,

284
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:02,000
very often this a very common thing
that they still feel their phantom limbs

285
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,080
[inaudible]

286
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,500
they say, they say, yeah, they say,
doctor, I, I still feel it. Move.

287
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:11,220
They can feel it hurt. Give you that.
Sometimes get hot, sometimes very cold.

288
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,410
Imagine you're a civil war
doctor and you hear this.

289
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,840
You don't even know what germs
are yet, but one guy, Dr Silas,

290
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,180
where Mitchell decides he's
going to get to the bottom of it,

291
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,580
the first thing he did was he
wrote some clinical reports.

292
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,110
Only about 5% of the men who have suffered
amputation never have any feeling of

293
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:30,380
the part as being still present and
circulated them around the hospital.

294
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,870
While the remainder seems to
retain a sense of its existence,

295
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:37,550
so vivid as to be more definite and
intrusive than it is of the truly living

296
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,384
fellow member,

297
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,790
the stump is liable to the most horrible
neurologists and to a certain curious

298
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,440
spasmodic paralysis.

299
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,150
No one could make sense of this.
Even our Guy William James,

300
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,170
even he looks into it,

301
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,500
he did a very authoritative study where
he sent out questionnaires to all these

302
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,140
amputee victims and wanting to
know about their lost limbs.

303
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:01,140
He has to all of these civil war
amputees, all these questions,

304
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,100
does your phantom limb hurt? Can you
move it if you really concentrate?

305
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,480
And what he found was that there were
no patterns, no stereotypical lost limb.

306
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,420
Every, every experience was
different. In other words,

307
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,950
phantom limbs are like
real limbs. They're yours.

308
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Well, on this topic of Phantom limbs,

309
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,490
there is a guy who has figured at least
something out about this phenomenon.

310
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,420
Dr v S Rama Shondra. I
am a v S Ramachandra. I
remember him. I remember him.

311
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,950
He's a well known neurologist.

312
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,860
He works in California at the
University of California, San Diego.

313
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,880
And one day he says,

314
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,390
a patient showed up in his office and
it seems that the guy had had his arm

315
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,490
amputated. It was his left arm.

316
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,770
And then ever since this man had an
uncanny feeling that he still had an arm

317
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,180
where his real arm used to be. Yes,

318
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,970
it's important to emphasize
this is not a delusion.

319
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,440
He doesn't think he has an arm. He
knows he doesn't. He's not crazy,

320
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,640
but he vividly feels its presence.
And the rough part was that this arm,

321
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,880
it hurt. This sometimes happens
to people with phantom limbs.

322
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,860
He would have days where his phantom
arm would seize up in pain. Doctor,

323
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:13,300
it hurts me really badly. Goes
into this painful clenching spasm.

324
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,570
The nails dig into my palm.

325
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,180
So he has a phantom hand at the
end of his phantom limb. Yes,

326
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,360
and he'll say things like,

327
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,130
it's going into a cramp with the nails
digging into the phantom palm and it's

328
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,910
excruciatingly painful, but there
are no nails. There is no no problem.

329
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,920
And weirdest of all, the patient
couldn't do anything about it.

330
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,921
He try to unclench his phantom nails
from his phantom palm to make the pain

331
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:40,470
stop, but he couldn't. He said,
I cannot move the fountain.

332
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,770
The fandom I'm wouldn't obey.
I cannot volitionally move it.

333
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,420
And I started thinking to myself,

334
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,430
what does he mean when he says he cannot
move his phantom limb like an oxymoron?

335
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,633
There is no arm there.

336
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,360
Drew Ramachandran was
confused what's going on. He,

337
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,590
he checked with the patient and discovered
that 11 years earlier before the

338
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:01,341
amputation,

339
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:06,341
he'd had an injury to his spine and after
that his real left arm was paralyzed.

340
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:11,120
He could not move it. He tried his
brain would issue the commands.

341
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:12,590
His brain was saying move the arm,

342
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,280
but he was getting visual feedback and
indeed feedback from his muscles saying,

343
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,230
nope, move the arm. No move.
No. And this went on for months,

344
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,490
move. No, so maybe the Dr Rameshchandra,

345
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,580
maybe this patient got so frustrated
trying to move his real arm that at some

346
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:33,870
point after a few months or a year,
the paralysis got learnt by the brain,

347
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,410
snapped into the circuitry of
the brain. No, I call it learned,

348
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,590
learned paralysis. So even
when they cut the patients,

349
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,750
I'm off a year after the accident,

350
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,580
he still didn't get any relief
because the problem wasn't in his arm.

351
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,160
It was learned paralysis.
It was in his head. Now,

352
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,780
and that is when
Ramachandra thought, well,

353
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,840
maybe the solution here is to trick this
man's brain to unparalyzed to get his

354
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,590
cells to think, well,

355
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,260
actually we can move an on
the patio trick a brain.

356
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,080
How would you do that? How would
you do that? How would you do that?

357
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,120
How would you do that?
Indeed he thought for a bit.

358
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,600
Then I hit on this way using a mirror
property inside a cardboard box,

359
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,310
a mirror mirror prompt
inside a cardboard box,

360
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,450
a mirror pro parked inside a car.
I mean, I got a box cropped up. Oh,

361
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,780
it was kind of a home
depot solution. Really.

362
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,740
[inaudible] took a long and skinny mirror.
The kind you'd hang on a closet door,

363
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,780
right? Any propped it up, using a
cardboard box and then turned it sideways.

364
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,320
Place the side right in front of
the patient like right on his nose.

365
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,690
So he couldn't see himself. No,

366
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,240
couldn't see anything in the mirror
yet unless he hooked his neck around.

367
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,550
Took a pee. Oh, otherwise he's just
looking at the side. Ramesh Arjun says,

368
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,700
I want you to imagine
this with me. Jeff says,

369
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,080
I want you to take your good
on your [inaudible] arm. Okay?

370
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,990
And stick it out in front of
the mirror. So do that. Okay,

371
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,180
now make it do what the phantom arm
does. Pick your good arm. Make it stiff.

372
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,950
Curl your hand into a fist. Dig Your
fingernails into your palm, deeply.

373
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,240
Make it hurt. You're doing that. It's
kind of hurting. Now when I tell you,

374
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,390
Cook your head so that you can look
into the mirror and on your left,

375
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:18,380
just where the phantom ought to be. Let's
pretend that that's your phantom arm.

376
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,080
It's cramped. It's curled
exactly as you'd imagine it.

377
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,890
So now look in the mirror,
okay. And there's your arm.

378
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:27,860
You see it there in nearer
your phantom arm. Got It.

379
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,490
Now very slowly keeping
your eye on the mirror.

380
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:35,660
Now I want you to
[inaudible] curl your hand.

381
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,040
Patient says, okay, he
opens his real hand, my God.

382
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,370
And of course it looks like his phantom
is opening. That's not surprising.

383
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,670
He's got to do the mirror there.
But he says, my God, doctor,

384
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,760
you're not going to believe this.
The movements have all come back.

385
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,600
All these movements in
my fingers, in my elbow,

386
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:57,160
in my wrist from 11 years ago,
come flooding into my mind.

387
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:02,310
So is his pretend nails are now
ungripping from his pretend palm.

388
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:05,520
And the whole problem of the
pretend pain goes away, goes away.

389
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,940
That's what he said. For how long? By
the way, till the middle was in place.

390
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,290
But when Dr Ramachandran took away
the mirrors, the pain came back.

391
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,940
I said, fine salary, you
know, and then I said, look,

392
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:25,650
why don't you practice with the mirror
for the few weeks, every day for an hour?

393
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,810
Then maybe if you do it repeatedly,
you can unlearn the learned pain.

394
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,490
So this guy goes home, I got him. You
give him a mirror to take home? Correct.

395
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And you don't know if it was took $2 take
it with you. So he takes it with him.

396
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,570
He was delighted. And then
after about another week,

397
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,710
he phones me and he sounds all
agitated on the phone and I said,

398
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:49,670
what's going on? So talk, you're not
going to believe this. It's gone. I said,

399
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,430
what's going on? I thought maybe the
mirror was gone. He said, no, no,

400
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,890
not the mirror. The friend
Tom has gone, gone, gone, go.

401
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,180
That's what I said. Gone. Done. What
do you mean fandom is going? You do it.

402
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,580
Well, this phantom arm I been having
for the last 11 years is disappeared.

403
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,710
What am I, my initial reaction
was alarm. I said, my God,

404
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,240
does this bother you that if you said no,

405
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,960
you know this has happened three days
ago and in the last three days you

406
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:16,910
remember the excruciating elbow pain and
wrist pain? I got several times a day,

407
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,700
but I don't have them any more
because I don't have an arm.

408
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,690
Okay.

409
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,120
But my fingers,

410
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:25,670
okay.

411
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,180
They have not disappeared and they're
still up here dangling near my shoulder.

412
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,350
They're still painful. You
mean just disconnected?
Disembodied fingerlings yeah,

413
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,800
finger looks dangling from the
shoulder. What does that mean?

414
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,670
This guy saying that he seems to have
fingertips hanging on his shoulder.

415
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,820
He said you a mirror doesn't work anymore,

416
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,030
so can you redesign it and push it
prophet near my nose so I can look at the

417
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,550
reflection and maybe get,
get rid of the fingers.

418
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,130
So he now wants to get Dr
Ramachandra in to prop up the mirror,

419
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,790
point them at these phantom fingertips
and have the mirror erase the fingertip.

420
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,100
You thought I was a magician
and I could, you know,

421
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,320
eliminate his different
body parts in sequence.

422
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,160
And this is amputation
by mirror? Yeah, it's,

423
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,660
as I tell my medical
colleagues jokingly, I say,

424
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:20,040
this is the first example in the history
of medicine of a successful amputation

425
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:22,680
of a phantom limb, so don't
leave me hanging here.

426
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,250
Did the phantom fingers
eventually dissolve? Nope.

427
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:31,020
We still haven't been able to devise a
technique to get them and it turns out

428
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,730
that the pain, they're subsided a bit,

429
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,680
so he's not that worried
about us getting rid of him.

430
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:40,120
So somewhere in California there's
still a guy walking around with a sense,

431
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,740
fingers on his shoulder. Yeah. Are

which is not only weird.

433
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:49,620
It suggests that there's an awful lot
to know about how brains and bodies

434
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:51,810
interact. Many things to learn,

435
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:55,080

a brief tour of human consciousness,

which is where you can find out all
about the mirror experiment. Next up.

442
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,890
Let's scale it up a bit.

We're going to go from lost limbs
