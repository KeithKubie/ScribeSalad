00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.990
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. So today we are

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.000
getting ready for the Iron Bowl. We're at Jordan-Hare Stadium before anybody else is here

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.010
and we are going to practice with the Eagles. For every

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
Auburn game the eagle flies around and hits the field and everybody screams War Eagle, which is

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.040
pretty awesome, except that I'm an Alabama fan. 
But anyway, we're gonna

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.090
partner together on this academic endeavour and see what we can learn. Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.130
[music]

00:00:30.150 --> 00:01:02.500
      

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310
Alright, so we are here on the field

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.320
at Jordan-Hare Stadium with Marianne Hudson, 
and she is in charge

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.340
of Spirit and Nova, and she's gonna show us what she does before the game

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.360
and during the game.
-That's right, we practice with these birds almost every day

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.390
here in the stadium so, a lot of folks don't realise that we spend a lot of time here in Jordan-Hare Stadium

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.400
so the birds are used to getting fed here. 
This is where they get their breakfast

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.420
almost every morning. So on game day, we bring the birds out here

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.440
the only difference is, there are 87000 people watching us, but for the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.450
birds, it's just routine.
(Destin) OK, so for the Ironbowl this is the dinner plate?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.460
-That's right. What the bird knows is that every time he touches this lure he gets fed.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.470
The other side again gives the date and the competitors,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.490
and so when the bird touches this lure, he gets some food.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.510
(Destin) So where do we put it? Do you put it out there and.. just drag it across?
-That's right. What we do is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.550
the bird looks for us, and he knows that either myself or my partner Roy

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.590
is gonna have this in our hands, and when he touches it he gets the food reward so

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.620
he's looking for us, and he's waiting for us to produce this, and we usually try to drop it

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.350
near the 50, cause that is our tradition.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.730
[music]

00:02:10.750 --> 00:03:59.510
                        

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.320
OK one question I've alwas had is 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.330
what happens if the eagle just decides to leave the stadium? I mean that could happen right? They're

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.370
animals, they get to make their own mind up. Well, the people here at Auburn University

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.400
have thought about that. So what do you have here?
-Every time we fly any of our birds

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.420
free, whether it's the smallest owl or the largest eagle, we clip

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.440
a telemetry unit to them. It's a tracking device. We have a receiver

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.480
that reads the signal from the transmitter when it's turned on.
(Destin) What's he got here?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.510
(Destin) So that's it huh?
-And we have a seat for that transmitter permenantly

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.520
glued to the eagle's tail.
(Male) There's the tail mount.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.540
Little clips.. in there.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.570
Secured, it's good to fly.
(Destin) And can the bird even tell that it has the transmitter on?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.590
Nope. It's very light weight. He doesn't know it's there. It's out of the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.610
way in case he were to escape, and he wouldn't be tangled in anything.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.630
(Destin) It's actually in the slipstream too so there's not a lot of drag in that position aerodynamically.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.680
That's right so it just blends in with everything else, his general aerodynamic shape

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.695
and doesn't hinder him at all. 

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:01.710
So now you know how to track your pet eagle.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.730
Alright I'm here with Clay. We're in Jordan-Hare Stadium before the game. You can

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.760
see they're painting the lines for the Ironbowl. Check it out.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.790
They're not the only people that have to get ready for the Ironbowl. Aah the bird..

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.810
The eagle slapped me.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.850
I've been slapped several times by this eagle because I'm wearing

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.850
crimson and it doesn't like it. Roll tide.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.860
-War eagle. 
Whatever. 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.870
I think if you really asked me about it, legitimately

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.880
that the tiger is our mascot, but we have

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.890
now obviously the golden eagle, which you know

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.910
it sends our team to victory, it's our rally cry. 
(Destin) I'm just gonna be honest with you

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.930
it makes no sense to me to carry an eagle around with a tiger on top of it.
60
00:05:45,950 --&gt; 00:05:45,930
That doesn't make sense man. 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.970
It's aah it worked all last season [laughs]

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.570
Bald eagle through the legs. 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.050
We tried to investigate how to get an elephant to fly around our stadium before the games but we couldn't get the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.090
jet engines.. operation dumbo drop yeah.. 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.110
we couldn't get Bear Bryant to figure it out for us.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.140
Did your eagle just slap me?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Yeah you came to talk about Alabama.. in his stadium.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.170
And you're wearing crimson.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.180
