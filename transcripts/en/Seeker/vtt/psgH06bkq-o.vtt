00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.610
Hi there!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.980
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I wanted to address that kid question

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.930
all parents dread: Where do babies come from?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.200
Well, I don’t HAVE to answer to that as
I’m neither a parent or a biologist, but

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.220
I CAN answer where baby PLANETS come from.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.780
Planetary formation theories kind of make
logical sense.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.730
Starting with a nebula, containing hydrogen
and dust, a clump may form in this stellar

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.360
nursery that undergoes gravitational collapse.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.059
Our sun was spawned inside such a cloud, around
4.6 billion years ago, forcing a chain reaction

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.660
that sparked fusion, forming the solar core.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.420
While our young sun violently burned, pulling
in more and more material as it bulked up,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.390
a dusty disk became compressed, spinning about
the young star’s axis of rotation.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.070
As time went on, this disk -- known as a proto-planetary
disk -- cooled and small dust grains started

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.090
to clump together.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.180
Over hundreds of millions of years, these
dusty clumps became bigger and bigger, exerting

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.439
their growing gravitational pull attracting
even more dust.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.571
These clumps attached to more clumps, forming
small rocky objects called asteroids.

00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:13.810
Asteroids collided, clumped and grew and eventually
formed protoplanets -- otherwise known as

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.009
baby planets!

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.040
These protoplanets kept growing, eventually
settling into their current stable orbits

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.760
as the solar system’s planets.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.880
So, Earth started out as part of a spinning
disk, then a clump of dust, then a bigger

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.710
clump of rocks, followed by a protoplanet
and finally the planet we know and love today.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.299
This is all well and good in theory, but it
has been hard for astronomers to observe these

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.159
processes around other young stars.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.229
But that was until the European Southern Observatory’s
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array,

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.220
also known as ALMA, spied the protoplanetary
disk surrounding the star “HL Tauri” in

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.220
2014.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.310
At the time this image was called “revolutionary”
by astronomers as it was the clearest view

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.060
yet of tracks or gaps carved out by baby planets
around a VERY young star only one million

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.119
years old.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.220
But these gaps didn’t necessarily prove
they were formed by unseen protoplanets; it

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.520
was only indirect evidence of them gravitationally
vacuuming up the dusty debris.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.030
So there is a chance these tracks could just
be empty regions.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.670
But if they aren’t empty regions, this would
mean it was the first evidence of a young

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.510
star birthing baby planets.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.160
Now, astronomers using the Very Large Array
(VLA) in New Mexico, have viewed the same

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.510
star at longer radio wavelengths and has directly
seen material clumping inside one of those

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.510
gaps.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.819
And they’ve estimated that the clump, composed
of 1 centimeter wide grains, weighs in at

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.610
between 3 to 8 times the mass of Earth, which
gives us a hint at how big the future planet

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.870
might be.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.130
That fuzzy blob is basically the gravitational
agglomeration of small pebbles getting corralled

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.610
to form larger and larger clumps that will
go on to form a planet.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.920
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is where baby
planets come from!

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.700
There is, however, some weirdness.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.680
In another study published earlier this month,
dying stars may ALSO be able to give birth

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.900
to planets.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.150
Yeah, dying stars... giving birth to planets
[pause]

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.500
Using the ESO’s Very Large Telescope Interferometer
(or VLTI), also located in the Atacama Desert

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.560
in Chile, a dusty disk produced by a sun-like
star was also imaged.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.750
However, this is no young star -- it is a
dying star that has run out of fuel and puffed

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.739
up into a red giant and is sporting a protoplanetary-like
disk.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.470
Yep, it looks like even dying stars could
produce baby planets like their young star

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.470
cousins.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.060
