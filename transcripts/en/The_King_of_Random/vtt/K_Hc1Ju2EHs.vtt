00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop, where today we're going to be building ourselves a Batman style grappling gun

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.960
ooh nice

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.580
NO NATE!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.080
Phew!

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.580
He's ok

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.260
Nice logo :)

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
retracting abilities to something built by a billionaire bat would have

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.500
but it's a lot easier to make and it's still a lot of fun to play with.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
The supplies are low cost and easy to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.980
Get your hands on and there's a good chance you already have most of them lying around somewhere

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.980
We've got some electrical tape, a ballpoint pen, an old marker, two pencils, a clothespin,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.700
Two wide thickness rubber bands, three paper clips, and a box of dental floss.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.300
Along with our electrical tape, we've also got a hot glue gun that we'll use for some of our attachments.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.980
First, let's take our two pencils and secure them together using our tape

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.540
Ooh tape!

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.000
it's nice and tape-ey

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.680
Snip

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.850
Next let's grab our box of dental floss

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.089
And we're going to want to attach our pencils on to the bottom of that

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.839
We're using the bottom partly because we want to be able to open our floss later

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.400
but also because these boxes tend to have a curved top which is a lot harder to stably attach something to

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.900
yay glue

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.540
Glue Glue Glue

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.320
While adding the tape

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.770
I want to make sure that none of it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.560
Overlaps with the lid of our container because we do still want to be able to open and close it whenever we need

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.189
It feels pretty securely attached. Let's move on to the next step and to do that, let's grab our marker

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.850
So we need an empty plastic tube, and we're gonna take that

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.779
From the front part of the marker and then we want the back part of the marker

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.258
Where it attaches onto the lid the way I've got it right now

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.898
We don't need any of the writing nib and there's a little bit of plastic housing down inside the tube right here

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.600
So let's cut this off right about here and then we'll cut the rest of the marker tube approximately in half

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.559
We don't need the whole cap. We only need about one centimeter of it. So let's mark that spot as well

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.869
Now let's cut along these lines

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.000
We can use either a razor blade or a hacksaw or something like that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.458
Before I start cutting into that, I am just gonna try and pull the nib out here

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.169
We've still got a cartridge full of ink inside this too, which I'm just gonna end up cutting right through

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.040
That's alright

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.620
Saw ( ( i n c r e a s e ) )

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.000
See it stained my saw blade orange

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
There's the ink cartridge inside for a pen and marker

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.240
And now we just need to cut off the end of our cap

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.340
(more sawing)

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.180
We've now got a hollow tube that we can see right through

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.079
We have another piece of tube with the end still on it, which clips nicely into the end piece of our marker cap

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.940
Let's set these two pieces aside for a moment and move on to this piece

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.860
So this is going to be a sort of guiding barrel for our projectile, which is going to be our grappling hook.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.980
These markers have some little ridges down inside them that help keep that tube of ink in just the right spot

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.100
We're going to use those ridges to help guide our grappling hook to right where we want it to go

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.059
so if we look closely we can see that the ridges come all the way to the front on one side and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.969
Don't quite reach the back on the other side. We want the front ridges at the very front of our projectile gun

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.720
once again

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.910
Let's start by using a tiny bit of our hot glue to attach this tube onto the front of this gun

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.700
And then we'll go over it with tape to really secure it in place

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.380
The body of our little grappling hook launcher is starting to take shape at this point

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.360
Let's take a close pin and add it onto the back of the pencils as a firing mechanism

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.740
Our little gun doesn't have any power yet

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.960
And that's what we're gonna be using our rubber bands for

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.080
Let's just cut one of our rubber bands in half to start with

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.359
Those rubber bands are going to be attached onto the side of this front barrel

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.920
But we can see that if we use the whole rubber band

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580
There's not a lot of power when we pull it back into the clothespin.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.380
that's barely enough to move it at all

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.920
So we want to tighten this up and we won't use the whole rubber band

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.080
We'll pull it tight until we only have a very small loop just big enough to fit our finger in behind the marker

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.339
trim off our excess rubber band here at the front

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.489
And now we want to use a small dab of hot glue and then plenty of tape to hold just the front of this rubber band

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.280
in place

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.660
We don't want to secure the rubber band all along the whole pen body, or there won't be enough elasticity to reach the clothespin

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.849
The two rubber bands really have a lot more strength and resistance to them than the one

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.340
Most of the gun body is built. So it's time to start making the grappling hook itself

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.980
Let's grab our pen and three paper clips.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.280
For this grappling hook we're not going to need most of the internal bits of our pen. Let's take those apart

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.900
We can leave the back cap in as just the front of our grappling hook

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.240
Mostly, we're just trying to get the tube body of the pen

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.700
but let's set it aside because we are also going to want the small plastic collar that the ink cartridge fits into

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.169
We now need to bend our three paper clips into a hook shape and attach them onto our pen

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:05.749
Start by taking about the bottom quarter of our paper clip and getting a slight angle into it

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.029
You can see that once we attach that onto the pen it will angle away from the pen body and now we need to add

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.020
A second Bend to make it more of a hook

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
Let's Bend our other two paper clips into the same shape as this one

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.140
Our three paper clips are bent into hook shape, so now we need to attach them onto the back of the pen

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.400
Let's use a little bit of hot glue and then some tape to secure them in place

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.100
ooh paperclips

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.840
With our three paperclips attached our grappling hook is mostly ready to be used

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.209
If it doesn't look like you've got quite enough angle into the hooks

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.750
You can still bend them a little bit farther so that they'll grab onto things a little better

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.589
Now because our grappling hook isn't going to be much good unless we can pull it back to us

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.479
Let's pull out a length of the floss that we've got and attach that onto the back of our hook

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.788
it's hard to know exactly how much we'll need but

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.050
Let's pull out plenty

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.300
Plus, it's just fun to pull off floss.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.100
That should do it. To attach our floss

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.600
We're gonna be using that little color that we took off of the ink cartridge and we're going to attach that into the back part of the grappling hook

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:13.440
First, let's feed our dental floss in through the front of that collar and out the side and now with that piece

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.880
Extended sideways we can fit this into the bottom of our hook and it should hold it nicely in place

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.220
We can also trim off the extra floss

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.920
*Snatch*

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.060
Grappling hooked!

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.460
We can now test fire our grappling hook to see what kind of distance we're getting off of it

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.240
Let's pull our rubber bands back into the jaws of our clothespin

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.839
And then load the grappling hook in through that tube. It will pull the dental-floss string after it, which is just what we want it to do

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.528
Now by pressing down on the clothes pin our grappling hook should fire

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.389
Well, looks like after it fired we got to about here with our dental floss, let's add another

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.419
18 inches or so and trim it right there

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.829
Now we don't just want all of this dental floss just

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.199
flying around as we're using our gun and that's what we're gonna use this other piece of marker for this is going to be a

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.960
spool

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.859
That we can wrap the dental floss around when we're carrying our grappling hook and then when we fire the grappling hook it will all

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.409
unravel quickly trailing behind our grappling hook

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.929
Let's use a hot glue gun to attach the cap portion of our spool onto the body of our dental floss container

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.980
This is a pretty smooth surface, so be sure our glue sticks, let's rough that up using our exacto knife

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.920
scritch scritch

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.860
With the glue cooled we should be able to pop the body of our marker right off of the cap

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.610
This is how we can temporarily attach our floss onto our spool mechanism

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:45.709
Let's just take the end of the piece of floss

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:50.599
Lay it across the cap. And then press the body of our spool down into the cap

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.169
This is what will hold it in place

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:57.738
But we also want to wind all of our floss around the spool and it's going to be easier to do that before we attach it

00:07:57.739 --> 00:08:01.609
To the cap. Let's take this off and making sure that we leave an inch or two in the back

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:07.399
Let's begin winding our floss all the way around our marker spool until our grappling hook is on a short leash

00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:11.688
Just as a quick test we can see that if we just pull this dental floss

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:16.248
It comes off a spool very easily and now we can just take that piece of floss

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:19.219
And once again have it cross over the cap

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:22.549
And then press our spool down into it and it should be held nicely in place

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:28.968
now if we load up our gun by pulling back the rubber band into the jaws of the clothespin we can fit our

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:33.888
Grappling hook down the barrel and we can see that our floss tether isn't just hanging everywhere

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:36.948
It's well attached to our spool and when we fire it

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.140
It comes off  nicely.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.660
After we fire the grappling hook we can wrap the floss back up and it's ready to go for another shot

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.339
Our little grappling-hook is working pretty well, but I don't think it's quite the style of something Batman would use

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:59.229
so
Let's see if we can take a little bit of paint and tape and make this into something that Batman will be proud to hang

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.230
on his utility belt

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.650
