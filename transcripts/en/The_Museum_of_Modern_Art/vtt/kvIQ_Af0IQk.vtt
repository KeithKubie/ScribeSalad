Hello, everyone. My name is Dave Kehr.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.280
I am a curator here in the Department of Film
at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.680
You may have seen me in some of the
"How To See" videos.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.360
"The tidal wave! It's coming!"

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.060
Talking about the economy of B-movies,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.800
the survival of Westerns into the 21st century,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.140
or how to preserve silent films.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.760
You've sent us a lot of good questions on
those videos

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.760
so we thought it was time to do a Live Q&amp;A
on MoMA's YouTube channel

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.260
and get you some answers.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.500
You might ask questions like:

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.680
"What does a film curator do all day?"

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.820

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.780
"Wow. Can someone restore the Méliès films?"

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.220
Actually our friends in the Cinémathèque Française are working on that right now.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.800
The Superhero/Comic genre.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.780
"Do you agree with someone like Spielberg who says it'll eventually go the way of the Western?"

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.520
So please leave some questions for us in the comments section below.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.293
And make sure to tune in on Wednesday, July 25

00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:58.860
at 3:00 p.m. New York time

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.760
and we'll answer those questions and other questions that you submit during the live-stream.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
In the meantime, please have a look at some
of the other videos we've made here at the Museum.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.200
You can see some here.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.960
And here.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.980
And be sure to subscribe to MoMA's YouTube
channel, so we can send you a notification

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.439
when we go live on Wednesday, July 25.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.610
Thanks, and see you then.
