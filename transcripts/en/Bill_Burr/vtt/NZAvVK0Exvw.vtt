1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.721
All right.
Hey,

2
00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:05.721
what's going on it's Bill Birr and it's time for a special episode of the Monday

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.990
morning podcast.
It's not on Monday.
It's not on Thursday.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.690
It's coming out,
I guess what?
Tuesday,
Wednesday.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.450
We're going to put this out as soon as we can.
I have a special guest here.

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.790
You know I don't do a lot of guests,
so if I bring somebody in,

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
they gotta be a heavy hitter.
They got to be a mover,
a shaker,
a shot caller.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.410
We have the one and only Judd Apatow here.
Pleasure to be here.
John,

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.180
how are you buddy?

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.510
<v 1>I liked the beer.
Usually.
You're all by yourself just talking to the wall.</v>

11
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 0>Yes I am.
And usually you're in the midst of producing,
which fascinates me.</v>

12
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:38.030
I tried to,
uh,
talk to you about this because a,

13
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:39.710
I like to think I'm kind of a busy man too.

14
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:44.210
How you manage to have movies,

15
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:48.350
TV shows,
stand up,
special masterclass,

16
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.690
a documentary on Garry Shandling.

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.630
How they'll fuck manager.

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.080
Keep all like how big is the bolt and the war room?

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.610
<v 1>It's all management technique.
That's what you want to know.</v>

20
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.530
I'll tell you a good management technique.

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.130
The staff of crashing the room right now,

22
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.670
writing the fourth season,
third season comes on in January,

23
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.640
but they writing the fourth season and I'm here with you.

24
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.270
<v 0>Yes,
that's managed.
So,
so how do you check in with that?</v>

25
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.950
How do I check that every day?

26
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.220
Do they send you a draft and you just kind of keep it in bounds of where it

27
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:23.610
needs to be or at season four?
Is it sort of up and running?

28
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.700
<v 1>Well,
usually what it is is Pete and I,
uh,</v>

29
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.430
and also the Judith Miller and Oren who work on the show.

30
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:32.860
We'll kick around a little bit what we think the season might be.

31
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.930
We bring in writers for a month and we just kick it around very openly,

32
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.030
like anything is on the table.

33
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.930
And I'll pop in and out of those meetings and,

34
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.500
and then there's notes and I'll read the notes and then sit in for half a day

35
00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:50.320
and then take a day off and then pop back in.

36
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.650
And usually that gives me some perspective.
Because you've been in those rooms.

37
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.820
There's a lot of Chinese food,
there's a lot of danishes he get tired.

38
00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.930
Launch is huge.

39
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.060
There's a lot of people talking about things that have nothing to do with the

40
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.600
show for very long periods of time.
Uh,

41
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.660
and then at some point I'll sit with Pete and we'll go through everything and

42
00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:12.040
go,
okay,
which ideas do we like?

43
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.540
<v 0>You know,
my favorite thing is,
is the mental break you take in the writer's room,</v>

44
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.880
it's like you're pitching,
you're pitching,
you're pitching,
then you're fried.

45
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.460
And like I always look around the room and I'll just see someone hasn't pitched

46
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.400
him in it and then just sort of staring down at the ground for about 15,

47
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:25.950
20 minutes and then they just come back up the light.
Yeah.
All right.

48
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.300
What if frank did deaf?
If I can,
but you literally you have to do it.

49
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.410
And um,
what I learned on f is for family though,

50
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.440
is I didn't realize how fried you get yes.
In the writer's room.

51
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.800
And like my drinking went off the rails a little bit.
It was one little scotch.

52
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:43.470
And then it just became like three.
So last season.

53
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.880
<v 1>And what time of day though?
Are you having your Scotch in the room?</v>

54
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.780
<v 0>Oh,
not in the room now.
It was when I got home.
When I got home,</v>

55
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.960
I would literally just,
you know,
put on the fireplace,

56
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:54.730
turn it on now cause you don't light a fire anymore.

57
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:59.620
You just turn it on and then I would just sit there like uh,
yeah.

58
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:00.700
And it was getting to that shit.

59
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.480
It was just like I need this at the end of the day.
So in season three,

60
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.380
like I did this thing,

61
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.830
I go not only may not drink and this season I'm actually gonna try to do the

62
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:13.300
impossible,
which is drop weight.
And I was from,
which I did,
oh hi.

63
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.120
I packed a lunch.
Like I was a second grader.

64
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.510
So every day that they would be going out now I had like this keen what being

65
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.330
thing that I would always have.
And then yeah,
just fruit,
nuts,
you know,

66
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:27.030
it would be my,
my snacks or whatever.

67
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.480
<v 1>Cause it's all reward.
You want to reward yourself,
you need to get to work,</v>

68
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:34.920
whatever,
nine,
10 o'clock and all you think all morning is that they get 1230,

69
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.080
the food's going to lay a hand.
Oh yeah,
the food's going to land.

70
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.480
Then we can stop talking about this show and eat this food.

71
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.290
And if everybody voted a place that you fucking hate.
Yeah,
it's just like,

72
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.780
that is the longest day ever.
But if you're going into like,
you know,

73
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:49.470
it's like a Friday and they picked an awesome like lunch place like that can

74
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:51.300
literally,
you pitched better.

75
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.520
But I like that you are not in charge of that because the only area I will throw

76
00:03:56.521 --> 00:04:00.360
my weight around is if they say,
hey,
we're going to eat here today.

77
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.930
I'm very comfortable going,
we are not going there today.

78
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.790
Daddy needs this.

79
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.800
<v 0>No,
there's definitely a,
there's a,
uh,
there's also,</v>

80
00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:14.360
there's a generation gap and that also goes with nutrition,
you know,

81
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:16.850
so there's people like,
my show takes place in the 70s,
so that's,

82
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:19.130
there's people that grew up in the seventh and the other people who were born in

83
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:19.910
the 80s.

84
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.390
So there they're more likely to go to something a little more healthy than the

85
00:04:23.391 --> 00:04:26.930
old sort of John Wayne people in the room.
I'm like,
I'm not eating that shit.

86
00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:28.940
And some days there's a little bit of a mutiny,

87
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.480
but it's not about the writers from here.
I actually,
they sent me,

88
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:33.650
which was really cool.
Thank you.

89
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:37.790
You guys send me a link to the first episode of season three of crashing with

90
00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:41.120
the Great Pete Holmes.
And,
uh,
just once again,
it's like,

91
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.500
like watching that show,
it's like,
I've,
I've lived this,
I've,
I've,

92
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.790
I don't want to give away a what the episode is about,
but I mean,

93
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.990
in generally speaking,

94
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:55.910
it's like Pete has now gotten to the point where he actually has his own place,

95
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.890
<v 1>which is awesome.
And he's mentoring a young man.
Yes.
Yabuki from,
uh,</v>

96
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.210
the daily show was on the daily show.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Who's great at it.

97
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.900
So he finally feels cocky enough to give someone else advice.
Yeah.

98
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.300
<v 0>I have to sit and talk to my keys in the mix.</v>

99
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.180
He's kind of feeling himself a little bit and as always,

100
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.560
this business will humble you.
So he ends up getting humbled in.
It's like,
uh,

101
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.120
just the way the,
the,
uh,
how you,
when he gets humbled,

102
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:26.260
I don't want to say it is the way it's written that uh,

103
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.640
he then lashes out at this person that he kind of smoothed stuff over with.

104
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.870
And that's just like the worst,
especially with a woman.
Then you get that whole,

105
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:37.000
you're enjoying this,
aren't you?
You're enjoying that.
I mean,

106
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.430
I literally had that fight with my wife like two days ago.
Um,

107
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.580
what does she enjoy then?
I lost my temper.
Yeah.
And then,
you know,

108
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.490
and then she gets,
you know,
like,
you know how the deal is,
you know,
with women,

109
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.610
nothing is off bounds.
But like with you,

110
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.770
you have to stay within the lines are all,
she'll never hear the end of it.
So,

111
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.130
you know,
she,
you know,
she was driving the car all over the place,

112
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.140
all over my life.
Let

113
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.470
<v 1>me know who I was.
But you know,
she was right about a lot of it.
And uh,</v>

114
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.490
that's the worst part is that they are right about a lot of it.
No,

115
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.940
but they're all so wrong.
So I did this,
this whole period now where women,
like,

116
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:11.330
they went from nobody listening to them to now everything that they say is spun

117
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.300
with gold is just,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's getting ridiculous.
I was like,

118
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.000
we have to be okay,
let's,
let's,
you know,
women are like,
guys,

119
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.090
a lot of them are just full of Shit,
you know,
as our men.
So,

120
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.350
I mean that's the art of life is trying to figure out who actually has the

121
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.670
information that you need,
which is why when I talked to you how to,

122
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.650
you know,
manage a shell,

123
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.790
you have the goods with everything you've got going on here.
Um,

124
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.150
well sometimes you know,

125
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:40.151
the thing about it is that you do need someone who has the perspective to judge

126
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.380
ideas and how things are going.

127
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.520
So there's a process of generating maybe a thousand ideas for a show,

128
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.150
but if you're burnt out from being part of that generation,

129
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.700
it's hard for you to pick what works.

130
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.320
And so like at girls I was very involved in the writing,

131
00:06:57.321 --> 00:07:00.080
but I wouldn't go to the set because it was so well directed.

132
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.990
There was no reason for me to be there.
The footage always was great.

133
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:07.310
And Lena and January graded monitoring the directors and directing themselves.

134
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.680
At what point did you have confidence to be like,
all right,

135
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:14.430
this thing is cruising?
Well,
I don't think I ever felt like it was,
it was,

136
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.980
it was cruising,
but I had confidence in if the script was good,

137
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.480
they would shoot it great.

138
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.640
And then I could put all my energy into just reading the scripts to give them a,

139
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.560
a person who could tell them if the script's worked,
you know,

140
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:34.190
so they were tired from shooting and writing and they're exhausted and I,

141
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:38.000
I'm able to have a little more energy to just read and go on page four.

142
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:41.220
It's weird.
Why did they say that?
It's not tracking and it's,

143
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.560
that's hard to do when you're in the thick of it and you're exhausted and so

144
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.720
there is a value to,
you know,
picking where you're helpful and where you're like,

145
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.531
you don't need me here.

146
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.070
I don't have to sit and look at over the director's shoulder.
You're nailing it.

147
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.120
Let me save that energy for the writing part.
I hate to admit this,

148
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:01.280
but actually enjoy being in the writer's room.
Oh yeah.

149
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.340
I was like kicking and screaming,
thinking about,
God,
I'm a comedian.
I'm free.

150
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.010
Why the fuck am I going to go back and into some math class or whatever and I

151
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.310
should say this on days where it's working.
Yes,

152
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.790
it's working and it's cruising and we're getting good notes,
you know?
Um,

153
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.660
we always get good notes by me,
positive notes from Netflix,
like we enjoy this,

154
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.780
but then on the days where like this doesn't really,
there's too much of that.

155
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.681
And then we go,

156
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.230
all right and then we try to fix it and then it's just not working.

157
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.750
Those are the days where I feel like I'm back in high school and I'm just,

158
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.900
it's like,
it's the clock broken.
Like what,
what are we doing here?

159
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:32.320
So you're the teacher.
That's the thing,
you know,

160
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.610
when you work on the show and you're not the teacher,

161
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:38.870
like at the Larry Sanders show,
if we did a table read and what's working,

162
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.200
then suddenly there is someone upset with you,
right?

163
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:46.220
And you are ashamed child that at the script and work up and you're,

164
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:48.010
then you're like,
how can I fix it?
And,
and,

165
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.080
and there's almost a daddy or mommy character that you're disappointing if the

166
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:56.280
show isn't working or if the script isn't working.
There's a lot,

167
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.000
a lot of ways for it to be super unhealthy,
but it is more fun.

168
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.510
You're right when you're that person and you can treat people well and you have

169
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.630
your own strong point of view,
it's not as painful.

170
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.400
<v 0>Yeah.
I would say in my room at Mike prices,
he's the captain of the ship.</v>

171
00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:14.600
So I'm the guy that's sorta chimes in and tries to like,
I dunno,
uh,

172
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.530
keep it like certain things tethered to reality if it,

173
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.050
if it starts getting a little too like absurd.
But you know,

174
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.680
you brought up Gary Shandling who like,
you know,

175
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:26.960
anybody who is even remotely in the comedy just,

176
00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:31.750
I mean like guys like on the Mount Rushmore there.
And uh,
I just remember,

177
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:35.240
you know,
I watched,
you know,
you know,
this is the theme,
the gallery show.

178
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.680
I watched this first one.
I watched everything.

179
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:39.260
I used to watch this tonight show sets.
I just always just thought the guy,

180
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.960
he just always,
it was funny when even like when I was in junior junior highs,

181
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.380
like in seventh grade,
I knew that his stuff was just funnier.
That it was like,

182
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.620
this is like a different level.

183
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.110
Like this guy is better than all of these other guys.
And I was wondering what,

184
00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:56.600
like what was that like,
you know,
cause I,
I really,
I sent an email about that.

185
00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:59.250
Like I thought the Garry Shandling documentary that you did was that,

186
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.590
that's my favorite thing you've done.

187
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.580
And I think 40 year old virgin and all this stuff.
But um,

188
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.540
what was that like because you were friends with somebody?
Sure.
Like that.
Um,

189
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.070
you know,
myself,
I've lost a couple of friends and I know that certain things,

190
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.670
it just gets like really emotional what was,

191
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.480
but I never delved into their life.

192
00:10:17.481 --> 00:10:19.760
To the level that you did with,
with Gary,

193
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:24.040
who was like a friend and a mentor to you.
Like what was that process like?
Like,

194
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.820
how long did it take you to,
to,
to,
you know,
cause that was on par with like,

195
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:31.250
did you see that eagles documentary?
I love that.

196
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.240
It was like three hours long and a fellow,
he was 20 minutes.
Yeah.

197
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.370
And it's just like I got through like a cross country flight watching that.

198
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.490
I felt like that Gary Shandling duck was like that.
What was that like?

199
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.500
<v 1>It was like the Eagles Doc.
If,
if Gary,
uh,
wasn't on coke.
Yeah.</v>

200
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.040
Well,
you know,
it's funny cause now that it's over and I've been,
you know,

201
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.960
I finished at six or eight months ago,
something like that.
Looking back,

202
00:10:56.961 --> 00:11:01.250
it's almost like a fever dream that I even did it right.
Because he died.

203
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.550
I was really depressed.

204
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.340
It through me more than I thought because he was a constant presence of support

205
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.350
and I didn't realize what an important beam he was in everything.

206
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.320
And,
and uh,
and I thought,

207
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.150
I think there's just a lesson that he wants to teach everybody.

208
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.570
And I'll tell you a story that it kind of launched the documentary is that I

209
00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:29.540
went to Gary's cremation.
And so Gary's cremation was very,

210
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.030
I mean,
people don't go to cremations.
You're not supposed to go to cremation.

211
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.130
What you sound like sliding the body in.

212
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.630
Well kind of it's Jesus judge basically,
you know,

213
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.120
basically.
Uh,
how did you get the tickets to that?
And I only saw,

214
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.190
I only tell this story because I think it's,
it,

215
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.530
it's is helpful to people in their own lives is that a,
you know,

216
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:58.900
a friend put together a very small service.

217
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:02.660
So if you can imagine there's only like eight people there and you know,

218
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.710
oven basically.
And,

219
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.160
and like for a Buddhist monks,
right?

220
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.790
So he takes the edge off a little bit like that here.
They're not freaking out.

221
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.710
Yeah,
they were fine with it.
That's their whole religion.
Okay.

222
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.820
So we go to this place and it's in the valley and it's not that far from these

223
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.790
offices and it's,
you know,
a crematorium.

224
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.910
Is it part of a strip mall is like ramen noodles.
Get your tax done,

225
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.720
watching your friend get burned.
Even worse.

226
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.920
It's deeper in the valley where it's just next to a place that like,
you know,

227
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.910
makes glass bowls or something send in an industrial area.

228
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.170
So we go there,
it's clear no one's ever had a service in this space.

229
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.100
This isn't what people do,
right?
So there's no like room to do it.

230
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.460
We're literally in like the lobby of a place that looks like a sham business of

231
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:58.090
some someplace,
right?
And like what they're selling in the lobby,

232
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.700
there's literally just like one desk and empty space.

233
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:04.810
And did you make sure it was Gary underneath [inaudible] fucking,

234
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.140
he should have crash test dummy.
Like that'll be 50 grand.

235
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.110
Like what they were selling there.
They had these little,

236
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.970
these little pamphlets where you could take some of the ashes of your beloved

237
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.390
and have them put into like a little glass figurine you could put on your table

238
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:27.000
or like something you would wear.
Medical itself gone,
gone.

239
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.180
So we go,
we go to this,
this place.
And,
uh,

240
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.340
we go into this little room and again,

241
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:38.290
it's like it couldn't be ratty or really,
and the,
they have,

242
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.270
uh,
a service,
uh,

243
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.050
which is very sweet and it's beautiful and,
and,

244
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.090
and moving and all of the ideas of,
of Buddhism and the,
and,
uh,

245
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.520
and then they take us in this room.
Now the room with the crematorium,

246
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.440
it's like the kitchen to a restaurant.

247
00:13:56.441 --> 00:14:01.320
It's just like a big room with a cement floor and like four or five oven,

248
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.020
they did a little service.
They hit some little fucking gongs or something.

249
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:06.440
Like what happened.
Yeah,
they're just,

250
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.530
they did Buddhist prayers and they talked about Carrie's life and,

251
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.570
uh,
and,
and what life is about,
you know,
you,
you know,
you live,
you die,
you,

252
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.930
you learn the lessons that you can,
you try to be as loving and kindness.

253
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.260
You can hopefully you,
uh,
you know,

254
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.560
you grew and it was very sweet.
That actually sounds cool.
Now,

255
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.340
did they believe in a heaven and Hell Buddhist people?
Here's my issue.

256
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.910
Buddhism is as you get deeper and deeper into it,

257
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.810
it had to reincarnation.
I,
I believe,

258
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.970
and I always get lost when things get too magical.
I like something that's clear,

259
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:46.120
like life is about being kind and that's it.
Like that's,

260
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.360
that's as far as I usually can get.
I can see this script writer in you,
things,

261
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.860
you know,
you need it to land
is

262
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.600
magical in any way.
As soon as someone's reborn and it goes to heaven or hell,

263
00:14:56.601 --> 00:15:01.520
I'm,
I've lost,
I have trouble now.
I'm not 100% closed,

264
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.700
but I'm pretty close.
Uh,
but I do,

265
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.730
I can get interested in ideas that are about how can we let go of our egos and

266
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.020
be kind.
That's all I need.
Okay.
So we have the service and it's,

267
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.810
and it's bringing into the other moving and then we go in the other room

268
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.670
and it's literally a table with a cardboard coffin.

269
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.710
And then they say some more prayers.

270
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.160
And then at some point they open up an oven,

271
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.530
which looks like almost like a dishwasher in a restaurant.

272
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.240
And they roll it into flames already going or do they turn it on after they

273
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.150
closed the door?
There's a pilot light and uh,

274
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.890
and then they stick it to,

275
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.540
it's literally not that far from a pizza oven.
Okay.

276
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.680
And you know,
they put,
uh,
the cardboard coffin,

277
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.870
then they close,
close it illness.

278
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:01.220
Like if a dishwasher in a restaurant and then they ask who wants to push the

279
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:04.550
button?
Oh Jesus.
And you know,

280
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.160
they're saying they have a bunch of fake buttons,
like a firing squad.

281
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.530
Like somebody gets flanks and one guy really blows his brains out.

282
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.280
He had no one wants to know who,
who pushed,
you don't want to carry that.

283
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.700
And then a friend of Gary's,
you know,

284
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.200
push the button and then suddenly you hear it fire up,

285
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.401
you know,

286
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:27.401
it's getting hotter than your normal pizza oven and the room gets hot.

287
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:33.050
And then it's like you smell something burning.
Like it's like,

288
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.530
you know,

289
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.790
if it was like a fire at your neighbor's house and suddenly like your chest

290
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:42.380
hurts a little bit,
then you realize it's Gary,
isn't it?

291
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:44.600
There's no vent I guess.

292
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.100
I guess I it maybe it was a place that needed more ventilation.
No,

293
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:51.410
I mean there is a vent.
It's not like overpowering,

294
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:52.940
like the room is all filled with smoke,

295
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:57.941
but you do realize like someday if you go on a fast to get rid of toxins in your

296
00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:02.240
body,
part of that is Garry Shandling.
Exactly.
And that would sadden me.

297
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.380
But,
but that's what was crazy about it.
So now I love Gary so much.

298
00:17:06.381 --> 00:17:11.180
I will never go on a fast after I breathe.
Wow.
So,
so I'm,
you know,

299
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.470
watching this,
crying my eyes out,
just balling.

300
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:18.680
It's as intense as anything I've ever experienced.
This,

301
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.370
it's pretty heavy and I'm feeling it in my chest and I'm aware like that's scary

302
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.480
.
We're breathing in Gary.
And at first,
you know,
part of me,

303
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:30.500
it made me laugh like,
yeah cause this is super creepy dude.
It's creepy.

304
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.560
It's kind of weirdly like the Gary always would make the joke like I'm inside

305
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:39.620
you.
You know,
like there's like a sexual joke to be made there.

306
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.420
And then I just thought,
God,
Gary would find this so funny.

307
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.440
All of us sitting here crying,
watching them cremate his body,

308
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:54.441
he would think that this was fantastic like me here bawling my eyes out.

309
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.010
Gary would look and just go like,
that's right.
That's what it is.

310
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.400
That's what it is.
And,
and I thought in that moment,

311
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.380
this is a lesson like having to look at that will change your life.

312
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:11.100
Having to be at the crematorium about,
you know,
what's important?

313
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.200
What do we care about?
How do we treat people?

314
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.830
What do you want to do with your life?
And I thought,
Gary wanted me here.

315
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:21.470
He wanted me to go through this hell in this freaking,
you know,
oh,

316
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.630
is this part of his like,
no,
he didn't ask for it,

317
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:27.690
but I decided in like a spiritual level.
I thought,
this is it.

318
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.750
Gary wants me to learn every freaking lesson to the point of his incineration.

319
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.890
He wants me to look at in the eye and take from it whatever I can take to be a

320
00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:41.490
better person.
And I think in that moment was,
you know,

321
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.470
the seed of how do I tell other people this lesson?

322
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.580
Because I think in Gary's life he was trying to figure out how to talk about

323
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.331
this stuff.
And you know,

324
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.540
it's very hard in comedy to do it without seeming really corny or weird.

325
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.050
You know,

326
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.950
as soon as people start talking about their spirituality in a sincere way,

327
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.990
we're all like,
shut the fuck up.
And it feels,

328
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.320
you gotta be interviewed by Oprah and she has to bring it out of you and act

329
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.590
like,
well,
she asked me exactly,
only waited.
That's the only cool way to do it.

330
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.950
I mean,
I had so many friends that tried to,
and they always seemed odd.

331
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:11.641
And I think Gary,

332
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:16.170
when he did comedians in cars getting coffee was the first time he found a way

333
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.950
to be really funny,
but talk about some things that he believed in.

334
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.350
And I think that was his goal near the end of his life.

335
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.220
He's trying to figure out how to reinvent how he did stand up and get some of

336
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:29.940
these ideas in and he hadn't quite cracked it.
He was really into silence.

337
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.800
He loved not getting a laugh.

338
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:36.801
He loved putting people through weird silences and he would say to the crowd

339
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.790
that that's where it all is.
It's all in that silence.
Right?

340
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.100
And he didn't have a joke.
He didn't even know what to do with it.

341
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:48.060
He just knew when the room went dead contemplating is what they're doing.

342
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.830
They're contemplating what was just said.

343
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.680
And so what I was working at his memorial service,

344
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.860
I cut together four or five little mini docs about Gary and when I was making

345
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.060
them I thought,
oh yeah,

346
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:03.870
there's a whole movie about Carrie about what he believed in and,

347
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.520
and that's how it started.
It's incredible.
And it just came out on Blu Ray.

348
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.420
There was still have the blue ray players,
you know,
I still have,

349
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.550
I have a DVD VCR player but my TV's too advanced and I can hook it up to that

350
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.180
cell if anybody knows that there's some sort of adapter or some other thing I

351
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:23.670
can do to try to make that work,
I would appreciate it.
But,
uh,

352
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.790
there's a lot of shit cause you know,
I,
I,
you know,

353
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:30.590
finally became a parent so I had to get my affairs in order.
Yeah.
You know,

354
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.970
you know,
it's a guy,
you've got to make sure everybody's going to be okay.

355
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:37.110
You got the will you and I get like to the point like I gave,

356
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.000
I hooked my wife up so much like she has motive.
Like if I die suddenly,

357
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.600
um,
I've had the conversation with my wife and the insurance agent,

358
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:49.300
have you done this conversation yet where you sit with an insurance agent about

359
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:53.950
life insurance?
And he's like,
well,
Judd lifted this age,
you get this.
If he,

360
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.020
if he lives at this age,
you get that and,

361
00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.150
and it's gambling or gambling on me dying and betting against yourself,
like

362
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.210
<v 0>died before you thought I was going to.</v>

363
00:21:02.211 --> 00:21:04.540
Now you've got to give them all this money and my wife wouldn't

364
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:09.740
<v 1>by the extra insurance cause she said,
I feel really weird,
uh,</v>

365
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.470
you know,
having any,
you know,
handicapping your death.

366
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.270
And she was deeply upset at the conversation.

367
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.110
That was like six or seven years ago.
And just the other day she's like,

368
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.870
maybe we should get that insurance.
Yeah,

369
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.530
<v 0>that sort of happens after a,
I,
you know,
I want you to have kids and stuff,</v>

370
00:21:27.531 --> 00:21:31.460
but like,
I,
uh,
you know,
I went with the cremation thing.

371
00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:34.220
I think it's so stupid to stick yourself in the box.

372
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.090
And then the Nike like you that important that there's gotta be like a headset,

373
00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:41.730
I guess is for the living people to have someplace to go.
But,
uh,

374
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.080
I think now just with the world population,
I mean the graveyards at some point,

375
00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:47.180
I mean they,
I don't know if they going to dig deeper.

376
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.670
If you're going to be underneath somebody else.
But,
uh,

377
00:21:49.671 --> 00:21:52.520
I've had a lot of people go,
well,
what if you still feel stuff?

378
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.250
And it's just like,
well then let's get it over with.

379
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.500
Which friend of yours thinks you still feel stuff?
A lot of people are afraid of,

380
00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.700
uh,
of death.
It's just the stuff that,
you know,
something I don't even know.

381
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.230
Cause I,
I,
my short term memory is bad,
but a lot of people say that about like,

382
00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:08.810
you know,
if you get cremated,
what if you still feel stuff?
It's like,
well,

383
00:22:08.811 --> 00:22:11.330
I'd rather just get it over with in a minute.

384
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.330
I guess I die again somehow in that minute.
But,
uh,

385
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.410
rather than laying there waiting for the worms to slowly work their fucking way

386
00:22:18.411 --> 00:22:23.240
in,
burn it and toss it out of an airplane,
I want to go,

387
00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:27.050
I want to,
I wish I don't just probably isn't legal in this country,

388
00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:30.920
but I want to do it like the Viking way.
Like,
make a little ship.
Sure.

389
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.460
Send me out there.
It gives people,
shoots some flaming arrows,
you know,

390
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.030
giving them a little contest.
It's like a burn it on the Ganges.
Yeah.

391
00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:42.950
It's like a clay pigeon type of thing.
But um,
anyways,

392
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.780
uh,
what else we got?
We got a benefit coming up too that you're doing a,

can we discuss here?
We've,
we've,
we've promoted,

403
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.170
we've promoted whose law away your master class?

407
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.010
how to fuck things up.
Uh,

Sure.
I have that mastered.</v>

409
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.670
What was you,
what was your masterclass?
Well,
I,

410
00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.820
I did it because my friend Jay Roach who directed Austin Powers,

411
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:57.350
he directed my masterclass.

412
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.390
So it's basically several days of talking to Jay Roach who's asking me
questions.

413
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.920
There's no crowd or anything like that.
It's like a Ted talk or anything.
No,

414
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:07.060
it's just a name you just edited,
edited up and uh,

415
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.230
and I think it came out really well.
You know,

416
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.560
the thing you probably know because you've worked with a lot of people and staff

417
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:17.240
is so much of it is just inspiring people to work hard.
People are so damn lazy,

418
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.090
like people just don't put in the effort at all.

419
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.500
<v 0>I told him,
I told someone that the other day,
I was like,
look,</v>

420
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.940
you got to have a certain level of talent.

421
00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:27.550
But what separates people is just like,

422
00:24:27.551 --> 00:24:31.540
I mean the people who have like that work ethic and it's almost got to be like,

423
00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:34.720
and people in this business,
I kind of workaholics.
Um,

424
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.420
and like I've learned that with F is for family.
Some of these people,
hey,

425
00:24:37.421 --> 00:24:39.640
I want to go through it again.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
yeah.
I'm like,

426
00:24:39.641 --> 00:24:43.080
these people are fucking insane.
Like they don't want to go home.
Um,

427
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.260
but the people that I saw like just really,
really,
really work.

428
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.570
I don't want to name any names because then if I don't name names,

429
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.400
people saying what he's saying,
I'm fucking lazy.
But I just,

430
00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:55.040
I saw a lot of people that warrant the guy.
Yeah.

431
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.980
But work their way,
like into being the guy.
But like,
you know,

432
00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:00.311
with you,

433
00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:02.650
it's got to feel good when somebody comes to you and asked you to teach your

434
00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:03.370
masterclass.

435
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.940
I mean you certainly have the body of work and all this stuff that you've done

436
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.630
it.
Cause I,
that's I think the last three times I've,
I've talked to you,

437
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:11.830
that is what I've asked you.

438
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.090
How do you and my delegation of that Shit,

439
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.880
cause I still want to be a comedian and still,
you know,

440
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.360
and the only way to go still be in good as you have to be out there doing it.

441
00:25:22.361 --> 00:25:24.790
But if,
if,
how do I,
you know,

442
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:28.120
but I also love doing the show and then also got to be a dad.
Like how do,
how,

443
00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.490
how the fuck do you balance all of it?
So some of that in,
in there.

444
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.710
<v 1>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

445
00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:37.240
And I think that like a lot of it is a [inaudible] that you're just pushing,

446
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.070
pushing balls forward.

447
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.610
So you may be on the road doing standup and you have a great idea for a movie

448
00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:47.140
and it's just making sure in some consistent way you're pushing it forward and

449
00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:49.300
making progress.
Now you might finish it in three months,

450
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:50.650
you might finish it in three years,

451
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.680
but if you have four or five things going at the same time,

452
00:25:53.681 --> 00:25:55.960
that's really what it is,
is,
you know,

453
00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:59.920
I might get up in the morning and go from the moment I get up to lunch,

454
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.720
I'm going to work with Pete.
And in the afternoon you,

455
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.300
I'm doing a movie with p Davidson.

456
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.500
I'm going to rewrite p Davidson and then did you ever get burned out?

457
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.400
Do you get frustrated?
The Illusia Tempe seem like a chill guy.
Is this like a,

458
00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:14.980
is this how you are or like you behind the scenes,

459
00:26:14.981 --> 00:26:17.080
you one of those guys throw in laptops.

460
00:26:17.081 --> 00:26:22.081
Like it doesn't work where I'm going to stay here all night where I only get

461
00:26:22.271 --> 00:26:25.300
crazy on two issues.
What,
like two or three issues.

462
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.400
One is if the food orders wrong,
I just,
I,

463
00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:33.800
I can't handle it.
Like if they don't bring the salsa with the Burrito,
like I,

464
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.960
I'm so reward myself with that.
That could go viral.
That could go bad.
You're,

465
00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:40.960
you're,
uh,
you're,
you're flipping out.
That's okay.
That's,
that's,

466
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.220
that's understandable by,
by moments of shame or I go,

467
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:46.500
you really lost it are mainly around food.

468
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.690
But the areas where I get crazy one is I used to people who tell me I couldn't

469
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:55.220
have my casting and that would always drive me crazy if I said,

470
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.850
you know who the star of the show should be?

471
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.440
It should be Jason Segel and then Fox would go,
no,

472
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.800
that's where my head would explode.

473
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.180
<v 0>And where would you explode on the phone to them?
In your car to your windshield?</v>

474
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.070
<v 1>Every,
every scenario.
I mean,
I,
I'd be,
I'd be screaming,
I'd be in tears.</v>

475
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.230
I would be threatening.
I'd have agents calling and I never won.
As a result,

476
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.670
it took me years to realize,
oh,

477
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:24.300
all my emotional reactions have never won the fight.

478
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.700
And then when I stopped behaving that way,

479
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.610
I started winning more of those debates.

480
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:34.611
But I would get so upset because to me the worst thing in the world is if you

481
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.450
have an edited a movie and someone forces you to change it and you've ruined

482
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.980
your own movie to,
to something.
Does that happened?
Well,
it,
I,

483
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:47.670
that's the one area I just can't allow to happen.
Now.

484
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:52.230
I have had things changed in the past that I look back at more so,
you know,

485
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.100
a couple of decades ago where I did give in and neck,

486
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.560
even right now I thought about that movie and be like,
Oh,

487
00:27:58.561 --> 00:27:59.670
why did we cut that scene?

488
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:04.010
They told us to cut that scene and there was a scene in way

489
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.810
<v 0>you failed because you were young and just trying to get your foot in the door.</v>

490
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.660
Every,
everybody always says that thing,
you know,
you just gotta let him get him,

491
00:28:10.661 --> 00:28:11.890
get you the first time,

492
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.140
and then the next time you'll be able to write your own ticket.
Now do you,

493
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.510
do you subscribe to that?

494
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.790
<v 1>Well,
I think it's true.
Only in the sense that you can't win.</v>

495
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.420
You just don't have the power.
Right.

496
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.760
So we made this movie heavyweights and Paul Feig was in it and still are played

497
00:28:25.761 --> 00:28:29.300
the bad guy who was a summer camp for fat kids.
Uh,
and it was a,

498
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.860
it was a Disney movie.

499
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.880
And then when we finished it and see real directed it and wrote it with me,
uh,

500
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.300
it was just a little darker than any Disney movie you've ever seen.

501
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.560
And it ended with,
uh,
with,
so it was funny.

502
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.560
It was funny and not in the way that a lot of those movies are still here at the

503
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:47.360
end of the movie.
He's lost his mind.

504
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.420
He's the owner of this fat camp and he's like this like demented Tony Robbins

505
00:28:50.421 --> 00:28:54.320
guy and he's got a bow and Arrow and he's like threatening to kill all the

506
00:28:54.321 --> 00:28:57.390
children.
Right.
And Disney said,
you know,
you really can't have him.

507
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.060
Lake point pointing bow and arrows from Jill at children are like three feet

508
00:29:02.061 --> 00:29:06.260
away.
Right.
And so we had to re add it,
the sequence.
That's the kind of stuff.

509
00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:07.640
I'll wake up at two in the morning and go,

510
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.020
why did we cut out the goddamn bow and Arrow sequence still eats at you?

511
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.190
And I might have five of those.
And so that's where I can

512
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.620
<v 0>what point in your career where you're like,
all right,
all right,
Jed.</v>

513
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.390
Screaming at people and flipping out during these moments isn't working.

514
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.520
Yeah.
Like how did you,
cause I am like,
my big Achilles heel is,

515
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.130
is uh,
it's not anybody,
it's funny.
It's not at work.
I don't flip out.
Yeah.

516
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.730
In comedy clubs,
I don't,
I've never flipped out at,
uh,
F as a family have raised.

517
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:40.760
My Voice of it is just cry.
Wait,
how do we talk about,

518
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:45.820
but I never like got to the point of light,
you know,
never had a big,
you know,

519
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.810
storm out fucking throwing shit.
Never had one of those.
But like,

520
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:54.310
it's more like at,
at,
at home.
Yeah.
I,
uh,
I,
you know,

521
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:56.410
I just like flip out about just stupid shit.

522
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.730
Like I fucking suck at these iPhones and laptops I get,

523
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:03.970
so I'm so frustrated because I don't like them.

524
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.180
Technology doesn't fascinate me.
It's not something I'm interested in.

525
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.350
It's really,
it's ruined the world.
So,
and you know,
little ways it has it now,

526
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:12.184
the other ways it hasn't

527
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.683
<v 1>medic medically is,</v>

528
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.240
it's nice when your kids are older and they don't look up at you for hours.

529
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.990
You'll,
you'll go through in the way.

530
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.350
<v 0>Yes.
I,
yeah,
that aspect of it.
But I definitely like,
uh,</v>

531
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:29.120
like I just don't like how yesterday I knew how to use this device and then now

532
00:30:29.121 --> 00:30:32.850
I don't know,
I have to go through this fucking bullshit.
It's just every time,

533
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.520
you know,
you move three feet ahead,

534
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.210
they knock you back with the new updated system and then you can't,

535
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.010
you can't opt out of not updating.

536
00:30:40.011 --> 00:30:42.380
It cause you to be able to keep your phone for years and they're just like,
no,

537
00:30:42.381 --> 00:30:45.530
we're going to fill up this fucking phone until you have to bring it in.

538
00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:48.050
And then we're gonna take everything off it and sell it to some kid in the

539
00:30:48.051 --> 00:30:50.540
Philippines and you just feel like you're just part of this thing.

540
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:55.430
And like that's the type of shit,
like I'm trying to,
uh,
you know,

541
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.890
and I'm failing miserably at it.

542
00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.970
<v 1>But explain the flip out.
Is that alone?
Like throwing it against the wall.</v>

543
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.510
Are you yelling at another person?
Like what does it turn into?

544
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.290
<v 0>I just literally like,
my wife will be just totally chilling,</v>

545
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:10.360
watching TV and then out of nowhere I'll just be like,

546
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:12.940
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
You fucking piece of shit.

547
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:16.030
I flip out like that and like what?
I don't know,
cause I grew up with that.

548
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:19.660
I didn't understand what it was doing to her as far as just really just having

549
00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:23.890
her be on edge and uh,
yeah.
So I mean,

550
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.760
<v 1>how did she tell you not to do it?
What's her,</v>

551
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:29.390
her approach to telling you to chill out?
Oh man,

552
00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:32.930
she's just straightforward teeth.
Straight forward.
She said,
she said some shit,

553
00:31:32.931 --> 00:31:35.940
I'm not going to,
you know,
this is too intimate detail,

554
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.130
but she said some shit to me like two days ago that I will never forget.

555
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.300
And I was like,
wow,
well good.
When you have,
you did,

556
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.950
it changes everything because you're,

557
00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.710
she knows you're about to do it in front of a child that understands it.

558
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.650
So when they're little,
they're babies and you can go in the other room,

559
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.160
but at some point you just spend so much time with your kid that they will

560
00:31:55.161 --> 00:31:57.470
absorb it and then you go to,

561
00:31:57.471 --> 00:32:00.980
I like the way I move in the world cause I think my kid's going to copy it.

562
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:01.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

563
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.960
So fortunately I am really on my best behavior for the most part around my kid.

564
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.460
She seen me flip out a few times,

565
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:14.230
but I quickly tried to turn it in and do a joke.
But,
um,
it's something,
yeah,

566
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:16.810
I got to go to therapy dude.
Cause I,
I,

567
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.750
I don't wanna cause she's getting to the point now where she's repeating stuff

568
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:23.800
and I just don't,
I don't want to,
this is the deal.
She's not going to be like me.

569
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.060
I already know she's not going to be like me,
uh,
as far in a good way.

570
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.150
So I mean that's,
that's kind of what,
what does that say about me?
Like,

571
00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:35.710
my job as a dad is to make my kid not like me.
Well,
the one thing,
half of me,

572
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:38.250
but I don't want you to be me at all.
I want you to be like your mom.

573
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.010
<v 1>Well,
they don't really,
the damage of</v>

574
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.970
<v 0>us,
you know?
So that's something I've noticed is,
you know,
my kids are hilarious,</v>

575
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:45.500
but they're neurotic kids too,

576
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.420
but they didn't go through some of the intense things and I went through that,

577
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:55.250
really built how my mind works.
But I'm sure they have their own,

578
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:56.970
their own menu.
No,

579
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.430
I bet there's a whole new level of shit with just like social media didn't

580
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:06.200
exist.
So like what I liked about my childhood was once school was over,

581
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:11.180
the ass kicking was over,
whatever thing,
humiliation.
I could go home.
It was fine.

582
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:16.040
It didn't continue.
The Mike Douglas show was on,
you'd watch it heal.

583
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.520
Yes.
Yes.
There wasn't this think tank of kids trying to,
you know,

584
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:23.090
getting all online and pile on you and the shit that they deal with.
So,

585
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.990
and they know when they're being excluded.

586
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.410
So the biggest issue is because of Instagram,

587
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.080
you're aware of what you've been invited to.

588
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.140
So when people are hanging out you're like,
oh,

589
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.680
they didn't want me at this thing.
When I was a kid,

590
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.130
I was excluded by everybody.
I had one or two really good friends.

591
00:33:43.131 --> 00:33:46.310
But basically if I thought about it,
if I think about it now,

592
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.080
I was excluded from every possible social thing that was happening at the club.

593
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.120
But I,
but I didn't know it.
You know,

594
00:33:53.121 --> 00:33:56.780
I just would go home every day and just watching the Dinah shore show and be

595
00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:59.030
fine and wait for my friends to get back from football.

596
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.930
But now the kids know like,
oh,
those three girls went to the mall.
Oh,

597
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:06.830
those two are hanging out at this concert.
And they feel bad.
No.

598
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.940
And then they take a picture,

599
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.460
which is not an accurate depiction of what that's like.
It's like,

600
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.420
it's like they're selling the movie of like their,
their,
their life or anything.

601
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.830
So that's the,
uh,
that's the thing I get nervous with.
And that's been,
you know,

602
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:22.550
a source of,
uh,
you know,
back and forth.
Me and my wife is like,

603
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:25.610
I don't like her watching TV and all of this shit and I don't like you're eating

604
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:28.550
junk food and uh,
you know,
and she has more of like,

605
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:31.430
like she wants a little bit TV.
She occasionally has Mcdonald's and it's like,

606
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.530
it's like,
all right,
but you know,
I mean,

607
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.220
this is the fights you have because yeah,
you,
when you're married,

608
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:42.221
you're instantly deciding how much do I care about each thing and what,

609
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.470
how far do I want to push my wife?

610
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:48.070
Like in knocked up one of the scenes that I like,
but it's a,

611
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:53.130
it's an intense scene is Leslie sitting there and she's looking at a website

612
00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:57.770
that tells her where sexual predators live in the neighborhood.

613
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.990
And Paul comes in and he just keeps making jokes about it and she's really

614
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:05.450
freaked out.
Like,
do you know there's a guy like three,

615
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.230
three streets over and Paul keeps making jokes like,
well,

616
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.500
let's not go to his house on Halloween.
And then finally she's like,

617
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.320
that's what I would do.
And then she finally says like,

618
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.190
sometimes I just want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking

619
00:35:19.191 --> 00:35:22.940
stupid.
And that really is what marriage is about.
Is there,

620
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:25.430
there are issues that you care about.

621
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.310
Like how much of Mcdonald's should the kitty?
Now when I was a kid,

622
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.140
I swear to God,
I had McDonald's.
I'm not kidding you six times a week.

623
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.970
And I loved it.
I ate it.

624
00:35:34.971 --> 00:35:38.430
My mom had no issue taking me there every single time.

625
00:35:38.431 --> 00:35:41.670
We used to go out as a family,
like it was fine dining.

626
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.880
He got there,
we had a big family.
So it was five cheeseburgers,
five small fries,

627
00:35:47.881 --> 00:35:51.060
five chocolate shakes,
two big MACs,
two large fries to coax.

628
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:56.040
That was the order for a years.
And it was awesome every time.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it was,

629
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.050
it was an ice being jealous.
And when I got older,

630
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.720
because I kept getting a cheeseburger and I was big enough to get a quarter

631
00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:03.900
pounder with cheese,
but I was afraid to ask as you get shit.
And I just,

632
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.840
we looking at theirs and they would only like halfway through it with that

633
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:10.800
little mouse trying to eat it.
And I have Woolston mind down.
But,
uh,
yeah,

634
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.910
I remember when I used to,

635
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.580
when I was really young and I lived on the north shore of Boston.

636
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:17.430
I remember there was a Mcdonald's and it was this train track that was right by,

637
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:22.380
and you would throw some of your French fries to the seagulls and you get to see

638
00:36:22.381 --> 00:36:24.570
a train go by and you'd be sitting outside.

639
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.220
And it was like some of my fondest memories as a kid and um,
you know,

640
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.760
yeah,
there was no,
yeah.
You know,
they will roughly the same age.

641
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:37.370
So it was just all a,
you know,
peanut butter and fluff and all of these,
these,

642
00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:40.740
these,
um,
there's some of this out about it.
It,

643
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.350
when did you even realize Mcdonald's was bad and what,

644
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:47.010
like how old were you when you were like,
I guess I shouldn't eat them?
Well,

645
00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:50.660
you knew fast food was bad,
but he didn't know to the point like,

646
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.640
I make Mcdonald's,
remember a few years ago they had a bolt in a bulletin board.

647
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.020
A billboard just came out and it's like now with a 100% beef,

648
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.990
which is obviously,
well what the fuck was it before the page?

649
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.070
Did you watch that movie founder with Michael Keaton?

650
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.940
Oh you gotta watch that Michael Keaton's amazing in that movie and it's such a,

651
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.260
it's such a well done a movie about like all of that type of stuff.
So,

652
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.730
um,
but then,
you know,
your wife says,
ah,

653
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.910
I want to give her the kid and some Mcdonald's and you're like,

654
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.730
they could let be awful.
Now I have the poisoned,

655
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.540
I have the reverse with my wife used to be poised.
I think now it's more like,

656
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:25.970
it's a little more healthy right now.

657
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.950
It might be just nothing this blank,

658
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.610
no positive anything.
But my,

659
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.590
my wife early in our relationship when I would get Mcdonald's would look at me

660
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:41.040
like,
what is wrong with you?
Are you an adult?
Like you eat this food?

661
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.540
She was so disgusted.

662
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.840
She shamed me to such an extent that I don't even sneak out and get it.

663
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:53.010
Like she,
she programmed me to be disgusted by the thing that made me so happy.

664
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.810
Yeah.
My thing was when I was going to be healthy,

665
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:59.400
I went to Wendy's cause Wendy's seemed like it was actually burger meat.
Yeah.

666
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.780
Probably wasn't either.
No,
it probably wasn't.
Well,
dude,
um,
I gotta tell you,
man,

667
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.950
it's such a thrill to have,
uh,
someone like you come on on the show and like,

668
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.510
and I really appreciate the advice both on this and an off that you've given me

669
00:38:12.511 --> 00:38:16.770
as far as like,
how do you know,
you know,
keep it all kind of going without,

670
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.910
without screwing it up.

671
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:20.070
And now I'm definitely gonna check out that master class that you're in.
