00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The first thing I'm going to do is convert to m/s.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If I use these conversion factors, I find that all my units—km, hr, and min—cancel

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
leaving me with m/s, so the velocity that my plane needs to be moving

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if it's going to take off is 69.4 m/s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So this question is asking for acceleration.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We know initial velocity, final velocity, and the distance we have to accelerate.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Time is not really used in this question, so we use this equation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now there's a few ways to solve this. What I'd like to do is first solve for a.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then plug in everything I know since a is what I'm looking for.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this is the equation I get so now I can plug in, and I get an answer of 30.1 m/s².

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Note that 30 is three times bigger than 10.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And 10 is that special number, which we call g and that's the acceleration of objects in free fall fields.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Another way of phrasing this acceleration of 30 is saying it's equal to 3 g.
