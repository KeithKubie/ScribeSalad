<i>- It's been about--
over 20 years</i>

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.290
<i>that I've had this truck.</i>

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.880
<i>Never had a chance
to lay a hand on it</i>

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.790
<i>and try and get
anything done.</i>

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.880
<i>To be out here today
with Rick,</i>

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.460
<i>working on this truck,
finally--</i>

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.040
<i>it feels really good.</i>

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.080
- Hey.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.460
How are you doing?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.880
How's it going?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.080
- Going all right.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.580
- Okay.
- Little slow going,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.420
but think we're getting it,
a little bit.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.580
- We're out a little more
than we should be.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.330
Okay, let me see
the hammer you used.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.580
Okay, so the hammer head--

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.750
see the hammer?
- Mm-hm.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.920
- See how it's rounded
like that?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.040
- Uh-huh.
- And which dolly?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.620
Okay.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.500
This dolly is good
on the inside...

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
- Mm-hm.
- But this hammer

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.120
is not so good on the outside,
'cause all it's gonna do--

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.880
see how it's got, like,
a round corner?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.330
All it's gonna do
is punch holes.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.170
It's gonna make more divots,
more holes.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.620
So you want a flat head,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.670
where it's really flat
on the end,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.000
and then,
when you're hitting on it,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.830
you gotta feel where it is.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.080
Okay, I'm high here,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.380
so I'ma put the dolly
right behind there,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.040
and I'm gonna tap it.
[loud tapping]

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.120
And you want that--
you want to go up and down.

Let me get over there.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.500
So right now,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.120
especially with my body man.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.790
He is--he likes the Bondo.
I hate the Bondo.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.330
I wanna metal-finish it.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.120
So, I mean, you've got it.
It's looking good.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.120
There's j--you saw I was
just barely hitting it, right?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.620
But that little bit of hitting

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.920
will allow that 1/8 inch

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.500
of extra Bondo
you would put in it

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.960
to--you won't have to.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.170
You did good.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.960
I mean, you can feel this,
right?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.170
Feel this, nice and flat.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.000
Feel that,
and then feel that.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.170
- Yeah.
- And i--

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.500
- I can feel some ripple in it.
- Yeah.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.960
- There's a little bit
of stuff, right?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.500
So all you're gonna do now is--
this one here,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.040
I think we need to pull
all the way out,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.750
and then we need
to just sand it,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.460
you know, and it'll--
it'll eventually be

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.460
the same thing, and then
all you gotta do is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.960
you prime it.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.330
You get it all metal-finished.
You just prime it.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.080
There's no material on it
at all,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.290
which is the best way,
believe me.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.620
It's important to have this
all nice and smooth.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.330
It's got some lumps in it,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.670
but we're getting there.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.040
- Got a little bit
of work left to do.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.500
