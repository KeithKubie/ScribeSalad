00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.630
In the last video, we
proved that the sum

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.310
of all of the positive
integers up to and including n

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.350
can be expressed as n
times n plus 1 over 2.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.959
And we proved that by induction.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.750
What I want to do in
this video is show you

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.730
that there's actually a
simpler proof for that.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.490
But it's not by
induction, so it wouldn't

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.630
be included in that video.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.005
But I'll show you
that it exists,

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.960
just so you know that induction
isn't the only way to prove it.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.630
So we define that
function S of n

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.150
as the sum of all of the
positive integers up to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.080
and including n.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.050
So this is equal
to, by definition,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.900
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus, all the
way to plus n minus 1 plus n.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.320
So it's the sum of all of the
integers up to and including n.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.230
This is how we're defining it.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.530
Well, we can rewrite it again.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.840
We can say that the sum,
S of n-- we could just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.840
rewrite this same thing,
but we could rewrite it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.714
in a different order.

00:00:56.714 --> 00:01:01.400
We could say that this is the
same thing as n plus n minus 1

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.990
plus n minus 2 plus, all the
way down to plus 2 plus 1.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.040
Now, what does this do for us?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.480
Well, we can actually
add these two rows.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.150
If we add S of n
plus S of n, we're

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.090
going to get 2 times
this sum, so we're just

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.400
adding on the left.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.060
And then we can also
add on the right.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.630
So we're just adding this sum
twice, but what's interesting

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.984
is how we're going to add it.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:31.150
We're going to add this
term to this term, this term

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.066
to this term, because
we're really just trying

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.180
to add these two things.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.330
And we can pick any way
we want to add them.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.320
So 1 plus n is going
to be n plus 1.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.810
And then we're going to add--
let me do it in pink-- 2

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.010
plus n minus 1.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.637
So what's 2 plus n minus 1?

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:51.720
Let me write it over here.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.460
2 plus n minus 1.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.110
It's the same thing
as 2 plus n minus 1,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.400
which is the same
thing as n plus 1.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.240
2 minus 1 is just 1.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.470
So this is also
going to be n plus 1.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.190
And then this term over here,
3 plus n minus 2, or n minus 2

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.260
plus 3.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.550
Once again, that's
going to be n plus 1.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.300
And you're going to
do that for every term

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.640
all the way until you get
over here, n minus 1 plus 2.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.400
That's also going
to be n plus 1.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.130
And then finally, you have
n plus 1 right over here.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.390
Plus n plus 1.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.940
So what's this whole
sum going to be?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.330
Well, how many of these
n plus 1's do we have?

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.870
Well, we have n of
them, for every term

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.030
in each of these sums.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.540
So this is 1, 2, 3,
count all the way to n.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.980
You have n of these terms.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.910
So you have n n plus 1's.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.750
So if you add something
to itself n times,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.300
or if you have something
n times right over here,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.190
this is exactly equivalent
to n times n plus 1.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.920
So 2 times that sum of
all the positive integers

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.660
up to and including
n is going to be

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.930
equal to n times n plus 1.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.930
So if you divide
both sides by 2,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.430
we get an expression
for the sum.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.400
So the sum of all the positive
integers up to and including n

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.330
is going to be equal to
n times n plus 1 over 2.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.730
So here was a proof where we
didn't have to use induction.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.941
It's really kind of a
pure algebraic proof.
