00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be my only or guess but it's like
 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
would be my only or guess but it's like
I<00:09:48.360><c> think</c><00:09:48.420><c> that'd</c><00:09:48.660><c> be</c><00:09:48.690><c> too</c><00:09:48.959><c> obvious</c><00:09:49.140><c> uh</c><00:09:49.620><c> because</c>

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.370 align:start position:0%
I think that'd be too obvious uh because
 

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.130 align:start position:0%
I think that'd be too obvious uh because
they<00:09:50.490><c> make</c><00:09:50.670><c> him</c><00:09:50.790><c> an</c><00:09:50.940><c> inventor</c><00:09:51.390><c> and</c><00:09:51.690><c> so</c><00:09:51.839><c> on</c><00:09:51.990><c> so</c>

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
they make him an inventor and so on so
 

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
they make him an inventor and so on so
forth

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:52.529 align:start position:0%
forth
 

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
forth
um<00:09:52.970><c> so</c><00:09:53.970><c> I</c><00:09:54.240><c> don't</c><00:09:54.450><c> know</c><00:09:54.570><c> that</c><00:09:54.779><c> that's</c><00:09:54.959><c> the</c><00:09:55.260><c> only</c>

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:55.290 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that that's the only
 

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.220 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that that's the only
guess<00:09:55.800><c> I</c><00:09:55.950><c> have</c><00:09:56.130><c> now</c><00:09:56.540><c> about</c><00:09:57.540><c> who</c><00:09:57.690><c> the</c><00:09:57.839><c> author</c><00:09:58.080><c> is</c>

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
