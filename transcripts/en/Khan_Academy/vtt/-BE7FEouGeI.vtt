00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.800
So we can make sure
we really understand

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.131
what's happening in this little
iterative Fibonacci function

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:07.880
that I wrote, I'm going
to step through it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.140
with a particular example.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.056
So we're going to assume
that this function is

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:12.700
called with the argument 5.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.520
So we want the fifth term
in the Fibonacci sequence

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.540
starting at where we're
indexing things starting at 0.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.877
So the 0th term will
be really sometimes

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.710
what you would imagine
the first term to be.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.150
We'll start at the 0th term.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.670
So we're assuming that
Fibonacci of 5 is called.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.060
So we want the fifth term
starting at the 0th term.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.970
So we just want the fifth one.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.310
And so when we go
into this program,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.540
terms is defined as
this list right here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.270
that just has two
elements, 0 and 1.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.990
So what I've done here is,
I'm going to really focus

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.340
on what happens in this loop.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.950
So as we enter into this
loop, the first time

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.210
that we enter into
this loop, terms

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.536
is referring to a list that
has just 0 and 1 in it.

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.410
And we did that because,
by definition, those

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.590
are the first two terms
of the Fibonacci sequence.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.370
And then also entering
into the loop,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.510
we define i as being equal to 2.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.150
And we do that,
because we've already

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.800
defined the 0th term
and the first term.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.240
And so now we want to,
as we enter the loop,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.150
we want to add the second
term as we go into the loop.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.130
And then we say, while i
is less than or equal to n.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.310
Well, we already
know that n is 5.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.970
So in the scope
of this function,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.750
while we are running
it, the variable n is 5.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.750
And so clearly i is
less than or equal to 5,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.180
so we will run this
code right over here.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.802
And we're appending to terms.

00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:46.260
So we're going to
append something.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.790
So entering into this clause,
this is what i, in terms,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.610
look like.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.650
But it looks like we're going
to append something to terms.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.190
So terms is going to look like--
terms is going to be 0 and 1.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.870
And then we're going
to add something.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.520
We're going to add something
right over here to terms.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.270
And what is that thing
we're going to add?

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.644
Well, we're going
to add whatever

00:02:04.644 --> 00:02:06.329
this business over here is.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.370
It seems complicated, but
when you break it down,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.070
it actually doesn't
look too bad.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400
In this situation,
what is i minus 1?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.580
Well, i is 2, so in this
situation, i minus 1

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.000
is going to be 1,
and i minus 2 is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.140
going to be 0, as we go
through this iteration.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.230
The first term in
terms, the first term,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.530
so this is the 0th term.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.900
This is the first term.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.800
So the first term in
terms is literally a 1.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
So this whole thing is 1.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.850
And the 0th term in terms,
remember terms, the 0th term

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.880
in terms-- actually I
should write it this way.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.090
The list is called terms.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.350
The 0th term in terms-- this
is what term looks like right

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.950
now-- is going to be 0.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.310
So this whole thing is
going to be 0, as well.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.910
So it's 1 plus 0, which is 1.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.390
And that's what we're
appending to terms.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.110
So we're going to
append a 1 over here.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.540
And then we say i is
equal to i plus 1.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.370
Well i is, right
now, equal to 2.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.210
So you're going to
add 2 plus 1 is 3.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.100
And that's going to be
the new value for i.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.480
And then we go back,
we loop back up

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.710
to the beginning
of the while loop.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.760
And we say while i is
less than or equal to n.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.740
Well, now i is a
little bit closer to n.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.500
It's 3 now.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.560
But it's still less
than or equal to 5.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.250
So now we evaluate this again.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.270
So once again,
entering into the loop,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.550
terms now looks
like this-- 0, 1, 1.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.670
I looks like this-- 3.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.510
It's really the same values
we had exiting the loop.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.420
And now we evaluate
right over here.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.080
We're going to add
something to terms.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.622
So terms right now is 0, 1, 1.

00:03:44.622 --> 00:03:46.080
We're going to add
something to it.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.290
And what is that something?

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.360
It's going to be the i
minus 1th term of terms.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.143
So what's the i?

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:54.820
I over here is 3.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.940
3 minus 1 is 2.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.270
So this right over here
is now going to be 2.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.670
So it's going to be the
second indexed term in terms.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.240
So this is the 0th,
the first, the second.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.250
So this over here is going to
evaluate to 1, plus i minus 2.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800
Well, i is now 3.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.720
3 minus 2 is 1.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.959
So plus the first term in terms.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.769
This is the 0th term
and the first term.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.950
So this is also going
to be a 1 over here.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.020
This is going to
be 1 plus 1, or 2.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.407
So we're going to
append a 2 to terms.

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:34.740
That's what this does over here.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.810
And then we take whatever i was,
which is i, in this iteration,

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.690
i is 3, and we're
going to add 1 to it

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.010
and redefine i to be that.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.060
So 3 plus 1 is 4.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.010
And that's the new i.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.440
Then we go again to the
beginning of the loop.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.990
While i is less
than or equal to n.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.380
Well, i is now 4.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.500
n is is still 5.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.730
4 is less than or equal to 5.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.489
So we run this again.

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:59.030
And once again, we
need to figure out

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.590
what terms of i minus 1 are.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.370
Let me write it over here, since
this is getting kind of messy.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.460
Let me actually clear
this up, because I

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.720
want to be able to
read it clearly.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.230
So let me clear this.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.010
So now in this loop,
let's just think

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.400
about what-- so now, let
me write it over here.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.330
Entering the loop
now, i is equal to 4--

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.300
I'm going to do that same orange
color-- entering into the loop

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.420
i is equal to 4.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.050
And the terms has now been-- it
now has four elements in it--

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.300
0, 1, 1, and 2.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.420
And now 4 is still less than
or equal to 5, so we do this,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.120
and we have to figure out
what terms of i minus 1 is.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.160
Well, now i minus 1 is 3, right?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.600
4 minus 1 is 3, so
terms of-- not terms of.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.740
I should say the third element
in terms is 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.690
So it's going to
be-- this whole thing

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.025
is going to be this
2 right over here.

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:55.400
So we're going to
take that 2-- I

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.220
know you can't read that--
we're going to take this 2,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.360
and we're going to add it to
terms, the i minus 2th terms.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.610
I is 4, 4 minus 2 is 2.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.200
The second term in
terms is 0, 1, 2.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.800
It's a 1.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.400
It's this 1 right over here.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.280
So we're adding this 2
plus this 1 to now get 3.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.710
And we're taking-- so this whole
thing-- when you add it it's 3.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.570
And we are appending
it to terms.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.010
So terms was 0, 1, 1, 2.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.030
But now we are appending
a 3 to the end of it.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.056
We're appending a
3 to the end of it.

00:06:35.056 --> 00:06:36.930
And then we're saying
i is equal to i plus 1.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.110
I was 4, 4 plus 1 is 5, so
that is what i is equal to now.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.210
It's equal to 5.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.830
Then we go the
beginning of the loop.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.780
i is now going to be equal to 5.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.850
Terms-- let me write in that
same color for consistency--

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.530
terms are now 0, 1, 1, 2, and 3.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.020
And then we say, well i is less
than or equal to n. n is 5.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.020
Well, 5 is still less
than or equal to 5.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.630
It's equal to 5, so
this still is true.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.480
So we will execute this clause.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.330
And now we have to figure
out-- let me clear this out

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.800
again-- now we have to figure
out what is terms of i, well,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.230
what is the i minus
1th term in terms?

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.640
So now i is 5.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.940
So it's 5 minus 1.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.360
So it's the fourth
term in terms.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.080
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.750
So it is this term
right over here.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.090
It is the 3.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.270
So this over here is 3 now.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.765
And then we have to
think about-- let

00:07:42.765 --> 00:07:44.890
me do this in another
color-- and then we

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.080
have i minus 2. i is 5 now.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.540
5 minus 2 is 3.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:54.520
The third term in terms 0,
1, 2, 3 is this over here.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.980
So this over here is 2.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.680
So you evaluate
this-- you'll notice

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.250
we're just adding the last
two terms that we had so far.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.170
This is how we build
our Fibonacci sequence.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.540
And so 3 plus 2 is 5.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.710
So we're going to append
the 5 to the end of terms.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:15.740
So terms is going to be
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, and then

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.550
we are going to
append a 5 to it.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.410
And then we say i is
equal to i plus 1.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.380
So i is equal to 5 plus 1, or 6.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.214
i is equal to 6 now.

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:26.671
We go to the
beginning of the loop,

00:08:26.671 --> 00:08:28.900
and it says, while i is
less than or equal to n.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.669
Well, now i is 6,
and n has been 5.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.750
6 is not less than
or equal to 5.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.440
So this is false, So we do
not-- we break out of the loop,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.980
and we go to, I guess,
we stopped running it.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:51.700
And then we go to return
the nth term in terms.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.090
So remember n was 5.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.580
So what's the fifth
term if we start at 0?

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.020
So this is the 0th term, first
term, second term, third term,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.845
fourth term, fifth
term, and we are done.

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:03.720
And hopefully that gives
you an understanding

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.020
of why this worked.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.590
And also a little bit of the
logic of how we wrote it.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.310
It's literally building up
the Fibonacci sequence the way

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.420
you would expect to.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.170
It started with the first
two terms by definition,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.932
and then each time
we went to the loop,

00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:20.390
and it added another
term and said,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.970
hey, the new term is just going
to be the sum of the last term,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.464
right now, and the
second to last term.

00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:29.880
And add them together, and
then that will be the new term,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.240
and you keep doing that.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.610
You keep doing that until
you have, essentially,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.970
until you've added
that nth term.
