00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.360
- [Instructor] One of the
most commonly used tools

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.340
in all of statistics is
the notion of a Z-score.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.330
And one way to think about a Z-score

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.520
is it's just the number
of standard deviations

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.420
away from the mean that
a certain data point is.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.630
So let me write that down.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.510
Number of standard deviations.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.343
I'll write it like this.

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:25.343
Number of standard deviations
from our population mean

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
for a particular, particular data point.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.710
Now let's make that a little bit concrete.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.550
Let's say that you're some
type of marine biologist

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.480
and you've discovered a new
species of winged turtles

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.810
and there's a total of
seven winged turtles,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.520
the entire population of
these winged turtles is seven.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.540
And so you go and you're actually able

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.170
to measure all the winged turtles

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.120
and you care about their
length and you also

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.540
wanna care about, how are
those lengths distributed?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.170
Lengths of winged turtles.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.210
All right, and let's say, and
this is all in centimeters.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.130
These are very small turtles.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.210
So you discover, and these are all adults.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.930
So there's a two centimeter one,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.560
there's another two centimeter one.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.470
There's a three centimeter one.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.570
There's another two centimeter one.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.980
There's a five centimeter
one, a one centimeter one,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.400
and a six centimeter one.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.610
So we have seven data
points and from this,

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.100
and I encourage you at
any point if you want.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.940
Pause this video and see
if you wanna calculate,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.330
what is the population mean here?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.230
We're assuming that this is the population

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.933
of all the winged turtles.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.580
Well, the mean in this situation
is going to be equal to,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.820
you could add up all these
numbers and divide by seven

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.170
and you would then get three.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.080
And then using these
data points and the mean

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.470
you can calculate the
population standard deviation.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.920
And once again, as review
I always encourage you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.370
to pause this video and see
if you can do it on your own.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.350
But I've calculated that ahead of time.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.040
The population standard
deviation in this situation

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.040
is approximately, I'll round
to the hundredth place, 1.69.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.230
So with this information you
should be able to calculate

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.420
the Z-score for each of these data points.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.000
Pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.460
So let me make a new column here.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.173
So here I'm gonna put our Z-score.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.770
And if you just look at the definition

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.540
what you're going to do for
each of these data points,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.580
let's say each data point is x,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.190
you're going to subtract
from that the mean

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.510
and then you're going to divide that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.113
by the standard deviation.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.110
The numerator right over
here's gonna tell you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.640
how far you are above or below the mean,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.030
but you wanna know how
many standard deviations

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.670
you are from the mean,
so then you'll divide

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.050
by the population standard deviation.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.270
So for example, this first
data point right over here

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.670
if I wanna calculate the
Z-score I will take two.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.970
From that I will subtract three

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.010
and then I will divide by 1.69.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.263
I will divide by 1.69.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.140
And if you've got a calculator out

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.110
this is going to be -1 divided by 1.69

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.670
and if you use a calculator you would get,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.883
this is going to be approximately -0.59.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.360
And the Z-score for this data
point is going to be the same.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.563
That is also going to be -0.59.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.410
One way to interpret this is,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.210
this is a little bit more
than half a standard deviation

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.120
below the mean, and we could
do a similar calculation

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.040
for data points that are above the mean.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.990
Let's say this data point right over here.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.320
What is its Z-score?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.130
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.130
Well, it's going to be six
minus our mean, so minus three.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.160
All of that over the standard deviation.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.610
All of that over 1.69 and
this, if you have a calculator,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.420
and I calculated it ahead of time,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.160
this is going to be approximately 1.77.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.310
So more than one, but less
than two standard deviations

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.920
above the mean.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.240
I encourage you to pause this video

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.660
and now try to figure out the Z-scores

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.210
for these other data points.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.160
Now, an obvious question that
some of you might be asking

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.430
is why, why do we care how
many standard deviations

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.640
above or below the mean a data point is?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.680
In your future statistical life,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.030
Z-scores are gonna be a really useful way

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.240
to think about how usual or how unusual

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.750
a certain data point is.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.750
And that's going to be really valuable

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.380
once we start making
inferences based on our data.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.720
So I will leave you there.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.200
Just keep in mind it's a very useful idea,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.320
but at the heart of it
a fairly simple one.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.580
If you know the mean you
know the standard deviation.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.940
Take your data point, subtract
the mean from the data point

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.730
and then divide by your
standard deviation.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.383
That gives you your Z-score.
