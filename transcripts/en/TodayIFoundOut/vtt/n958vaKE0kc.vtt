00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.939
Why Do We Knock On Wood?

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.929
You’ve probably said this phrase and performed
this action countless times, without the slightest

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.980
clue as to the meaning behind it.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.560
So why do we feel compelled to “knock on
wood” as an insurance policy against bad

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.560
luck?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.370
Unfortunately, nobody knows for sure and while
you’ll often read detailed accounts of how

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.160
the saying comes from centuries old practices
by various peoples (depending on the origin

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.180
theory you’re reading), oddly enough the
expression itself only popped up a little

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.300
over a hundred years ago, first documented
in 1905, with the British equivalent “touch

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.680
wood,” popping up in 1899.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.190
As for the various theories of how the expression
came to be, these include that most Pagan

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.140
cultures in the ancient world – from Ireland
to India – believed that trees were inhabited

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.690
by nature spirits, and often incorporated
them into their rituals and worship.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.540
Thus, the theory goes that it was thought
that one could simply knock on the bark of

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.420
a tree to invoke the aid of the benevolent
nature spirit residing within.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.869
The Irish also supposedly believed this was
how you thanked the little people, or leprechauns,

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.640
for any good luck you’ve been experiencing.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.420
So over time, knocking on the tree may have
become a way of showing gratitude for a run

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.360
of particularly good luck, and the acknowledgement
that the nature spirits deserve thanks for

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.090
blessings received, in case they got miffed
and caused your luck to change from good to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.090
bad.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.020
Mortals provoking the ire of the gods is never
a good idea, so respect is crucial to avoiding

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.840
serious backlash – and bad luck.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.040
Yet another theory gives credit to Christians,
who elevated twisting Pagan tradition for

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.439
their own purposes to an art form.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.670
In this theory, the wood in question is the
cross that Christ was crucified on.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.270
Knocking on the wood, more or less then invokes
Christ’s protection.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.840
There’s also a Jewish version of “knock
on wood” origin that contends the practice

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.369
originated in the 1490s during the Spanish
Inquisition under the infamous Torquemada.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.170
Jews were running for their lives at the time,
and as synagogues and temples were built from

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.929
wood, coded knocks were devised so Jews could
gain entry.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.310
This resulted in many lives being saved, so
“knocking on wood” became synonymous with

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.510
good luck according to this origin theory.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.790
All that said, again, despite the supposedly
ancient origin of knocking on wood for luck,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.080
the earliest documented references of the
expression “knock on wood” and “touch

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.190
wood” date back only a little over a century
ago.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.900
If we go a little further back, to the early
1800s we find a series of children’s chasing

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.110
games, including “Tiggy-touch-wood,” where
one of the rules state that you cannot be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.070
tagged if you “touch wood.”

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.650
This was an extremely popular game at the
time, and could very well be how the British

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.180
equivalent of”knock on wood,” “touch
wood,” came about; that may have in turn

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.489
given rise to “knock on wood” across the
pond.

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.580
Or perhaps not, but at least this particular
“touch wood” origin theory seems plausible

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.270
enough with a slightly more direct connection
to the phrase over any ancient spiritual origin

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.300
theories.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.590
Given the two expressions mean pretty much
the same thing and first popped up around

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.060
the same time, there’s bound to be tangible
connection.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.340
Unfortunately, just what that connection is
and how, for certain, these expressions came

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:29.079
to be has been lost to history.
