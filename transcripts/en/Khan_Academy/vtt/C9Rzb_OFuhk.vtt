00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.900
Jeff works as a waiter
at a fancy restaurant.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.850
He receives a base amount of $70
each day plus approximately $10

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.465
of tips for each
client he serves,

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.880
or $10 in tips for
each client he serves.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.200
Assuming x represents
the number of clients

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.530
Jeff will serve in a day and
y represents his daily salary,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.200
draw the graph which
represents Jeff's daily salary

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.510
as a function of the number
of clients he serves.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.300
So he's going to get
$70 no matter what.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.340
So even when x-- so even if he
serves absolutely no clients,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.810
he's going to get $70.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.360
So when x is equal to 0, his
pay for that day is still $70.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.430
Then he gets $10--
they already told us

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.680
he gets $10 in tips for
each client he serves.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.210
So if he goes from serving
0 clients to 1 client,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.340
he's going to get $10 in tips.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.200
If he goes from serving
1 client to 2 clients,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.280
he's going to get
another $10 in tips.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.337
If he goes from serving
2 clients to 3 clients,

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:04.920
he's going to get
another $10 in tips.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.461
And you see that
this line represents

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.620
all the different
possibilities for him.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
If he goes and serves
6 clients, he's

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.460
going to get $60 in
tips plus the $70.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.010
So the $70 he would have made
otherwise plus $60 in tips

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.510
gets him to $130.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.020
So this right here is the line.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.790
So we could check our answer.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670
We got it right.
