00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
Great job. Look at how much you've learned. You now know how to make objects

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.230
from classes and how to call methods on them to make them do things.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.470
&gt;&gt; You've learned how to look up the documentation for classes and methods so you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.425
can find out what they can do and how to make them do it.

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:15.440
&gt;&gt; Also you've learned how to store objects and variables so that you can recall

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.503
them when you need them.

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:19.970
&gt;&gt; Most importantly you've learned how to combine different objects in order to do

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.750
more complicated things.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson you will learn how to write your own classes, so you can

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.591
become a giant that other programmers can stand on.
