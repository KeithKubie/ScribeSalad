00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.580
Objective-C's approach to mutability
differs from Swift in a couple

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.120
fundamental ways.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.000
One relating to how mutability is
achieved for a given type, and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.980
one relating to the probability of an
unintended mutation propagating through

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.550
a program.
