00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Good afternoon.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.820
I'm Larry Appelbaum
with the music division.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.780
I'm here once again
with Dr. Ingrid Monson,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.390
Quincy Jones Professor
of African-American Music

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.960
at Harvard University.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.140
We had an interesting,
stimulating chat the other day

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.520
and I kept thinking
there's more.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.580
There's more to talk
about, more to discuss.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.920
So that's what we're
going to try and do today.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.820
I want to get a sense,
first of all,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.410
for what exactly the
Quincy Jones Professor

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.920
of African-American
Music at Harvard does.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.220
What do you do?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.520
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: What do I do?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.820
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.120
tell us your typical
day at the university.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.420
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Oh, my typical day.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.230
Well, it depends whether
it's a teaching day,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.150
a meeting day, or
a research day.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.450
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Okay.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: But
usually when, you know,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.150
teaching is very time intensive.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.250
And I spend a lot of time
preparing for courses,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.820
continually trying to
update my material.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.260
So there's a lot of preparation
for the teaching of the courses.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.150
There are then faculty meetings
in which we discuss the progress

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.300
of students, deal with what
our curriculum is going to be.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.880
There are departmental

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.430
and university committees
of various kinds.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.770
Now, I'm in two departments

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010
so I actually have
two faculty meetings.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Which two departments?

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.610
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Music and African

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.640
and African-American Studies.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.940
And in African

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.810
and African-American Studies
I service the director

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.570
of undergraduate studies,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.520
which means that I have
office hours every week

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.040
where I'm meeting with people
who are majoring in African

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.540
and African-American Studies
and try to help advise them

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.910
on courses to take or
how to meet the deadlines

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.580
that they need to -- need
to complete their degree

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.190
in a timely fashion, to
turn their senior thesis

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.740
in on time, those
general things.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.020
Faculty members spend
time on search committees.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.440
So, and in search committees
you read the dossiers of many,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.320
many very promising
candidates and then you have

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.290
to discuss them and
come, you know,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.530
and meet with your
colleagues and talk about them.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.720
You have to go to
their interview events,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.670
which include talks and
teaching classes and lunches

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.620
and so on and so forth.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.000
So there's a lot of stuff
that we do that has nothing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to do with, you know, what we
ostensibly got our degrees for,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.410
which is doing research.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.240
So we're always constantly
trying

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.260
to find more time for research.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Of all
those things you just mentioned,

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.990
what are the parts of your
job you enjoy the most?

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.290
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Well, I like teaching.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.030
I love interacting
with the students.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.060
And I love doing my research.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.530
So I would say I
prioritize those two things.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.950
I think I am in the company
of most of colleagues

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.020
when I would say that
meetings are my least favorite.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.180
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Because
they're not always productive

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880
or because they're
political or what?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.590
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
they take up a lot of time.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.890
And sometimes you feel

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.710
like maybe the meeting
wasn't necessary.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.920
Maybe this could have been
handled in some other way.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.790
Did we really, you know,
have to spend an hour

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660
in a meeting about this?

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.030
But this is a common complaint
throughout universities.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.330
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Indeed.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.160
So, I want to get a sense for
the trajectory of your career.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.030
How did you get from being
a practicing musician

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.910
to becoming an educator scholar?

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
I was living in Boston

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.670
and I was playing in a
number of different groups

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.870
after I graduated
from music school,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.840
from New England Conservatory.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.140
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You
were a trumpet player?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.440
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I
was a trumpet player.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.800
I played in the Klezmer
Conservatory Band,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.750
which does Klezmer music.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.540
And that band was
quite successful.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.800
We toured a number of places
and [inaudible] companion

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.160
and that sort of thing.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.000
I also played in salsa bands in
Boston and I played, you know,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.430
pickup jazz gigs where we would
organize them in various spaces

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.890
and places in the Boston area.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.920
I also was doing
a certain amount

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.130
of teaching kids how
to play the trumpet.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.120
So there I was, and you
get tired of touring.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.600
You get tired of traveling.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.920
You get tired of
packing your bag.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.220
And I -- and I felt like I
wanted to be doing more reading.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.970
So I had this thing where
I often did my warmups

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.970
where I was reading things.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.080
Other people were watching TV
while they did their warmups,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.890
but I was -- I was doing quite
a lot of reading and I learned

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.980
about the field of
ethnomusicology.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.930
I think my time at New England
Conservatory exposed me some

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.580
to world music because there
was a man at the conservatory

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.320
at that time named Dr.
Peter Row who was a sitarist

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.600
and I took a class in North
Indian music from him.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.950
And it -- and it was
-- it was mind blowing.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.250
It was amazing.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.820
And so he was a practicing
musician and taught us all sorts

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.360
of things, the bowls, the
verbal sounds that you make

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.190
to speak rhythms
in Indian music.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.470
I read Harry Powers for the
time, who was a musicologist

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.190
at Princeton who wrote
widely about Indian music.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.060
And so I was very, very
fascinated by Indian music

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.410
and that made me, you know,
open to ethnomusicology,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.550
as did playing in Latin
bands in the Boston area,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.850
because that was a --

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.480
that opened up a whole
world to me as well.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Can
you talk just a little bit

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.010
about that world
that's opened up?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.310
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: What, the?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah,
how did it open up to you?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.130
How does playing in a -- in
a Latin band or a salsa band?

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.510
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Okay,
so I played in this band,

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.810
[speaking foreign language],

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.170
and it basically was a
cover band doing covers

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.480
of arrangements by
people like Willie Colon

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.830
or Celia Cruz or
some Tito Puente.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.730
And we played -- and
there are a mixture

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.510
of things in the repertoire.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.020
There were straight
up salsa pieces

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.980
for more Puerto Rican
kind of audience.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.900
Then we played cumbias
for Columbians.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.330
We played merengues
for Dominicans.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.320
So I started to leaned
about, you know, different --

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Rhythms.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.920
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Musical styles associated

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.220
with different subsectors

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.180
of the Spanish speaking
population in the northeast.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.000
And we did gigs at
Lawrence [assumed spelling].

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.930
We did gigs in Boston.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.020
There was a place called The
Latin Paradise and Providence,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.990
in a social club in the Bronx.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.560
And I loved playing the music.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.640
First of all, it's very
trumpet centric, okay.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.300
Secondly, the dancing
that took place

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.620
in these clubs was just amazing.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.110
And I found that as a person
with a jazz background I had

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.920
to learn a different
sense of time to do this.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.190
And I started to learn about
clave, which is a subject

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.170
that had -- that
is very profound,

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.790
that goes -- that
goes very deep.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.090
And I think at the time I was

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.160
in those bands I only
understood that a little bit.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.460
So I --

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.760
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So clave
being sort of the heartbeat

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.300
of rhythm for a lot of these --

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.600
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.270
this idea that there's
a syncopated rhythm,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.040
recurring rhythm that --

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040
around which everything
else is organized.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.870
And that there are
elaborations of this pattern

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.870
that everybody knows that are
played on the [inaudible] drum

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.760
or on the timbales or
what's being played

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.670
on the cowbell at
particular times.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.180
And so, you know, it
piques your curiosity.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.480
It makes you want to learn more.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.430
So I was always the kind of
person who wanted to learn more

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.230
and I enjoyed seeing
these, you know,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.950
communities of people
gathering for this music.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.290
And it was a world I hadn't
had any experience with before,

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.500
but it left me with a, you
know, an open feeling to wanting

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.570
to know more about them.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.460
The same thing with
Indian music.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.240
There was, of course, not
as large of Indian community

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.150
in Boston around the music

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.760
and I didn't really
become a player of it.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.300
But I started going to Indian
music concerts including,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.430
you know, people like Ali Akbar
Khan, who I heard a number

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.650
of times and just
was blown away by.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.520
I mean, if you're
interested in improvisation,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.220
it's just the level of
improvisation that goes

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.590
on in North Indian music
is truly astonishing.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.710
So I wanted to hear, you know,
so I had eclectic tastes.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.780
I wanted, you know, I solely
by did I like the music or not?

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.700
Did it pique my interest enough
to spend more time with it?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.020
So that's why ethnomusicology
became a good place for me.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
your interest is piqued

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.670
in a certain style,
a certain genre.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.660
How do you pursue knowledge,
or even just information

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.360
about these styles when
there's not basic reference

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.790
materials necessarily?

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.090
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Right,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.890
and that was certainly the
case in the early 1980's.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:06.130
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: There was not
much written about Latin music.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.190
There was not -- there was not

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.550
that much world music
available in record stores.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.440
I mean, you probably
remember this yourself.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.770
There was this store in Boston
that carried like the Folkways,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.490
Smithsonian collections,
Folkways collection

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.500
of world music, and I used to
go in and buy those albums.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.300
And it wasn't like now you can
go online and hear a little bit

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.990
of it before you buy it.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.550
You know, you would look at
it, if you liked the cover,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.630
if you thought that the
label was interesting

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.410
or reputable you would
-- you would buy it.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.080
So I would just cold buy
all sorts of records.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.320
And that's how I learned about,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.310
in the Time Square
subway station --

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I remember that.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.910
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: In New York.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.210
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I remember that shop.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.510
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: There
was a Latin record store --

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.810
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.110
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That
everybody went to.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.410
And so every time I went
to New York I would go

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.430
into that record store
and buy Latin records.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.670
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And the guy
who ran it was so knowledgeable.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.970
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.270
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I would
just say, oh, I'm interested

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.950
in really great tres
players, for example.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.250
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, well,
here and out he pulls them.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.270
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And he'd
go in the back and he'd rummage

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.000
through and he'd
pull out six of them

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.620
and I would just buy them
based on recommendation.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.920
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, right.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.820
And there was a place
like this in Boston.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.840
It was a record store in
Mission Hill neighbor --

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.670
in the Mission Hill
neighborhood of Boston,

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.050
and that was a Latin
record store, too.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.970
You couldn't buy that music
at a mainstream record store.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.140
And there weren't things
like Tower Records then.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.050
An evolution started
to happen in the 1980's

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.980
with the establishment
of Tower Records

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.550
and the apparent
starting of this genre

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.140
that becomes called world music.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.980
You have people like Salev Kata
[assumed spelling] emerging.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.250
You have Boba Mall [assumed
spelling] coming to New York.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
All the Afro pop stuff.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.530
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Yes, you get the Afro,

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.800
a lot of Afro pop stuff, but you
also had the mysterious voices

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.090
of the Bulgarian Women,
and I loved that album.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
But how do we account

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.690
for something like that?

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.990
It's just in the culture.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.910
For some reason that caught
on and sold tremendously well.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.330
And I could never figure out,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.620
like where did people
hear about this?

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.000
It didn't get played on
the radio, for example.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.300
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It
wouldn't necessarily be written

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.100
up in the -- in the
mainstream press.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.030
So how do these things
bubble up?

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.330
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, there --

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.710
well, I think it
depends on the context.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.920
But in the case of the Eastern
European stuff, for example,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.020
there was this Bulgarian brass
band in New York that I found

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.590
out about through
my Klezmer circles

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.670
when I started graduate
school at NYU in 1985.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.100
And all of those people
had been, you know,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.040
running around collecting
records in the same way

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.540
of Eastern European music,
Bulgarian records, you know,

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.120
traveling various places,
Yugoslavia, and coming back

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.700
with these rare button
accordion, you know,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.000
recordings and things.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.540
And so those community
organizations in New York,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.040
when they heard that
the Mysterious Voices

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.810
of Bulgaria were coming
to Lincoln Center,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.470
which I think they did,
I think they played

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.250
in Lincoln Center,
they all turned out.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.670
So, in a similar way, when I
played in the Klezmer band,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.360
I mean, this was not a super
huge audience, but the people

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.040
who were devoted to it were
seriously devoted to it

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.270
and it was moving
to play to them.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Were you
always comfortable playing

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.050
in different time signatures?

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.290
For example, a lot of this
ethnic music is based on things

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.850
that is mother's milk
coming for some --

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.040
for people who grew
up in the culture.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.340
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh right.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But for
those of us who were sort

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.730
of conditioned by march music
or by standard swing music,

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.550
those are different rhythms.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.850
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: They
are different rhythms.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.180
And most of the -- most of the
Klezmer stuff was actually not

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.270
in those multiple rhythms.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.080
But members of our band were
deeply interested in the stuff

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.610
that was so we practiced doing
things in seven and 10 and 11.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.230
I had a Bulgarian
brass band record

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.660
that had all those
time signatures in it.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.490
And, you know, you pra --
it, you know, so it's --

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Does
it come easy for you?

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.090
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: The
fun of the challenge?

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.230
Well, yes, I would practice
it and I would get it.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.690
And what's interesting to me
right now is that amongst,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:45.540
you know, now many of the clave
rhythms have become more central

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.900
in jazz as well.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.720
So, in the old days you
didn't necessarily have

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.940
to know clave really well, like
the difference awawa [phonetic]

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:58.750
and koe and a son
montuno or various things.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.060
But now people really
do need to know that.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.930
And people have been doing
clave rhythms in seven.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:10.290
You get somebody like Dafnis
Prieto, for example, from Cuba.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.040
And so a drummer friend of mine,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.480
Ralph Peterson [assumed
spelling], you know, did a --

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.940
was doing, you know, does
a clave thing in seven

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.600
that he expects his band
to be able to play to.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.850
So I think doing some of those
more ambitious meters has sort

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.990
of come into the consciousness.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
So you somehow morphed

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:41.020
from being just a player, your
curiosity leads you to academia.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.220
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I
had always been, you know,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.880
a scholarly sort, too.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.560
And you have to -- the other
axis of my upbringing is I went

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.860
to high school in Madison,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.900
Wisconsin during
the Vietnam War.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:01.420
Madison was very much a
hotbed of antiwar activism.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.160
So I met all those people.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.170
I actually had moved
into my high school

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.550
when I was a sophomore, and so
everybody else had friends there

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.100
from the time they were like in
second grade and I didn't have

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.110
as many friends because
I just moved in.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.920
So I went down to
State Street in Madison

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.280
and I read all the alternative
papers and, you know,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.020
bought music and listened to it.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.590
And then one of my high school
teachers was very much involved

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.560
in some community organizing --

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.290
organizations, and
from then I started

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.440
in Marxist study
groups of various kinds.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.820
So, by the time I was
a sophomore, a junior,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.480
I was reading a lot of political
stuff about the Vietnam War.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.980
Kind of, you know, the Marx --

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.180
reading about Marxism
is really good training

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.780
for social theory
actually as it turns out.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.100
And I think one of the
reasons I did very well

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.930
as a graduate student is I
had a background in that.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.160
I actually was an economics
major at the University

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.570
of Wisconsin and I
took all these courses.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.010
I took George Mosse's [assumed
spelling] history courses.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.030
Harvey Goldberg [assumed
spelling] was on leave

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.450
when I wanted to
take his course.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.940
But these are people
who taught sort

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.510
of progressive history courses.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.190
And so that was the other
side of my background.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.990
And so I was always
interested in reading deeply

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.580
about society and, you know, and
trying to see the relationship

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.100
between music and society.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:40.890
And jazz always had that, you
know, front and center just --

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
When you were

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.160
in Madison was Richard
Davis teaching there?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.460
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.230
and Richard Davis was
an early mentor of mine.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:55.180
I think it was in my junior
year there when he came

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.400
and I played in ensembles.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
He's the base player

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.000
for those who are watching.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.300
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: The bassist.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.600
A wonderful bassist.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.900
And I took his jazz history
class, which he taught based

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.090
on the Smithsonian
collection of classic jazz.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh, really?

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.690
Yeah, interesting.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.380
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And I
was in ensembles with him

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.630
and he was really
nice to me, you know,

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.310
and he was very encouraging
to students.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.510
And there was also on faculty
a woman named Joan Wildman,

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:28.020
who was a pianist and had a
very close relationship to some

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.580
of the people in the
art ensemble of Chicago.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.600
And so she was, you know, had
an avant-garde orientation.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.030
And between the two of them
I became part of a community

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.950
of people playing music at
the University of Wisconsin.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So Roscoe
Mitchell was there, yeah?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.520
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Roscoe Mitchell came.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.770
There were some other
people that came as well.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.220
So, I wonder how much of
this music, and we're talking

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.170
about jazz, but other
styles as well,

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.250
how much of it is still sort
of oral tradition versus things

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.440
that you learned
from reading books

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.370
or attending a conservatory?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.940
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
that's interesting.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.540
When I was coming up, and even
though I went to a conservatory,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.940
at that time there weren't that
many jazz pedagogical materials.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.580
What was available
was fairly minimal.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.850
There were some David
Baker books.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.400
There were -- and so a lot

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.400
of the training was not
focused on these books.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.290
I had a course in the
Lydian Chromatic Concept

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.940
of Tonal Organization --

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
George Russell.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.000
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
From George Russell.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.570
But really, the heart and soul

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.150
of the music really comes
in the oral training.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.020
And also at New England
Conservatory was Ran Blake

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.940
and the third stream
department at that time

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.850
and they really emphasized
learning things by ear.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.110
And I took a third
stream ear training class

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.220
that Hank Esnetsky
[assumed spelling] taught.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.840
And that approach was you
learned your intervals

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.180
by learning songs that
begin with those intervals.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.720
And Ran had this, you know,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.580
[inaudible] of Billie
Holiday songs.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.380
And what we would do, we had
little cassette tape recorders

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.310
and there would be a song
assigned every week and we had

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.280
to sing it back onto
our tape recorder

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.580
until we had it in our head.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.580
And there's certain Billie
Holiday songs I will never

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.900
forget as a result,
like no more.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.320
You know, so I thought that was
a wonderful way to do things.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.480
But then jazz, we always were
transcribing things, too,

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.840
to try to figure things out.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By the
way, what can you learn

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.690
from transcribing either
a solo or a composition?

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.790
What do -- what's that
process teach you?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.190
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: There
are a lot of things.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.640
First of all, by the process

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.960
of translating the sounds
[inaudible] notation can be

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.260
very challenging.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.320
And one of the things, in
order to transcribe it,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.530
you usually have
to repeat it a lot.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.830
So one of the things

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.310
about transcribing something
is it forces you to listen

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.170
to things at a level
of closeness

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.260
that you would not otherwise do.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.590
And once you've listened to a
piece enough to transcribe it

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.170
into notation, it's deeply
in your head in a way

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:24.320
that it would not have
been if you didn't do that.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.900
There are many schools
of thought on this.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.390
Some people think
that, you know,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.880
just learn to play
along with it.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.240
Ran always used to
emphasize singing,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.140
learning to sing
it before trying

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.490
to play it on your instrument.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.790
And that, I think it comes

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.490
out of a Tristano kind
of idea about this.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.300
And I think it's
actually very effective.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:49.220
Now, I find personally if I just
learn it by ear and I go back

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.070
to it and I don't play it
or think about it for a year

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.220
and I come back, it's sort of
like I have to do it again.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.160
Maybe other people, you
know, it stays in longer,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.870
but I find that if
I don't use it.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.080
So it's nice to have
had it written

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.260
down so I can relearn it.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now,
there are certain aspects,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.800
especially of jazz performance,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.910
or even of recordings,
that embody sound.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.510
It's not just notes.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.810
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That's right.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.110
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And so, for example,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.030
you can transcribe the notes
that Ben Webster plays,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:32.050
but how do you get to his
sound, that breathiness, that,

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.010
you know, it's like the
sound of someone's voice.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.310
It tells you so much.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.610
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Absolutely.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.910
And it does.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.070
And I think that brings
up a really key point

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.210
about the limitation
of transcription,

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.390
is that it gives you two
parameters, rhythm and pitch.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.650
And there are a lot
more parameters

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.350
in the fullness of sound.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:56.360
So, but part of learning a
piece by ear from a recording is

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.750
to try to emulate the sound.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.840
So people, as a trumpet
player trying

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.520
to emulate Miles Davis'
sound, for example,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.930
or Lee Morgan's sound.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.520
These are things that
people do try to do.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.400
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And is
this what you try to do?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.700
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yeah.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.000
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, was
there somebody that was a model

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.300
for you as a trumpet player?

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.390
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, no,
I like a number of them.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.930
But, you know, there are always
-- there are a number of people

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.580
who are high on my list.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: For example?

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.180
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Miles
Davis is high on my list.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.400
Lee Morgan is, I love his sound.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.940
You know, just, I mean, as --

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.740
the quality of sound
on the instrument.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:36.740
I like that rich sound,
dense sound that he gets.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.980
I studied for a while
with Woody Shaw and I

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.440
like his playing extremely much.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.810
I mean, it's really hard

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.280
to do what Woody does,
okay, you know, so.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you mean
harmonically or rhythmically or?

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.790
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.530
all these incredible pentatonic
patterns that he developed.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.910
I have -- I still have
these exercises of his

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.620
that he gave me that I practice.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.580
But the way he was able
to phrase with them.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.330
So I think the other thing,
it's not so much the notes

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.380
or even the quality of the
sound, it's a kind of sense

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.400
of phrasing that you get -- that
you -- where you try to emulate.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.650
Like, I think that's absolutely
key in Charlie Parker.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.580
I mean, I don't know if
you've ever heard kids

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.600
who are just reading Charlie
Parker transcriptions compared

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.020
to the ones who've actually
listened to the solos

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.070
and are trying to get to the
places where he swallows notes

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.530
and accents notes and things,
which are really, you know,

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.110
key to sounding anything
like him.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I just
wonder if we're going to get

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.030
to the point, sort of a
next level of being able

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.280
to notate the more
idiosyncratic aspects

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.550
of music production,
of sound production.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: You
know, I don't know.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.080
I mean, this is a big
debate and, you know,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.510
there have been debates about
this in ethnomusicology.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.810
There's always this thing

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.480
about what good is
transcription and what for.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.000
And if you -- if
you sit down a class

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.540
and you have 12 people
transcribe the same thing,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.430
you're going to have subtle
differences in all of them.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:17.060
And then people like Charles
Seeger tried to do things

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:24.130
like the Melograph, where you
see these sound spectrums.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.780
And I look at that and it's

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.770
like I can't do anything
with that, you know.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.140
I can't translate a
sound out of that.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.000
At least with notation
I can translate a sound.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.640
I get something that looks
like a sound out of it.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.060
There are people who are doing
really interesting things

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.210
about trying to visualize music.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.260
And I'm fascinated by this guy.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.450
There's this guy, I wish I could
remember his name right now,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:54.690
but he does these elaborate --
he does it by making MIDI --

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.890
you know, entering MIDI
parts to everything,

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.310
like the Beethoven Symphony.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.960
And there's a guy who does James
Jamerson baselines like this.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.760
Enter it -- he's a
bassist and he uses MIDI

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.720
to enter all the notes.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.620
And then you can create
an animation of it

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.830
where it moves in
time to the music.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.130
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I've seen that, yeah.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.000
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And you
can have different colors

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.830
and different walls of sound to
try to -- you know, there's --

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.770
one of these tries
to -- gives --

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:30.440
you know, make crunchy harmonic
sounds in Chopin visible

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.750
through colors on that.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.420
So I think we're always trying
to come up with new ways

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.670
to represent music, and
I'm always trying to come

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.300
up with new ways to
present music to my students

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.550
where they hear more than
they started hearing.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.400
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The
other day when you first came

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.130
and we were looking through
some of the treasures

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:52.010
in the collection, I showed you
a piece by Wadada Leo Smith.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.310
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
As an example of sort

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.800
of non-traditional notation.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.710
And he is a great example of
somebody who is trying to break

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.280
through sort of old models --

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.580
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And teach
in a way that goes like straight

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.710
to the heart, or sometimes
it bypasses the brain.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.730
Antony Braxton is another one

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.680
who makes use of
non-traditional --

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.980
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Absolutely.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Notation.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.580
Yeah.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.880
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And both

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.180
of them are very intellectually
engaged in their own way.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.190
I mean, I've, you know,
had the pleasure of talking

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.500
with Wadada Leo Smith and
seen him do a presentation

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.200
on the [inaudible].

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.990
And it's a system.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:37.780
It's a very clearly,
deeply thought out way

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.510
of representing these things,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.380
and he uses it productively
in his own art.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.810
And Anthony Braxton, the same.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.910
All those numbers and
circles and things as titles

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.580
of the pieces, he was
very much, very interested

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.710
in signs, a very brainy guy.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.200
So, you know, I think there's
a tradition of people trying

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.660
to find new ways
of representing.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.020
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Thank goodness.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.830
So all of this was sort
of background and context

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.800
for you telling me,
or explaining to me,

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.500
how you get from being a
player to becoming the teacher.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.440
And I'll preface this part

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.370
by asking what do you
think makes a good teacher?

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.320
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: A thing that
makes a good teacher is getting

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:33.460
to know your students and
hear them, listening to them.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.430
You may end up arguing with
them about certain things,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.760
but if you don't know your
students you're not going

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.520
to be very effective
at reaching them.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.710
And this is why teaching
in a small group

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.540
or a small is the
ideal situation.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.380
It gets harder.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.450
The larger the class gets,
the harder it is to get

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.010
that same feeling of
back-and-forth and exchange

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.630
and really knowing all the
students that you're talking to.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.930
Then --

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So do
you teach undergrad and grad?

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.530
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I do, yes.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And the
undergrad classes I assume

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.170
are larger?

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.470
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
No, not all of them.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:15.770
Some of them are small.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.380
They are different sizes, but
there are courses at Harvard

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.470
and things that they
called general education

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.000
that tend to be larger courses.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.140
And they've -- I've tried
to teach a couple of those.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.530
For one, I started on R
and B [inaudible] class.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:34.570
It started out with 17 people
and then when it got --

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.060
all of a sudden I had 150
in it when it got approved

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.440
for general education.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.740
And those courses are often ones
where we have section leaders

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.320
that employ our graduate
students.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.640
So I try to have a mixture

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.540
of the larger ones
and the smaller ones.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.350
And even though I prefer
teaching smaller classes I felt

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.060
like I should teach
the larger class

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.650
because the graduate
students need

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:01.450
to have some experience
teaching as well.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now,

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.970
do you teach those same
classes year after year?

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.510
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
About every other year.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.850
I do -- I do one large
lecture course a year.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:12.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And how does
it change from year to year?

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.690
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh,
it changes every time.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.720
You know, I do a course
called jazz freedom in culture

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.350
and I have noticed a
difference in the knowledge

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.750
that people have
coming into a course.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.900
The old expectation in a
jazz course is to teach the,

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.050
you know, the full
history of jazz.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:41.020
I have wanted to have
more recent jazz in it.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.100
You know, I, you know, I've --
lately I've given some thought

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.710
of doing it backwards or doing
it in dialogue where I start

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.910
with something really
recent before I jump back

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.640
to New Orleans and talk about
where it -- where it came from.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.540
Because it's hard to get our
current undergraduate students

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.150
to really get into
listening to scratchy 78's.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.570
That's -- they keep
wanting the later --

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.810
they keep wanting Miles
Davis and Coltrane.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.810
It used to be that a lot

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:17.970
of people really loved
hearing the avant-garde section

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.050
of the course, too.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.200
Now that's a tougher sell.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.740
So I've been trying to juxtapose
some noise in hip-hop with noise

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.710
from '60s avant-garde stuff
to show them the relationship

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.400
to it, so they just don't
think, well, that's old stuff

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.850
and why did people do
that in the first place.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:44.350
You know, I think of the younger
generation as being adventurous

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.980
or of thinking of themselves
as being adventurous,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:55.180
but then I put on Sun
Ra, Space is the Place,

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.360
and they don't know
what to do with it,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.300
you know, kind of at first.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So how --

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
What is this about?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.200
Yeah.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: How
do they process this,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.800
or are they looking
to you to provide --

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.100
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I try
to give them some process.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.350
I have them, you
know, read materials.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.450
Like John Szwed's book is
absolutely wonderful on Sun Ra.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.340
So I assigned the
reading for that.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.420
But usually they haven't
read it before, you know,

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.740
they get to the class on
Sun Ra and I'm playing,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.440
you know, materials from it.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.760
And I -- so I just try to --

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.840
Give them, you know,
some understanding

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.550
about where he was coming
from and why he managed

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.570
to create his own
world in a world

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.990
that was not necessarily
welcoming to what he was about,

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.410
and he did an amazing
job of it actually.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What
are the kind of required --

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.780
what's the -- what's the
required reading list

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.250
for your classes?

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.550
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It depends --

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
What kind of authors?

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.150
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It
depends on the course,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.450
but I always have a Amiri
Baraka, A Blues People.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
It's standard.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:03.080
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Because it, you know,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.450
it's a really brilliant book.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.890
And it has an ambitious
-- it's social theory.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.110
I mean, I have a piece that
I never published but I put

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.640
up online called Amiri
Baraka as a Social Theorist.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.490
And he really had this idea
of the path from slavery

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:26.160
to citizenship and the way
African-Americans are feeling

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.970
in the world can be
followed through music.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:34.660
And he drew on, he read
Herskovitz, he read all sorts

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.030
of anthropology in it, and so
he's constantly trying to look

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.070
at the relationship of
African-Americans to the music,

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.110
but also in Blues People

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.930
of white people's
relationship to it.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.850
So he talks about
[inaudible] back in there.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:55.860
He talks about white
beboppers as being as marginal

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.570
as African-American beboppers,

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.680
but it was a matter
of choice, okay.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.610
Kind of -- that's
kind of how he put it.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.230
So that's -- I have
them read Ralph Ellison.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.870
I have them read Albert Murray.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:14.120
I have them read books by any
one of a number of jazz scholars

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.620
from Scott DeVoe to Gunther
Schuller to, you know,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:24.700
Robin Kelly's biography
of Thelonious Monk.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.340
I also have them read articles
from journals at the time.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.780
They love actually
reading the articles

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.480
from Downbeat during
the civil rights era.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.700
So the, you know, big debates

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.260
that were published
in Downbeat Magazine.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:46.260
Articles by Nat Hentoff,
you know, they enjoy.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:52.090
At one point when Nat was
still with us, I had Nat come

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.350
to a class that we did
on Freedom Now Suite

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:00.430
and we read the debate
and he read the article

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.840
and then he was there and
the students were able

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.610
to ask him questions,
and they loved that.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:07.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
So if people --

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:13.820
if anyone were to make a
Freedom Now Suite for today,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.850
what would it sound like?

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.050
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I think
we're beginning to see some

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:24.040
of what those sounds are in
response to Black Lives Matter.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.830
I've seen it in the
last two or three years.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.510
I noticed a difference in
the attitude of my class

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.710
when I taught the
class last spring.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.560
It's now that there
is a movement

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.890
on the ground there is a
sense of the younger people

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:45.440
of what is the relationship
to it going to be?

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.770
One of the albums that I think
is interesting that has come

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.790
out is Terence Blanchard's
Breathless.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.620
I don't know if you've
listen to that.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I have.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.880
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: In which
he's got some spoken word,

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.180
things going on.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.270
And the piece Breathless,
the poet, I think --

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.750
the title track I think is
really very, very interesting

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.020
and he's playing his beautiful
trumpet solos with a band

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:17.480
that is kind of playing
more elaborate versions

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.890
of some popular music
groups but,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.860
you know, are absolutely jazz.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:28.390
He sees used a Cornell West
speech on that and he's trying

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.120
to -- in Breathless he's trying
to talk about Eric Garner.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.420
So that's one example.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.410
So I think different
musicians, as things hit them,

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.650
are going to inspire new ways.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:45.470
Now, I was very interested
in Kendrick Lamar's album.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.770
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
To Pimp a Butterfly.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.070
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.370
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And
what I noticed there,

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.120
I've been interested in the
jazz people that are trying

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.590
to have some relationship

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.440
to the hip-hop world,
people like Glasper.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.990
But in this case it sounded
like a hip-hop or trying

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.350
to have a relationship to a
certain kind of jazz sound.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.210
And what I was interested
in is that there were parts

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:11.340
of that sort of avant-garde
saxophone sound.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Kamasi Washington is --

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.220
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
One of them, yeah.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.820
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Yes, yes, exactly.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.120
I'm not sure Kamasi is
actually on that album.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.990
I think somebody else is on that
album, but I could be wrong.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.990
But anyway, there is this
sense that there is this sound,

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.020
there's an assertiveness to
the sound and it has some kind

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.530
of relationship to the message

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.710
that Kendrick Lamar
is trying to put out.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:37.930
And so it's putting that
sound world into hip-hop.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:43.050
This artful, you know, and the
upping the sense of artfulness

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.010
in hip-hop, not that it
hasn't always been there.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.280
And I think we'll see artists
coming to different kind

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.120
of collaborations
along those lines.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:38:03.970
And so Robert Glasper and his
stuff, with amazing singers,

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:11.930
Erykah Badu and others,
there is this kind

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.080
of dialogue between the two.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.290
And then what -- and then
I was absolutely blown away

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.880
by Beyonce's Lemonade.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.720
Now, I wouldn't quite say
it was putting jazz into it,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.900
but there was a level of
artistic ambition in it

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.520
that seemed to me
really informed

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.620
by understanding
African-American history

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.210
and particularly women's voices
within that that's drawing on,

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.790
you know, there's -- there
has been this presence

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.230
in African-American studies
since I entered the Academy

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.290
in the '80s, these rich
sources of history.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:57.070
Writers like Toni Morrison,
and examples like Toni Morrison

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.800
or Audre Lorde and
things that are --

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.760
that people are studying
in deep ways

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.310
and that you see them
inspiring a younger generation

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.610
of musicians.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.890
So it's going to be
interesting in the next year

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.710
when we start getting
some artworks that are --

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.850
that will be speaking to
the election of Trump.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I would imagine so.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.820
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I think
they're going to blow our minds.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Well, I mean, I guess --

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.540
this brings another
question to mind.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.410
Many creative artists
have always had their ear

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.000
to the ground of
what's happening

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.330
in the culture, you know.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.100
And yet when music
is often inspired

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.490
by popular culture it
can reach more people

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:53.220
because of the message, but it
doesn't seem to last as long.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.040
It has a shorter shelf life.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.320
Whereas certain of what --

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.630
certain items that we
would consider classics

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.630
in jazz are relevant for
a much longer period.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:11.760
And I wonder whether things
that seize upon what's happening

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.100
at the moment, is it
just music of the moment

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.370
or does this become
a classic expression?

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Well, I think in a lot

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.970
of these things they
become classic.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.110
I think a lot of the
popular music stuff became --

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.610
I mean, Marvin Gaye's What's
Going On became classic,

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:33.350
Curtis Mayfield, that I do think
a certain number of those works

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:40.300
in popular music
do become classics.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.150
And we're not sure what are
going to become classics

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.360
from what's coming out at
this moment and we don't --

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.480
we're not sure whether there
will be classics coming

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.630
out of it at this
moment in jazz either.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, a
fascinating example of that,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.910
for me, is I'd say in the
1960's, certainly late '60s

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:03.840
into the early '70s, a lot
of jazz musicians who wanted

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.860
to attract a larger audience,
a more popular audience,

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.630
would adopt certain
rhythms and certain sounds,

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.310
especially if you look
at Blue Note Records

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.380
under the Mizell
brothers, right?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.750
And that stuff did become
popular in its day and then

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.890
for a long period
of time was dormant

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.060
and then it got rediscovered by
people who started sampling it.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.360
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Sampling it, absolutely.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.660
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.960
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Cantaloupe
Island for one, yeah.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.590
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
it's not always easy

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.510
to predict these things,

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:39.150
but it's fascinating how certain
modes of expression are cyclical

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.770
and they have a life
beyond a generation.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.070
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Absolutely.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.370
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It can
actually skip a generation.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I
think that they do.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.970
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.270
So --

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.660
What -- I want you to
talk a little bit more

00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:00.560
about your students and, I mean,
you've been at this for a while.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.680
You've been teaching how long?

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.310
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Since 1991.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.670
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Okay, more than a minute.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:11.380
And so, how have your
students changed?

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.680
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Well, first of all,

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.760
when I started I was
closer to their age, okay.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:24.150
And I felt like my own
understanding of things

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.130
in the world and theirs
were not very different.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Okay.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.060
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And so I could
talk about jazz or popular music

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.970
or world music in ways --

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.250
You know, that I -- that I felt
were easier to communicate.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.500
Now, over the years then you
become stuck in this role

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.080
of you're the teacher and
you have to grade them.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.250
You have to give
them assignments.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.510
You have to, you know, so you
start to become a certain kind

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:59.120
of disciplinarian,
whether you want to or not,

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.740
because the nature of the
university is such that you have

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.390
to grade them, unless
you're teaching at a school

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.180
that doesn't have grades,
in which case then you have

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.670
to write lots of letters of
rec -- you know, basic --

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.950
you have to write lots
of letters about them.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.600
The students when I started
teaching were more aware

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.340
of the real history of the civil
rights movements I would say.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:32.620
It was in the experience
of their parents rather

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.970
than their grandparents.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:39.280
And they were open-minded
towards a, you know,

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:47.480
wanting to tear down racism
view of teaching jazz.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.620
And white students, black
students, they were open to --

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.850
they were open to
that narrative.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:59.090
I learned in the
first five years

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:04.210
that there would be a certain
group of white students

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.270
in the class who would be
resistant to wanting to think

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.900
that anything about race

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.580
or African-American history
mattered to the class.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.120
Why do we have to
read all this stuff?

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.850
Can't we just listen
to the music, you know?

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.560
And they were more comfortable
in a space of wanting to turn it

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.330
into a technical problem.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.940
And I always felt, you know,
in many cases when I taught

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.480
in St. Louis, for example,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.840
there would be very few
African-American students

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.140
in the class.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.900
And the poor students who were
there always felt, you know,

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.650
sort of, you know, put on
the spot of having to speak

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.640
for the entire culture.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.640
And some of them enjoy doing
that and others just, you know,

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.970
found it -- found it depressing.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.910
I did get a reputation as
being a sympathetic teacher.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.690
And so I, the more I was there
more African-American students

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.460
came to my class and once --

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.890
and I really learned that
once there was a critical mass

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.470
of diversity in the
classroom you had a much more

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.460
interesting conversation.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:16.820
And it was also very
educational for the students

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.930
to find themselves
in a situation

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.840
where there was more
than a critical mass.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.320
Now, when I came to Harvard,

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.870
Harvard had a bigger
critical mass.

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.270
So really the last time I taught
my R and B soul class, about --

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:34.140
at least 40% of the class
was African-American,

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.050
maybe about 40% was white,

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.630
and the rest was
African-American and Hispanic.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.350
So there was a real
diverse group of people.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.640
So I really tried
to teach it in a way

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.090
that the African-Americans
felt like their side

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:54.540
of the story was going
to be the predominant one

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.420
and the white students
had to deal with it.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.080
And many of them do and
rise to the occasion.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.330
And they're a self-selecting
group of the white students.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.630
If you don't -- you know,

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.910
I teach it as an
African-American studies class

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:12.960
so they know that they're
going to have to deal with race

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.360
when they come to the class.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.170
So it's a self-selecting group
of people who want to do that.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.130
But I really try to get them
to engage with one another

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.320
and have the teaching sections,

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.210
have honest conversations
about these issues.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.150
Now, in some cases
there are flare ups

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.580
on various things
that the TF's handle.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: For example?

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.490
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: There --

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:45.660
What's come up in
terms of hip-hop is

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.730
that the African-American
students really don't want

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.040
to see the white kids
singing along to songs

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.280
with the N word in them.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.480
And many of the white students
were going I'm just singing

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.780
along to this song.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.080
It's on the, you know.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:07.200
So, having a debate
about that, for example.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.500
And that's something that's
changed since, you know,

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.020
nobody -- the prevalence
of that word

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:19.300
in some hip-hop has created
a different discussion

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.600
around this.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:30.100
I would manage feelings of
students who would say, well,

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.690
you're talking about all this
African-American history,

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:35.260
you're excluding
the white musicians.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.290
Okay, so this becomes
then a conversation

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:43.870
about let's examine exclusion
here for a minute and who is --

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.210
who experiences exclusion
in this society

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.350
and what that's about.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.430
And, you know, it's
not like I don't teach

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.420
about any white musicians, you
know, but that I try to put it

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:03.320
in the context of this in the
very racially unequal structure

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.050
of the music industry in
the early 20th century.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.650
So, you know, trying to talk
about Benny Goodman in a way

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.300
that says that, look,
by the standards

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:16.750
of his time he was
a progressive.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.100
But a later generation would
look back and say, well,

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.170
this is an example of
white appropriation.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:22.960
He took Fletcher
Henderson's arrangement

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.770
and he became a rich
person on the air

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:29.500
and the black bands couldn't
get the sponsored radio.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.110
So I try to get them to
have a more complex view.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.900
I don't want them
to just say, okay,

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.800
Benny Goodman is
just an exploiter.

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.940
I want them to see the dynamic

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:44.440
about what gave him white
privilege in that situation.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.590
And so, why it's natural

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:51.670
that some other people
were resentful of that.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:57.080
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you ever
get kind of negative feedback

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.300
about a white woman teaching
about African-American culture?

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.600
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.900
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
You still get that?

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.200
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That's okay.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.560
Well, they -- it comes with the
-- it comes with the territory.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.400
And I think any white person
who's working with this is,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.690
you just have to expect
that there's going

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:18.040
to be some ambivalence,
and that's okay.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.820
And I've had, you know,
at the same time I've had

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.220
that I've also had
wonderful experiences

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.830
of people really
warmly responding to me,

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.310
African-American scholars
and students and things

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:32.540
that I wouldn't give up
for anything, and sometimes

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.570
that I've been surprised by.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:38.450
So they're both sides of things.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:42.770
I think, you know, it
matters, your attitude matters

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.010
and attitude of respect
matters and attitude

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.190
of knowing what you're
talking about helps.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.660
Even so, you know, I try to say
to my students I'm not trying

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.020
to tell you to think just
like I do about this.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.020
This is why I think about it.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.620
You know, here's why
I think what I think.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.150
It may look different
to your generation.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.910
You need to have these
conversations among yourselves

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.210
about this.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.010
At the same time, you know,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.670
sometimes I feel very white
standing up there going,

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:16.610
here I am, going on
about issues of race,

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:17.910
music, and culture again.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:24.440
And I try to tell myself, and I
think the good part of this is,

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.500
I often tell my students,
you know,

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.000
that one of the things
I've always been interested

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.660
in exploring is like what
would an ethical relationship

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.760
to African-American
music and culture be?

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:43.890
I'm not saying I'm it, but
I'm saying that I would

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.440
like to be more like that, okay.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:53.250
So I think being
honest about that

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.670
as a white person
you have privilege.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:01.180
You know, and being aware
of that and, you know,

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.680
mentioning all the cont
-- you know, every --

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.460
you know, every -- you know, one
thing I've said to the students,

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:10.940
everybody, you know, how
come everybody wants access

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.240
to the good parts

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.250
of African-American
culture, the fun parts.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.770
They want access to the music

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:17.340
and they say you won't
let me, you know.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.270
And so they'll lay this trip on
African-American musicians, oh,

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.780
you're excluding
me, excluding me.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.300
Nobody wants the privilege
to be profiled on the --

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.220
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.960
Nobody wants the privilege
of having lousy schools

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.320
in their neighborhood, you know.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.300
So I try to get the
non-African-Americans to think

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.670
about if you really want to
appreciate, it's not just

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.000
about appreciating the music,

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.410
it's about appreciating
the people and the culture.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So as
you encourage your students

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.790
to have their own conversations
and to work with these concepts,

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.700
are you ever surprised
by their insights?

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.290
Do they come up with
new things each year?

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:06.590
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, they do.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.700
I mean, and I could write
a whole thing about,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.120
especially in the smaller
courses I teach where I get

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.220
to read all their papers.

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.830
Some of the students
write amazing things.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:18.130
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I
mean, are you surprised

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:22.260
by what they come up with?

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.480
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I'm having
trouble thinking of, you know,

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.270
one single example
that can show you.

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:32.830
But, one of my -- I had a
student when I first came

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.620
to Harvard, and he's
now in our faculty.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.120
His name is Brandon Terry.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.950
He's a political scientist.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.370
And I taught my jazz class,
and I think it was the one

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:43.690
where Nat Hentoff came, and he
wrote the most amazing paper.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.680
Of course, this is
about 12 years ago

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.710
so I can't tell you exactly
what the paper was about.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.780
It was extremely well written.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.860
Then I had -- then I
taught another class

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.930
where we did Motown and --

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.850
Motown had the manners
lady, Mrs. --

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh, the one

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:09.450
who taught all the groups
how to behave and --

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:12.540
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, you
know, and she taught Marvin Gaye

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.460
to not close his eyes while
he's singing, you know.

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.030
Well, he traced her
down in Detroit

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.870
and did a phone interview
with her --

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:22.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Great, great.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.500
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: About it so.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There
was also Cholly Atkins,

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.490
we used to --

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:28.790
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Cholly
Atkins, the dancer.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:30.090
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Teach
him choreography, yeah.

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.820
That was cool stuff.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.120
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
You know, and then,

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.800
so the students sometimes would
have the idea that Motown, okay,

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.200
they were just trying
to act white.

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.680
And I've always thought
that's kind of unfair, okay,

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.150
given what, you know, they
were -- this was the --

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.120
a really successful business.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.270
And, yes, they systematically --

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:53.690
they strategically tried
to do it so it would --

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.350
so it would make it
into the mainstream,

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.770
and brilliantly it did.

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The
sound of Young America.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.460
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And The Funk
Brothers and James Jamerson.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:04.630
There's, you know, that's
not a compromise with,

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.970
you know, musical sound.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
But you've mentioned --

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.640
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: You
know, but the students do.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.010
You know, they ask questions
that you don't expect

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:18.620
and you respond to it

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.690
and sometimes it
can be fun doing it.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.410
And when you're on
it's really fun.

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:24.710
Some days you're not on.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you like
to be challenged as a professor?

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.880
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes,

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.300
it depends on the
kind of challenge.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Respectful?

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, yeah,

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.200
if I feel like I'm being
insulted then it's a drag.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.910
But I won't lash out at them no
matter how insulting they are.

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.670
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do
they try and bait you?

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Not often.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.210
Not often.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:51.960
Now, what -- most of them are
usually pretty respectful.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.830
But if I say something
they disagree with,

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.780
then I try to deal with it
and listen to them, and I may

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.670
or may not agree with
their point of view,

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:05.880
may think they're being unfair.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.660
If I feel like the reaction
-- what I'm getting is sexist,

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.240
I get a little icy [laughter].

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.540
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I would imagine.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.840
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Okay, so.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.300
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah,
this is not surprising, yeah.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.150
So do you think your students,

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:27.400
or students at Harvard are
typical of students everywhere?

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.900
I mean, are students students?

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.400
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: In many ways I
do think students are students.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.550
You know, we do have
some extraordinary,

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.530
extraordinary undergraduates
at Harvard

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:40.040
that can completely
blow your mind.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.120
And then there are
others who are, you know,

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.880
no matter how smart they
are they're still kids.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.780
They're still 18,
19, 20 years old

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:52.040
and they have all the
potential in the world,

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.280
but they don't know
all that much yet.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.940
But I also found that I had
wonderful students when I taught

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:00.590
at Washington University
in St. Louis, when I taught

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.370
at the University of
Michigan, when I taught

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.930
at the University
of Chicago, okay.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:07.910
So I haven't taught at any
school that was a, you know,

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:11.760
you know, all those
schools are good schools.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.720
But I do think that students
can get overly obsessed

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:22.520
about what going to a particular
school means about them.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.610
Because there's plenty of
students at the University

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.770
of Wisconsin, for
example, who are as good

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:30.240
as any Harvard student.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.430
You know, and there have
been studies about this.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:37.700
There's an economist at
Stanford who did work

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:46.010
on Caroline [assumed spelling],
what's her, something with an H,

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:51.320
who did a systematic study
of what people's SAT's were

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.600
in all kinds of public schools,
Chicago, Detroit, you know,

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.340
the whole -- the whole country.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:02.320
And the interesting thing was
that many of the working class

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.360
and inner-city neighborhoods,
there were plenty of kids

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.320
that had scores that would
be competitive for getting

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.080
into a top school,
but not as many

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.740
of those students
applied to those schools.

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:17.360
So I think that there are plenty
of students across the country,

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.280
and I think an earlier
generation

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.710
of African-American students,
and I think like about somebody

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:27.110
like Anthony Braxton or
people who were in the AACM,

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:30.430
they went to like Roosevelt
University and Chicago,

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:34.200
or Governors State
University, you know,

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.470
less prestigious schools,

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:44.070
but they got themselves
very educated.

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:47.110
So I'm against the
snobbery about the schools.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.970
And the problem with
Harvard is --

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.340
I shouldn't say.

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.140
I shouldn't say this on
camera [laughter], okay.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.690
Well, it's -- they
get a little were

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.530
over invested in their brand.

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.240
But I'm the ben -- I have to
say, I'm the beneficiary of that

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.800
so I can't complain too much.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.410
They pay -- they make
my life possible.

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
You used the word,

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.650
did you use the word snobbery?

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.590
Was that something
you just mentioned?

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:21.330
Anyway, I'm curious if you
think there's an intelligentsia

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.980
in jazz?

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.280
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.490
Jazz is an intelligentsia
in some ways.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:28.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But
who are they actually

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.720
and what do they do?

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.380
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Okay.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.730
Well, I think, you know --

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:36.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Are
they just gatekeepers or no?

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:37.830
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Well, I don't know.

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:39.130
It's interesting.

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.920
I mean, there -- jazz has always
had the self-confidence to sort

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:45.200
of understand that
it's important.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.200
And that in order to
become the musicians that --

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:56.540
musicians became they
had to be, you know,

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.590
they had to work
really hard and they had

00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.900
to learn a lot of things.

00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.390
And they became interested
in trying to be artists.

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:07.240
I mean, the path of getting jazz
recognized as an art was a --

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.590
was a movement in many ways.

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.680
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Does
this really start with bebop

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.150
or were people self-aware --

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:14.450
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, there's
bebop, no, it's happening --

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Even before?

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:17.050
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Before that.

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:18.350
You know, Armstrong

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:19.650
and Ellington are no
slouches along these lines.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.100
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: No, I'm just
talking about the awareness,

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:24.810
the self-awareness
not only as artists.

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:27.220
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It becomes
more pronounced after bebop,

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.820
but I, you know, I
think someone, you know,

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:35.660
someone like Coleman Hawkins or,
it evolved with the time of it.

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:41.830
So there's an insider quality of
talk among the jazz community,

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.130
however you define it.

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:45.330
And I think of the jazz
community as being comprised

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:53.540
of musicians, of people
who run clubs, of critics,

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:58.760
of presenters, and
audience, you know,

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.360
members who are devoted
and they come.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.330
I always used to marvel when I
lived in New York and when I was

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:08.350
in graduate school that you
would go to Bradley's or any one

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.690
of the clubs, and the same
people were at these concerts,

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:16.810
or jazz, you know, this was
before jazz at Lincoln Center.

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:22.370
This was, you know, you
know, even the concerts

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.510
that would happen
at Carnegie Hall or,

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:29.050
you would see the
same people there

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.510
and you would see
the critics there.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:32.480
And I remember going to,
you know, for example,

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.750
I remember going to an Ornette
concert at Carnegie Hall.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:40.110
And the first half
was a Japanese singer

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:42.330
who Ornette was promoting
in some kind of way

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:43.760
and trying to give a chance.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.540
Well, let's just say that the
New York jazz audience wasn't

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.840
responding that well.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.560
Everybody sort of left
and went to the bar

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.310
and came back -- came back out.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.870
But you would see those -- you
would see those same people.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:01:00.110
So within this very large
multimillion city there was a

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:05.480
small town feeling about
the people who came

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.780
out to the jazz concerts.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.710
And I think we've
always really liked that,

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:11.590
but it is kind of insular.

01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:16.150
And other people think
we're snobs, you know,

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.520
or there is such thing as
a jazz snob that, you know,

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.040
there's a certain kind of
person you're talking to,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.530
a record collector, and unless,
you know, so I have Mingus',

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.550
Charles Mingus presents
Charles Mingus.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.430
And the other one has,
well, I have a, you know,

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:34.340
and a recitation of record
numbers and everything.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.810
And usually we're just being
excited about what we're doing.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:39.110
But there is a little
ranking thing that --

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:40.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Sure.

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.710
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That goes on.

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
The matrix boys.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:44.310
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes,
the matrix numbers boys.

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.610
And I always felt like --

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:46.940
and then sometimes there
was this certain kind

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.830
of male conversation
that would go on,

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:52.130
that no matter how much
I tried to insert myself

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.000
in the conversation they
were talking to each other

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.340
and I was [inaudible].

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, isn't
collecting a male impulse,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.550
or am I being sexist there?

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:03.620
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, if you
talk to Krin Gabbard he will say

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:07.630
to you that -- say that
it is a male impulse.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.090
Sherry Tucker is a collector.

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:13.980
And so Sherry would argue
with Krin that, you know,

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.760
there was nothing in your DNA
that made you a collector.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
It's just when you go

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.850
to certain communities,
if you circulate --

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.150
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Yes, that jazz --

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You'll see

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:23.750
that it's somewhat
predominantly --

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:25.050
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It is guys.

01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:26.350
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Male.

01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:27.650
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:28.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And some are not so.

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:31.770
And even within the
jazz community at large,

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:35.050
there are sub-communities
based on different genre.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:36.350
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh yes.

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.650
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
it's not as if somebody

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:40.100
who likes jazz likes all
different kinds of jazz.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.400
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That's right.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.660
Now, I'm the kind that likes
all different kinds of jazz.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.530
I sort of feel like being
a scholar makes you want

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.890
to advocate for all of that.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.100
And I want to see the whole
of the music represented.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.920
When you're an artist I think
though you cultivate developing

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.980
your own voice and you
want to advocate for that,

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.280
for that place within it.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.420
So if you are a successful,

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.860
experimental musician you're
going to argue for that

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.590
and you're kind of going to
look down your nose at somebody

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:15.050
who does something else, or at
least that's been my experience.

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:18.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So I'm
guessing you, like many people

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:21.000
in this country,
are paying attention

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.400
to what's happening
politically among other ways

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.700
to think about it.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:29.540
And we know that there's
been some discussion floating

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:39.190
about around the possible
pulling of funding

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.950
for the National Endowment for
the Arts, the National Endowment

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:45.970
for the Humanities, and other
agencies, especially agencies

01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:48.150
that work with culture.

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:53.430
And I wonder what, how
important is government support

01:03:53.430 --> 01:04:00.350
for the arts and to what extent
do the arts really matter

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.220
in people's lives?

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.880
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
I think the arts are

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.190
extremely important.

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.560
This will not surprise you.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.450
And I'm horrified at
the idea of the NEA

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.220
and the NEH being defunded.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.690
First of all, it's a
relatively small amount

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:22.020
of the federal budget already.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.760
And I think what
people don't realize is

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.680
that the various grants and
programs that are sponsored

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:34.340
by the NEH are really, really
important in a number of ways.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.490
I think to presenting
agencies where they, you know,

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.480
just getting part
of their funding

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.020
from the NEA makes them
more credible to fundraising

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.880
from other kinds of
foundations and organizations

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.660
to put together a program.

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:58.390
We need to -- when you look,
they have entire ministries

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:00.100
of culture and things that are

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.710
about supporting their
cultural efforts.

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:07.880
The NEH, I mean, humanity
scholars are always applying

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.180
for those grants.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.620
They're very competitive grants.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.290
They have an extremely
good track record

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:16.990
of producing excellent
scholarship.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:20.890
They have a wonderful digital
humanities initiative as part

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:24.920
of it, and we need these things.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.000
You know, overall with the
change in the politics,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.910
the thing that is
most discouraging

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:33.820
to me is the deep
anti-intellectualism.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.610
The deep anti-knowledge of this.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:43.080
The fact that people don't
seem to care about the truth.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.710
They just care about
manipulating discourse

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:49.500
to get what they want
is what seems to be --

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.330
is happening these days and
I think that is horrifying.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:06:00.220
What we try to do in
scholarship is present ideas

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.350
and cite your sources
where you got them.

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:10.390
That, you know, be able to show
where you got your facts from so

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:15.170
that somebody else can come and
take a look at it and revisit it

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:19.300
and see it in a different
way, if they so believe.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.060
And I think those kind

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:26.740
of research skills are really
important for students.

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:32.230
So I feel it's, you know, it's
not only the NEA and the NEH

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:35.160
that are under attack, but
all of higher education.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.190
I think there has been,
as if to be educated

01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:46.960
and know things is
simply East Coast snobbery

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.950
or something, or
liberal snobbery.

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:51.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Or elitism.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Or elitism.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.270
And the thing is, I don't
like elitism of a --

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:58.230
well, when I say elitism I think

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:05.100
that when somebody is just
being arbitrarily hierarchical.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:10.500
And I don't think that's
what real scholarship is.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.670
I think what scholarship is is
learning deeply about something

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:19.480
and be able to present
and defend your position,

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.740
and that's part of being an
educated person in the world.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.660
That's part of what we need
in all forms of leadership.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.960
So when I hear we have a
president that doesn't read

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.540
and instead watches TV,
that really disturbs me.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:38.400
How can we get informed, smart
policies such that has always,

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.440
you know, been happening
within the federal government,

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.290
you know, I mean at its best.

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:48.560
So the idea that
reading and writing

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.690
or the arts aren't
important, you know,

01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:57.930
is deeply disturbing to me.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:01.020
And I think that presidents of
universities are trying to speak

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.380
out at our own university.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.180
Our own president is very
supportive of the arts.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.560
We don't always have
enough money to do things,

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:17.500
but I feel like President
Faust gets that.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.800
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Good.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.850
I want to address something.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:24.560
I think we have a
little bit of time left.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.670
You're going to give your talk,
your lecture, on Thursday night.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:31.010
What will the topic be?

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.970
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
It's called Miles

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.340
and Coltrane as Living
Ancestors.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.650
And it's part of
their 90th birthday.

01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:43.150
And it's, the talk is really
my attempt to try to talk

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:47.700
about them in a way that tries

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.970
to bring something
new to the table.

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:54.740
Now, it's very difficult to say
anything new about Miles Davis

01:08:54.740 --> 01:09:00.740
and John Coltrane, and so I
try to contextualize them --

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.250
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What
does that mean, by the way,

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.640
to contextualize them?

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.290
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh, that's
one of those academic words.

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:08.590
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh, sorry.

01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:13.400
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: To fill
in the historical context,

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.300
to put it within a framework.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.210
And what I'm doing is I'm
talking about them as being

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:23.170
like living ancestors
and African religions,

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:28.930
which are examples of
divinities, but divinities

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:32.280
with individual personalities,
divinities with flaw,

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.680
just like the Greek gods are,
you know, or Hindu gods are

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.820
that way, and to really
try to get at what it feels

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.700
like to listen to
Miles and Coltrane

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.970
and why we lose our
critical distance when we're

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:51.950
in the act of listening to this.

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:54.110
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Thirty-five
years ago I interviewed Archie

01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:56.700
Shepp and I asked
him at the time one

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.780
of my more naive questions, what
do you think Coltrane, you know,

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.070
what do you think about him now?

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:06.230
What would have happened to him
if he had lived beyond his 40's?

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.700
And he said, John Coltrane
would be an old man standing

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:15.060
by the side of the road
with a stick in his hand.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.360
That elder.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, exactly.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.260
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Absolutely.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.560
Well, I have some
fun tidbits in there.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.560
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And I kind of
contrast the two personalities

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.950
because they were very
different personalities,

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:33.280
both absolute pivotal
to the music

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.820
and inspiring deep devotion by
many different kinds of people.

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:42.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: How much
of that devotion is based

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:47.670
in mythology versus reality?

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:51.320
Not that these are
mutually exclusive.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
they're both there.

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:58.360
People's investment

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.120
in the mythology part I
really feel is deeply related

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.080
to their listening
experience of it, okay.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.080
So, I've got some examples
in this lecture, for example,

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:17.030
of Amiri Baraka responding
to listening to Miles

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:24.790
and an essay he wrote
after Miles died.

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:31.640
I have materials showing
different people viewing them

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:37.920
as models of different things.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.400
And, you know, look,
I'm a scholar.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.800
I want to -- part of being
a scholar is breaking

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:50.040
down mythologies, but I think
you have to look at both

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:56.420
where they come from and look
at people's investment in them

01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.910
as part of how they
are as fans in this.

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:02.210
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
But people want

01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:04.570
to believe what they
want to believe.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.870
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
That's true, they do.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And they
don't want to be distracted

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.680
by nuance necessarily or
by the things that are --

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.850
don't celebrate them
as much, you know,

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:18.150
because everybody is human.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:19.450
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Right, exactly.

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:21.070
We'd much rather
have a positive story

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.330
about ourselves, so
I understand that.

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:26.190
And you walk a line when you're
trying to write about some

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:29.630
of these famous people
of if you break

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:35.540
down their mythology
are you hurting them?

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:39.880
And I took the position
in my Freedom Sounds book

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.710
that you've got to have
that nuance in there

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:47.360
that if it's just all
celebratory you lose the story

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.540
of how hard it was for them
to become who they were.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.080
And I think I mentioned
this the other day,

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:57.410
but I really view music
as a means of self-making

01:12:57.410 --> 01:13:01.490
and that the towering
figures in this were --

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:04.540
did an amazing job of
that, and that's one

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.020
of the reasons they're
so admired.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Is there also a risk

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.020
at romanticizing the struggle?

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, of course
you can roman -- yes, you can --

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.710
you can romanticize
it and, you know,

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:20.180
and never be critical
of the person.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:23.330
I don't believe in that either.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:28.190
So, you have to have a balance.

01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:30.670
Well, nobody's perfect,
that's my --

01:13:30.670 --> 01:13:32.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: No,
everybody struggles.

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:33.530
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, okay.

01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:34.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And that's what --

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.130
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Nobody's perfect.

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:37.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Helps us connect.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:38.730
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And everybody
has things they've done

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:40.880
that they're ashamed
of, and that's true

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.980
for great artists just as
it is for everybody else.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So,
you know, forgive me,

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.040
but I'm thinking about Miles
right now, and Coltrane

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:58.240
for that matter, and
people tend to, I mean,

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.850
part of what makes Miles such
a contemporary figure still,

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:09.260
and it's not just this movie
that came out last year,

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.250
it has less to do with his music
and more to do with who he was

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:15.460
and the culture and
what he represented.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:23.170
And so I wonder which
aspects draw you in?

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.690
What are you most taken
with when it comes

01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:26.990
to somebody like Miles Davis?

01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:28.300
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
someone like Miles --

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.200
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Is it --
is it the music itself or --

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.970
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
it's music from me.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.090
You know, he had, you know,
and I'll talk about this

01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:42.810
on Thursday, he had
this more rebellious,

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:46.930
trickster type quality
to his persona.

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:52.640
He always dressed really
well and thought about it.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.070
He looked cool and everything.

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.800
And Baraka has this [inaudible]

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.710
so he's just going
rapturous over, you know,

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.650
how Miles Davis looks.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:03.770
You know, so I think for men,
you know, he was a certain kind

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:10.170
of a model of a kind of a
modern African-American, cool,

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:18.610
hip jazz guy who wasn't
going to bow down.

01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:22.300
And so modeled a kind of
resistance to what was expected

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:28.790
of him that was widely admired,
and women admired it, too.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.870
The underside of Miles,
of course, is he was --

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:37.460
he was really awful to the
women he was involved with.

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.720
And that's the, you know, that's
an underside of the story.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.940
And he could be mean
and mercurial

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.640
and generous one moment.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.310
I mean, Herbie Hancock writes
about him in his autobiography

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:54.610
in very interesting -- he talked

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:57.460
about how generous
he was musically,

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.500
but in other respects
not so much.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
So a complex man.

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:03.250
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And
you contrast that, perhaps,

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:08.730
with John Coltrane,
whose music is complex,

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:13.870
and yet as a person he seems
not quite as multidimensional.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.170
Is that fair to say?

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.810
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh,
I wouldn't say that.

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:18.900
I would say that he didn't care

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.550
about whether he was wearing the
latest, cool looking clothes.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:24.990
I mean, that many
people reported, in fact,

01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:31.370
he didn't always wear
very nice clothes at all.

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:34.100
But, he had a lot of humility,
whereas Miles had more

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:39.280
of an arrogant quality to him,
or could come across that way.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:45.370
And Coltrane was very much
into spiritual stuff and trying

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:48.810
to be a good person,
and that seemed

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:52.340
to be a central mission for him.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.110
And he surrounded himself
with people who had

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.870
that same interest,
like Alice Coltrane.

01:16:56.870 --> 01:17:02.960
And then I look at him and he
brought Alice into his music,

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.970
brought her into the band
and wanted her to be a part

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:10.980
of his creative life,
which may have made some

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:14.220
of his previous band
members unhappy.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:17.880
But that's what he chose.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Your
favorite Miles record,

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.060
your favorite Coltrane record?

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.360
I'll put you on the spot here.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.340
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It's hard.

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.600
But I suppose if I have
to name one album --

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You
can name two if you like.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Okay [laughter].

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.200
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Feel free.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.140
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Is the
Miles Davis, My Funny Val --

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.540
what was originally the
My Funny Valentine album

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:46.760
that was recorded in 1964
that has this amazing version

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.220
of My Funny Valentine and Stella
by Starlight, and also happened

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:53.830
to be a benefit concert for a
coalition of civil rights group

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:58.210
for voters' rights,
February 12, 1964.

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:04.620
And it's the quintet with
Wayne [assumed spelling] --

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:09.990
well, actually, George Coleman
is on this one and Ron Carter

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:13.550
and Tony Williams
and Herbie Hancock.

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.850
That's a great one.

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:17.150
Now, of Coltrane.

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:20.950
I like so many of them.

01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:24.100
I mean, like everybody
else, I love Supreme,

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.930
but I also love Crescent.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:28.230
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
It's a good one.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:29.530
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And I also

01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:32.720
like Expression of
his later ones.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.590
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's
always interesting when you --

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.410
when somebody says they love
Miles or they love Coltrane.

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:39.780
I always say which records?

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:41.080
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yeah.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Because
they have distinct periods --

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.680
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: They
have distinct periods.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
In their career.

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.280
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I mean, I
also love the earlier Miles.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.870
If I liked the earlier
1956 My Funny Valentine,

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:54.350
Around Midnight album, the
Jazz at the Plaza album,

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:57.160
the Sketches of Spain.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Yeah, [inaudible].

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:04.430
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I mean, an
incredibly rich, musical legacy.

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well,

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:07.030
there's a reason why these
records never go out of print.

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:08.330
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yeah.

01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:09.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:15.790
In the time remaining I want to
ask you as a musician, but also,

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:21.030
especially as a scholar and
as an educator and author,

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:24.170
how do you measure success?

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.820
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: How
do I measure success?

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.420
I think a really feeling

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.590
of success can't come
completely from external stuff.

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:41.950
It's got to become -- come
from an internal feeling

01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:44.860
of like you're doing your best.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:50.190
You like how you've developed
over the course of your life.

01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:51.560
It's nice.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.930
I feel very fortunate

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.250
that I have the external
success that I've had.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:59.960
I couldn't believe it when I was
hired at Harvard in this chair

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.380
and sort of the excitement

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.040
about my work among an
audience has surprised me.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:11.510
And I, of course,
have enjoyed that.

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:13.850
But, you know, I do feel

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:17.320
like what got me there is I've
always been trying, you know,

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.390
driven by trying to
do the best that I can

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:23.230
and to bring the best part

01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:27.880
of whatever skills I
have to bear on this.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.180
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Dr. Ingrid Monson,

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.660
continued success to you.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.960
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson:
Okay, thank you.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.260
It's been a pleasure
to talk with you.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Yeah, always.

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:39.470
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
