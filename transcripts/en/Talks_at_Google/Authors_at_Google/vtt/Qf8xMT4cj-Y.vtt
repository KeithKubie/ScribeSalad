KAREN MAY: It is my great
pleasure, this afternoon,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.280
to introduce you
to George Mumford.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.370
And George is here
joining us today

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.470
to talk about his book,
which you can see right here,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.330
"The Mindful Athlete."

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.870
And some of you have a
copy of it in front of you.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.960
And he's here to share some
of the wisdoms and lessons--

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.090
wisdom and lessons in his
book, but even more than that,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.890
to share some of who
he is with all of you.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160
And one of the things
that I was really

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
struck by when
reading George's book

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.020
is what an extraordinary
life you've had

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.240
and the extent to which you've
been listening your whole life.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.650
And it's that listening
that really struck me,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.390
that you've been-- you
watched messages coming in.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.520
Sometimes, you took
the message right away.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.160
Other times, you let it
sit for a couple of years.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.100
But when you were ready,
you went after it.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.660
And you really paid attention
to what was around you,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.990
took from teachings
from many, many people,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.580
and then found a calling
around sharing those teachings

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.060
and helping other people listen
and learn for themselves.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.310
And your story is extraordinary.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.150
Your humility is just
as extraordinary.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.220
And we're just so
lucky to have you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.930
here today to share
some of your thoughts

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.830
with us, and experience.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.450
Some of you will know George
by reputation for the work

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.220
that he's done with
professional basketball stars.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.880
If you're a basketball player,
you know all of the names,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.530
Kobe Bryant, LeBron
James, and so forth.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.070
If you aren't, it doesn't
matter, big basketball stars.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.620
But I think what's
interesting about the work

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.950
that you've done with
professional athletes is

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.980
that you have found
people who happened

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.680
to be at the top
of their profession

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.560
doing work that require
them to be entirely present.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.650
And so they happen
to be in athletics.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.450
I know you've done work with
people in many other walks

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.350
of life, people who
need to be the very best

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.660
that they can be, at
the top of their game,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.010
and helping them find a way to
be that, but out along the way

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.950
finding extraordinary peace.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.320
And so before I let George
do some of the talking,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.740
I want to share-- I want to
read this to you because it's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.450
so special,
something George just

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.210
shared with me,
which is his charter.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.430
And George's
purpose for his life

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.730
is to release the divine spark
within every human being.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.250
And when I think about that
in the context of the work

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.780
that you're doing, it really
is being there for people

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.420
and finding the way
to release that spark.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.180
And some of the values
that shape his work

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.260
are love, curiosity, truth,
wisdom, selfless service,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.420
integrity, courage,
and compassion.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.340
And what an extraordinary
set of gifts

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.520
to bring to the
world around you!

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.830
So I'm Karen May.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.480
I lead our People
Development team,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.210
and it's my deep pleasure to
introduce George to you today.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.300
And tell us a little bit
about yourself, your work,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.697
your calling, and your book.

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:15.780
GEORGE MUMFORD: Thank you.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.630
Well, I'm really happy to be
here today, being at Google.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.080
Very often, I can't
use my computer

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.841
without referring to Google
in one way or the other.

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:34.840
KAREN MAY: We like that.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.970
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yes.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.040
So when I agreed to come
here and talk about my book,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.655
I actually gave
them a little idea

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:49.260
of what it is I wanted
to talk about today.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.270
So this is a reminder
to me as well.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.910
The power of flow, the
role of mindfulness

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.041
in cultivating flow readiness.

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.040
So this idea-- the
interesting thing about flow.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.430
How many people know what
the flow is or the zone?

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.230
OK, great.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.630
So a lot of people know that.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.950
And the interesting thing about
flow or the zone is that if you

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.330
try to get into flow, you won't.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.440
So it's one of these paradoxes.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.410
So I prefer to talk about
the role of mindfulness

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.260
and cultivating what I
would call flow readiness.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.770
And so creating the
conditions so flow

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.450
will arise when it arises.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.810
And so being in flow or
being in the zone, or flow,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.910
is enhanced by the
regular practice

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.580
of being mindful in
all our activities

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.240
in such a way that
an emphasis is

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.940
put on the continuity
of mindfulness.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.150
This requires an expanded view
of what mindfulness meditation

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.970
is in a sense that
sitting practice or being

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.980
still and knowing is just
one aspect of the practice.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.320
It is possible for us to
be mindful from the time we

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.480
wake up until the
time we fall asleep.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.790
Just being mindful of our
postures during the day

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.710
as we are sitting, walking,
standing, and lying down.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.330
We contracted being fully
open, fully engaged,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.020
and welcoming each unfolding,
unknown moment of mindfulness

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.980
and wisdom.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.720
And I have to say that's a
mouthful, what I just said.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.365
And the interesting
thing is-- so it

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:23.020
would be obvious to talk
about, what is mindfulness?

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.234
How many people here
know what mindfulness is?

00:05:25.234 --> 00:05:27.150
How many people practice
mindfulness and don't

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.240
know what mindfulness is?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.392
So it's an interesting thing.

00:05:33.392 --> 00:05:36.720
My buddy, Jon Kabat-Zinn,
talked about mindfulness

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.100
is paying attention in a
particular way in the moment,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.997
non-judgmentally, as if
your life depended on it.

00:05:43.997 --> 00:05:45.580
Now, he doesn't use
that all the time,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.315
but I like to use that
because it's really important.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.190
But another way of
thinking about mindfulness

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.020
is that it's a way
of being where we're

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.720
able to observe experience.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.400
And one of the things
I do in my book,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.930
I talk about the space
between stimulus and response.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.100
And Viktor Frankl has a quote.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.541
I think-- Let me see
if I can find it.

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:10.790
I don't really need the quote.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.870
I can just talk about it.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.520
But basically, he's saying
between the space of stimulus

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.170
and responses are power
and freedom to choose.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.212
And that-- another way of
looking at mindfulness--

00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:23.670
I have some things
here that I want

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.660
to read because it
gives you an idea.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.930
So when I talk
about mindfulness,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.510
I'm also talking
about mindfulness

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.720
that's supported by some
qualities, which I call

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.590
in the book, the super powers.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.580
And they have to do with this
idea of faith, or confidence,

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.800
because if you really
think about it, in order

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.610
to make an effort,
we have to have

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.860
enough faith, or confidence,
to actually make that effort.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.000
And I know that trust or
confidence is really important

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.230
because Einstein said so.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.220
Einstein basically said that
the most important question

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.660
we have to ask is whether
the universe is friendly

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.180
or unfriendly or neither.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.969
And that just to cut
it short, because I--

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.510
instead of going
through all of them,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.060
I'll just talk about
the idea that he said.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.440
If the universe is
unfriendly, then we

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.890
will use all of our
resources, all our technology

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.400
to build bigger walls to
actually keep out the danger

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.280
or to actually get hostile
and kill off any threat.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.150
And if we think the universe is
neither friendly or unfriendly

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.670
and that God is
just throwing-- it's

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.410
like throwing a pair of dice.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.680
The role of the dice
determines whether the universe

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.830
is friendly or not, then
why bother with anything.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.910
There's no consequences
to doing anything.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:02.280
But if the universe is friendly
and that the way forward

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.550
is to use all our
resources, our technology,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.090
to understand how the
world is, to understand

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.600
how the universe works,
and to align our intentions

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.490
and purposes with
the way things work,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.600
then we're into something.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.130
And so that's the place that
I'm coming from in that,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.090
on a really basic
level, if we don't think

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.590
the universe is friendly,
then why would we

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.770
cultivate mindfulness?

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.059
Why would we pay attention?

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.049
Why would we try to figure
out how things work?

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.169
And so this idea of having this
faith-- and sometimes, it's

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.372
just a launching faith, just
enough faith to try something,

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:44.080
but on a deeper level,
it's understanding

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.680
that how we choose to
think, feel, and behave

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.220
has an impulse-- has an impact,
and that the universe is

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.284
lawful, and that
the best way to live

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.700
is to live in
alignment with that.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.930
So having faith to
actually make the effort.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.540
And so mindfulness is one thing.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.875
But then there's this faith that
enhances us to make the effort,

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.720
and you have to make the
effort to be mindful.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.810
And so we talk about effort.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.400
And what I talk about in
the book is diligence.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.770
And it's a way of looking
at effort or energy

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:22.500
as a continuous application of
enthusiastic, poised energy.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.700
So oftentimes,
what I find working

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.180
with people in my own practice
for years, until I woke up

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.820
a little bit, is that there's
this efforting, or just trying

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:40.080
too hard or having this energy
that's really guided by greed

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.840
or wanting it badly
or trying too hard.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.160
And that energy doesn't work.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.380
And then there's the other
energy, this lethargic

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.100
or just not making any
effort at all because we

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.320
don't think it matters.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.040
And so effort is similar
to like tuning a guitar.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.110
If anyone plays a
string instrument,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.890
when you tune a guitar, if it's
too tight, it doesn't work.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.514
And if it's too loose,
it doesn't work.

00:10:03.514 --> 00:10:05.400
It has to be
balanced just right.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.420
And so when we make
an effort, the idea

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.540
is continuous application of
enthusiastic, poised energy.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.040
Or the idea is when
you're doing something,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.440
it's almost like there's a Hoagy
Carmichael line in his song.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.210
It says slow motion
gets you there faster.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.110
It's similar to that.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.480
That effort is just
application no matter what.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.366
You just keep
applying the effort.

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:31.990
It doesn't matter
what the results are.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.440
It's walk straight
ahead no matter what.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.560
So the interesting
thing about effort,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.640
and the interesting thing
about not making wrong effort

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.510
is that it has to be
balanced by wisdom.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.390
And one way of looking at wisdom
is information, intellect,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.170
or rational thinking, which
we call wise reflection,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.410
reflecting on things
using our intelligence,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.050
and a third way is
what we call intuition,

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.810
or direct experience.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.640
And so the idea is when we
experience it subjectively,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.830
that's the deepest way
of knowing or intuition.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.320
So information, intelligence,
and direct experience.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.340
And so wisdom-- what mindfulness
does is it balances effort.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:27.120
But effort is balanced by--
let me go back before that.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.180
So the wisdom
balances the faith.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.070
So going back to faith because
I talked about faith and effort.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.980
But they have to be
balanced by mindfulness.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.380
So mindfulness cultivates faith,
but it also cultivates wisdom

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.730
because if you have too much
faith and no discernment, then

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.040
it's blind faith.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.540
And it's the same
thing with wisdom,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.590
if your too wise
or too intelligent,

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.720
then you become cynical.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.500
And so the idea of mindfulness
cultivates these things

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.410
individually.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:04.410
Effort, trust, wisdom, it
cultivates those things,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.400
but then it also balances them.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.490
And so wisdom balances faith.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.700
And then concentration--
or what I

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.970
like to use-- steadiness of
mind, is what balances effort.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.100
When I talked about
a poised effort,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.780
that's what
steadiness of mind is.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.750
In order to have
steadiness of mind,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.390
we can't be focused on what we
like and what we don't like it.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.960
It has to be this idea
of just allowing things

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.435
to be as they are, that we're
not moving towards something

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:36.060
because it's pleasant, and we're
not moving away from something

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.580
because it's unpleasant.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.910
We're just being still.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.300
And so steadiness of
mind is really important.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.500
And so mindfulness has-- the
only way mindfulness works

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.320
or what I call the
power of mindfulness

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.870
is when these other factors,
like effort and steadiness

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.630
of mind, of faith and
wisdom, are working together

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.640
and balancing each other.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.780
And so we can make the
effort to be mindful.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.740
And so what is mindfulness?

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.850
So when we allow each
moment to unfold as it is,

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.420
there has to be this ability
to have mindfulness, which

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:26.440
is supported by right effort and
steadiness of mind and wisdom.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.924
It has to be
working with wisdom.

00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:30.340
In other words, we have to
have an idea, well, what are we

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.839
doing?

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:32.410
What are we being mindful for?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.270
And so Socrates said
wisdom begins in wonder.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:41.140
So there's this guy, his name
is Eugene-- what's his name?

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.810
Eugene Fink.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.730
He says, "wonder is the
unwilled willingness

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.810
to meet what is utterly strange
and what is most familiar.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.890
It is the willingness
to step back and let

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.440
things speak to us.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.090
A passive receptivity to
let the things of the world

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.650
present themselves
in their own terms."

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.000
And so our normal way of
observing experience is data,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.400
or something comes up.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.180
Whether it's a
thought or a sound

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.740
or an image or a
sensation, it comes up.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.240
And instead of just
receiving it as it is,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.810
there's a very short time
in the perceptual process

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.632
where we're seeing it as it is.

00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:18.840
We're letting it speak to us.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.145
But then, immediately,
there is self-reference.

00:14:21.145 --> 00:14:23.080
There's associative thinking.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.390
There's abstract thinking.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.100
And so we end up
embellishing the raw data

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.500
with our views of things.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.330
And so what mindfulness
does-- and one of the things

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.620
I talk about in the book a lot
is that, what we want to do

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.740
is we want to create space
between stimulus and response

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.200
so that we can actually
allow the receptive

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.420
phase of perception to
be elongated or longer.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.130
And so these practices of
mindfulness and concentration

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.900
and right effort,
these things help

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.860
us to create space between
stimulus and response.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.420
So Viktor Frankl said in
that space we can create.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.730
We can actually stop, slow
down, and see what's happening.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.310
Let things speak to us
instead of embellishing them

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.430
with what we think because
a lot of the time--

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.520
even you listening to
me now, I guarantee you

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.929
one of the things
we do is we listen

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:16.720
to what is being offered,
and we compare it

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.440
to what we already know.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.360
So that's interesting,
but we haven't

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.170
had an experience of
everything, so we're not

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.440
really present to what is
and letting it speak to us.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.540
Well, why is that so?

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.500
Because it takes a certain
level of vulnerability

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.600
to allow things to speak
for themselves without us

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.140
knowing what the answer
is before, especially

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.860
in this culture.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.280
We multitask, which is a myth.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.500
No such thing as multitasking.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.521
But we do it.

00:15:44.521 --> 00:15:45.520
We think we're doing it.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.770
The mind is just flitting
from one thing to the other,

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.640
but ultimately,
the mind can only

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.670
be with one thing at a time.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.160
And a part of this
cultivation of mindfulness,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.360
or being flow ready, is
the idea of allowing things

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.220
to speak to us.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.970
And then in that speaking
and in that space,

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.940
we're able to discern
and make proper choices

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.390
and part of that process is
to make mistakes because we

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.440
don't know what we don't know.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.570
But by learning and being
able to observe experience

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.410
in a certain way, we're able
to learn from our mistakes.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.190
And then when we
go into it again,

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.310
we get a little bit
more information.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.979
We start stitching
intelligence together.

00:16:23.979 --> 00:16:25.520
The way I like to
frame it, it's just

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.750
like when you do a
crossword puzzle-- or not

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.220
a crossword-- a jigsaw puzzle,
that when you do a jigsaw

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.600
puzzle, you put one piece.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.430
You try pieces.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.020
And you put them aside, and
then you're going along,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.530
and you say, oh, I need a piece.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.564
I saw that piece.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.480
You go get the piece,
and you put it together.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.680
And then as you keep building
on it, each time you go around,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.190
it's circular learning.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.430
The time you go through it,
through trial and error,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.570
you get a full picture
of what is there.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.870
And then you get another puzzle.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.170
And then you start over again.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.340
So this is how we learn.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.140
We don't just see things or
know things ahead of time.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.960
A lot of it is just blue
collar trial and error.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.700
And then the
mindfulness helps us

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.240
remember what's happening so
that we can actually learn.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.420
So it's all about-- it's
a commitment to learning.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.740
Learning for learning's sake.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.660
And doing things for
the sake of the thing.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.829
Because when we do
it for gaining idea,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.400
then we get greed, and
then the wrong effort

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.280
is applied because
we're trying too hard

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.510
or we're trying
with an ulterior--

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:30.670
with a motive that is
coloring what's happening.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.420
Does that make any
sense, what I'm saying?

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.490
And so this idea of
mindfulness and being

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.560
in flow-- being flow ready,
is just learning and being

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.570
in the moment and let
each moment unfold.

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.640
And what happens is we
start to get into the way

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.570
things are, and we're
flowing with it.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.070
The next thing you
know, we're actually

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.480
seeing how things are evolving
before they evolve because we

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.580
developed this sixth sense.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.400
But I also talk about
this idea of observing

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.567
from the eye of the hurricane
because by observing

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:01.150
from the eye of the
hurricane, there's

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.210
this-- in the eye of the
hurricane, there's blue skies.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.160
There's all this turmoil
that's going around.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.890
But when we can
be in that middle,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.120
we can observe things
without reacting to them.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.760
So mindfulness is
supported by these things.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.310
And one way of looking at
mindfulness or what mindfulness

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.400
might look like or the
flavor of mindfulness

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.130
would be this idea
of not forgetting.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.365
So everything-- we can
only live in the moment.

00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:29.550
So everything that's happening
in this moment is all there is.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.446
And so our ability to not
forget-- not forget what?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.420
What we're doing.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.733
So it's like even being here.

00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:36.566
Well, why am I here?

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:39.680
I am here to listen and learn,
so got to remember that.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680
And when do you do that?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.679
In the moment, so we got
to remember the moment,

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:45.670
remember what our intention--
what it is we're doing.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.409
So that's one part of it.

00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:49.450
And that's where the
steadiness of mind comes in,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.244
whee we're not forgetting.

00:18:51.244 --> 00:18:52.660
And then there's
presence of mind.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.930
Well, what's presence of mind.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.520
The mind being in
the here and now.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.390
It's like mirror mind.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.860
The mirror just reflects
what's in front of it.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.740
And so that's where this ability
to be still and know or just

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.290
see how by being in this
eye of the hurricane

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.140
with this relax
receptivity, there

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.860
could be an-- there
could be some enthusiasm

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:18.965
or-- I want to say a joy of
learning or loving to learn

00:19:18.965 --> 00:19:20.322
or learning for learning's sake.

00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:22.530
So we're sitting here and
saying, well, what is this?

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.690
We have this curiosity.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.030
We have this interest.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.130
We want to investigate.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.560
We want to see things.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.490
So that we're
letting things speak

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.500
to us in their own
language, in their own time.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.650
Because a lot of us
have time pressure,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.530
so we need this to move along.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.990
We can't wait for it to unfold.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.540
But that's the only
way we're going to know

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.290
is to have that ability to
wait and let it speak to us.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.970
So an example I
love to use is when

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.230
we have-- we're in conversation
with each other all the time.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.080
And so what is it like when
we're talking to somebody,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.369
and they're not there?

00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:58.660
They're trying to formulate
the answer before they even

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.630
hear the question.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.680
I think we're all guilty
of that on some level.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.010
So in that case, it's like
this being there an saying, OK,

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.900
I wish he would hurry up.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.900
I got things to do.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.670
But just realizing that
that's not being present,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.050
that mindfulness just sits
there and just listens

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.835
and lets the whole
thing be communicated,

00:20:18.835 --> 00:20:23.990
or speak for itself, and
then there's this ability

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.730
to ascertain-- or to
come from that space

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.290
where we can have some
wisdom and say, OK, I

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.550
heard what is being said.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.470
And then trusting that if
we listen and we're present,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.809
we're being still and knowing,
there's a wisdom that's there.

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:40.100
There's an ability to be there.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.970
So not forgetting the present
moment and what it is we're

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.830
doing, so the steadiness
of mind-- presence of mind,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.770
being in the
moment, mirror mind,

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.960
just letting things
speak for themselves.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.380
And then there's this
idea of remembering.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.780
Remembering what?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.110
Remembering what is skillful,
what is helpful, what is not.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.060
So if I remember, OK, I
got to be here and listen

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.360
without trying to answer.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.197
And that I know when my
mind has compassion there,

00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:12.530
there's a willingness to listen.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.988
When I have patience
there, there's

00:21:13.988 --> 00:21:15.940
a willingness to listen.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.030
When there's impatient
or if there's

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.172
some other negative emotion,
like indifference, I'm

00:21:23.172 --> 00:21:24.380
not really going to be there.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.610
And I need to know.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.651
This is the right effort.

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:30.290
I need to know how to abandon
that negative mindset,

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.677
like indifference.

00:21:32.677 --> 00:21:33.260
How do I know?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.801
Oh, there's indifference
in the mind.

00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.890
Can I just let it
go, and then bring

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.470
this quality of
care and attention

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.280
to what is being said?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.040
And so it's this idea
of knowing what's

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.220
skillful, what's unskillful.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.220
That's the right effort.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.300
And so then, finally,
it's also what's

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.660
the essence of what's happening?

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.725
So what's the essentials?

00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:56.670
Well, the essentials
in a conversation

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.820
are 70% listening
and 30% speaking.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.580
So the essential
is to listen, just

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.290
to know that, OK, if I'm
speaking before they're

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:11.360
speaking, then I
don't know-- I don't

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.020
have the right information that
tells me what I need to know.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.020
What are the essentials?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.870
The essential is to be
still and know to be present

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.207
and to just listen.

00:22:20.207 --> 00:22:22.790
Each time the mind is thinking
about something else, just come

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.000
back and listening again.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.610
And so mindfulness
looks like that.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.940
Mindfulness looks like-- you
know when you come someplace

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.930
or when you're doing your
activity, the basic fundamental

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.360
of what it is your doing, that's
in mind-- with the mindfulness.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.990
Well, you got to know a little
bit, at least what I'm doing

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.400
and why.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.770
So there has to be
this understanding.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.420
So there's some
mental preparation

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:51.710
before to figure out what
it is we're doing and why.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.980
And we talk about this.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.280
So there's mindfulness, or
just the bare sensational

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.880
mindfulness.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.730
just knowing.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.570
Say, for instance, if you're
sitting in your breathing,

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.770
and then there's a--
let's say there's

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.880
some sensation in your knee,
especially if you're sitting

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.732
and you have-- and
there's pain in the knee.

00:23:11.732 --> 00:23:12.940
I wouldn't even call it pain.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.192
I say there's a sensation.

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:16.150
So instead of calling it
pain, you just notice,

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.190
OK, this is a bare sensation, so
just noticing a bare sensation.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:25.460
Or if a sound comes in through
the window or through the door,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.070
let's say.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.260
Where I practice in Cambridge
is right on the Main Street,

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.570
so you'll be sitting
there meditating,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.960
and a fire engine goes by.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.790
And so our ability to be mindful
and notice that we're sitting

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.460
and a sound comes
through the window.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.310
The sound comes
into our awareness.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.430
Well, we could allow
it to be a sound.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.462
Or, we could make it noise.

00:23:46.462 --> 00:23:47.795
I say, Oh, that's a fire engine.

00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:48.370
It shouldn't be there.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.328
I'm trying to meditate.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.710
And so we just notice,
oh, we hear it.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.880
But then if we see that
we made it into noise,

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.467
then we can just say, OK.

00:23:57.467 --> 00:23:58.300
There's frustration.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.860
There's-- I don't know
what you want to call it--

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.626
anger or fear that we're not
going to be able to meditate

00:24:05.626 --> 00:24:07.000
because there's
sounds coming in.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.041
If we can just know, oh,
there's fear in the mind

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.700
or there's anger
or just noticing,

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.390
oh, it's just a sound.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.540
It's just a sound.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.960
Just see it as a sound.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.230
So something happens.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:21.020
A sound-- then we interpret
what it means and what it is.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.162
And that's where we suffer.

00:24:22.162 --> 00:24:23.620
We suffer because
we make it noise.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.641
And this ability to just
notice and just let it

00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:27.390
flow through because
the interesting thing

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.890
is it won't last
more than 30 seconds.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.990
But if we keep it mind
and we hold onto it,

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.130
it's still in the mind.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.500
The fire engine is still there.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.250
And so we start to
understand that there's

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.750
a way of relating
to experience, out

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.530
of that eye of the hurricane,
where we just allowing things

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.870
to come because they
arise and pass away.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.070
Under the right conditions,
there's a sound.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.280
It comes through.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.540
And that's only the external.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.590
Just imagine what's going
on inside with the self-talk

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.706
and our opinions
about everything.

00:24:54.706 --> 00:24:56.720
When we start to sit
still and notice,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.866
we have an opinion
about everything.

00:24:58.866 --> 00:24:59.740
And there's no shame.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.570
We'll say any-- we'll
think about anything.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.280
But then we see it
and say, Oh, I can't.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:05.970
I'm a meditator.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.260
I can't have thoughts like that.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.551
I shouldn't be thinking at all.

00:25:08.551 --> 00:25:11.042
Well, good luck with
that one because there's

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.750
all kinds of thoughts
that are coming up.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.083
There's all kinds of sensations.

00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:17.660
What matters is our ability
to just notice that thinking

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.390
is happening.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.760
That sound is happening.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.410
That sensations are happening.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.970
So there's a way of relating
to experience in a way

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.550
where we can just be
still and know and just

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.660
let things speak to us.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.430
We create space between
stimulus and response.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.250
And when there's no space
between stimulus and response,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.930
that's not a problem
if we just notice,

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.060
OK, my mindfulness
wasn't quick enough.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.360
And then you start over again.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.550
And so this idea of
cultivating this way of being.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.865
So you can do this from
the time we wake up

00:25:47.865 --> 00:25:48.990
to the time we go to sleep.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.450
So there's the
sitting meditation

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.310
and being still and focusing.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.640
But then there's this idea, like
even now, just think about it.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.050
Humor me for a moment.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.636
You know you were sitting.

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:03.010
Do you really know
you're sitting right now?

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.219
Are you conscious of sitting?

00:26:04.219 --> 00:26:05.593
So most people
say, yeah, George.

00:26:05.593 --> 00:26:07.070
Of course, I know I'm sitting.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.800
Well, how does it feel?

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.832
How can you prove that out?

00:26:11.832 --> 00:26:13.290
What are the parts
of the body that

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.786
are making contact
with surfaces,

00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:15.910
and what does it feel like?

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.535
Is it pressure?

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.235
Can we be still?

00:26:20.235 --> 00:26:23.170
Can we just sit here and
listen and then allow our body

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.470
to be embodied and have our
body anchor us in the present

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.220
and notice that there's
breathing going on

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.880
or should be?

00:26:32.394 --> 00:26:34.310
And that we can just sit
here and just notice.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.700
Your breath comes, breath goes.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.560
You just breathe in
sitting, feeling.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.420
So when we stand up, you're
aware of standing up.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.152
You walked here from somewhere.

00:26:43.152 --> 00:26:45.360
Can you remember what happened
between where you were

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.050
and how you got here?

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.264
And some of us will
remember, some of us may not

00:26:50.264 --> 00:26:52.180
because we were trying
to get here in a hurry.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.410
We don't want to miss anything.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.920
And so the body moving.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.780
We're in the body
as it's moving.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.880
Do we know when
we move our hand?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.870
When we do things?

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.440
These are postures,
mindfulness of postures.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.070
Just knowing we're sitting
down, and knowing it.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.350
Standing up, and knowing it.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.840
Listening, and knowing it.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.405
That sounds simple, right?

00:27:15.405 --> 00:27:16.760
How often do we do it?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.710
Well, we're busy trying
to hear what's happening

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.660
and not being
anchored in the body

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.700
and noticing that there's a
way of relating all day where

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.844
we can just check in.

00:27:25.844 --> 00:27:27.260
Well, is there
energy in the body?

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.495
How does it feel
when I'm listening?

00:27:33.495 --> 00:27:34.120
Is it pleasant?

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:34.900
Is it unpleasant?

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.330
Is it neutral?

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.010
What's my attitude?

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.810
Am I happy to be here,
or I'm just here,

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.860
and I don't know how I feel?

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.360
That's OK.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.740
But knowing that is
really important.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.750
It's knowing what
our attitude, knowing

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.750
how we're seeing things.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.760
So there's so many
things we could do.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.310
And I don't want
to talk a lot more.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.570
I just wanted to just introduce
some of these concepts,

00:27:55.570 --> 00:28:00.660
like this idea of mindfulness,
just not forgetting, presence

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.220
of mind, and remembering
what is skillful,

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.105
and then staying
focused on that.

00:28:06.105 --> 00:28:07.480
And then what are
the essentials?

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.438
What is it we're doing?

00:28:08.438 --> 00:28:10.050
What are the basic fundamentals?

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.370
I do this with-- whether
we're speaking or hearing

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.150
or whether we're doing our job
or if you're playing basketball

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.320
or softball or even walking.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.680
Just being with ourselves
as we're walking,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.090
moving through space, and we'll
notice that the body can't

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.930
stay in one position too long.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.490
It's in either one
of four positions.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:36.060
It's either walking, standing,
sitting, or lying down.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.950
And then all through the day,
we have those transitions.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.135
Are we aware of them
when we do them?

00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:45.030
Do we know why the
body is walking?

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.890
Do we know where it's going?

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.694
Do we know what the
purpose is to lie down?

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.360
How many of us lie
down at night and try

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.130
to go to sleep, and everything
we did during a day,

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.270
all our worries are there?

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.690
And we start
ruminating, thinking

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.780
and then, OK, it's
been two hours.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.320
I'm still trying to asleep.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.500
Instead of realizing
that, yeah, OK,

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.295
we have to have a way
of letting go of work

00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:09.680
and letting go-- when
something keeps coming up,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.270
either we need to
attend to it or we need

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.100
to figure out how to let it go.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.290
But this happens, so we have
this-- what's that saying,

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.450
that most of us live in
quiet lives of desperation?

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.130
I think a lot us,
especially people

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:29.470
in this room, that have been
very successful and skillful.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.640
There's a lot to be happy for,
but there's always suffering

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.110
in one form or the other.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.410
That's a human condition.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.170
Suffering is things change.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.360
They don't stay the same.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.900
We get connected with
things we don't like.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.150
We get removed from
things we do like.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.670
We could have a certain mindset.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.081
It's going to change.

00:29:52.081 --> 00:29:53.330
It's not going to be the same.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.320
So things change all the time.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.570
There might be subtle things
or parts of our lives--

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.060
like Sigmund Freud said,
love, work, and play.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.580
If you've got all three of
those working, you're doing OK.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.260
If you can work, love,
and play at a high level,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.030
that's what he calls
psychological health.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.300
Well, good luck with that
one because very rarely,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.956
do we have all three
going on really well.

00:30:16.956 --> 00:30:19.080
And it doesn't stay that
way because we got parents

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.660
that are getting old and sick.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.800
We're getting old.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800
Things change.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.520
We don't have the same level
of energy we had before.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.630
Then, there's just
things that happen.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.550
People we know die and get sick.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.282
Or, the candidate we
like doesn't get elected.

00:30:37.282 --> 00:30:38.740
Or, he does get
elected and doesn't

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.430
do what we want him to do.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.160
There's all of these
things that happen

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.830
that have an impact on us.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.440
And so really it's
about just starting

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.450
to get in touch with
what's going on in here,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.070
what's going on in our
heart, and then starting

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.940
on the state of,
well how am I living?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.522
Who do I want to be?

00:30:55.522 --> 00:30:57.730
Because I like to say, if
you don't know who you are,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.912
you can be anybody.

00:30:58.912 --> 00:31:00.620
And if you don't know
where you're going,

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.080
you could end up anywhere.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.990
So these are just
some of the things

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.250
that, I'd like to open up
the conversation about.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.750
It's just talking
about-- obviously,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.150
we can talk about anything.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.700
But just this idea
of flow having to do.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.950
Because flow is when--
when we're in flow,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:22.322
it's interesting because our
self-consciousness is gone.

00:31:22.322 --> 00:31:23.530
You hear people all the time.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.640
Well, I don't know where I went.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.420
I wasn't there.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.370
I got expanded awareness,
and time-- everything

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.840
was effortless and was
doing it by itself.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.245
Time flies.

00:31:33.245 --> 00:31:34.620
I don't know where
the time went.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.300
Your sense of time was altered.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.920
But the interesting
thing is, to be in flow,

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.930
we have to have--
be in a high state

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.430
of arousal, which means that our
challenges and our skill level

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.460
has to be high.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.280
An elite athlete
or a mindful person

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.880
knows when that high state
of arousal, that excitation

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.960
could be because we're very
excited because something

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.560
good's going to
happen or we could

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.320
be very excited because
something bad is

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.940
going to happen.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:09.710
And our relationship to it, if
we see it as a crisis or as a--

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.480
not as a crisis, but
as a curse, then we're

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.560
probably going to reduce our
energy or lower our standard.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.830
So just before we get
to that flow state,

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.970
we quit or we withdraw.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.670
But if we see it
as an indication

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.040
that we're really close to
getting where we want to go,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.230
and we see it as a
challenge, then we

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.880
bring more energy,
more focus into it.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.610
We persevere.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.870
We consistently continue
to make the effort,

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.080
then we get into flow.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.602
But even that's a problem
because it won't last.

00:32:43.602 --> 00:32:45.310
But while we're in
it, we could be in it.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.601
And then when we get out of
it, we say, that was great.

00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:49.860
I'd like to do that again
because, all of a sudden,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.760
I disappeared.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.084
Where did I go?

00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:54.000
What happened to time?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.083
You mean it was two hours.

00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:57.060
It didn't feel like that.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.780
And so this is the excitement.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.440
The mystery of life is that
we can get into things,

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.560
and we can just take
it one moment at a time

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.260
and just really
manage the moment

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.450
that we might find
ourselves getting into,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.080
like the stream or
the flow of a river,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.410
we end up getting into
the current of it.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.490
And we flow with it,
and it's taking us

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.450
where we want to go
without any effort.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.060
But if we try to do it
consciously, it's a problem.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.170
But if we just do these
things as a byproduct

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.930
of paying attention, a
byproduct of understanding

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.010
how to be mindful moment to
moment-- because the secret

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.120
is continuity of
mindfulness, not

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.330
being mindful for two or
three hours while we're

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.770
sitting or doing what we love
to do and we really focus on it.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.540
It's being present for
our life more and more,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.070
bringing more and more
of that continuity.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.630
And sometimes, just knowing that
there's a body just a continued

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.640
mindfulness is fine.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.800
You don't have to have
a whole lot of-- can

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.346
be a rough just, OK,
my body, I feel it.

00:33:53.346 --> 00:33:54.220
There's a body there.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.340
It's moving and sitting.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.290
It doesn't have to be
where there's a body,

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.660
and it's doing such and such.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.690
Just to the extent that we know
we have a body can be enough.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:03.835
OK, yes?

00:34:03.835 --> 00:34:04.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, George.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:05.390
Thank you so much.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.848
As you're talking,
I'm just getting

00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:09.730
more and more excited
about asking my questions.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.895
And I have quite a few.

00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:13.270
And so I'm just
going to ask one,

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.630
and then I'll go from there.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.602
But as you're talking
about flow and body--

00:34:17.602 --> 00:34:19.310
when I see that I
haven't read your book,

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.689
but I know who you are.

00:34:20.689 --> 00:34:22.230
I mean I read a
little bit about you.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.040
So I know you worked with
Phil Jackson and the Bulls.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.580
And that was a time where
I used to watch basketball

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.239
all the time.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.270
So the fact that you're
talking about this,

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.550
and you worked with them, and
they won so many championships,

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.889
I would love for you describe
how you worked with them

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.489
as a team and as individuals.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:44.800
And how they-- when you're
saying you get into the flow,

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.900
and then you accomplish your
goal, and then you lose it.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.310
How did they get into a position
where, just about every time

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:57.187
they went out on the court, they
were in the flow for so long?

00:34:57.187 --> 00:34:58.020
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yes.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:04.750
Well, it's interesting because
somebody asked me recently

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.680
because I'm working with
the New York Knicks.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.320
And, of course, they had an
interesting season last year.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.590
And people said Georgia,
it must be really hard,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.630
you working with them.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.205
You know they've
not this and that.

00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:17.940
And I said, no, my job is
the same no matter what.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.030
It's just to help them
to be more present

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:26.530
and help them to try to manage
the moment in a skillful way.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.950
So when I was working with the
Bulls and having Michael there,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:35.250
it was very interesting
because there

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.960
was a commitment to excellence.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.460
And there was a--
they were always

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.725
raising their challenges.

00:35:40.725 --> 00:35:42.850
So you can even-- if you
were to listen to Michael,

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.933
you'd hear him say, OK,
he won three championships

00:35:44.933 --> 00:35:46.170
before I even got there.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.540
Then, they won in '96.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.949
Then, in '98, you can
hear him say-- '97,

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.115
you can hear him say, well,
that's one win for Coach

00:35:54.115 --> 00:35:55.940
[INAUDIBLE] because
we had a new coach.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.540
So he would always find a
reason or another worthy cause

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.380
of what to commit to so
that we could continue

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.430
to be motivated and keep
pushing ourselves out

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.517
of our combat zone.

00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:09.100
So the way you do
that, whether you're

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.310
in last place or first place,
is wherever you are today

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.060
is not where you
want to be tomorrow.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.600
So there's just constant
getting comfortable,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.580
being uncomfortable, pushing
out of our comfort zone

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.190
so that you're in a
high state of arousal.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.740
So a lot of us-- I
tend to say that we

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.840
spend most of our time
in boredom or anxiety.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.270
So we're bored when we have
high skills, but low challenges.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.150
So we're chilling.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.300
We are in that relaxed.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.440
We're content.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:43.787
And then there's others who have
low skills and high challenges,

00:36:43.787 --> 00:36:44.620
and they're anxious.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.360
They're just-- and
so the idea is--

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.600
the middle way is when you're
anxious because the challenges

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.510
are too high, then
you've got to get busy

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.810
improving your skills,
knowledge, and experience.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.420
So then you're always moving.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.080
So there's no standing still.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.690
You're always trying to be
a little bit better today

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.250
than you were yesterday.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.610
And the important thing
is, working with them,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.190
is to talk to them
about competing

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.159
against their previous best
self, not the other team.

00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:13.825
Because on a given
night, you might play

00:37:13.825 --> 00:37:15.820
a team that's better or worse.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:19.690
And you might beat them or
win, but you haven't really

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.040
gotten better that night.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.430
You haven't really
competed at a level that

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.490
is going to push you
out of your comfort zone

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:29.840
and expand your
capacity to perform.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.570
And the same for us,
not just athletes.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.630
Even in our work, to
the degree that we're

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.100
able to just look and
evaluate, well, where am I?

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.580
Where do I want to go,
and how do I keep pushing?

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.800
And it's incrementally,
and it's painless

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.840
because it doesn't have to be
so far ahead the we're damaging

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.070
ourselves, just a
little bit at a time,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.100
like slow motion gets
you there quicker.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.190
Just incrementally, and then
it has an exponential jump

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.740
when we can do that.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.280
So that was the
idea, having people

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.340
who are willing and
committed to excellence,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.995
and willing to say, OK, let's
keep raising our challenges.

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:10.980
And let's keep getting
better each day.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.560
Let's put in the work.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.310
Let's use the mindfulness
and stay committed to what

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:18.510
the basic fundamentals are.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.885
And then you have
a system that's

00:38:19.885 --> 00:38:25.770
predicated on all five
players moving like fingers

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.320
on a hand in unison.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.090
So the we takes
precedence over the me.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:31.870
And it's a blending.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.910
It's a commitment.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.700
One of the things Phil
used to say all the time--

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.715
or he still says this,
the strength of the pack

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:40.210
is in the wolf, and the strength
of the wolf is in a pack.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.310
So we need both the
wolf and the pack

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.000
or both individual
players and the team.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.570
So as good as
Michael was, as good

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.970
as Scottie was, as
good as Dennis was,

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.320
they had to work together.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.540
And they had find a
way of being in the we.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.570
But in the same time,
in that context,

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.470
could they be their unique,
authentic selves in that space.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, George.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:08.480
I really admire the topic
of mindfulness for athletes,

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.060
and I'm curious to hear it a
little bit more about this.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.200
For example, I'm a
want to be triathlete.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.840
And you know to run triathlons,
you have to push yourself.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.180
You have to run harder in order
to be able to perform faster.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.400
And there is a lot
of pain in the way,

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.850
especially to run fast.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.230
There is a moment like
a lot of points of pain.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.220
So I'm wondering, can
you use mindfulness

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.550
in order to overcome those.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.380
So as you're in a
training session

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.290
or maybe can you use
mindfulness in order

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.620
to get more motivated
to exercise?

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.240
And I would appreciate
some practical tips

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.690
on how to approach the athletics
discipline with mindfulness.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.721
GEORGE MUMFORD: Mhm.

00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:44.220
Yes.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.440
Well, let's think
about mindfulness.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.810
What mindfulness can do
with those other factors,

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.490
with wisdom and making
the right effort

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.280
and having enough faith and
steadiness of mind, is really

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.730
looking at, so what
am I doing, and what's

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.920
the best way to to do it?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.810
It's what we would call
clear comprehension, which

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:06.720
is what your purpose?

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.290
What your intention because your
intention is really important.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.710
If your attention
is just to do this

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.084
because it's a good thing to
do, that's a certain energy.

00:40:13.084 --> 00:40:15.480
If your intention is
to do this because you

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.385
want to see-- you
love competing,

00:40:19.385 --> 00:40:23.560
and you love this context
of swimming, riding a bike,

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.970
and running, so then
you have to investigate.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.840
Explore, well, who's
the best at doing this?

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.680
Who's the best swimmer
in the triathlete?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.620
Who's the best runner?

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.220
Who's the best cyclist?

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.430
And then you try
to learn and try

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.310
to understand what are
the basic techniques

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:42.110
for each one of those things.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:46.315
And then your own personal
evaluation or inventory

00:40:46.315 --> 00:40:47.000
of yourself.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:47.990
What do I do well?

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.490
What do I not do well?

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.864
So let's say, if
you're really good--

00:40:51.864 --> 00:40:53.030
what are you really good at?

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.744
What's your best--

00:40:54.744 --> 00:40:56.130
AUDIENCE: The running.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:56.530
GEORGE MUMFORD: The running.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:57.210
OK.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.630
So then the idea is you
want to sustain the running.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.600
But if you're really
weak at swimming

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.690
and really weak at cycling,
then maybe your strategy

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.130
needs to be-- this is what
we call strategic planning,

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.170
or forethought.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.280
It has to do with
motivation, but also

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.020
your strategy, your technique,
your tactics that you're

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.120
going to use.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.340
And so when we set
goals, the goals

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.240
can be a combination of
outcome and technique.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.120
So you have to work
on the technique that

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.000
will help you get faster times
and help you develop a place

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.540
where your effortless.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.930
But if you try to do all
three of those things

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.470
with equal attention
and care, that

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.970
might not be the
best use your time.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.340
It maybe that whatever you do
really well, you sustain that.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.400
And then maybe one
of the other two,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.760
instead of trying to do both
of those, you just focus on one

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.110
and get that one up to speed,
or get that one faster.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.215
And then just realize, OK,
that one, I'm not so good in,

00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:54.710
so my time is not
going to be good.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.320
But I'm going to focus
on what I can control

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.520
and what I can get better at
because what you don't want

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.520
to do, sometimes, is do
something you're really

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.560
not good at and spend all your
time just to be mediocre rather

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.450
than realizing just do it to a
certain level to the best you

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.020
can, but then focus on the areas
where you can get gain time

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.130
or you can reduce time.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.290
You get what I'm saying?

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.060
And so it's more like that.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.080
So there has to be some wisdom,
some understanding on what's

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.020
the best way for me to
improve my performance.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.550
And whatever-- and instead
of trying to perform it--

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.360
do it all at once, you
start selectively selecting

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.240
what things you want to bring
more deliberate practice to

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.240
and really focus on getting
better at so that even

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.070
though you have less-- more
time in one of those three

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.042
components, the other
two can carry that one.

00:42:43.042 --> 00:42:45.500
So it's like they have a thing
they called Pareto Analysis.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.200
I used to work in corporate
world as a financial analyst.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.460
And Pareto Analysis says
that if you have five things,

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.520
instead of working on all
five, you take two of them--

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.010
or you take one of them.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:01.720
That one thing, that 20%, will
give you 80% of the benefit.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.660
So you start to deliberately
understand, well,

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.340
which one is going to enhance
my improvement the most--

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.545
my performance the most.

00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:11.110
Then, you focus on that.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:11.703
Make sense?

00:43:11.703 --> 00:43:12.494
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:43:12.494 --> 00:43:12.994
Yes.

00:43:12.994 --> 00:43:13.785
GEORGE MUMFORD: OK.

00:43:13.785 --> 00:43:15.670
And obviously, not that
I'm trying to sell,

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.319
but my book is a good
start for this stuff.

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.610
Actually, because you stop
looking at-- because there's

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.950
the five spiritual
powers, so you

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.200
have to have energy to do
whatever you're going to do.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.210
And these balancing
of those powers

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:31.045
actually helps you have
access to energy and power

00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:33.170
to do things, especially
the space between stimulus

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.590
and response because when
you stop paying attention,

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.560
you'll start to know.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.890
Because when I-- I used to
run before my legs gave out.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.440
And I used to get
a stitch running.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.380
And then when I became
mindful, I just--

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.290
instead of calling it a
stitch, I could just be with it

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.340
and allow it to be there.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.840
And I was able to run
longer and just allow

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.420
it to just be a sensation.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.250
Just allow it to
be there and just

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.770
continue to-- because the
more you try not to have it,

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:57.910
the more you have it.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.910
You get what I'm saying?

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.010
So the mindfulness
can be really helpful

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.420
because the body has
intelligence, if we can just

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.680
listen to what it's telling us.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.240
So sometimes, when
it tells us to rest,

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.240
we have to get recovery.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.800
Sometimes, it tells us we can
push it a little bit long--

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.670
more.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.250
But you've got to listen, and
you've got to know your body

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.264
and what you need to do.

00:44:19.264 --> 00:44:21.680
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
something about knowing million

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.860
who you are and where you
are and what you want to do.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:30.095
So do you believe everyone
needs a life purpose and also

00:44:30.095 --> 00:44:33.100
a life mission to achieve?

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.450
Do you think that's the
whole point of being present,

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.920
being mindful?

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.550
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yeah, is the
purpose just to be who you are?

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.030
Maybe I'll answer it this way.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.310
One way I look at
this is that we all

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.230
have a masterpiece
inside, and we all

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.110
have a uniqueness
that is special.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:57.330
And that if we can cultivate
that, embrace it, develop it,

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.870
and share it with others, that
that would be really, really

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.789
helpful.

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:02.580
But I do know this.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.516
If we don't know who we are,
we will end up being anybody.

00:45:05.516 --> 00:45:07.140
And if we don't know
where we're going,

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.280
we'll end up going anywhere.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.710
So the idea is that
we have the ability

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:18.770
to decide what our core values
are or how we want to live.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:22.220
And even if we don't know who we
are, if we just live according

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:27.880
to core values, like just
being more loving, more

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.830
compassionate, being present
for yourself and others,

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.130
that you start to glean.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.350
And then when you listen, there
will be something inside of you

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.185
that starts speaking
to you from your heart,

00:45:39.185 --> 00:45:42.000
telling you, OK,
I like to do this.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.270
Like Joseph Campbell
said, follow your bliss.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:45.599
Where's your bliss?

00:45:45.599 --> 00:45:47.140
But the problem with
that sometimes--

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.020
or the difficulty
with that sometimes

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.070
is if we really look at where
we are and who we want to be,

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.100
we might not be in
the place we're at

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.140
and we may not do with
the people we're with.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:04.000
So there's a loss there or
there's a having to let go, was

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.140
can be painful.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.930
But it's my experience,
with myself,

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:12.130
I had to be in the
throes of substance abuse

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.410
before I got to a
point where I said OK.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:16.620
This is not working.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.640
Maybe I ought to look and see
who I'm supposed to be and just

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.260
connect with that, follow my
bliss, and just be the best

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.100
George I can based on
the inside out approach.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.070
Not what somebody
thinks I should be

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.710
or what society says I should
be, but really looking inside

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.500
and then following my bliss
or following the thing that

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.920
wants me-- that draws me to it.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:45.470
It's heartfelt. As a
path with heart is,

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.730
as Jack Kornfield would say.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.480
Just following what is it.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.560
And sometimes, it's being
still and knowing and asking

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.220
that question.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.040
Who am I?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.170
Or, who do I want to be?

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.010
Or, who do I admire?

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:01.210
What are the qualities
that I admire in people

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.474
and that I would
like to emulate?

00:47:03.474 --> 00:47:06.140
AUDIENCE: So I'm experiencing, I
think, what might be a paradox,

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.210
and I'm struggling with it.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.501
I'd love to hear how you
communicate maybe specifically

00:47:09.501 --> 00:47:11.640
to athletes for an analogy.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.740
I find that the more I cultivate
a mindfulness and meditation

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.820
practice in my own
life, the better I'm

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.792
getting with productivity,
focus, compassion.

00:47:19.792 --> 00:47:21.500
So it's becoming harder
and harder for me

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.624
during those practices
to be still and present

00:47:24.624 --> 00:47:26.040
and really in the
moment because I

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.860
realize the benefit from them.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.860
So I found myself
wanting to cultivate

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:33.740
those practices for this
outcome that I'm wedded to,

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.120
which is paradoxical because
I want to be in this moment

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.770
not thinking about
what's to come.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.549
But the more I do it, the more
I get better at these things,

00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:45.590
and so it's making it
harder to be in the moment.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.910
Does this make any sense?

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.090
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yes, so
what you're saying is

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.300
you can't be in the moment
and think about the future

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.021
at the same time?

00:47:51.021 --> 00:47:52.270
AUDIENCE: Something like that.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.260
GEORGE MUMFORD:
Yeah, but who said

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.926
you had to be in the
moment all the time

00:47:54.926 --> 00:47:57.376
and never think
about the future.

00:47:57.376 --> 00:47:58.250
It's a good one, huh?

00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:59.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.700
GEORGE MUMFORD: See because the
fact is what I think is helpful

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.740
is forming the
intention or saying

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:09.172
this is-- there's the mountain
top, and I want to go there.

00:48:09.172 --> 00:48:11.380
So every once and a while
I look at the mountain top.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.550
But the main thing is
to be on the journey

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.600
and be present to the journey
because the journey could

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.010
have twists and turns.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.260
Or, we could get off
track, but the mindfulness

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.820
will bring us back on track.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.790
And so this either/or
or saying I've

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:28.550
got to totally always be present
and not think about the future

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:34.780
or not have an idea
where I want to go,

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.040
that is a way of looking at.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.350
That's not the only
way to look at it.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.460
I think that it's important
that you have goals.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.640
It's important that
you are striving.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.960
But after you set the
intention, form the intention,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.500
and set the goal,
then you've got

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.340
to focus on the here and now
and the incremental steps

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.290
to get you there.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.540
So you've got to keep looking.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.956
Am I going in the
right direction?

00:48:52.956 --> 00:48:55.110
Is this where I need to be?

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.760
Because you can get off track.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.450
And so I don't see it
as a paradox at all.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.520
Unless, you start
using the present time

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.380
to think about the future more
than being in the present time

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.180
as you are experiencing
the present time.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.310
So you got to find
a balance there,

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.150
and each person's
going to be different.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.310
But, sometimes, just
thinking about your goal

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:21.630
can be inspiring and motivating.

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:24.250
But then where it
gets to be a problem,

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.809
sometimes, is you have an
idea of how it should unfold,

00:49:28.809 --> 00:49:30.350
instead of just
forming the intention

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.895
and allowing it to unfold
the way it needs to.

00:49:33.895 --> 00:49:34.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, George.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.260
Thank you for sharing
your insight with us.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.130
When I run, especially
longer runs,

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.040
I find it easier, a lot easier,
if I let my mind tune out

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.990
and just drift away
and wander around

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.500
as opposed to being
mindful of running.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:55.390
So my time goes faster when
I'm not thinking of running.

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:59.435
This is like the total
opposite you're advising us.

00:49:59.435 --> 00:50:01.560
I'm wondering if I
misunderstood what you're saying

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.926
or if this is--

00:50:02.926 --> 00:50:03.800
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yeah.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.820
So are you enjoying
what you're doing?

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.000
AUDIENCE: Yes, I do a lot.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.300
GEORGE MUMFORD: Are you
aware of what you're doing?

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.770
You're aware that
your mind is just

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.636
out there, not focused on
anything in particular?

00:50:12.636 --> 00:50:13.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.329
And sometimes, I
purposely take it there.

00:50:16.329 --> 00:50:17.120
GEORGE MUMFORD: OK.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:17.620
Yeah.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.280
But it would be
interesting to see

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.010
because I don't see anything
wrong what you're doing.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.660
Unless, you're taking
it there because you

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.940
don't want to be in your
body because there's

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.209
something in there you
don't want to deal with.

00:50:26.209 --> 00:50:28.500
Because one of the things we
do-- the nervous system is

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.340
programmed to do is
if it's pleasant,

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.970
it will move towards it.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.410
If it's unpleasant, it
will move away from it.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.140
And if it doesn't have
a goal or a focus,

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.172
then it will space out.

00:50:39.172 --> 00:50:41.140
It's Neither pleasant
nor unpleasant.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.910
And I say we spend most
of our time in that one.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.890
That you just space out, whether
we're watching TV or running

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:49.110
and just letting
our mind just go.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.690
And I'm not saying anything
is wrong with that,

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:55.600
just knowing that you're
doing that is important.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.240
Just knowing where
your mind is, even

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.070
if it gets lost for 20
minutes and it comes back,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:01.770
when you're back, you're back.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.436
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:05.390
It usually goes out for a few
minutes comes back and then

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.620
goes out again, comes back and--
especially when you're running

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:09.456
two, three hours.

00:51:09.456 --> 00:51:10.330
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yeah.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.590
Well, I think everybody's
mind is like that.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.730
That whatever we're
doing, we're not able--

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.540
because we would be enlightened
if we could be present

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.215
and we didn't have any issues.

00:51:20.215 --> 00:51:21.380
We'd be enlightened.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.090
But the mind has
a mind of its own.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:23.720
It goes.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.830
It does things.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.110
And it's when it's going off and
doing that when we're-- I say

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:33.400
you're doing carpentry at home,
and you've got the electric saw

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.912
going, I think your mind
wants to be present--

00:51:36.912 --> 00:51:39.340
or when you're driving or
when you're doing things,

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.000
there's a time.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.657
Like the carpenter says,
measure twice, cut once.

00:51:42.657 --> 00:51:44.490
There's a reason why
they say measure twice.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.050
Because the first
time, you may not

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:48.800
have been paying attention
because the mind has

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.570
a mind of its own.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:50.970
It is always going off.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.890
So I'm not suggesting
when your mindful means

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:54.080
your mind is always there.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.663
I'm saying when
you're mindful, you're

00:51:55.663 --> 00:51:57.700
mindful when your
mind is not there.

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.279
You're mindful when
you do space out.

00:51:59.279 --> 00:52:01.820
Now, it's not a problem unless
you make it a problem and say,

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.476
it shouldn't be doing that.

00:52:03.476 --> 00:52:05.100
Well, it's doing it
because that's what

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.727
it does under those conditions.

00:52:06.727 --> 00:52:08.310
So if you don't like
that, then you've

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.290
got to change the conditions.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.020
But if you're OK
with it, it's fine.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.545
But I'm not-- it's not to
use the mindfulness to say

00:52:14.545 --> 00:52:16.420
mindfulness means you're
there and you're not

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.920
thinking about anything else.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.165
No mindfulness is a-- it
could be a broad mindfulness.

00:52:21.165 --> 00:52:25.010
It could be really narrow when
you're focusing on one thing,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.810
but most of the
time, being broad

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.980
is good because it shows you
how things are connected.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.850
And you see the whole
periphery of all the activity

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.790
and the interconnectedness
of everything.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:39.351
So it is a question of what
do you mean by mindfulness

00:52:39.351 --> 00:52:40.350
and why are you running.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:41.640
It's always your intention.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.170
If your intention is just
to run and to be out there

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:48.600
and just to let your mind go,
then that's what you're doing.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.550
But if your intention
is to be there

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:54.450
and to be mindful and really
improve your performance,

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:55.887
that's something else.

00:52:55.887 --> 00:52:56.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.167
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yeah.

00:52:58.167 --> 00:53:00.750
AUDIENCE: I was just confused a
little bit, George, about when

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.600
you're talking about slowing
everything down in elongating

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.540
everything.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.450
And yet you're talking--
the other sport

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.830
that you've been
involved in primarily

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.002
is basketball, which
happens in split seconds.

00:53:13.002 --> 00:53:14.210
GEORGE MUMFORD: That's right.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.640
AUDIENCE: And having to be
incredibly attuned and present.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.502
I mean what-- it's a
contradiction to me, I guess.

00:53:20.502 --> 00:53:22.710
GEORGE MUMFORD: Yeah, it
sounds like a contradiction.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:26.270
I was watching this program.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:30.970
It was on the human-- I think
it was on sight or the brain.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:34.290
And it was about
these firefighters

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:37.440
that were in the
Northwest fighting a fire.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.300
And one of the
things a brain can do

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.710
is-- so they were in this
place, and all a sudden, they

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.590
got trapped by the fire.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.160
It surrounded them.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.920
And so the brain has this
trick where it can slow down

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.090
perception where
these folks were

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:56.500
able to slow-- it slows down
your perception so that things

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.379
seem-- they slow down.

00:54:00.379 --> 00:54:02.420
There's a way of relating
experience where you're

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.610
coming out of that space.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.440
You just have two seconds.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.360
It seems like an eternity.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.750
And it's like
relativity [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:12.770
So if your team is
up by one point,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.490
and it's two seconds to
go, and the other team

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:18.090
has the ball, that's
a long two seconds.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:21.570
But if you're the team
that is trying to score,

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.520
that two seconds
is not enough time.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.460
But so perception is
really interesting.

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.010
So there's a way of
relating to your experience.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.300
And then by programing
yourself when you're not

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.961
on the court by slowing
down and understanding--

00:54:34.961 --> 00:54:36.460
and a lot of times,
the slowing down

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.820
is not to habitually
react, but just

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.090
to let things speak to you.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.920
And in that space,
the perception,

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.530
it creates more time.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.750
And so it's not like
you're doing it on purpose.

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:52.300
It happens because you are
open and not mechanically

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.370
reacting to things.

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:56.060
You are actually letting
things speak to you.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.280
And so it's something
that I talk about,

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.230
but unless you experience
it, it may not make sense.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:05.490
But I'm pretty sure there's
times when, depending on-- it's

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:08.990
not just sports-- but when
you're looking at something,

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.730
and for some reason, there's
enough patience there

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:17.190
and a willingness to just
hang out and that not knowing.

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.220
If that makes any sense.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.610
It's just not knowing.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.280
And so you cultivate
that by being mindful

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.730
and because you know
what's going to happen

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:30.060
and you program your autonomic--
you program your neural net

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.490
to know what to do.

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:36.080
And they say that the speed of
trust, like if you trust things

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.850
and you have-- and
you know things

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:42.850
are going to turn out well,
you've got a lot of patience.

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:45.990
It's perception
of-- it's relative.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.920
So there's an idea that we
have the same perception,

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.800
and everything's the same speed.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.320
But the body and the mind,
when you say save me,

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.230
the intention to save
you-- the unconscious

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:02.340
has a way of slowing
perception down so that we have

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.230
time to do what we have to do.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:08.300
And these guys-- it was just an
instinct, a survival instinct.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.190
These firefighters were able to
save their lives because they

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.730
were able to slow down time.

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:15.030
And they get to where they
need to get and they dig.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.100
And then they put the
things over themselves

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.230
so that they can do that.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:20.020
And a lot of times, you see it.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.800
In the book, I talk about
when I was a substance abuser,

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.560
using heroin.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.590
And one time, I was giving
myself an injection,

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:37.840
and the needle broke.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.930
And it started
moving in my vein.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.360
And I slowed down time.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.249
I tied up my arm, and I was able
to go to the emergency room,

00:56:45.249 --> 00:56:46.540
and they were able to catch it.

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.300
Because if that I had gone to
my heart, I would have died.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.980
So it slowed down time, and
I was not in my right mind.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.640
But my brain knew what to do.

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.530
So it's not just
because the mindfulness

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.390
allows us to do that.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.789
There's a life instinct.

00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:05.580
There's a way that the
nervous system, when

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.380
we get out of the way,
it knows what to do.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.840
And so I cited this situation.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.830
So yeah, it's not a paradox
that you're moving really fast,

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.370
but because you're coming from
the eye of the hurricane-- My

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.520
Sifu, my Tai Chi teacher, said
there's movement in stillness

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.620
and stillness in movement.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.465
So you can be quick
and not be in a hurry.

00:57:25.465 --> 00:57:26.840
That's what John
Wooden, and that

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.320
was his famous saying, the
Hall of Fame coach for UCLA.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.640
He said, be quick, but
don't be in a hurry.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.640
And so there's a way of
relating the experience where

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.450
there's just time.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.824
Just like people will tell
you, when they're in the zone,

00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:43.100
that basket is huge
or that goal is huge.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.680
And you can't describe it.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:50.460
So it being huge, there's
something about it.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.530
And some people--
Pele, he had this thing

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:56.827
he would do where he would
move his body one way,

00:57:56.827 --> 00:57:58.410
and the goalie starts
moving this way.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.800
And then he would-- boom.

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.000
He would do this thing.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.230
They have a name for it.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:05.310
But he had this
ability, unconsciously,

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:10.259
to reverse direction before
the other person knew

00:58:10.259 --> 00:58:11.300
what was going to happen.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.656
And if they do an
fMRI on you, they

00:58:14.656 --> 00:58:16.030
can tell you what
decision you're

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.655
going to make before
you're aware of it

00:58:17.655 --> 00:58:21.420
because this part of
the brain that trigger,

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:27.370
or the neuronet that signals
or that's stimulated, that it

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.850
fires before we're aware of it.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:31.700
So there's this
space-- this time

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.770
before stimulus and response.

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:36.180
And so most of the time,
because it's reactive

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.669
and we're not paying
attention, there's no time.

00:58:38.669 --> 00:58:40.710
But when we're paying
attention and we can see it

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:45.610
as it's arising, then
we can create space

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.430
and be able to have a thing.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.442
So it's not-- some
of this stuff,

00:58:50.442 --> 00:58:51.900
if you're trying
to figure out what

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.760
the left brain, if
you're right-handed,

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.562
it ain't going to get there.

00:58:55.562 --> 00:58:57.270
There's something you
have to experience.

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.590
It's like implicit learning is
what we call a non-declarative.

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.580
It's just something--
because they've

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.040
done this with these
tests with cards.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.800
People can-- they can pick
cards, two decks of cards,

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.946
and then your unconscious
knows what cards to pick

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:13.560
and it works better when your
conscious mind is not involved.

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.220
So when you know and
you program yourself,

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.855
you have time because
this reaction.

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.480
It's like there's a
seeing, and there's

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.230
no space between
seeing and reacting

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:25.110
because the seeing is moving.

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:28.490
You see this in baseball, or
any sports the ball is hit,

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.265
and the guy is moving
this way towards the ball.

00:59:31.265 --> 00:59:32.560
He's not thinking about it.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.914
His body is just been trained--

00:59:33.914 --> 00:59:35.330
KAREN MAY: He's
that well trained.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:36.538
GEORGE MUMFORD: --to do that.

00:59:36.538 --> 00:59:38.810
So there's no--
There's plenty of time

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:43.230
because there's-- something
is moving that's already got

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.940
what's happening.

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.850
That's already
prepared and ready

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.470
to respond to what's happening.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:51.340
I know it may not make sense,
but that's the way it is.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:51.700
KAREN MAY: We're going to--

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.090
GEORGE MUMFORD: OK, thank you.

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:52.790
KAREN MAY: --leave
it there, George.

00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:54.440
Absolutely lovely
to hear from you.

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.220
Stick around if you want
to ask him more questions

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.344
or have him sign your book.

00:59:57.344 --> 00:59:59.490
And if you haven't read
it, I recommend it.

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:01.280
GEORGE MUMFORD: Thank you.
