00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.333
Good afternoon.
I hope you had a nice weekend.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:30.000
Did you have a nice weekend?
Good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.400
Today, we are going to start
talking about the motion of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.280
molecules.
We are first going to talk

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.080
about the translational motion
of molecules today and Friday.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.480
And then we are going to talk
about the internal motion,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.120
in particular the vibrational
motion of molecules and their

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.880
rotational motion.
That will be early next week.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.753
First, transitional motion.
Certainly, the quintessential

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:05.406
equation that represents the
behavior of gases is,

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:11.008
of course, the ideal gas law,
P equals n over V times RT.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.807
This equation accurately

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:19.459
represents the behavior of gases
at low pressures.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.593
It is an empirical law,
of course.

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.626
It is a law that Boyle and
Charles discovered by doing

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:31.988
experiments.
They noted that as the

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:35.875
temperature is raised,
the pressure went up.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:41.299
They noted as the amount of gas
or the number of moles of gas

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.463
added goes up,
the pressure goes up.

00:01:44.463 --> 00:01:49.887
They noted that as the volume
of their gaseous container goes

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:55.039
up, the pressure goes down.
Literally, this is an equation

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.372
established by experiment and
just varying one variable at a

00:02:00.372 --> 00:02:04.598
time.
And since it looked like the

00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:09.517
pressure was directly
proportional to the temperature,

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:15.365
they wrote an equation where it
was directly proportional to the

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:19.077
temperature, etc.
And the proportionality

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:23.161
constant here was always this
one constant R,

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:27.709
no matter what gas you had.
But this ideal gas law

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.000
describes the macroscopic
properties of a gas.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.487
And what I mean by macroscopic
properties are properties that

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:40.030
describe a collection of
molecules.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.573
For example,
to really talk about a

00:02:42.573 --> 00:02:46.462
pressure, you have to have a
collection of molecules.

00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:50.875
We are going to talk about the
pressure due to one molecule,

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.193
but that is really just a
model.

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:57.157
If you want to talk about
pressure, you need to have a

00:02:57.157 --> 00:03:02.448
collection of molecules.
If you talk about temperature,

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:06.938
it really only has meaning when
you have a collection of

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.204
molecules.
But what we want to understand

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:14.530
is what are the underlying
microscopic phenomenon that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.346
gives rise to this macroscopic
equation or these macroscopic

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:22.612
properties.
We want to know what is going

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:27.102
on in terms of the behavior of
the individual particles,

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:32.000
the individual molecules that
make up this gas.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.411
Inquiring minds want to know
what the temperature means when

00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.529
we talk about individual
molecules.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:45.757
And that is also was Maxwell
and Boltzmann wanted to know.

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:50.985
They wanted a microscopic
explanation for PV equal nRT.

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:53.002
And, to do so,

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:57.497
they put forth a theory called
the kinetic theory,

00:03:57.497 --> 00:04:03.000
or the kinetic theory for the
behavior of gases.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.778
And that is exactly what we are
going to take a look at here,

00:04:07.778 --> 00:04:11.601
this kinetic theory.
We are going to do what they

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:14.309
did.
Basically, this kinetic theory

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:19.088
allowed properties of gases at
low pressures to be predicted,

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:24.106
and it allowed an understanding
of why some of the properties of

00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:28.725
real gases at higher pressures
deviated from this ideal gas

00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:31.735
law.
But, more importantly,

00:04:31.735 --> 00:04:36.232
what it did was it allowed the
quantity pressure times the

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:40.965
volume **PV** to be understood
in terms of the motions of the

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:43.805
molecules.
And it provided a means to

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:48.144
understand this concept of a
temperature in terms of the

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:52.405
motions of the molecules.
And that is what we are going

00:04:52.405 --> 00:04:56.113
to look at today.
We are going to see how we can

00:04:56.113 --> 00:05:00.609
describe pressure and volume in
terms of the motion of the

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:04.869
molecules and temperature in
terms of the motion of the

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:08.598
molecules.
That is our goal.

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:13.205
In order to do that,
the first thing we have to do

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:17.059
is to understand what we mean by
pressure.

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.008
For example,
if you have some gas here in a

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:26.931
container and you are measuring
the pressure of this gas in that

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:31.908
container, --
what you are really measuring

00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:37.826
is the force that the gas exerts
on one of the walls of this

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:41.838
container.
That is, pressure is the force

00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:45.851
exerted by the gas on one of
these walls.

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:51.869
It is the force per unit area
that is exerted on the walls of

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.382
that container.
That

00:05:56.382 --> 00:06:00.495
is what pressure is.
But what Maxwell did,

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:04.133
--
-- and this is 1850,

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:07.866
1855.
What Maxwell did was recognize

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:14.373
that he could understand this
macroscopic pressure in terms of

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:20.240
the individual forces of the
molecules when they hit the

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.906
container.
In other words,

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:29.306
he proposed that this gas was
composed of these molecules and

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:34.000
that these molecules were
moving.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.838
That was his proposal.
And that when they moved and

00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:44.645
hit the walls of the container,
well, that was the force that

00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:48.322
was exerted by the gas.
In other words,

00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:52.387
the force was really the
individual forces,

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:56.064
F sub i,
here, of the individual

00:06:56.064 --> 00:07:00.231
molecules.
That total force was the

00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:05.158
individual force of the
molecules hitting the walls of

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:08.690
the container.
That is what led to this

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.060
macroscopic concept,
the macroscopic quantity of

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.570
pressure.
That was his idea.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.125
Well, if that was his idea,
he carried it through,

00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:24.587
now, to a prediction.
The idea is that this force

00:07:24.587 --> 00:07:29.422
arises from the individual
forces of these individual

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:35.000
molecules hitting the walls of
the container.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Let's look at what theory he
wrote down.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.547
His goal, here,
was to calculate these

00:07:56.547 --> 00:08:00.000
individual forces,
F sub i.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.530
And, of course,
go back to classical mechanics.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.444
Force is the mass times the
acceleration,

00:08:07.444 --> 00:08:10.360
the mass of the particle,
the molecule,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.351
times its acceleration.
And acceleration we can write

00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:17.190
just in terms of delta v over
delta t.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.488
That is just the mass times

00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:26.016
delta v over the change in time.
And if the mass is constant

00:08:26.016 --> 00:08:29.930
here, this numerator,
that is the change in momentum

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.390
per unit change in time.
That is what this force is.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.639
What we have to do,
here, is calculate the change

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:44.862
in the momentum of the wall when
the molecule hits the wall.

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:50.262
That will be the force of the
individual molecule in the wall,

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:55.662
that over the time between the
collisions of the molecule with

00:08:55.662 --> 00:09:00.000
the wall.
That is the individual forces.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.857
That is what we are trying to
calculate, right here.

00:09:04.857 --> 00:09:09.904
Let's do that and calculate
delta p, the change in the

00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:14.095
wall's momentum.
Let's do it in one dimension

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.190
first.
Here is our box.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:21.714
This is just a cross-sectional
view of that box I drew over

00:09:21.714 --> 00:09:24.761
here.
And this is going to be the

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:30.000
wall that we are going to be
interested in.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.595
The box has a length l.
And we have this molecule with

00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:38.236
some mass m.
It is coming into the wall and

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:43.352
is going to collide with it,
and it has some velocity vector

00:09:43.352 --> 00:09:45.433
v.
But let's do it in one

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:48.641
dimension because it is simpler
to do.

00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:54.017
And then we are going to extend
it to three dimensions in a few

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:57.225
minutes.
We are just going to do it in

00:09:57.225 --> 00:10:01.788
one dimension now.
We are only going to be

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:05.833
interested in then the
x-component of the velocity of

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:10.422
this molecule coming into the
wall, and we want to know what

00:10:10.422 --> 00:10:14.933
is the force exerted by this
molecule when it collides with

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:18.122
this wall.
First we have to get the change

00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:21.777
in the momentum.
This molecule comes in and hits

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:26.211
the wall, and we are going to
consider it to be an elastic

00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:30.247
collision.
If the component of the

00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:36.011
velocity in the x direction
before the collision is v sub x,

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:40.408
then after the collision,
it is minus v sub x.

00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:45.195
We have just changed the
direction of our velocity

00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:50.080
vector, not the magnitude.
The change in the atom's

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.086
momentum, then,
is just the momentum after

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:59.362
minus the moment before.
The momentum after was m times

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:03.648
minus v sub x.
The momentum before,

00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:06.946
m sub v sub x.
Delta in the change in the

00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:09.997
atom's momentum,
is minus 2 m v sub x.

00:11:09.997 --> 00:11:14.614
However, we have to conserve

00:11:14.614 --> 00:11:17.912
momentum.
The momentum change in the atom

00:11:17.912 --> 00:11:22.364
plus the momentum change in the
wall has to equal zero.

00:11:22.364 --> 00:11:27.228
And what we want to know is the
momentum change in the wall,

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:31.021
because we are after this
macroscopic quantity,

00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:35.463
pressure.
And so, if the change in the

00:11:35.463 --> 00:11:40.917
momentum of the atom is minus 2
m v sub x,

00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:46.108
then the change in the
momentum of the wall is 2 m v

00:11:46.108 --> 00:11:49.011
sub x .

00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:52.706
We have one quantity here.
We have delta p.

00:11:52.706 --> 00:11:57.897
But now, we have to calculate
how often that momentum in the

00:11:57.897 --> 00:12:03.000
wall changes due to this
molecule's collisions.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.079
We need the delta t.
And so, what happens here?

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:11.513
The molecule comes in,
collides, and then reflects.

00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:15.681
And the molecule is now going
in this direction,

00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:20.027
where it hits the back wall,
and then it reflects.

00:12:20.027 --> 00:12:24.639
And ultimately it comes back
and hits the front wall.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:29.605
And what we want to know is
what is the time here between

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:34.333
the collisions.
The time between when that

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:38.461
molecule makes the momentum in
the wall change.

00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:40.794
What is this time,
delta t?

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:46.358
Well, if we know the length of
the box and we know the value of

00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:49.500
v sub x, we can calculate that
time.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.974
That time is just two times the
length of the box because that

00:12:54.974 --> 00:13:00.000
molecule is traveling back and
then forth, --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.986
-- that is 2l divided by the
velocity component in the x

00:13:04.986 --> 00:13:09.428
direction, v sub x.
That

00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:13.054
is delta t.
Now we have delta p and delta

00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:18.313
t, and we can plug that in and
make it simple a little bit.

00:13:18.313 --> 00:13:23.390
And so, here is the force
exerted by the collision of one

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.829
molecule on that one wall of the
container, m v sub x squared

00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:33.000
over l.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.884
But we said that Maxwell's idea
was that the macroscopic total

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:43.128
force was the sum of these
individual forces.

00:13:43.128 --> 00:13:48.337
What we have to do is take the
force of each individual

00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:52.871
molecule and add them up over
all the molecules.

00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:56.344
There is that force for
molecule one,

00:13:56.344 --> 00:13:59.045
molecule two,
molecule three,

00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:05.516
all the way up to molecule n.
I am going to pull out an m

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:10.830
over l out of this.
I just pull out an m over l,

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.610
and I have left the sum of the
squares of the velocities in the

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.432
x direction for each one of the
molecules.

00:14:20.432 --> 00:14:23.228
Notice here,
in this treatment,

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:27.796
we have identical m's.
The particles are the same,

00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:33.203
but, and this is important,
the velocities of the molecules

00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:38.896
are not the same.
That is going to be important.

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:44.013
Now, this expression here,
I want to simplify a little

00:14:44.013 --> 00:14:45.751
bit.
In particular,

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:51.158
I want to simplify the sum of
the squares of the velocity

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:56.855
components in the x direction
for each one of the molecules.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:15:02.068
To do that simplification,
I am going to introduce this

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:06.683
quantity.
This quantity is the average of

00:15:06.683 --> 00:15:10.579
the square of the velocity in
the x direction.

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:15.513
What this means is I take the
velocity in the x direction,

00:15:15.513 --> 00:15:18.976
I square it,
and then I take the average.

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:23.650
This is not the square of the
average velocity in the x

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.074
direction.
That is different.

00:15:26.074 --> 00:15:31.008
This is the average of the
square of the velocity in the x

00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:35.421
direction.
How am I going to evaluate that

00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:38.312
quantity?
Well, I am going to take the

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:43.078
velocity in the x direction for
molecule one and square it and

00:15:43.078 --> 00:15:47.765
add to that the square of the
velocity in the x direction for

00:15:47.765 --> 00:15:52.687
molecule two and add to that the
square of the velocity in the x

00:15:52.687 --> 00:15:58.000
direction for molecule three,
all the way up to molecule n.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.059
And then, if I want the
average, I am going to divide by

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.370
n, the number of molecules there
are.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.522
I am just going to bring n,
here, over to the other side.

00:16:11.522 --> 00:16:17.041
I have n times the average of
the velocity in the x direction

00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:21.364
squared as this sum,
and this is exactly the sum

00:16:21.364 --> 00:16:25.688
that I had in my expression for
the total force.

00:16:25.688 --> 00:16:31.703
I can simplify that now.
There is that same expression.

00:16:31.703 --> 00:16:36.389
Here is my total force.
What I am going to do is I am

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:42.066
going to substitute n times the
average of the velocity in the x

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:46.933
direction squared in for this
whole sum, and I have now

00:16:46.933 --> 00:16:52.430
something that is much tidier.
That is the total force exerted

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:57.566
by all the collisions of the
molecules in the container on

00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:03.268
that front wall.
But now I want the pressure.

00:17:03.268 --> 00:17:08.404
And the pressure is just force
per unit area.

00:17:08.404 --> 00:17:15.058
And so, I am going to take my
expression for the force and

00:17:15.058 --> 00:17:21.478
divide it by the unit area.
The area is the area of this

00:17:21.478 --> 00:17:25.330
wall, here, in my initial
example.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:31.694
I am going to call that area A.
And if this is a Q,

00:17:31.694 --> 00:17:36.867
and I am going to make it a Q
because it is easier to do it

00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:42.129
that way, the area times the
length then of this box is just

00:17:42.129 --> 00:17:44.805
the volume.
Here is the volume.

00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:49.799
There is my expression for the
pressure due to all of the

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:54.259
molecule colliding with the
front wall of that box.

00:17:54.259 --> 00:17:58.986
However, this is an expression
for the pressure in one

00:17:58.986 --> 00:18:03.000
dimension only,
the x dimension.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.288
And we know,
in real life,

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:10.230
we have three dimensions.
We have to take care of that.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.440
Let's do that now.
Let's extend this problem to

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.559
three dimensions.
To do so, I am just going to

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:23.684
realize right here that the
square of the velocity is the

00:18:23.684 --> 00:18:26.979
sum of the squares of the
components.

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:31.344
That, you understand.
That is okay.

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:37.448
What is not so obvious is this.
The average of the square of

00:18:37.448 --> 00:18:43.655
the velocity is the sum of the
average of the squares of each

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:47.275
one of the components.
That is true.

00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:52.448
You can prove that.
We are not going to prove that.

00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:57.103
I won't hold you responsible
for proving that,

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:01.230
but that is true.
That is correct,

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.384
but now here comes a critical
assumption in Boltzmann's

00:19:05.384 --> 00:19:08.538
treatment.
The critical assumption is that

00:19:08.538 --> 00:19:12.000
the motion of the molecules in
this gas, here,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.846
is random in the sense that the
molecules don't have a preferred

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:19.384
direction.
They are going in the x

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:23.769
direction as often as they are
going in the y direction as

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:28.307
often as they are going in the z
direction, so the motion is

00:19:28.307 --> 00:19:32.345
random.
If that motion is random,

00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:36.848
then the average of the
velocity squared in the x

00:19:36.848 --> 00:19:42.196
direction is going to be equal
to that in the y direction.

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:47.544
It is going to be equal to that
in the z direction if that

00:19:47.544 --> 00:19:52.048
motion is random.
And that is great because it is

00:19:52.048 --> 00:19:56.926
going to make things a little
simpler for us up here.

00:19:56.926 --> 00:20:00.679
If that is right,
then the average of the

00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:06.121
velocity squared is three times
the average of the velocity

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:11.000
squared in any one of the
dimensions.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.739
That is going to make it easy
to extrapolate this to three

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:22.579
dimensions because now I am
going to be able to substitute,

00:20:22.579 --> 00:20:28.420
which had the average of the
velocity squared only in the x

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:34.663
direction, I am going to be able
to substitute in an expression

00:20:34.663 --> 00:20:40.000
for the average velocity in
three dimensions.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.627
That is just going to be
one-third that.

00:20:43.627 --> 00:20:48.837
This is going to be one-third
the average of the velocity

00:20:48.837 --> 00:20:50.883
squared.
That is great.

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:56.186
Now, I am going to do that
substitution way up into there.

00:20:56.186 --> 00:21:00.000
And when I do that,
look at this.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.069
I have a result.
This is the kinetic theory

00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:07.072
result.
We just did exactly what

00:21:07.072 --> 00:21:11.044
Maxwell did.
We have an expression for the

00:21:11.044 --> 00:21:16.470
pressure times the volume,
which is written here in terms

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:21.799
of the average of the velocity
squared of the molecules.

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:28.000
It is written in terms of the
motion of the molecules.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.943
For the first time,
there is an understanding,

00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:36.500
here, of what gives rise to
pressure, and that is the

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.582
velocity or the motion of these
molecules hitting the wall.

00:21:41.582 --> 00:21:45.087
That is great.
That is the kinetic theory

00:21:45.087 --> 00:21:48.154
result.
But now, Boltzmann also knew

00:21:48.154 --> 00:21:53.324
from experiment that P times V
is equal to nRT.

00:21:53.324 --> 00:21:57.881
That is the experimental
result, which had been known

00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:02.000
already for over a hundred
years.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.628
That is the experiment.
If his theory is correct,

00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:14.312
if PV is equal to N m average
velocity squared over three,

00:22:14.312 --> 00:22:20.996
it better be equal to nRT.

00:22:20.996 --> 00:22:26.742
That will give us,
here, a prediction for what the

00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:33.543
velocity of the molecules ought
to be in terms of something

00:22:33.543 --> 00:22:40.658
experimentally controllable.
We can see if this kinetic

00:22:40.658 --> 00:22:45.667
theory model is correct.
We can solve this for the

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:52.006
average of the velocity squared.
It is equal to 3n RT N over m.

00:22:52.006 --> 00:22:57.629
We can go in the laboratory,

00:22:57.629 --> 00:23:02.230
vary T and see if,
in fact, the average of the

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.239
velocity squared of the
molecules is equal to this

00:23:07.239 --> 00:23:11.467
expression here.
That is great.

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:16.604
We have a way to experimentally
check this theory.

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:21.008
And you also see,
here, now, a relationship

00:23:21.008 --> 00:23:26.983
between the velocity of the
molecules and this macroscopic

00:23:26.983 --> 00:23:32.330
quantity, temperature.
Temperature is related to the

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:37.968
motion of these molecules.
But, before we go on,

00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:41.625
this is kind of a messy
expression here.

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:44.718
It has too many n's and m's in
it.

00:23:44.718 --> 00:23:48.562
Let me simplify that a little
bit for you.

00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:54.375
I am going to simplify this so
that this is 3RT over capital M,

00:23:54.375 --> 00:24:00.000
where the following is true.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.321
Over here, n is the number of
moles in the gas.

00:24:04.321 --> 00:24:08.078
That is little n.
Big N was the number of

00:24:08.078 --> 00:24:12.400
molecules in the gas.
Little m was the mass per

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.875
molecule.
All of this is equivalent to

00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:20.009
one over big M,
where big M was kilograms per

00:24:20.009 --> 00:24:23.296
mole.
You can convince yourselves of

00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:27.336
this equality.
I am taking all these N's and

00:24:27.336 --> 00:24:31.000
m's and making one big M.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.265
That is my expression,
here.

00:24:38.265 --> 00:24:42.797
I have the average of the
velocity squared equal to 3RT

00:24:42.797 --> 00:24:47.328
over M.
But this quantity is the

00:24:47.328 --> 00:24:52.615
average of the velocity squared.
It is more convenient for us to

00:24:52.615 --> 00:24:57.062
talk about a quantity
proportional to the velocity and

00:24:57.062 --> 00:25:02.176
not the velocity squared.
What I am going to do is take

00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:04.953
the square root of it.
That is simple.

00:25:04.953 --> 00:25:09.156
I now have the square root of
the average of the velocity

00:25:09.156 --> 00:25:12.008
squared.
That is the square root of 3RT

00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:14.560
over M.
I am going to call that the

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.688
root mean square velocity.
I am going to put an rms here

00:25:18.688 --> 00:25:23.267
as a subscript for the velocity.

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:25.668
It is the root mean square
velocity.

00:25:25.668 --> 00:25:29.571
I wanted to talk about a
quantity proportional to the

00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:34.000
velocity, instead of the
velocity squared.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.542
That is all I did there.
That is the root mean square

00:25:38.542 --> 00:25:41.861
velocity.
But the other big thing about

00:25:41.861 --> 00:25:45.093
it is you can see,
for the first time,

00:25:45.093 --> 00:25:47.888
now we have got,
and Maxwell had,

00:25:47.888 --> 00:25:51.382
an understanding of what
temperature was.

00:25:51.382 --> 00:25:56.099
Temperature is related to the
motions of the molecules.

00:25:56.099 --> 00:25:59.156
Temperature is related,
in this way,

00:25:59.156 --> 00:26:06.661
to the speed of the molecules.
Those are the two important

00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:11.949
results.
And this kinetic theory makes a

00:26:11.949 --> 00:26:19.000
prediction for what those
velocities ought to be.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.246
In addition,
the temperature is a measure of

00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:34.000
the kinetic energy of the
molecules.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.715
How is that?
Well, it is for this reason.

00:26:37.715 --> 00:26:43.009
Here is the expression we
derived from the kinetic theory.

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:47.931
And then here is an expression
that I just wrote down,

00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:53.597
that says the average kinetic
energy of a molecule is one-half

00:26:53.597 --> 00:26:58.891
M, where M is kilograms per
mole, times the average of the

00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:04.000
velocity squared.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.604
If I substitute the average of
the velocity squared into here,

00:27:09.604 --> 00:27:13.371
I get three-halves RT.

00:27:13.371 --> 00:27:16.954
This is telling us,
right here, that the

00:27:16.954 --> 00:27:22.374
temperature is also a measure of
the kinetic energy of these

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:25.865
molecules.
We are getting a microscopic

00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:30.000
view, here, of what temperature
is.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.571
It is related to the motions of
these molecules.

00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:40.212
Now, before I go on talking
about this, let me make one big

00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:43.714
point.
That is, this expression here,

00:27:43.714 --> 00:27:48.674
for the average energy,
notice that it is one-half M

00:27:48.674 --> 00:27:53.927
times the average of the
velocity squared.

00:27:53.927 --> 00:27:59.762
It is not one-half M times the
square of the average velocity

00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:03.701
This is important.

00:28:03.701 --> 00:28:09.371
The average energy is not the
square of the average velocity.

00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:14.664
Rather, the average energy is
the average of the velocity

00:28:14.664 --> 00:28:17.972
squared.
There is a big distinction.

00:28:17.972 --> 00:28:23.359
This is because the average
energy is the second moment of

00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:26.573
the velocity distribution
function.

00:28:26.573 --> 00:28:31.109
Variables don't always
correspond in a one-to-one

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:36.315
manner.
You don't have to understand

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:43.657
that, if this is foreign to you,
but I do want you to know this

00:28:43.657 --> 00:28:48.513
is correct.
Now, let me pick up back here.

00:28:48.513 --> 00:28:54.789
What I want you to notice is
that the root mean square

00:28:54.789 --> 00:29:00.000
velocity has a mass dependence
in it.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.210
What does that mean?
Well, it means the following.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:09.451
For some constant temperature,
say we pick 300 degrees Kelvin,

00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:14.520
the velocity of the molecule is
going to depend on its mass.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.300
And it is inversely
proportional to the mass,

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:23.455
so heavier molecules move more
slowly, lighter molecules move

00:29:23.455 --> 00:29:25.603
more quickly.
For example,

00:29:25.603 --> 00:29:30.587
helium at 300 degrees Kelvin,
it is cruising along at 3,060

00:29:30.587 --> 00:29:36.000
miles per hour at
room temperature.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.821
Xenon, on the other hand,
which is much more massive,

00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:44.529
is moving at a measly 534 miles
per hour.

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:47.403
There is a mass dependence
here.

00:29:47.403 --> 00:29:52.039
However, there is no mass
dependence to the kinetic

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:54.450
energy.
The kinetic energy,

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.437
we saw, was three-halves RT.

00:29:58.437 --> 00:30:04.000
You don't see a mass dependence
in here, do you?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.292
The kinetic energy is only
dependent on the temperature.

00:30:09.292 --> 00:30:15.161
Whether or not you have helium
or xenon, the kinetic energy of

00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:21.030
those atoms is 3.74 kilojoules
per mole at 300 degrees Kelvin.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:26.804
It does not matter that helium
is moving six times as fast as

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:30.364
xenon.
They both have the same kinetic

00:30:30.364 --> 00:30:34.477
energy.
There is no mass dependence in

00:30:34.477 --> 00:30:36.707
kinetic energy.
Now you say,

00:30:36.707 --> 00:30:39.681
oh, but look at this,
here is a mass,

00:30:39.681 --> 00:30:43.811
there is a mass dependence.
No, because you have to

00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.784
remember that you substitute in
here.

00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:49.923
If you square this,
there is an M here,

00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:53.805
and that cancels.
There is no mass dependence in

00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:57.769
the kinetic energy,
but the velocity is dependent

00:30:57.769 --> 00:31:01.743
on the mass.
That is important.

00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:07.169
Well, I told you that this was
the kinetic theory result.

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:12.110
That is, that the root mean
square velocity of these

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:16.179
molecules was represented by
this equation.

00:31:16.179 --> 00:31:21.508
And, from this equation,
if you calculate at 300 degrees

00:31:21.508 --> 00:31:25.771
Kelvin, these are,
in fact, the velocities of

00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:30.501
those atoms.
But how do we know this is

00:31:30.501 --> 00:31:33.772
right?
How do we go and measure the

00:31:33.772 --> 00:31:38.197
velocities or the speeds of
molecules or atoms?

00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:44.162
Well, this is the way we do it.
It is called the time-of-flight

00:31:44.162 --> 00:31:47.048
technique.
Are we all on board,

00:31:47.048 --> 00:31:48.491
here?
Questions?

00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:51.569
Okay.
How are we going to do this

00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:56.764
time-of-flight technique?
What we are going to do is we

00:31:56.764 --> 00:32:02.055
are going to have a little
pinhole here that we can open

00:32:02.055 --> 00:32:08.006
and shut really quickly.
We are going to let out a

00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:12.020
little pulse of gas.
To measure the velocity of the

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.434
molecules, we are literally
going to measure the time it

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:21.250
takes the molecules to fly from
where we let them out to some

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.461
detector.
And since we know the distance,

00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:28.715
we are going to be able to
calculate the velocity from

00:32:28.715 --> 00:32:32.852
that.
The idea is at time t equals 0,

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:38.190
we let out a little pulse of
gas, and then we start a clock

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.595
running.
Then we just measure how long

00:32:41.595 --> 00:32:46.932
it takes the molecules to fly
from this origin here to this

00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:49.785
detector.
And since we built the

00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:54.662
apparatus, and we know what L
is, we can calculate the

00:32:54.662 --> 00:32:56.871
velocity.
Time-of-flight,

00:32:56.871 --> 00:33:02.298
that is what is done.
However, when we let this

00:33:02.298 --> 00:33:07.080
little pulse of gas out,
and now we let the molecules

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.597
fly to that detector over here,
what happens as a function of

00:33:12.597 --> 00:33:15.816
time?
What will happen is that pulse

00:33:15.816 --> 00:33:21.057
of gas will spread out because
not all of the molecules or

00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:25.563
atoms in that pulse of gas have
the same velocity.

00:33:25.563 --> 00:33:32.000
Some of those atoms are moving
faster than the other atoms.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.742
And so, what is going to happen
is that the molecules or atoms

00:33:36.742 --> 00:33:41.252
that are moving faster are going
to hit the detector first.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:46.072
The molecules or atoms that are
moving more slowly are going to

00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:48.560
hit the detector at a later
time.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.069
And that is what we also want
to know, this distribution of

00:33:53.069 --> 00:33:55.713
velocities.
But in the measurement,

00:33:55.713 --> 00:34:01.000
what we are going to measure is
a distribution of times.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.745
Out of our detector,
we are going to have a plot

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:08.570
that looks like this.
This is going to be f of t,

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.953
essentially the number of
molecules hitting the detector

00:34:12.953 --> 00:34:15.742
at a certain time t versus the
time.

00:34:15.742 --> 00:34:20.524
When we first let our pulse of
gas out, that is time t equals

00:34:20.524 --> 00:34:22.118
0.
Then, for a while,

00:34:22.118 --> 00:34:26.979
there are no molecules hitting
the detector because it takes a

00:34:26.979 --> 00:34:32.000
while for them to get over here
to this detector.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.700
But then, all of a sudden,
they start reaching the

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.645
detector.
And this is essentially just a

00:34:38.645 --> 00:34:43.403
number of molecules that hit the
detector as a function of time.

00:34:43.403 --> 00:34:47.557
That number of molecules
increases and becomes a maximum

00:34:47.557 --> 00:34:50.804
here at some time,
and then it exponentially

00:34:50.804 --> 00:34:53.901
decays, here.
So, this is what we measure.

00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:58.583
This is a distribution here of
flight times of the molecules in

00:34:58.583 --> 00:35:02.551
this pulse of gas.
Well, that is nice,

00:35:02.551 --> 00:35:05.979
but this is a distribution of
flight times.

00:35:05.979 --> 00:35:10.387
It is not a distribution of
velocities, and we wanted a

00:35:10.387 --> 00:35:14.959
distribution of velocities.
We want to know the velocity,

00:35:14.959 --> 00:35:19.367
here, of these molecules.
You know how to convert time,

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.142
given the path length,
to velocity,

00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:25.979
but it is not so
straightforward because we have

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:31.594
a distribution function.
We have a distribution in time,

00:35:31.594 --> 00:35:36.365
and we want to convert that to
a distribution in velocity.

00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:41.555
We have to change the variable
here in a distribution function.

00:35:41.555 --> 00:35:45.656
How do we do that?
Well, we want this f of t to be

00:35:45.656 --> 00:35:50.259
an f of v.
We recognize here that this

00:35:50.259 --> 00:35:54.361
distribution in time,
the probability of finding a

00:35:54.361 --> 00:35:59.383
molecule between t and t plus
dt, has got to be equivalent to

00:35:59.383 --> 00:36:04.405
the probability of finding a
molecule with a velocity between

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:09.035
v and v plus dv.
But to get from one

00:36:09.035 --> 00:36:13.857
distribution function to
another, for example,

00:36:13.857 --> 00:36:20.071
if we want f of v,
what we have to know is how one

00:36:20.071 --> 00:36:25.000
variable changes with respect to
another.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.893
We have this distribution
function f of t,

00:36:33.893 --> 00:36:37.692
but we need to know how t
changes with v.

00:36:37.692 --> 00:36:40.541
We need dt by dv,
we need that,

00:36:40.541 --> 00:36:44.340
so let's get it.
I will tell you why in a

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.759
moment.
We know how v changes with t.

00:36:47.759 --> 00:36:52.983
We are going to take the
derivative of v with respect to

00:36:52.983 --> 00:36:58.206
t and turn things around.
So, dt / dv is proportional to

00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:04.000
minus t squared over L.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.472
This is telling us,
essentially,

00:37:06.472 --> 00:37:09.104
how the variable t changes with
v.

00:37:09.104 --> 00:37:13.012
To every point in our
time-of-flight distribution,

00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:17.478
we are going to multiply this
by this, what is called the

00:37:17.478 --> 00:37:20.509
Jacobean.
We need this because the time

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:24.337
and the velocity do not
correlate in a one-to-one

00:37:24.337 --> 00:37:27.049
manner.
That often happens with two

00:37:27.049 --> 00:37:33.309
distribution functions.
If you do not understand what I

00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:38.327
just said, it is okay.
This was just some extra.

00:37:38.327 --> 00:37:42.170
I do not hold you responsible
for it.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:48.042
I just changed my variable in
the distribution function.

00:37:48.042 --> 00:37:50.711
Yes?
I think in the notes,

00:37:50.711 --> 00:37:54.661
I might have had as a
proportionality.

00:37:54.661 --> 00:38:00.000
Up here I actually have the
equal sign.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.454
That actually won't matter in
this transformation.

00:38:04.454 --> 00:38:06.727
Pardon?
I understand that.

00:38:06.727 --> 00:38:10.363
That is fine.
I don't have the equal sign

00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:13.181
there.
That is why I left it out

00:38:13.181 --> 00:38:17.090
there, I think.
Anyway, this is the velocity

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.818
distribution.
You don't have to understand

00:38:20.818 --> 00:38:24.545
how I got there.
This is what the velocity

00:38:24.545 --> 00:38:29.753
distribution looks like.
It is what is called the

00:38:29.753 --> 00:38:32.602
Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity
distribution.

00:38:32.602 --> 00:38:36.840
And the bottom line is that
Maxwell and Boltzmann predicted

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.127
this, about 1855.
They actually predicted this

00:38:40.127 --> 00:38:43.342
distribution function.
We did not predict it.

00:38:43.342 --> 00:38:46.922
We did not go through that part
of kinetic theory,

00:38:46.922 --> 00:38:50.794
but they predicted it.
However, it was only until 1955

00:38:50.794 --> 00:38:54.447
that the technology existed,
fast enough timing and

00:38:54.447 --> 00:38:57.662
electronics existed,
to actually measure this

00:38:57.662 --> 00:39:02.605
experimentally.
This took a hundred years or so

00:39:02.605 --> 00:39:07.058
in order for this distribution
function to actually be

00:39:07.058 --> 00:39:10.504
measured, but here it is,
f of v.

00:39:10.504 --> 00:39:13.865
First of all,
there is all of this stuff,

00:39:13.865 --> 00:39:16.722
which is proportionality
constants.

00:39:16.722 --> 00:39:19.663
We will talk about that in a
moment.

00:39:19.663 --> 00:39:23.277
But the variable,
here, is v squared

00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:28.235
times an exponentially decaying
function with a v squared in

00:39:28.235 --> 00:39:31.463
there.
What does that mean?

00:39:31.463 --> 00:39:35.634
Well, if you look at the form
of f of v, this v squared is

00:39:35.634 --> 00:39:38.707
what gives rise to this increase
in f of v.

00:39:38.707 --> 00:39:42.365
Right here, at low velocities,
that is a quadratic,

00:39:42.365 --> 00:39:45.219
v squared.
But you are multiplying it by

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:49.317
an exponentially decaying
function with this v squared in

00:39:49.317 --> 00:39:52.390
the argument.
And so that is what gives you

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.878
this tail.
If you are multiplying a

00:39:54.878 --> 00:39:58.097
function that is going up and
one decreasing,

00:39:58.097 --> 00:40:03.000
you are going to get a maximum
at some value of v.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.302
That is where the shape of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:40:09.302 --> 00:40:14.659
function comes from.
And what this is telling you is

00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:21.277
the probability here of finding
a molecule in a gas with a speed

00:40:21.277 --> 00:40:26.739
between v and v plus dv.
That is what that is telling

00:40:26.739 --> 00:40:30.312
you.
We often characterize these

00:40:30.312 --> 00:40:35.279
distribution functions by some
quantities, and one of those

00:40:35.279 --> 00:40:39.561
quantities is what we call the
most probable speed.

00:40:39.561 --> 00:40:44.100
Here is the distribution
function, and I have the most

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.125
probable speed labeled.
The most probable speed,

00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:53.435
(v)mp, is simply the value of v
at which the probability is the

00:40:53.435 --> 00:40:56.775
largest.
That was like our most probable

00:40:56.775 --> 00:41:02.000
value of r in the radial
distribution functions.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.913
That is what the most probable
speed is.

00:41:04.913 --> 00:41:07.901
If you wanted to get that
mathematically,

00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:11.785
what you would do is take this
distribution function,

00:41:11.785 --> 00:41:14.848
take the derivative,
set it equal to zero,

00:41:14.848 --> 00:41:18.359
and then solve for v.
That makes that derivative

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:21.272
equal to zero.
The derivative is zero at

00:41:21.272 --> 00:41:24.708
maxima or minima.
And then, you would find that

00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:29.265
the value of the most probable
speed is the square root of 2RT

00:41:29.265 --> 00:41:33.000
over M.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.920
You are not responsible for
taking this derivative and

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.063
setting it equal to zero.
You are responsible for knowing

00:41:41.063 --> 00:41:44.169
physically what the most
probable speed is.

00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:48.608
The fact that it is this value
here, where the probability is

00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:51.641
the largest.
It is the most probable value

00:41:51.641 --> 00:41:54.008
of v.
And you are responsible for

00:41:54.008 --> 00:41:57.484
recognizing this.
I don't ask you to memorize it

00:41:57.484 --> 00:42:01.844
or to write it down.
But, if you see it,

00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:07.184
you should know what it is.
That is one quantity that we

00:42:07.184 --> 00:42:11.650
use to characterize this
distribution function.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:16.407
Another quantity that we use is
the average speed,

00:42:16.407 --> 00:42:21.165
v bar, average speed.
And the first thing that you

00:42:21.165 --> 00:42:26.990
see is that the average speed is
a little bit higher than the

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.972
most probable speed.
It is a little bit larger.

00:42:31.972 --> 00:42:35.235
Why is that?
Well, it is a little bit larger

00:42:35.235 --> 00:42:38.725
because on these
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

00:42:38.725 --> 00:42:43.429
functions, there are molecules
way out here that have very high

00:42:43.429 --> 00:42:45.630
speeds.
There are not a lot of

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.182
molecules that have very high
speeds, but there are molecules

00:42:50.182 --> 00:42:54.052
with very high speeds.
And so, when you average over

00:42:54.052 --> 00:42:58.225
this distribution function,
because there is such a long

00:42:58.225 --> 00:43:01.336
Boltzmann tail here,
is what it is called,

00:43:01.336 --> 00:43:05.813
the average velocity is going
to be a little higher than the

00:43:05.813 --> 00:43:10.832
most probable velocity.
That is physically why the

00:43:10.832 --> 00:43:15.130
average velocity is a little bit
larger than the most probable

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.033
velocity.
That is important.

00:43:17.033 --> 00:43:20.768
If I wanted to calculate what
the average velocity is,

00:43:20.768 --> 00:43:24.714
I would take the distribution
function, multiply it by v,

00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:28.590
and then integrate over the
range of v, which is zero to

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.004
infinity.
You don't have to do that,

00:43:32.004 --> 00:43:36.398
but the quantity that you would
get, if you had done that,

00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:41.101
is the square root of 8RT over
pi M.

00:43:41.101 --> 00:43:43.568
It is larger than the most

00:43:43.568 --> 00:43:46.112
probable value.
And then, finally,

00:43:46.112 --> 00:43:50.737
the other way we characterize
the distribution function is by

00:43:50.737 --> 00:43:55.517
this root mean square speed that
we have already talked about a

00:43:55.517 --> 00:43:57.984
lot.
That root mean square speed,

00:43:57.984 --> 00:44:02.610
here, is even a larger value
than the average velocity or the

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:07.114
average speed.
And the reason for that is,

00:44:07.114 --> 00:44:10.639
again, because of this
Maxwell-Boltzmann tail.

00:44:10.639 --> 00:44:14.477
We have molecules here that
have very high speeds.

00:44:14.477 --> 00:44:18.315
We don't have a lot of
molecules with high speeds,

00:44:18.315 --> 00:44:22.937
but we have very high speeds.
When we take that speed and we

00:44:22.937 --> 00:44:27.010
square it, and then take the
average, they make a big

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.221
contribution,
and they push this root mean

00:44:30.221 --> 00:44:35.000
square speed even higher than
the average speed.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.976
Again, if you wanted to
calculate what that is,

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:43.818
you would take v squared,
multiply it by the distribution

00:44:43.818 --> 00:44:49.092
function, integrate it over all
values of E, and you would get

00:44:49.092 --> 00:44:53.242
what we got before,
the square root of 3RT over M.

00:44:53.242 --> 00:44:57.046
Bottom line here,

00:44:57.046 --> 00:45:01.801
for argon at 300 degrees
Kelvin, the most probable speed

00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:07.234
is 353 meters per second.
For argon at 300 degrees

00:45:07.234 --> 00:45:11.890
Kelvin, the average speed is 399
meters per second.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:17.012
And the root mean square speed
is 433 meters per second.

00:45:17.012 --> 00:45:22.506
Here, you can see how these
three quantities increase as you

00:45:22.506 --> 00:45:28.000
go from most probable to the
root mean square speed.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.065
And, in fact,
no surprise,

00:45:31.065 --> 00:45:38.298
if you actually go and measure
the argon speeds distribution

00:45:38.298 --> 00:45:44.183
function and then evaluate these
characteristics,

00:45:44.183 --> 00:45:51.295
you find that indeed those
measurements agree with what Mr.

00:45:51.295 --> 00:45:56.567
Maxwell and Mr.
Boltzmann predicted in 1850,

00:45:56.567 --> 00:46:00.000
1855.
No surprise.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.594
Back to this distribution
function.

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:06.868
We saw how to characterize it,
but I want to talk about a

00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:10.226
couple of other parameters that
it has in it.

00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:13.431
It has in it the mass,
and it has it in the

00:46:13.431 --> 00:46:16.331
temperature.
Let's talk about what this

00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:20.605
distribution function looks like
for different masses and

00:46:20.605 --> 00:46:24.268
different temperatures.
That is the general form,

00:46:24.268 --> 00:46:29.000
but different masses and
different temperatures.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.336
Let's start by keeping the
temperature constant,

00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:35.744
300 degrees Kelvin.
And now, we are going to look

00:46:35.744 --> 00:46:39.720
at the distribution functions
for three different masses,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.198
and I am going to plot that.
Here it is for xenon.

00:46:43.198 --> 00:46:46.819
What you can see is xenon,
very narrow distribution.

00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:49.233
Here it is for argon,
lighter mass,

00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:52.286
broader distribution.
Here it is for helium,

00:46:52.286 --> 00:46:55.480
really broad distribution.
Well, first of all,

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.669
you can see that the average
speed of helium is much greater

00:46:59.669 --> 00:47:04.000
than it is for argon,
than it is for xenon.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.739
Because we already saw that it
was inversely proportional to

00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:15.381
the square root of the mass.
But the other thing to note is

00:47:15.381 --> 00:47:21.023
how broad the distribution is
for helium compared to xenon.

00:47:21.023 --> 00:47:26.859
And that is the general case.
The lighter masses have broader

00:47:26.859 --> 00:47:30.707
distributions.
Helium is so broad,

00:47:30.707 --> 00:47:36.188
meaning that there are helium
atoms here that are so fast that

00:47:36.188 --> 00:47:41.489
this is the reason why there is
relatively little helium and

00:47:41.489 --> 00:47:45.353
hydrogen in our atmosphere.
That is because,

00:47:45.353 --> 00:47:49.936
at our temperatures,
there are enough molecules with

00:47:49.936 --> 00:47:55.597
high enough velocities to escape
the earth's gravitational pull,

00:47:55.597 --> 00:48:00.000
because they are here at the
tail end.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.316
And so, the helium and the
hydrogen leave our atmosphere.

00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:09.683
Unlike Jupiter,
which is 300 times more massive

00:48:09.683 --> 00:48:14.050
than the earth,
where the gravitational pull is

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.518
greater.
And, in that case,

00:48:16.518 --> 00:48:22.120
then those helium atoms don't
have enough velocity to escape

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.677
the earth's gravitational pull.
So, that is mass.

00:48:26.677 --> 00:48:32.004
What about temperature?
Now we are going to keep the

00:48:32.004 --> 00:48:35.798
mass constant and we are going
to look at temperature.

00:48:35.798 --> 00:48:39.735
Here is the distribution
function at 100 degrees Kelvin,

00:48:39.735 --> 00:48:42.455
pretty narrow.
Here is the distribution

00:48:42.455 --> 00:48:45.318
function for argon at 300
degrees Kelvin,

00:48:45.318 --> 00:48:47.609
broader.
Here is the distribution

00:48:47.609 --> 00:48:50.902
function at 1000 degrees kelvin,
broader again.

00:48:50.902 --> 00:48:55.268
You see that as we increase the
temperature, the average speed

00:48:55.268 --> 00:48:58.203
increases.
As we increase the temperature,

00:48:58.203 --> 00:49:03.000
the width of that distribution
function increases.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.607
Now, one thing to note here is
this is a probability.

00:49:07.607 --> 00:49:12.392
The areas under these curves
have to all add up to one.

00:49:12.392 --> 00:49:17.265
If this distribution function
is going to move to higher

00:49:17.265 --> 00:49:21.430
velocities as we increase the
temperature, well,

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.126
of course this maximum
probability is going to have to

00:49:26.126 --> 00:49:31.000
go down because we cannot lose
any molecules.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.617
All the area under this curve,
at 100 degrees Kelvin,

00:49:35.617 --> 00:49:40.412
has to equal the area under
this curve, at 1000 degrees

00:49:40.412 --> 00:49:45.474
Kelvin, because this is a
probability that we are plotting

00:49:45.474 --> 00:49:48.582
here.
That is our description of the

00:49:48.582 --> 00:49:51.848
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
See you on Friday.
