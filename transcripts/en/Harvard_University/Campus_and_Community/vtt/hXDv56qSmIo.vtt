00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:16.289
This trip has been fantastic so far. A little disappointed it’s raining, but the group

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.009
has been in high spirits nonetheless. 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.980
I’m mostly impressed with this group because so few of them have been backpacking before. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.529
I think they are already outside 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.389
their comfort zone with people they don’t know very well. 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:32.049
And they are also doing something they don't know how
to do.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:39.049
I think it's a very risky and impressive first move.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.250
I love the outdoors and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.280
I’ve always wanted to…

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.570
I grew up in China and never had the opportunity to go

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.450
hiking and camping

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.940
and I thought that

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.860
I really wanted to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.860
be in the outdoors and go on a hiking trip like this. I was really excited about it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.680
I think it's the ultimate equalizer in that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.440
everyone's out here with the same gear holding the same weight,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.119
without a shower, without deodorant, 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.040
no one looks their best, but we are all having fun. We’re in close quarters bonding and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.040
there's very little judgment out here.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940
As a senior, 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.510
I've really enjoyed talking

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.400
to the incoming freshman

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.670
and sharing my experiences

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.950
and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.350
my thoughts on life at Harvard.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.280
I think this is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.939
a great group of freshmen

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.059
that are very understanding and mature, 

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.939
that are

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:15.939
better than me when I was a freshman.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.619
I came in as a freshman

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.919
very anxious about making friends

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:26.700
and going to what felt like a huge school, across the country from home

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.409
and my FOP trip was where I met people that I really connected with

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.079
and from there I believed that I could make friends
in college. It was my first support system and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.579
it carried through

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.979
into the new friends I made at schoo.
