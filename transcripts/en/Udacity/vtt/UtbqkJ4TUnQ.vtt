00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.870
One of the easiest things you can do,
to contain the table in the view port.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.570
Is to wrap it in a div.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.240
And set the width to 100%.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
And overflow x to auto.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.950
Then, instead of breaking
out of the view port.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.800
The table will instead,
take up the same width.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.410
But will scroll within the view port.
