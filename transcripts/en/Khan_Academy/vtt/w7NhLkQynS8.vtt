00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:02.168
- What I want to do in this video is

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.781
really make sure that we feel comfortable

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:09.125
manipulating algebraic expressions
that involve fractions.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:11.610
So we'll start with some
fairly straightforward ones.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.024
So let's say that I had, let's say I had

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:19.024
A over B plus C over D,

00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:21.849
and if I actually wanted to

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.589
add these things, so it
is just one fraction,

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.434
how would I do that?

00:00:26.434 --> 00:00:28.129
Well, what we could do is,

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:30.010
we could find a common denominator.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.309
Well, over here, we don't know what B is,

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.911
we don't know what D is,

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:35.164
but we know a common denominator

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.208
is just going to be B times D.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:41.039
That is going to be a
common multiple of B and D.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.265
So we could rewrite this as two fractions,

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:47.564
with the common denominator BD,

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:52.395
so, plus, BD, actually, let
me color code it a little bit.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.430
So A over B is going to be the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.472
same thing as what over BD?

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:02.210
Well, to get BD, I multiplied
the denominator by D,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.439
so let me multiply the
numerator by D as well,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.296
then I haven't changed
the value of the fraction,

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:09.060
I'm just multiplying by D over D.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.285
So this is going to be A
times D over B times D.

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:14.470
Notice I could divide the numerator

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.257
and the denominator by D, and

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:18.974
I'm going to get back to A over B.

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.946
And then we can look at the
second fraction, C over D,

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:26.946
to go from D to BD, we multiplied by B

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.352
and so, if I multiply
the denominator by B,

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:32.070
if I don't want to change
the value of the fraction,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.949
I have to multiply the
numerator by B as well.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.479
So let's multiply the
numerator by B as well,

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.105
and it's going to be BC, BC.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:45.899
BC over BD.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.333
This is C over D.

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.432
So what I have here in magenta,

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:52.255
this fraction is equivalent
to this fraction.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:54.493
I just multiplied it by D over D,

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:55.792
which we can assume is one,

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:57.944
if we assume that D is not equal to zero,

00:01:57.944 --> 00:02:01.427
and then, if we just
multiply C over D times one,

00:02:01.427 --> 00:02:03.140
which is the same thing as B over B,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.184
if we assume that B is not equal to zero,

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:07.856
then this fraction and this
fraction are equivalent.

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.153
Now, why did I go through
all of this trouble?

00:02:10.153 --> 00:02:12.614
Well, now, I have a common denominator,

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:15.168
so I can add these two fractions.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.770
So what's this going to be?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.115
Well, common denominator is BD,

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.550
so let me just, so the
common denominator is BD,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.041
and I could just add the numerators,

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:26.099
just like you would've
done if these were numbers,

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.867
if this wasn't an algebraic expression.

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:32.693
So this is going to
be, this is going to be

00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:36.693
AD plus BC, all of that over BD.
