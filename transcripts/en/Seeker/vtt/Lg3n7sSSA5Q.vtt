00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.980
Cancer is a serious disease, but can I catch
it by playing basketball with my friend who

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.980
has it?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.180
Of COURSE I can't.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.560
I never play basketball.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.230
Sup guys, Trace here at the YouTube Space
in Los Angeles.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.179
Just changing things up a bit, trying some
new things at DNews.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.150
I was being glib earlier, but it's not entirely
a joke.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.939
In the 90s, a lack of education about the
HIV and AIDS epidemic in the U.S. saw people

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.979
believing they could contract the disease
by sharing a basketball with Magic Johnson.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.760
Now, some media outlets are repping the news
that cancer might be contagious, but stop

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.140
worrying; in humans, cancer is definitely
not contagious.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.620
In the 1970s, the humble clam created quite
a wash of press when it was discovered they

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.300
were developing leukemia at a fantastic rate.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.020
Researchers from Columbia University suggested
it wasn't a virus causing cancer, but that

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.930
the CANCER ITSELF was contagious -- and they
were right!

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.390
Contagious cancer is extremely rare.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.480
With a few exceptions, the cancer cells themselves
are host specific, meaning if an organism

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.150
dies from cancer, the cancer dies too.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.469
Scientists found this new contagious cancer
when they scooped up these maladapted molluscs

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.189
and tested their tumors; finding they were
all the same genotype!

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.689
The cells are clones!

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399
They believe a sad little clam developed a
type of cancer which, somehow, continues cell

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.539
division outside of the clam's body.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.119
The tumor cells divide and are swept away
in the ocean currents, occasionally encountering

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.689
other clams, latching on and dividing more
-- causing cancerous tumors in previously

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:27.840
unaffected clams.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840
This is a clam nightmare scenario.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.530
This is only the third time scientists have
found contagious cancers; but don't worry,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.700
none are primate-born.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.000
11,000 years ago, genetic maladaptation in
a dog evolved and was spread to other dogs

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.850
-- just like the clams, it somehow was able
to jump from dog to dog and still afflicts

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.079
them to this day.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.869
Yes, dogs can catch cancer from each other.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.009
Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumor (CTVT)
was documented 200 years ago, and has been

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.469
seen on dogs on every continent.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.039
The cancer develops a cauliflower-shaped bleeding
tumor on the dog's genitals.

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.609
When the dogs mate, or just hump, the tumor
spreads like an STI and infects the new host,

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.659
eventually causing another tumor.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.740
Over the last 11,000 years, CTVT has evolved
and lives as a parasite in the dogs body,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.330
eventually disappearing -- that's not the
case for the second type of infectious cancer.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.470
Tasmanian devils, which are real, not just
a cartoon -- they don't even spin!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.470
You lied to me Looney Tunes!

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470
Tasmanian Devils can catch cancer from their
fellows, poor devils, when they bite each

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.610
other in competition over food.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.640
Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is an infectious
cancer which has somehow evolved a cloaking

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.220
device as described by National Geographic.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.100
The cancer cells lack a group of proteins
which identify foreign cells to the immune

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.780
system called MHC -- without them the immune
system doesn't attack, the cancer takes hold,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.310
facial tumors develop and are so intense the
animals can't eat -- causing death.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.940
Cancer is a extraordinarily broad term for
abnormal cell growth caused by unfortunate

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.680
genetic mutations in cells.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.590
You can increase the likelihood of errors
by exposure to radiation, smoking, stress,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.150
obesity, viruses, smoking, or other carcinogens;
but as of yet there are NO KNOWN CONTAGIOUS

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.120
TUMORS in primates or humans; though bacteria
like Helicobacter pylori can increase the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.440
chances of developing stomach cancer; and
a few of the strains of HPV famously increase

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.420
chances of cervical cancer.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.060
// GET VACCINATED // But, they're not contagious
cancers; they just make conditions more favorable

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.280
to develop cancer.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.430
What do you want to know more about?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.440
Have a science question?

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.980
An Idea for a future show?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.460
Let me know in the comments.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.280
And while you're thinking about tumors -- why
not learn EXACTLY what they are?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.660
Some are benign, some aren't and you might
have one in you RIGHT NOW -- Julia lays it

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.150
all out in this video.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:52.460
Thanks for watching DNews!
