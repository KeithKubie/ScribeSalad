00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.230
Okay, I'm going to try my, my little

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.090
friend on the right here. And, okay, validation rules.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.630
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.390
&gt;&gt; Excellent, new. Okay, rule name, I want

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.370
to call this, Valid Ticket Number Checker. How's that?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.370
&gt;&gt; It's a little weird, but.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.450
&gt;&gt; Valid ticket number?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.054
&gt;&gt; Let's run with it. There you go.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.233
[LAUGH]

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:25.940
&gt;&gt; in description make sure that you've got less than eight tickets.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, while we're checking, you know, bad data, why don't

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.150
we just make sure there's also more than zero tickets. So at least one ticket.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense. And, you've bought at least one ticket.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.970
&gt;&gt; So the weird thing about validation

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.980
rules is they're a little backwards. The

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.540
rule that you create needs to check if the formula is true, which means

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.840
whatever equation you're building needs to evaluate to

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.770
true in order to throw an error message.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.690
&gt;&gt; So basically, I want to say, instead

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.330
of saying, making sure, make sure it's between

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.800
one and eight. I want to make sure it's not less than one or greater than eight.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.580
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.570
&gt;&gt; That makes, I mean sort of makes sense, but I'll roll

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.380
with it. Okay, so I guess I'm going to use this little hierarchy thing.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; It

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.160
allows you to choose fields on the attendee object, or even of of related

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.360
objects. But yeah, just click the fields

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.920
that you're trying to add into this formula.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.260
&gt;&gt; Tickets purchased, I think.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.640
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to make sure, I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.560
want to check if tickets purchased is greater than eight.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.140
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.190
&gt;&gt; I can just do that, right?

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.670
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.840
&gt;&gt; I want to do or, how do I do or?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.290
&gt;&gt; Check that insert operator.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.956
&gt;&gt; Oh, sweet. Okay.

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:46.170
Or tickets purchased, less than one.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to check to make sure I didn't screw anything up too bad.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.080
&gt;&gt; And this looks pretty similar to the formula we just made doesn't it?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. It's cool that you can do all this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.490
with just the mouse. Okay, no errors found. Okay, error message. Dude.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.140
You have to buy between 1 and 8 tickets. Okay,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.300
Save. Okay. I'm going to, obviously, try and break this rule now.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.690
&gt;&gt; So, let's create a new one. New attendee. Maybe, Sally Scalper?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.270
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice. Sally Scalper, you're not getting in through my validation rule.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.270
&gt;&gt;

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.838
[LAUGH]

00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:34.290
&gt;&gt; Email, thief@evil.whatever. purchase source, box office. If

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.875
she'll try to buy general admission tickets, she'll try to buy ten of them, for

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:44.280
Cloudstock. And let's to see what happens to Sally Scalper.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.230
Ha, she was foiled, she was thwarted in her evil attempts to scalp tickets.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.230
&gt;&gt;

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.972
[LAUGH]

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:52.710
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's pretty cool.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.710
&gt;&gt;

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.470
[LAUGH].

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.910
&gt;&gt; Alright, Sam this is pretty cool, we did all of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.250
this object building and field adding, and things are updating automatically.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.020
&gt;&gt; Formulas, validation, like does your head feel like it's about to explode?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.830
&gt;&gt; No, no. It's actually, it's alright.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.460
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.200
&gt;&gt; Which, I mean, so we've only done it for attendees and festivals. I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.880
guess next step is to do it with bands and stages and all that.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah! Let's do it!
