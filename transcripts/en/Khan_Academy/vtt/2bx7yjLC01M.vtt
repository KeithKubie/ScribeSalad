00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.081
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians
today we're going to

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.990
be talking about the irregular plural.

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:08.631
Previously I had said that
if you take any English word,

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:11.041
any noun, say the word dog.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.841
And you tack an s onto
the end of it like so.

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:17.470
Boop you get the word dogs
and that's how you form

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.773
the plural in all cases.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.664
I was lying sorry, it turns
out that English is a little

00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:26.391
bit more complicated than that.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.790
While adding an s to things
is the way you usually

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.911
make things plural, sometimes,
there are other changes

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:34.911
and sometimes you don't even pluralize

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.271
using an s at the end.

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.343
But what we're not going
to talk about that now

00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:38.881
that's for another time.

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.030
What I wanna talk about
today, is the most basic kind

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
of irregular plural, so we
have the difference in English

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.150
between regular and irregular plurals.

00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:00.311
And remember a plural is when there's more

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:03.391
then one of something, it
comes from the latin plus.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.011
Which means more.

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.630
As opposed to the singular
when there is just one

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.870
of something.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.080
One dog, two dogs.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.310
So there is a handful of words

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.710
in English and it really
is a handful, that don't

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.010
pluralize regularly.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.111
Words like leaf and loaf and calf.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.431
It's a baby cow.

00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.702
If you try to pluralize these
as though they were regular

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:41.921
plurals you're gonna return
something that is not correct.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:45.704
Or at least is not conventional
within modern standard

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:49.241
American English right so leafs
for example, unless you're

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.940
talking about the Toronto
hockey team, is not correct.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.750
In fact, the proper term boop.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.031
Is in fact leaves.

00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.941
It is not loafs but loaves.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.551
Tasty loaves of bread.

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.671
It is not calfs but calves.

00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.350
So there are several different
kinds of irregular plurals

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.471
that's why this video is called part one.

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.270
But I'm only going to cover
one such irregular plural today

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.640
and that is the change from
singular f to plural v.

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:27.343
So if you see a word,
generally that ends in f.

00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:30.351
The plural is going to become v.

00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:33.011
You can learn anything David out.
