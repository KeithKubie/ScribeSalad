00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.100
We have the curve y is
equal to e to the x over 2

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.160
plus x to the third power.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.660
And what we want to do
is find the equation

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.910
of the tangent line to this
curve at the point x equals 1.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.840
And when x is equal to 1, y is
going to be equal to e over 3.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.230
It's going to be e over 3.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.630
So let's try to figure out the
equation of the tangent line

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.106
to this curve at this point.

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:28.730
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
and try this on your own first.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.230
Well, the slope of the
tangent line at this point

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.160
is the same thing as the
derivative at this point.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.620
So let's try to find
the derivative of this

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.410
or evaluate the derivative of
this function right over here

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.180
at this point.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.440
So to do that, first
I'm going to rewrite it.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.537
You could use the
quotient rule if you like,

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:53.120
but I always forget
the quotient rule.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.570
The product rule is much
easier for me to remember.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.400
So I can rewrite this as y
is equal to-- and I might

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.080
as well color code it-- is equal
to e to the x times 2 plus x

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.420
to the third to the
negative 1 power.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.000
And so the derivative of
this, so let me write it here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.240
So y prime is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.310
of this part of it, e to the x.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.272
So the derivative of e to
the x is just e to the x.

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:25.230
Just let me write that.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.570
So we're going to take
the derivative of it.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.591
And that's what's
amazing about e to the x,

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.090
is that the derivative
of e to the x

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.920
is just e to the x
times this thing.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.170
So times 2 plus x to the
third to the negative 1.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.120
And then to that we're
going to add this thing.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.890
So not its derivative anymore.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.450
We're just going
to add e to the x

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.500
times the derivative of
this thing right over here.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.010
So we're going to
take the derivative.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.330
So we can do the chain rule.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.050
It's going to be
the derivative of 2

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.800
plus x to the third
to the negative 1

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.410
power with respect to 2
plus x to the third times

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.320
the derivative of 2 plus x to
the third with respect to x.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.455
So this is going to be
equal to negative-- I'll

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:22.920
write it this way-- negative
2 plus x to the third

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.700
to the negative 2 power.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.730
And then we're going to multiply
that times the derivative of 2

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.160
plus x to the third
with respect to x.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.000
Well, derivative of
this with respect to x

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.955
is just 3x squared.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.320
And of course, we could simplify
this a little bit if we like.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.510
But the whole point of
this is to actually find

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.560
the value of the
derivative at this point.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.400
So let's evaluate.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.300
Let's evaluate y prime
when x is equal to 1.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.080
Y prime of 1 when
x is equal to 1.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.900
This thing will
simplify to-- let's see,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.960
this is going to be e times 2
plus 1 to the negative power.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.320
So that's just going
to be 1/3, right?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.000
2 plus 1 to the negative 1.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.545
So that's 3 to the negative 1.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:17.410
That's 1/3.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.820
So that's times 1/3 plus
e to the first power.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.360
Now let's see,
what does this do?

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.560
This part right
over here, this is

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.020
2 plus 1 to the
negative 2 power.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.040
So this-- actually,
let me-- I don't

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.694
want to-- so this part right
over here is going to be,

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.110
let's see, this
is going to be-- I

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.943
don't want to make a
careless mistake here--

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:44.500
is 3 to the negative 2 power.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.970
So 3 squared is 9.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.670
3 to the negative
second power is 1/9.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.815
And so it's going to be 1/9.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.940
Well, you're going to
multiply this negative there.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.150
So it's negative 1/9.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.930
And then we're going to
multiply that times 3 times 1.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.390
So it's negative 1/9 times 3.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.190
Times 3 right over here.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.350
So it's negative
3/9 or negative 1/3.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.529
So times negative 1/3.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.190
And all I did here
is I substituted 1

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.320
for x and evaluated it.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.590
Now this is interesting.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.030
I have essentially--
let me rewrite this.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:37.250
This is equal to e over 3 minus
e over 3, which is equal to 0.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.280
So the slope of the derivative
when x is equal to 1 is 0,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.420
or the slope of the
tangent line is equal to 0.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.310
This simplified to a pretty
straightforward situation.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.480
If I wanted to write a line
in slope intercept form,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.170
I could write it like this. y
is equal to mx plus b, where

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.250
m is the slope and b
is the y-intercept.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.830
Now we know that the slope of
the tangent line at this point,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.640
it has a slope, is 0.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.180
So this is going to be 0.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.394
So this whole term
is going to be 0.

00:05:14.394 --> 00:05:16.560
So it's just going to have
the form y is equal to b.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.330
This is just going to
be a horizontal line.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.970
So what is a
horizontal line that

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.780
contains this point
right over here?

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.292
Well, it contains the value
y is equal to e over 3.

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:29.500
So this is a horizontal line.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.400
It has the same y
value the entire time.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.460
So if it has the
y value e over 3,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.260
then we know the equation
of the tangent line

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.880
to this curve at
this point is going

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.480
to be y is equal to e over 3.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.730
Another way you could think
about this right over here

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.025
is, well, let's substitute
when x is equal to 1.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:52.400
Well, there's not
even an x here.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.850
But when x is any value,
y is equal to e over 3,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.740
you get b is equal
to e over 3, or you'd

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.950
get y is equal to e over 3.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.340
So it's just a horizontal line.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.923
So let's actually
visualize this, just

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:07.250
to make sure that this
actually makes sense.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.130
So let me get my
graphing calculator out.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.970
And so I'm in graphing mode.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.770
If you wanted to know
how to get there,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.682
you literally can just
go to graph, y equals,

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:27.680
and I will do-- so e
to the x power divided

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.175
by 2 plus x to the third power.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.280
That looks right.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.620
And I actually set the range
ahead of time to save time.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.500
So let me graph this.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.080
So let's see.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.840
Ooh, it does all sorts
of interesting things.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.380
All right.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.750
Oh, look at that.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.860
All right, so now we can trace
to get to when x is equal to 1.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.980
x equals 1.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.710
Right over there, you see
y is equal to e over 3,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.500
which this is kind of
its decimal expansion

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.450
right over here.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.840
And it does look like
the slope right over here

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.430
is 0, that the
tangent line is just

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.780
going to be a horizontal
line at that point.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.593
So that makes me feel pretty
good about our answer.
