00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.810
Why Figure Skaters Don't Seem Dizzy After
Spinning

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.279
Dizziness is controlled by the vestibular
system in your upper inner ear.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.780
Within the vestibular system, there are three
canals that contain fluid called endolymph,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.770
as well as sensory nerve cells that look sort
of like little hairs.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.390
When you move your head, the endolymph resists
change in motion and lags behind, stimulating

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.750
the nerve cells.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.210
Those cells send messages to the brain, telling
it which way the head moved.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.369
Now, when you spin, the endolymph lags behind
at first, but then moves at the same rate

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.509
that you’re spinning around.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.030
When you stop, the endolymph resists change
in motion again, and keeps going for a while.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.850
This sends a message to your brain that your
head is still spinning even if it isn’t,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.579
resulting in the dizzy feeling.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.360
The endolymph slows down eventually, making
you feel normal again.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.010
Dancers and figure skaters have captivated
audiences by spinning around and around on

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
a fixed point.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.629
Afterwards, they’ll often leap straight
into another move.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.039
Part of the reason this is so interesting
to the people watching is that many people

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.359
can’t understand how they could possibly
remain standing without so much as a wobble

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.999
after spinning around so much, let alone leaping
into another move.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.899
Don’t they get dizzy?

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.229
Dancers tend to get around this problem by
keeping their eyes locked on a fixed point

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.159
and whipping their heads around when their
neck can’t turn any more.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.159
The result?

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.350
While the rest of their bodies are spinning,
their eyes trick the brain into feeling like

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.490
they’re standing still.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.750
In this case, the endolymph doesn’t have
a chance to move around and alert the nerve

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810
cells to tell the brain that the head is spinning.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.970
So, the same principle should apply to figure
skaters too, right?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.219
With the help of the ice, figure skaters are
able to spin at much greater speeds than dancers

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.840
can, which means this method isn’t really
safe to practice in these high speed rotations.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.610
They will stare at a fixed point at the end
of each spin move, but they typically don’t

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.479
whip their heads around continually during
it, as this could cause injury to their necks

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.700
at the rotational speeds they achieve.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.729
Because of this, they aren’t easily able
to trick their brain as well into thinking

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.270
the head isn’t moving at all.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.219
So how do they do it after these high speed
spins?

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.110
The answer is the somewhat anti-climactic,
but perhaps more impressive, “they just

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.369
get used to it.”

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.290
Figure skaters do typically get a little dizzy,
but a lot of training means they are usually

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.229
able to ignore the sensation and carry on
as normal, without the audience ever noticing.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.319
The beginner figure skater will start off
doing just one or two rotations per spin and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.739
slowly work up to more.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.980
They also start out with “easier” spins
before trying out the more dizzying variations.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.900
With years of practice, they are able to work
past the sensation of dizziness so that it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.220
doesn’t upset their routine.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.840
While you might have trouble walking in a
straight line after a few spins, they have

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.650
trained themselves to essentially “fake
it.”

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.720
As Olympic Gold figure skater Evan Lysacek
explains,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.900
Oh, you definitely get dizzy, but your body
learns to build a tolerance for it.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.690
It’s like when you go upside down on a really
fast roller coaster, you’re going too quickly

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.370
to realize you’re upside down.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.659
So I guess, when you’re going so fast that
everything’s a blur, you don’t get as

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.659
dizzy as if you are spinning more slowly and
see specific objects going by, if that makes

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.879
any sense.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.260
There are tricks other than “spotting”
that coaches will teach their pupils as well.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.730
Breathing exercises between rotations in the
early stages of training help the figure skaters

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.650
regain control after spinning.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.550
In addition, at the end of a long spin, some
figure skaters will incorporate a dance move

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.970
into their routine before a jump, which requires
more balance.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.610
The dance move not only masks their temporary
dizziness, but also provides a short reprieve,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.370
allowing their endolymph to settle back down.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.160
Bonus Facts:
• Astronauts often get dizzy because of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940
being in a continual free-fall state while
in orbit.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.980
NASA studied 1956 Olympic silver medal winner
Ronnie Robertson in an attempt to figure out

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.170
how they could help astronauts deal with this,
but they found that Robertson never got dizzy,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.420
even when spinning 500 revolutions per minute.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.940
That certainly gave him a leg-up on his competitors!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.120
If you guessed he was known for his spinning,
you’d be right.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.620
• Olympic skaters can typically spin so
fast it looks like they’re a blur.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.620
How do they do it?

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.890
By starting with their arms and leg (and sometimes
head) out, and then tucking their appendages

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.430
in while aligning their head with their body.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.250
This works thanks to the law of conservation
of angular momentum, with the skaters picking

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.630
up speed by reducing their rotational inertia
as they bring the mass in closer to their

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.720
body.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.299
This could be a separate episode on its own,
which we may do at some point, but for those

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.720
curious for more detail on the physics of
this check the link in the show notes.
