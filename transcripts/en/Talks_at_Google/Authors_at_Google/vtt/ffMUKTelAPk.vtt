[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:07.856
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, welcome.

00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:08.350
FELICIA DAY: Hello.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.849
Thank you.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.135
MALE SPEAKER: Have a seat.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.510
Yeah, I've got
your book up here.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.590
FELICIA DAY: You've
got Post-it notes.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.250
MALE SPEAKER: Mine came
with fancy Post-it notes.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.730
FELICIA DAY: Are you
getting graded later?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.230
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.860
I don't know.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.318
FELICIA DAY: Let's
grade him later.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.150
MALE SPEAKER: Gosh.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.900
So your resume has been
all over the place.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.650
And I don't think
I've actually talked

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.330
to anybody who's had as much
internet-specific stardom.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.404
People have become stars
and then gotten famous

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:32.070
on the internet.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.170
And you kind of flipped
the bit on that,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.460
which has been very cool.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
FELICIA DAY: I guess so.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.330
I have a weird
pathway that I don't

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.330
know if other people could
duplicate but at the same time,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.990
I wrote the book
because I thought

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.150
there were some universal
things in my book

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.982
that I thought people
could take away.

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.440
And hopefully, just embrace
who they are a little bit more.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.898
That's kind of the
theme of my book

00:00:51.898 --> 00:00:54.450
because I got where I
am and did the things I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.320
did because I just
kind of followed

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.589
the weird paths life took me.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:58.630
MALE SPEAKER: Well, yeah.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.640
I guess for those
who don't know,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.223
I didn't actually
introduce the book--

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:03.860
"You're Never Weird on the
Internet (Almost): A Memoir"

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.629
by Felicia Day.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.739
Right here.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:09.820
With a foreword by Joss
Whedon, which is awesome.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.127
So did your friendship
with Joss and Will Wheaton,

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:16.210
and all these other guys,
and Neil Patrick Harris,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.280
and all the people
you worked with--

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.690
FELICIA DAY: Wow, that's a
lot of names you dropped.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.564
MALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:20.990
You can pick it up.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.060
I gotta bump you up a
little bit here, right?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.540
FELICIA DAY: Thank
you, thank you.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.831
MALE SPEAKER: So, how did
these friendships come to be?

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:28.780
Because you started
filming The Guild

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.770
in like, your tiny little garage
on, like, no money, right?

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.160
FELICIA DAY: Yeah, well, I
guess the fancy people I know,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.368
I've collected over the
years through different ways.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.325
Joss Whedon-- I
was recently hired

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.650
for a role on Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, last season.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.860
They hired a bunch of
like red-shirt girls,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.860
who basically were killed
off during the season.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.310
So you'd always, like, get the
script on your doorstep and go,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.810
am I dead?

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.710
Am I dead?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.490
Oh no, she died.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.260
But I'm not dead.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.170
Yay!

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.521
I survived.

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.020
Actually, in the lore, I'm the
head of the New York Slayers.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.590
So just-- I'm not dead.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.450
Just to be clear.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.180
Any trivia.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.690
I am an actual slayer.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.410
And one day, this dude
sat down at the table

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.970
with a bunch of
the red-shirt girls

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.617
and was asking us questions.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:11.950
I was like, OK, he's seems cool.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.325
And then he says
something about,

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:16.215
well, you know, actors usually
don't get college degrees.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:17.800
And I was, like,
excuse me, but I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.258
was the valedictorian of my
class and I have a math degree.

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:21.400
And I studied music.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.690
And he said, OK.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.810
And everybody was just
like, what did she just do?

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.660
And I was like, well,
I schooled that guy.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.706
And afterwards, I learned
he created the show.

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:33.580
He was just that guy.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.220
So I was convinced, next time
I got a script on my doorstep,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.710
I would be like, oh dead.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.030
And killed by a library
book on her head

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.520
because she's a know-it-all.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.102
But in fact, he did not do that.

00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:47.560
Because I was, kind
of, an oddball,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.206
he embraced, I guess, the
fact that I was an oddball.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:51.830
And I got to be a
part of his, sort of,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.480
Whedonverse, which
is very-- it's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.330
kind of a tight-knit
group of people who

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.350
socially support each other.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.030
I mean, he has this
spirit of family

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.657
that I am blessed
to be a part of.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:03.990
So I've worked with him over
the years in "Buffy," and I

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.670
was in "Dollhouse"
and "Doctor Horrible,"

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.500
which was a great project.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.780
It was a web series
that he did because he

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.909
was frustrated with his
opportunities in Hollywood.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.200
That's why I created The Guild.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.050
So there's sort of a link there.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.760
And then everybody else, Will
Wheaton I just knew socially.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.160
And I was like, I want to
create this guy for The Guild

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.490
who's a dick in a kilt.
Because I love kilt guys.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.950
So you, kilt gamers?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.997
I'm like, they're kind of hot
but they're like, aloof and--

00:03:29.997 --> 00:03:31.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.830
It was before
beards were popular

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.772
and they're, like,
hairy everywhere.

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.976
So I wanted to
create this character

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:40.850
and I kind of knew him
through somebody else.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.040
And I pitched him.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.450
And I took him out to a
coffee place that had $8 cups

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.600
of coffee.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.130
And it was like,
I'm a high roller.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.730
That was high rolling for
web series, of $8 coffee.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.230
MALE SPEAKER: So, basically,
the moral of the story

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.010
is you like hairy guys
in kilts and that's

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.850
how it all came to be.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.849
FELICIA DAY: I'm attracted
to them artistically.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.639
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.930
MALE SPEAKER: So you obviously
have a good track record

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.740
of being able to write
things and have then become

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.450
successful.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.770
So why the book?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.462
Why were you, like,
oh, yay, I'm going

00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:10.920
to do more things in my life
and write this wonderful book?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.400
FELICIA DAY: You mean, I
should talk about myself,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.858
and then record an
audio book where

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.740
I talk to myself about myself?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.740
That was, yes, it was a
weird thing to sign up for.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.690
Well, I guess, the
point was, after I

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.030
created Geek and Sundry,
which was funded and created

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.580
by YouTube-- helped me start
my business, which is awesome.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.330
Thank you Youtube.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.765
I was asked to go around the
country presenting my story

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:32.640
to a lot of people,
either through advertiser

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.880
meetings or universities
or speeches like this,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.660
at corporations.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.940
And of course I was like, I've
never done a speech before.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.521
So I kind of put together this
sort of janky PowerPoint slide

00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.020
thing.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.390
A lot of the pictures are
in this book right now

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.750
telling my journey from
weird homeschooled girl

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.240
to business owner.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.872
And since people responded
to it-- and at conventions

00:04:52.872 --> 00:04:54.580
I go to over the years,
people would say,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.890
hey, you inspired me to
say I'm a gamer at work,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.070
even though I didn't
ever tell anybody before.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.740
Or, I decided to write a
web series because of you.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.980
Or, you know, a
lot of creativity.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.570
I said, hey, this could be
useful for people on a bigger

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.000
scale than just going
to speeches like this.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.790
So that's why I
kind of dived in.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.854
And also, it's just
a creative exercise.

00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:16.270
I've always wanted
to be an author

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.644
and it seemed like
the right time

00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:21.170
to sort of encapsulate my
story of finding success

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.050
through increasing
your individuality.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.310
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.870
FELICIA DAY: You seem skeptical.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.480
MALE SPEAKER: Well, no.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.850
That was a much more complicated
answer than I expected.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.165
FELICIA DAY: OK, I talk a lot.

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:32.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.420
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, that actually

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.503
leads to my next question.

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:37.360
The writing style is very, very,
like, stream of consciousness.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.568
You're just like, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, fuck.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:41.090
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, fuck.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.840
FELICIA DAY: Don't say
that because I tell

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.750
people it's great for children.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.125
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, children have

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.000
to learn how to speak
like that eventually.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.056
FELICIA DAY: It's true.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:51.470
Treat them like adults.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.240
But no, I mean, I
appreciate that.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.440
I spent a year on the draft.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.640
So it wasn't as if I was
just, like, here's a book.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.720
Buy it.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.880
I spent a long time breaking
it down and thinking

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.550
about each piece
as far as, like,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.860
is this useful to someone?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.739
Is this section, is the story,
something that someone else

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:10.030
could take something away from?

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.780
Or is it just me looking
clever or hilarious?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.950
I cut all that out
because at the core of it,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.640
I want this to be a useful book.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.930
I want it to inspire people to
really pursue the things that

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.265
make them an individual.

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.640
Because that's where I think
you find success and meaning

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.710
in this world.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.110
As well as just trying to be
creative and out of the box

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.150
without result-oriented
behavior.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.330
Because really, if I had
just jumped in and written

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.640
something for myself, I
wouldn't be here today.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.160
It wasn't for external goals.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.740
It was for just really wanting
to tell a story that was mine.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.960
And, yeah, so that's
why I decided to do.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.600
And hopefully, people
take that away.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.900
Or, just, you know,
read it for Joss Whedon.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.942
That's fine too.

00:06:45.942 --> 00:06:47.650
MALE SPEAKER: At one
point, you mentioned

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.691
that when you moved out
to Hollywood, eventually,

00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.630
like after college, and
whatnot, you originally

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.300
were doing things for like the
Hollywood people, and whatnot.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.705
And then, at one point,
you're like, all of a sudden

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:59.300
when the comments started coming
in on episode one of The Guild.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.660
You're, like, holy
crap, this is amazing.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.680
I want to do things
for internet land, now.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.440
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.950
No, I went to college
when I was just barely 16.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.042
So clearly, I had a
great dating life.

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:10.000
I mean, it was illegal.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.660
I didn't date.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.467
So.

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:15.880
And my mom drove me
to college every day.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.211
So clearly, I can't write the
next "Revenge of the Nerds"

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.710
because I don't know actually
how people partied at college.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.907
But I came from this world where
achievement was very based on

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:27.740
how hard you worked.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.240
It was mathematical
and I studied math.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.660
It was a mathematical equation.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.534
The harder you worked,
the more you achieved.

00:07:33.534 --> 00:07:35.800
And then I moved to Hollywood
where I was like, hey,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.100
I'm enrolled in every class.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.010
I have all the head shots.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.220
Discover me.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.400
And that didn't
work because it's

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.380
a very external-based world.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.860
And kind of growing
up in a vacuum

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.690
like I did as a
homeschool person,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.590
I wasn't used to being judged
on my appearance for the things

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.546
that people wanted from me.

00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:55.920
And a lot of things
that I loved,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.030
like math and science
fiction, and geeky things

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.150
like video games.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.370
I think if I were in
school, I would've

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.840
been dissuaded from pursuing
those or being proud

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.590
about saying that I loved
those things because of the way

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.260
I was born.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.250
I'm a girl, you
kow, the way I look

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.700
would influence what
people expected of me.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.710
And I found that
pressure to be enormous.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.750
I found it to be infuriating
and demoralizing.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.760
And, ultimately, the
message in my book

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.100
is that you have to change that.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.790
Like, you can't influence
the choices of your life

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.890
because of the cliches
of the way you were born.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.630
And that is something that we
need to all strive together

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.430
to break.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.809
Because if we're limited by
other people's needs for us,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.010
then we're selling ourselves
short in every way.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.590
And that's something that I
eventually push back against,

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.836
not like in a very
methodical way early on,

00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:43.210
but by just looking
for an outlet

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.102
to be in control somehow.

00:08:45.102 --> 00:08:46.560
And that's why I
picked up a camera

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.200
and started shooting in
my garage with like $500.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.260
Hey, here's some trash.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.900
I mean, there's a whole
story about how I put trash

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.660
in the background of The Guild.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.770
Literally, if you
watch that show,

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.170
it's all trash in
the background.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.006
MALE SPEAKER: That you
picked up, literally,

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.130
off the side of the street.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.290
FELICIA DAY: Literally,
off the side of the street.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.920
Or, I would, like,
get wrapping paper

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.586
and be, like, it's a
painting, Sharpies.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:08.160
MALE SPEAKER: So you went
to college at 16, you said,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.118
which was very awkward.

00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:11.200
But you mentioned
math several times.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.661
But you also majored in violin.

00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:13.660
FELICIA DAY: Yes, I did.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.050
Right?

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.230
MALE SPEAKER: And you've got
like, some deformed thumb,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.310
right?

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.740
Or something?

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:15.940
Right?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.440
FELICIA DAY: It doesn't
really straighten all the way.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.767
It used to be way crooked.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.100
And that's why my mom got me
into playing when I was two

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.280
because she saw, you
know, Oprah or something

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.720
and saw all these kids that
were two playing the violin.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.860
And she was, like, well
clearly, that's fate.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.900
It doesn't really add
up to me either, guys.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.190
I don't know.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.000
That's my mom though.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.020
She basically was, like,
don't go to school one day

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.686
and I never did.

00:09:36.686 --> 00:09:38.680
So that's how my mom was.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.260
Who I'm very thankful for
because I basically grew up

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.890
kind of unfettered and
sort of followed everything

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.757
that I was interested
in and good at things

00:09:46.757 --> 00:09:48.590
that I never would've
been good at normally.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.280
But, at the same time, you
know, growing up in a bubble,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.390
I'm socially awkward.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.640
That's why I love video games.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.020
Because if I'm at a party,
if there's not a person there

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.620
who can talk about video games
with myself, I'm leaving.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.526
I'm going to play a video game.

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:01.832
So bye.

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:02.790
MALE SPEAKER: Well, OK.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.580
So you were originally
accepted to Juilliard, right?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.311
At 14.

00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:07.810
FELICIA DAY: I got
into pre-program,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.420
which is like a feeder school
for getting into Juilliard.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.580
But we couldn't afford
to move to New York

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.380
and so-- my mom, on
a whim, was like,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.560
let's go try out for things.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.740
I mean, I love her a lot.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.490
There's a story there
where she decided

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.860
to make me a Mouseketeer.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.719
And we just drove to
Ohio without any reason

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:28.010
to [INAUDIBLE] and I was
like, where are we going, Mom?

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.196
And she was like, oh, there's
an audition for Mouseketeers.

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:32.570
You're going to
be a Mouseketeer.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.820
And I'm, like, what
are you talking about?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.270
I didn't know anything.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.800
I don't know what
song-- she's like,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.450
just sing what you were singing
in opera class last week.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.850
So I was, like, singing
like a Schubert aria

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.980
to people in a Hilton.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.700
And I did not pass
the first round, guys.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.110
Surprisingly.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.450
But you know--

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.720
MALE SPEAKER: Well, she put
you in a bunch of stuff,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.940
though, because like, trying to
socialise you, I guess, right?

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.690
FELICIA DAY: She really tried.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.523
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.462
There was like dance class where
you were a famous astrologer?

00:11:01.462 --> 00:11:02.170
FELICIA DAY: Yes.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.720
She tried to make
me a Tejano star.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.400
This is all in the book, guys.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.320
Tejano is a kind
of Tex-Mex music

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.140
that I should never touch
in a very offensive way.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.770
But she decided, hey, we'll
just name you Felicia Diaz.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.759
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:20.300
I mean, I actually have never
said that aloud and I wrote it.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.716
But I'm more
embarassed saying it.

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:23.172
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:24.630
But, you know,
those kinds of whims

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.200
she would follow in an
effort to just provide

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.700
any opportunity for my
talent, which she always

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.780
was supportive of.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.070
So she's a wacky person that
I love very dearly because I

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.920
wouldn't be the person
I am without her,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.967
sort of being a
little bit crazy.

00:11:37.967 --> 00:11:39.800
MALE SPEAKER: You've
mentioned several times

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.780
she was like very into, just,
political activism, right?

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.150
FELICIA DAY: Oh, yeah.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.750
I remember from the
youngest age folding

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.540
envelopes for, like, Gary Hart.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.970
He was a guy, like 84.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.590
I was, like,
probably five or six.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.923
You know, I'm folding-- she's
like, here's how you do it

00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:58.570
and I'm like stuffing envelopes
for all these loser candidates.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.370
I mean, she would
support anyone who lost.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.300
But Ross Perot is
the one where I

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.840
was like, 13 or 14 and we would
go on the road with everybody.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.190
I would be out there picketing.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.439
Yeah, you know, flat tax.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.230
And I didn't know what
I was talking about.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.020
But it was definitely amusing
And it taught me, kind of,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.100
being a rabble rouser was fun.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.844
Really, we're just
on the corner, like,

00:12:22.844 --> 00:12:24.010
trying to disrupt the world.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.482
And I think that really fed
into what I do now, which

00:12:26.482 --> 00:12:27.690
is like disrupting Hollywood.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.773
It's very appealing to me.

00:12:28.773 --> 00:12:31.080
And the fact that technology
gives us all the tools

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.000
to get our creation out there
in a way more direct way

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.240
is very appealing to me.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.090
MALE SPEAKER: But you
have a brother, right?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.840
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.130
Younger.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.730
MALE SPEAKER: And
you and your brother

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.214
were originally in school at
a young, young age, right?

00:12:43.214 --> 00:12:45.380
FELICIA DAY: I don't think
Ryan ever went to school.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.882
He might have gone
to kindergarten,

00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:48.840
but then my mom got into
a fight with a teacher

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.070
because he held his
scissors backwards.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.990
And she was like,
I'm out of here.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.410
So I went to first and
second gradee-- part

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.620
of second grade, first grade.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.878
And then we just moved and
never went to school again.

00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:01.628
I mean, literally.

00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:04.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.540
MALE SPEAKER: In
Mississippi though?

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.250
FELICIA DAY: In Mississippi.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.470
They were not good schools.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.070
And there was reason
not to put us in school.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.653
But at the same time,
there was reason

00:13:10.653 --> 00:13:12.940
to maybe get us tutors,
which she eventually did.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.148
Because my dad was like,
what's up with the children?

00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:17.538
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.020
So then I began to be
trained like a geisha.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.770
She would put me in
every lesson possible.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.930
I took, like, watercolor
with 90-year-olds

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.580
at the community college
when I was 12, you know.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.000
I learned a little
bit of every language,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.520
including Arabic,
because you never

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.810
know what will happen with
the world political situation.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.110
I definitely cobble together
an interesting background.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.560
And like I said, everything
that she raised me

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.310
in a weird way that made me
feel a little different when

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.430
I got into the world, but have
been things that I've channeled

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.304
into my career today.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.070
MALE SPEAKER: Knowing
that there was like,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.020
a social life, I guess,
or a, I guess, structure

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.120
to being in school,
like looking back on it,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.530
do you think you're a little
bit, any different from what

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.279
your brother went
through, having not gone

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.060
to school at all?

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.310
FELICIA DAY: I don't think so.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.800
I think we were both raised
in a pretty isolated world.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.740
And our one conduit to the
world was, for me, theater,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.480
being like the fifth orphan in
Olvier, over and over again.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.160
Wherever I moved,
I was like, oh,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.320
I loved pence, and
all that stuff,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.490
like-- that was terrible.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.610
Oklahoma-- I was, like,
chorus girl number seven

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.400
a couple times.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.914
So that kind of family
was very appealing to me

00:14:27.914 --> 00:14:29.330
because it gave
me a social world.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.354
And then a dial up
computer-- we had a laptop.

00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:33.520
I talk about it in the book.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.840
Like it was this big.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.090
The "laptop" is convenient
and it's literally a truck.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.627
You have to have, like, a
forklift to move this laptop.

00:14:40.627 --> 00:14:42.210
And my mom would
dial up to CompuServe

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.090
and just argue with people
over Reagan, mostly.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.295
But I learned, that, hey, this
is how you connect to people.

00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:52.170
And she wouldn't let me
dial up on CompuServe

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.590
because that was expensive.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.110
It was like, I dont know, six--

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.070
MALE SPEAKER: It was hourly.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.930
FELICIA DAY: It
was hourly, yeah.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.850
It was like, $12 an
hour, or something.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.600
I don't know.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.170
Then we would play
King's Quest and we

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.540
would use the phone dial up.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.570
This is how old, I
guess, I feel right now.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.070
That you would have
to use the phone

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.750
to get a hint in
King's Quest to get

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.800
through a problem in the game.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.070
You couldn't Google anything.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.868
And we had like,
$500 phone bills

00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:16.493
for trying to get
through King's Quest.

00:15:16.493 --> 00:15:17.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:19.990
We got cut off from a lot of
things at a certain point.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.700
But Prodigy came along,
this other online service.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.450
MALE SPEAKER: I loved
Prodigy for Madlibs.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:24.860
FELICIA DAY: Really?

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.730
You did that?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.050
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:26.900
I did Madlibs.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.010
They were great.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.930
FELICIA DAY: That's crazy
to me because so few people

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:29.800
were into that.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.810
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, I
loved the-- of course.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.393
Look who I'm sitting on
stage with right now.

00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:33.200
FELICIA DAY: Oh.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.430
We might have been
Mailbox friends.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.310
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, gosh.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.400
FELICIA DAY: It
was so primitive.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.858
MALE SPEAKER: It
was 0.25 an email.

00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:40.290
FELICIA DAY: Yes, but if you
created an extra account,

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.460
that you could write
an email to yourself,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.350
and then leave it in
the inbox as a draft,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.440
and somebody else would
log in and look at that.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.240
That was how hard--

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.240
This is the equivalent of, like,
I'd walked 12 miles in snow.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.750
MALE SPEAKER: Left
myself an email draft.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.714
So throughout the early
chapters of the book,

00:15:58.714 --> 00:16:00.130
or talking about
your early years,

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.200
you reference and show
images from your diary,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.780
which I want to
read something here.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.110
OK.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.818
So in the diary--

00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:07.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.939
You wrote, do you
know what I would

00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:11.230
like to do more than anything,
except environmental and

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.040
biological stability
forever in the world?

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.350
I would like to travel in
time like in Quantum Leap.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.370
It would be so wonderful.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.350
Do you still have, A, this
diary, and B, these thoughts?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.350
FELICIA DAY: Well,
I have the diary.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.000
I don't think that anymore.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.970
I mean, there's some
crazy things in the diary.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.710
And I urge all of you to look at
yourselves because you probably

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.010
can make-- you can mock
yourself as a child.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.457
It's very easy for all of us.

00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:37.290
I think, at a certain
point, I wrote, like--

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.873
and there's startling
things in there.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.069
You're just like, hey, today, I
learned what a miscarriage was.

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:43.610
It's where you spit
out a baby early.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.120
By the way, today,
I got a beach bag.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.250
And I'm reading this,
I'm like, horrified

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.280
that-- A, that's how I
would learn what that is.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.948
And then B, that it was, just,
like, Anubhav and I got a beach

00:16:56.948 --> 00:16:57.448
bag.

00:16:57.448 --> 00:16:58.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.740
Yes.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.740
I had this diary that I
talked to because no one

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.865
else would talk to me.

00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:02.990
I talked to a little diary.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.300
And it's kind of great to see.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.000
That's was a very
formative period of my life

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.260
where I was very sequestered.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.920
And after that, I sort of,
branched out a little bit more.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.800
But having that to reflect
on, my weird, it's definitely,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.400
it's proof that
I certainly would

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.696
have been a social outcast
probably in school either.

00:17:18.696 --> 00:17:20.660
MALE SPEAKER: What about
your brother, Ryan?

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.960
What's he doing?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.930
FELICIA DAY: He was
mostly, like-- he

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.099
liked to take things apart.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.990
And he liked to be on
the computer and read.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.840
He read a lot of Dungeons
and Dragons books.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.120
Although my mother
wouldn't let us actually

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.900
play Dungeons and Dragons
with someone, anyone in person

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.640
because she thought-- she read
one article once about basement

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.400
satanic murders, and she
was, like, you can't do that.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.360
So fast forward to
today, I actually

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.020
have a company that produces
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.930
Take that, Mom.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:52.450
MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
that Ultima changed your life.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:52.810
FELICIA DAY: Yes.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:53.070
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.620
So for those who don't
know, what is Ultima?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.828
FELICIA DAY: Ultima's like,
one of the first computer

00:17:56.828 --> 00:17:58.120
role-playing games there is.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.640
Richard Garriott created this.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.640
And there were, you know,
I think eight of them.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.098
And, I, literally,
thought this was

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:04.780
the world I wanted
to live in primarily

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.404
because you could
create an avatar that

00:18:06.404 --> 00:18:07.950
looked kind of like yourself.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.930
You could play a girl.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.142
And you could steal bananas
from doors everywhere.

00:18:12.142 --> 00:18:14.100
Like, every single door
was equipped with fruit

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.475
that you could
take for yourself.

00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:18.970
And I loved the idea I could
steal things, you know,

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.190
in a virtual world.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.023
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:18:21.023 --> 00:18:22.287
[LAUGHTER] Of course.

00:18:22.287 --> 00:18:24.245
FELICIA DAY: It gave that
sense that I was free

00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:26.470
and I could walk to the corner
without a molester, you know,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.740
kidnapping me like my mom
told me that would happen.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.490
I could walk to the corner
and kill a monster in the game

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.577
and nothing would happen
to me that was bad.

00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:35.660
So I loved those games and
I connected with people

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.504
on Prodigy around that game.

00:18:37.504 --> 00:18:39.170
And that was really,
kind of, the first,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.287
really, close-knit social
group that I ever had.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.870
And I tell a story
about meeting them.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.626
And it's very awkward and funny.

00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:46.500
MALE SPEAKER: I've got
a page of quotes here.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.291
I want to read something
about Ultima here.

00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:50.474
So, she says, the early
community, within Ultima,

00:18:50.474 --> 00:18:52.140
taught me how wonderful
it is to connect

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.180
with like-minded people.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.970
No matter how lonely
and isolated and starved

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.270
for attention you
are, there's always

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.770
a possibility in
the online world

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.065
that you can find a place
to be accepted or discover

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.360
a friendship that started
with the smallest of interest

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.290
but then could last a lifetime.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.520
Your qualifications for
finding a place to belong

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.760
is enthusiasm and passion and I
think that's a beautiful thing.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.902
So you had your first
kiss out of this.

00:19:11.902 --> 00:19:12.860
FELICIA DAY: All right.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.450
That's an awkward segue.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.660
Because I felt, like, the
vibe in the room was like,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.360
I'm inspired.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.740
That's really what
tech is about.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.690
No, let's talk about my awkward
kiss in the back of an Acura.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.632
I mean, I met this guy on--
we had like a phone thing.

00:19:27.632 --> 00:19:29.340
And, I mean, you've
got to read the book.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.990
There's a picture that I
sent to boys on the internet,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.030
like a physical picture.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.860
And they all liked me very
much from this picture.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.390
It was a terrible,
like, kind of,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.860
glamour shots
picture with my butt.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.735
I was wearing, like, a
fringe leather jacket.

00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:43.070
It's so embarrassing, guys.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.386
And anyway, all the
boys loved it online.

00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:47.260
So we decided to meet
up in New Jersey, which

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.400
I'm going to New Jersey later.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.070
And I still hate that state
because of this incident.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.010
MALE SPEAKER: That
was my next question.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.982
FELICIA DAY: Yeah,
New Jersey, sorry.

00:19:52.982 --> 00:19:54.690
You're always going
to suck a little bit.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.320
I mean, I'm not going to
tell them that to their face.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.570
Please don't tweet it to them.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:00.610
MALE SPEAKER: This is airing
everywhere except New Jersey

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.340
so you're safe.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:01.424
FELICIA DAY: Great.

00:20:01.424 --> 00:20:01.924
Thank you.

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:02.920
Just geo-blocked.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.717
Love you, Google.

00:20:05.717 --> 00:20:08.050
So, basically, I met these
guys and I was kind of, like,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.050
attracted to two of them.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.930
And then one of them I
just eliminated because I

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.013
was like, nope, not there.

00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:14.040
And then, the other
one, nope not there.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.090
But my mom was like, you
have to kiss this guy.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.300
So she made me kiss him
in the back of the car

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.520
while they went in to get
Bugles at the Walmart.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.600
It's a whole story, guys.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.391
Just read the book.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:27.110
It's more mortifying to read
it than me talking about it.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.080
Not really.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.070
And that was my first
kiss and it was gross.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.695
And it made me not
want to kiss anybody

00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.220
because I was, like,
that was just sloppy.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.220
MALE SPEAKER: I think
most people's first kisses

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.340
are probably like that.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:37.940
FELICIA DAY: Really?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.490
MALE SPEAKER: Mine was.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.230
FELICIA DAY: What
was yours like?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.900
Let's hear about--

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.386
MALE SPEAKER: You want
to talk about mine?

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:41.850
FELICIA DAY: Yes.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.160
I'm going to put
you on the spot.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.868
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, well real quick.

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.030
I'll talk about this.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.825
It was in Dumb and Dumber.

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:49.200
FELICIA DAY: It
was in the movie?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.890
MALE SPEAKER:
Yeah, in the movie.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:50.280
FELICIA DAY: OK.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.488
MALE SPEAKER: Not filming
but we were there to watch.

00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:53.724
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.724 --> 00:20:55.890
We were there to watch the
movie and she came at me,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.120
mouth open, full tongue.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.102
And I was, like, and
it just went all over.

00:21:00.102 --> 00:21:01.910
FELICIA DAY: Eew.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.100
Why'd she go full tongue?

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.225
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:05.080
We were young.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.190
FELICIA DAY: Ugh and with
the popcorn and everything?

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.230
You know, that's
like, [? asbestos. ?]

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.880
MALE SPEAKER: She didn't throw
popcorn at me in the thing, no.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.630
FELICIA DAY: Yeah, but
just popcorn mouth.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.100
You need to clean that out
with a wet nap before you kiss.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.780
MALE SPEAKER: I will
tell younger self

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.540
to go back and fix that.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.979
FELICIA DAY: I'm
sorry about that.

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:18.770
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.030
MALE SPEAKER: It's all right.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.850
Yeah, well, we share that.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.391
That's great.

00:21:20.391 --> 00:21:21.757
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:21.757 --> 00:21:23.090
FELICIA DAY: Wet, sloppy firsts.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:27.180
MALE SPEAKER: So young, awkward,
homeschooled, of course.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.957
I'm into college, still awkward.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:31.790
FELICIA DAY: Thanks.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.669
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:34.460
MALE SPEAKER: It's all
in the book, people.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.390
I didn't say it.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.761
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.800
It's OK.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.330
Did you have much of a social
life in college or were

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.580
you just so focused on
getting a 4.0, which

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.270
you are happy to say
you graduated with.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.436
FELICIA DAY: I was valedictorian
in my class, I was.

00:21:48.436 --> 00:21:52.540
I gave a speech on finding
the art in your science.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.860
God, I hate myself,
in retrospect.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.980
I did have a social life in
that the music building was

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.080
sort of this commune.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.674
It's next to the
stadium, which gets

00:22:02.674 --> 00:22:03.840
all the millions of dollars.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.290
And then it's, like,
the music building.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.040
Like, oh, those
people are musicians.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.320
That supports the band
for the Texas football.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.799
So being [INAUDIBLE]
musician there.

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:15.090
I loved it because everyone
treated me a little sister.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.080
Because it was illegal,
of course, to date me.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.230
So everyone was very sweet
to me and I was, like,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.804
a little prodigy because
I was really flashy.

00:22:22.804 --> 00:22:24.470
And I practiced 12
hours a day because I

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.636
had nothing else to do
because no one would date me.

00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:29.690
So I became very good and I
joined the Austin symphony.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.240
I mean, being a
part of that world,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.730
because work was play then.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.480
Because if you were
friends with somebody,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.540
they'd hire you to
play at a wedding

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.920
or a depressing-- playing
Handel's "Messiah" for the five

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.450
millionth time for
Easter at some church.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.770
That was a social
life, in a way,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:50.010
but it certainly wasn't where
I got all those awesome college

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.830
memories that most people have.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.460
I mean, I kind of wish I had
been exposed to crazy keggers,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:55.960
you know?

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.459
No one every invited
me to anything,

00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.360
just to be perfectly honest.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.340
It's sad.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:02.850
Not really.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.870
I'm not that sad about it.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.590
I mean, a little bit.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.770
I really wish I had sex with
a lot more different people

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.561
just in retrospect.

00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:08.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.070
Because then-- don't get
that look on your face.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.101
You know that was
what college was for.

00:23:13.101 --> 00:23:13.600
No?

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.190
MALE SPEAKER: There's
a time and a place

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.780
for everything and that
time and place was college.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.010
FELICIA DAY: Exactly.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.670
In college.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.460
Exactly.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.700
In a safe way.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.424
Don't quote me on this.

00:23:21.424 --> 00:23:22.340
MALE SPEAKER: Be safe.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:22.964
Use protection.

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:23.923
FELICIA DAY: Thank you.

00:23:23.923 --> 00:23:26.422
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you don't
talk about the love life much,

00:23:26.422 --> 00:23:27.100
so, you know.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.600
FELICIA DAY: I try
to keep it clean.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.770
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.040
Everybody's laughing at that.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.805
So after college, 4.0 GPA,
double-majored, awesome.

00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:41.180
And then, all of a sudden,
you just go move to Hollywood.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.930
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:42.880
MALE SPEAKER: Why?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.710
FELICIA DAY: I knew
that someone would just

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.100
discover me on the sidewalk
and be, like, you're a star.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.100
That's really,
actually, the truth.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.059
I was very naive
in thinking that I

00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:54.600
was going to move to Hollywood
and feel like I belonged, just

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.145
like that Oklahoma chorus girl.

00:23:56.145 --> 00:23:58.020
We're just all going to
make a show together.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.470
And that did not work out
the way I thought it was.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.220
I did find a really great
career doing commercials

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.360
for, like, Cheetos, and
Anheuser-Busch, and the post

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:08.910
office.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.900
And it was always, like,
hey, I'm a secretary.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.610
And half my nose
would get on screen

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.010
and I would make, like,
$50,000 that year.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.240
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, national
commercials are no joke.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.820
FELICIA DAY: They're no joke.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.860
I made a great living,
but it's literally,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.410
you're a soulless being.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.730
They treat you like cattle.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.480
You go in and there's
five of you in a row

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.260
and you go, like, hey,
would you like a washer?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:26.760
Next.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760
Would you like a washer?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.420
And you're, just,
literally, just ejected

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.700
for your literal outer being.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.570
It was a great way
to pay the bills

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.320
but it was kind of
soul searing and that's

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.550
kind of what got me into my War
of Warcraft addiction, which

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.100
sort of enveloped my
life as a warlock.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.350
MALE SPEAKER: We'll get
to that, but I want to--

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.600
FELICIA DAY: That was ominous.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.470
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
it's the next section.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:50.380
FELICIA DAY: OK good.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.940
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I'm kind
of going chronologically

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.273
in the book, which is wonderful.

00:24:53.273 --> 00:24:54.760
FELICIA DAY: Thank you.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.690
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so your first
real gig was ultra low budget--

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.460
serial killers.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.287
FELICIA DAY: Yes.

00:25:01.287 --> 00:25:03.620
When you first move to LA,
you'd do anything, literally,

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.080
anything.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.050
And there's a thing
called backstage

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.030
where you send your head shot
in anywhere who will take you.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.860
And they're usually, like,
student films with 17-year-old,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.640
you know, 18-year-old
kids who don't even

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.090
sound on your camera.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.050
And you're expected to,
literally, beg for any job.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.540
And I got my first start with a
movie called "Serial Killers,"

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.040
which was an audition
when the guy asked

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.660
me to show my breasts.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.397
And I was, like, no, sir,
I will not show my breasts.

00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:29.730
And I felt really good about it.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.605
And then he hired me.

00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:31.240
I was like, OK.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.120
But I didn't show my breasts.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.220
I was the best friend of the
girl who showed her breasts,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.060
just for the record.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.972
And I treated her with
pity the whole time.

00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:39.680
MALE SPEAKER: But then
the check bounced.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.730
FELICIA DAY: The
check bounced, yeah.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.540
MALE SPEAKER: The $90 check
bounced-- for five days.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.748
FELICIA DAY: Yeah, and I
guess the moral of the story

00:25:44.748 --> 00:25:48.150
is that I came to Hollywood
thinking that my straight A

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.700
attitude is going to get me far.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.740
And it did not get me far
because that's-- Hollywood is

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.190
really more about appearances
and look more than anything.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.580
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.310
Right So you were going through,
like, the commercial world

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.740
and the low budget world for,
like, six years, you said,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.240
I think?

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.330
So why did you keep going
through all of this?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.956
A lot of people can't
handle rejection.

00:26:05.956 --> 00:26:07.454
FELICIA DAY: I mean,
I can't at all.

00:26:07.454 --> 00:26:09.260
Like I've cried
more times in my car

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.080
than you can count
after feeling like,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.410
hey, I did a terrible job.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.370
Or, they judged me and
I messed that word up.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.340
Yeah, it's really hard.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.840
And I think growing
up homeschooled,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.630
I didn't deal with
rejection at all because I

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.504
didn't get exposed to
it nearly enough, which

00:26:22.504 --> 00:26:24.505
I think is an advantage
of being in school.

00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:26.130
From what I hear,
high school is really

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.550
great for abusing yourself.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.660
I mean, I'm not envious.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.260
I watched "90210."

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.200
I know how those girls act.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.225
So I think I would have been
a little over more resilient,

00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:38.600
but I kept going
because I always

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.260
had this idea that
that next job was

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.510
going to get somewhere, right?

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.560
And that's sort of the carrot
that is danged in Hollywood.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.160
That-- it's just
around the corner.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.710
Just keep, you know,
keep going, keep going.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.950
And sometimes that's true.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.690
But for me, I just got
very upset with life

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.570
and just kept going
kind of feeling

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.794
sadder and sadder inside.

00:26:57.794 --> 00:26:59.460
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
that's a good segue,

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.225
I guess into your "World
of Warcraft" addiction.

00:27:02.225 --> 00:27:03.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:04.510
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.010
MALE SPEAKER: So this is
where Codex was created--

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.760
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.530
MALE SPEAKER: Your
level 60 warlock.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.446
FELICIA DAY: I always
call my characters Codex

00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:12.920
after the Ultima-- it's
the book of infinite wisdom

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.210
because that was what every--
it's just really nerdy.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.500
MALE SPEAKER: So there's an
entire chapter, 19 pages,

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.010
which is 7.3% of your book
about World of Warcraft.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.740
Like that is, I think
it's the longest chapter.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.000
FELICIA DAY: Did it feel long?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.850
MALE SPEAKER: No, no it didn't.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.766
I just got done reading
and I was, like, dang,

00:27:28.766 --> 00:27:30.840
all the chapters are
like a whole timeline.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.044
And then this is was like,
just World of Warcraft.

00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:35.210
FELICIA DAY: I mean, if you
look at the hours spent,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.520
it probably was proportional.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.510
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
how much do you play?

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.844
FELICIA DAY: I mean, I play,
like, 12 to 14 hours a day.

00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:41.260
I would wake up
and be, like, well

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.920
I-- I would literally
have a to do list

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.760
for "World of Warcraft."

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.218
I would like, I need to fly to
this place to get dreamfoil.

00:27:46.218 --> 00:27:48.860
I need to fly here and make
some [INAUDIBLE] titans.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.230
I was the potion master.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.296
I had a lot of responsibility
on my plate, OK?

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:54.170
MALE SPEAKER: How did
you get into it though?

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.470
FELICIA DAY: My
brother invited me.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.344
And I've been addicted
to other online games,

00:27:57.344 --> 00:28:01.960
"Diablo," "Puzzle Pirates," like
all these small, online games.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.840
Because I really liked
connecting with people

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.548
and hanging out with
them and play games.

00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:08.050
Like, I don't think games are
inherently addictive at all.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:11.590
Like I don't want to paint
them in any negative term.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.000
I feel like I needed
a Band-Aid on my life

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.040
and I used the "World of
Warcraft" as a Band-Aid

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.410
to fill the hours that I was
not happy being a rejected

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.790
actor over and over again.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.180
I mean, because the thing
was, I made a living.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.709
So I was just kind of hanging
out, waiting to be discovered.

00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:29.000
MALE SPEAKER: Did your brother
get addicted as you did?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.458
FELICIA DAY: No,
he quit before me.

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:33.440
He actually had some
self-preservation there.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.480
I played very intensely
for eight months, at least,

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.230
hours and hours and
hours and hours a day.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.170
So it got to the point where
I'd dream "World of Warcraft."

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.180
I'd wake up, I'd go
and play all day.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.620
I'd go to bed with a plan
for the next day of gaming.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.691
And I would dream in cartoon.

00:28:50.691 --> 00:28:52.690
At a certain point, you
know I'm a smart person.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.505
I'm like, maybe
this isn't healthy.

00:28:54.505 --> 00:28:58.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.184 --> 00:29:00.100
MALE SPEAKER: So you had
another Guild, right?

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.890
You found another Guild
online to play with?

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.264
FELICIA DAY: Yeah,
we had a raid.

00:29:03.264 --> 00:29:05.531
So I created an alt, I
had a couple of alts,

00:29:05.531 --> 00:29:08.030
because, you know, God knows
everybody needs another priest.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.197
So I had to get that priest to
60 and that's another thing.

00:29:11.197 --> 00:29:13.030
Then I can raid every
night and that's great

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.550
because everybody needs me.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.160
And it's just sort
of a slippery slope

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.270
because there are always
people to play with.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.780
There are always people who
felt like, I could provide help

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.460
to them.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.180
And it was obviously a
false sense of purpose

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.090
but it was something
that I needed in my life.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.010
And it was sort of
the quick fix for it.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.800
MALE SPEAKER: How much
do you still play?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.650
Do you play at all?

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.900
FELICIA DAY: I don't play WOW.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.940
I definitely game a lot.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.870
Like, I game around
20 hours a week.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.770
I stream games a
couple times a week.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.040
I mean, I produce a
lot of gaming content.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.720
So I still love it a lot.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.495
And I miss that sense of
camaraderie, I really do.

00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:48.870
Because that sense of belonging
and working toward a goal

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.104
together is very fulfilling.

00:29:51.104 --> 00:29:53.520
I try to find it in filmmaking
but it's really fun to take

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.500
down a monster, it really is.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:57.294 --> 00:29:58.960
MALE SPEAKER: And
then during this time,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.560
you were also trying to
write The Guild, right?

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.720
FELICIA DAY: Well, I quit WOW
cold turkey because I just

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.594
started skipping auditions
and at that point,

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:06.520
you know-- the lady
support group I was in

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.790
were like, OK so you're
being self-destructive.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.009
And I quit and I decided
to write something.

00:30:13.009 --> 00:30:15.300
They say write what you know,
something that you really

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.633
feel like you have something
to say about in this world.

00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:20.500
And that was a bunch
of gamers who were

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.400
interacting online and offline.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.100
It was definitely
something in my heart

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.370
I wanted to get on a
page, which was not

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.570
easy to get on the page.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:31.640
I had to kind of force myself,
really put the screws in.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.500
But I did finish a whole
draft and it was, literally,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.240
the proudest thing
I've ever been--

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.020
because I made myself
finish something for myself

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.862
rather than external
ratification.

00:30:40.862 --> 00:30:42.570
MALE SPEAKER: So the
ladies support group

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.480
you were talking
about, all stemmed out

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.625
of a love of pancakes.

00:30:45.625 --> 00:30:47.110
You were meeting at
the Wafflehouse, right?

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.420
FELICIA DAY: Yeah, well
we ladies were just,

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.210
like, let's support each other.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.360
And I think later it was
the secret that inspired it.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.050
So let's not talk
about that part of it.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.300
But it was a five,
four five ladies

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.050
that got together every
week and would be,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.060
like, these are
my goals and this

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.080
is what I want to do this week.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.230
And here's what I did this week.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.729
And they would do all sorts of
productive things and I'd be,

00:31:03.729 --> 00:31:06.876
like, I raided Zul'Gurub
and then we took down uh--

00:31:06.876 --> 00:31:08.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.402 --> 00:31:10.610
We took down [INAUDIBLE]
and I got a really great hat

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:11.060
this week.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.851
And they would be,
like, I don't understand

00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:14.520
anything you're doing.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.160
So at a certain point, I
had enough self-reflection

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.410
and I was, like, OK,
I'm feeling guilty

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.936
that they're really
excelling in front of me.

00:31:21.936 --> 00:31:23.560
MALE SPEAKER: So what
were they called?

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.460
FELICIA DAY: The Chicken.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.400
It was called Chicken.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.090
MALE SPEAKER: Chicken Ladies.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.923
FELICIA DAY: I know.

00:31:26.923 --> 00:31:29.134
It was so vaginal.

00:31:29.134 --> 00:31:30.175
MALE SPEAKER: So vaginal?

00:31:30.175 --> 00:31:30.570
Or magical?

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.570
FELICIA DAY: So vaginal.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.470
It was magical too.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.860
It's a magical vaginal.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.580
MALE SPEAKER: So the comments
came in, series took off.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.760
So on episode three was
when it was featured

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.886
on the homepage of YouTube.

00:31:43.886 --> 00:31:44.635
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:31:44.635 --> 00:31:46.830
YouTube had this power back
then to actually feature

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:47.600
content that wasn't ads.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.100
MALE SPEAKER: I
think they still do.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.714 --> 00:31:59.880
FELICIA DAY: I mean, there
was a curated front page,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.490
The YouTube.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.050
And literally, I wouldn't be
here without that one feature.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.610
So I definitely
owe it to YouTube

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:09.460
for kind of skyrocketing
the Guild into visibility.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.380
I think the woman's name
was Felicia Williams.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.910
She actually curated the comedy
for the front page of YouTube

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:14.410
back then.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.285
And a lot of the stars
were created from that

00:32:16.285 --> 00:32:18.409
because that was the only
way you could get traffic

00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:19.650
to be featured.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.560
So that really was
the tipping point

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.180
where people found the show.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.440
We wanted to make more and
we didn't have the money.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.460
So we tried to figure it
out by putting a Paypal

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.130
button on those janky
Wordpress websites

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.630
that I just kind
of cobbled together

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.171
through video
tutorials on Lynda.com.

00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:36.769
And I was like, it's beautiful.

00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:37.435
It was terrible.

00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:38.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.460
But I'm so proud of it because
I made it from scratch.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.679
It was fantastic.

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:44.720
I was, like, ey, I'll just
try this Paypal thing.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.100
This was before Kickstarter too.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.970
So I didn't expect
anyone to care.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.390
And suddenly, we
had enough money

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.120
to shoot more of the episodes.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.862
It was kind of the most
empowering thing I've ever

00:32:53.862 --> 00:32:56.330
experienced to kind of go
around that gatekeeper who

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.290
was going to allow me
to tell a story or not.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.240
And have the fans
support us directly.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.620
It was really fantastic.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.530
And it actually
invigorated me in a way

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.890
that I felt like I am
creating a community together

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.640
with other people.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.150
I feel like I'm playing
again for the first time

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.112
in a long time.

00:33:10.112 --> 00:33:11.570
And that's why I'm
still here doing

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.810
web content because
that sense of community

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.050
and feeling a sense of
belonging and making

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.500
people connect and
accept themselves

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.480
is really so much more
fulfilling than anything

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:25.120
external that I
can achieve before.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.080
MALE SPEAKER: So you were
trying to shop around

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.663
to Hollywood execs
though and actually

00:33:28.663 --> 00:33:30.914
get it picked up, right?

00:33:30.914 --> 00:33:32.330
You had a lot of
execs that wanted

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.788
to take over control
if they wanted

00:33:33.788 --> 00:33:34.900
to give any money at all.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.960
Have you gone back
to anybody or met

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.150
with anybody that originally
was like, just horribly

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.319
mean and just rubbed
it in their face?

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:44.860
FELICIA DAY: Not rubbed it in
their face but, a lot of people

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.235
were, like, oh, it's so great
that you didn't sell to us.

00:33:47.235 --> 00:33:49.070
I've actually had
people say that.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.921
Because so many times I've
seen people option their book

00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:53.670
or webseries, and it
gets into development

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.074
and-- the Hollywood
process is very lumberous

00:33:56.074 --> 00:33:58.490
and there's a lot of external
reasons why things get made.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.350
And honestly, if
anything ever gets made,

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.300
you should be, like,
man, victory to you.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.840
You can retire because it
is so hard to turn this vote

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.320
and get anything on camera.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.540
So I've been told in
the past to people

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.840
that I just turned down that
they were like, yeah, you

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.110
were right.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.860
You did it better than
we could have done,

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.380
even by taking away the
rights to your show and kind

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.105
of controlling everything.

00:34:19.105 --> 00:34:20.730
That's what I really
wanted to protect.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.021
Because I didn't want to give
up the thing that I loved

00:34:23.021 --> 00:34:25.219
so much just to
make that business

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.690
move to look fancier
for Hollywood.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.280
Because I didn't care as much
about pleasing them anymore.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.189
I really just want
to please our fans.

00:34:31.189 --> 00:34:32.230
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.860
There's another quote I want
to read here, specifically,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.860
about the support group.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.323
You said, "Find
a support group--

00:34:37.323 --> 00:34:39.239
find a group to support
you, to encourage you,

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.489
to guilt you into doing.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.889
If you can't find one,
start one yourself.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.580
Random people enjoy
having pancakes.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.250
Make a goal.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.639
Then strike down things
that are distracting you

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.239
from that goal, especially video
games, unless it's this book.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.210
Finish reading and then start.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.800
Put the fear of
God into yourself.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.739
OK, I'm not religious.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:55.500
Whatever spiritual
ideas float your boat.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.375
Read some obituaries.

00:34:56.375 --> 00:34:59.190
Watch the first 15 minutes
of Up, I don't care.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.471
Just scare yourself good.

00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:00.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.345
FELICIA DAY: You have a finite
number of toothpaste tubes

00:35:03.345 --> 00:35:05.380
you'll ever consume
while on this planet.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.200
Make the most of that clean
tooth time for yourself."

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200
MALE SPEAKER: Well said.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.780
Thank you.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.770
FELICIA DAY: I mean, if you
think about it, next time you

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.280
use toothpaste, it's like,
literally, it's a count down.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.238
It's really depressing.

00:35:16.238 --> 00:35:18.224
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.224 --> 00:35:19.890
MALE SPEAKER: That
was a long quote too.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:20.910
Sorry.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.470
So I want to take it
down a little bit.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.360
So you mentioned a little of,
like, depression and anxiety.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.570
It's sort of an underlying
theme throughout a lot

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.810
of your adult life after
college and what not.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.630
And maybe even during
it a little bit.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.206
Why talk about that in the book?

00:35:40.206 --> 00:35:41.205
Why'd you bring that up?

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:43.730
FELICIA DAY: I mean, I
think that reflecting

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.800
on a lot of the things
I've done my life,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.420
are or done in my life, I feel
like there have been things

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.780
in my brain ruling
me, in a way that

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.032
almost is as much peer
pressure as people

00:35:54.032 --> 00:35:55.740
to abandon things when
you're in puberty.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.044
My anxiety and problems in
my brain made me steer away

00:36:00.044 --> 00:36:02.210
from things that probably
would have been fulfilling

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.610
had I not let them rule me.

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.910
And the fact that I went
through such a tough time.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.470
After Geek and Sundry
started, ending

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.900
the Guild-- the crushing-- you
know, just a startup company--

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.150
I wasn't prepared.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.500
I didn't have the tools.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.630
We didn't scale-- we
weren't scaled big enough

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.030
to really handle the amount
of work that we had to do.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:21.220
And I wanted to execute.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.910
I had a reputation to maintain.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.110
I had a bar to set
that was really high.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.140
I was the Guild, you know?

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.754
So when all that came
crashing down on my shoulders,

00:36:30.754 --> 00:36:32.420
I just couldn't handle
the stress of it.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.950
MALE SPEAKER: You
got physically ill.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.220
FELICIA DAY: I got
physically ill.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.470
I have a lot of health
problems because of the stress.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.450
Because stress can
kill you, guys.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.940
I had a nervous
breakdown, really.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.320
I shattered into
a lot of pieces.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.147
And putting back
those pieces made

00:36:45.147 --> 00:36:47.480
me kind of look at my life
in a different way and think,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.500
hey, I don't want anyone
to go through this

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.745
and feel as alone as I
have through this process.

00:36:51.745 --> 00:36:53.870
Because the minute I started
reaching out to people

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.650
and getting their advice and
help and therapists and doctors

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:59.250
and things like that,
like, I started to heal.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.100
But in the moment, I didn't
realize I had an alternative.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.910
I didn't know I had tools
to like pull myself up

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:05.670
from the mud pit.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.280
I was like, I'm down here.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.610
I guess I'll just go under.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.837
I mean, I really
had no awareness.

00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:12.420
And I think the more
people talk about

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.566
that, especially if
somebody likes my work

00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:15.940
and they see the
external things,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.730
like, hey, that's
what success is.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.440
Or, she has it all, or
I want to be like her.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.650
I do it with other actors.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.820
Ah, it must be easy
being Lady Gaga.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.700
I mean, I'm sure she
wakes up and is just

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.770
depressed a lot because
of all the pressure.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.880
And everyone's got
their problems.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.270
And success, quite frankly,
can bring as many stresses

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:36.020
and pressures as failure.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.589
And nobody told me that ever.

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:39.630
I always thought that I
was just a broken person,

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.520
not being able to handle
all this opportunity I got.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.310
And when I started
building myself back up

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.430
and being able to
cope a lot better,

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.920
I wanted to write about it
in a very transparent way

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.800
so that everyone could relate.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.360
And if they had any
opportunity to be

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.220
more aware of the
patterns in their own life

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.360
and get help through
my story, that

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.032
would be worth writing
the whole book for.

00:38:01.032 --> 00:38:02.490
MALE SPEAKER: There
are microphones

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.590
in the aisles over here
if anybody has questions.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.770
Please step up and ask.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.080
And I'm going to actually
read another quote, which

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.810
I think is very timely for
what we just talked about.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.360
So about the depression,
you said, "In the end,

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.855
I'm able to look back without
shame or regretful nostalgia,

00:38:16.855 --> 00:38:19.230
and I think, 'you've made
something great.' And something

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.070
new will come around or not.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.030
Either way, do the work you
love, and love yourself.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.530
That's all you could do in this
world in order to be happy."

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.020
So I hope that-- yes,
anybody reading this book

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.620
will find some
inspiration from it.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.550
Because, I think, being
as open and as transparent

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.380
as you were about
that is probably

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.640
enough to get a lot of people,
like, just a little bit--

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.940
I don't know how to phrase
this-- it's personal for me

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:48.071
too-- that it'll allow
people to just, maybe,

00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:50.570
take a little bit initiative
to ask for help that maybe they

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.590
wouldn't have otherwise.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:51.890
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.560
You know, I mean, I think we're
greater than just ourselves.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.893
And a lot of times, especially
growing up the way I did,

00:38:56.893 --> 00:38:57.440
I feel alone.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.110
And I feel like I need to
be on an island to myself.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.770
And being vulnerable
to other people

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.354
and having that kindness repaid.

00:39:03.354 --> 00:39:05.020
And drawing the strings
between yourself

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.260
and other people is an amazing
tool, not only to create.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.010
Like, I would never
have created The Guild

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.550
without that Chicken group.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.750
And I never would have
stayed in this business

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.220
without the community around it.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.350
And it's really that sort of,
like, safety net of connection

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:21.740
between all of us that
really catches us when we're

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.120
most vulnerable and we need it.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.600
And bounces us up when
we're buoyant or joyous

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.772
and we want to share
something with the world.

00:39:28.772 --> 00:39:29.730
MALE SPEAKER: Question.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:29.970
Yeah.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.345
AUDIENCE: So it seems like a
lot of your work, especially

00:39:32.345 --> 00:39:35.240
The Guild, is about the way that
games can create communities

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.660
from people from all
sorts of different places.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.670
And so I'm wondering, like,
with the ethics movement that

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.230
will not be named, we see
this, like-- it seems recently

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.300
there's this, what seems to me,
like, a theme of like, identity

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.650
being very important
in a negative way.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:55.090
And I'm wondering if you think
that that aspect of gaming

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.772
that was really
appealing to you,

00:39:56.772 --> 00:39:57.980
do you think that's changing?

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.510
Where do you think that
that pushback comes from?

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.635
FELICIA DAY: I mean, I
think that-- I actually have

00:40:02.635 --> 00:40:04.010
a chapter of that in the book.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.760
And I was actually wary of,
like, do I put this in here?

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.510
It actually happened
after my draft was done.

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.260
The chapter was about negative
comments and various attacks

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.280
I've had on me over the years,
especially for the label "gamer

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.370
girl."

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.140
So that chapter was in
there and that incident

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.960
that I experienced last fall was
just almost like an addendum,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.750
the peak of that sort
of underlying movement

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.060
that had-- you're right.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.240
It's kind of like a basic
resentment or intractability

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.640
about identity of gamer.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.690
And because gaming has become
so much more than it used to be,

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.600
and expanded to represent a
lot more voices, and a lot more

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.310
differing viewpoints, I
think it got to the point

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.520
where it became too big
for the umbrella that

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.990
existed to include everybody.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.800
And then people are like,
well, I don't feel represented.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.950
I don't feel like I fit in here.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.670
I love this, but I would love to
feel more comfortable this way.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.670
And some people just can't bend.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.790
They feel personally
threatened by that.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.380
And I think it's a
tragedy that gaming even

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.750
has a black eye because
of these people.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.440
And to this day,
I daily see people

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.860
say that I'm afraid of
gamers and I alienate gamers.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.520
And it personally betrays
me because my identity

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.620
is so close to gaming myself.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.200
What I think is good that
comes out of it is that for me,

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.660
personally, the
community I have,

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.320
we try to be as
proactively positive

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.350
as that small minority of
people are proactively negative.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.472
And that gaming leaders
come out and say,

00:41:28.472 --> 00:41:29.430
this is not acceptable.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.740
This is not what gaming is.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.130
That's not the gaming I know.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.780
And I think the more--
everyone steps forward

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.980
and represents differing
points of view in saying,

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.670
you know what?

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.830
You can't do that.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.080
That's not acceptable.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.180
That really fosters
an environment.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.010
I think, even technologically--
it's incumbent upon platforms

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.680
to give people the tools to
regulate their environment.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.950
Like, to me, YouTube
needs to do better

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.510
to be able to give the tools,
not only to the creators,

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.695
but to the community, to
regulate the environments

00:42:01.695 --> 00:42:03.070
that they're
hanging out around--

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:04.610
and the community to create.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.240
I started a Twitch channel.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.070
And that environment gives
the moderators so much leeway

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.570
and we have so many
proactive people

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.485
who create a place, where
I would walk into that chat

00:42:13.485 --> 00:42:15.180
room in a virtual
or physical way,

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.180
and want to meet everybody
in that chat room.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.970
And everybody can be
included if they want

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.680
to be friendly and inclusive.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.930
I wish YouTube had
those tools-- to be

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.550
able to create a YouTube
comment and a YouTube place,

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.490
a sense of place
under those videos,

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:30.410
that people could feel
free to go in and enjoy

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:31.860
the company of everybody there.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.780
So I think that incredibly
negative incident

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.860
is positive in that
gaming is a lot stronger

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.890
in a unified front against
those kind of things.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.110
And hopefully, platforms
and leaders stand up

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.510
and say, let's just focus on
the love of games, which I

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.122
think we all have in our heart.

00:42:48.122 --> 00:42:48.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.303
FELICIA DAY: Thanks.

00:42:49.303 --> 00:42:54.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.280
So as you mentioned,
on the internet, like,

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.680
no matter how small or how
strange something might be,

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.950
like, you will
always find someone

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.950
that you can bond with over it.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:11.950
What is the most
obscure thing that you,

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:16.890
or someone that you know, have
bonded over with someone else?

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.974
And then a friendship just
bloomed and blossomed?

00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.390
FELICIA DAY: I
mean, I have a love

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.220
of Anne of Green Gables,
which is, like, immense.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:25.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.548
Like, I couldn't have
been more obsessed.

00:43:27.548 --> 00:43:30.346
I met Megan Follows and started
crying at a certain point--

00:43:30.346 --> 00:43:31.720
because she played
Anne of Gables

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.340
in the Disney
Channel mini-series.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.320
You guys are just blink
as hell over here.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.450
And when I say that, a lot of,
especially women, are like,

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.950
oh my god, Anne of Gables is
my hero, especially redheads.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.360
So it's like she's
the redhead heroine

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.160
that the redhead
girls always are,

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.880
like, she's literally
my Barbie, or whatever.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.280
So I think that is
something that-- and I

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.487
think-- the way
that I-- I'm talking

00:43:56.487 --> 00:43:58.820
about Anne of Green Gables
and I'm lighting up with joy.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.377
And that's really what we
should be able to follow.

00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:03.835
Whatever it is that lights up
your joy in talking about it,

00:44:03.835 --> 00:44:05.260
and you meet somebody at
a party and you're like,

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.968
thank God this guy
knows about, you know,

00:44:06.968 --> 00:44:09.640
cool collector
sneakers, or like,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.360
"DOTA," or something like that.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.260
That instantly
creates a connection.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.301
That's what I love about
geek culture and the way

00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:16.572
the internet is constructed.

00:44:16.572 --> 00:44:18.280
There's nothing more
tragic than somebody

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.680
abandoning something they love
and lights them up with joy

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.220
just because the
people around you

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.490
are saying that you're
weird or you should hide it.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.140
Like that's almost
a form of bullying,

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.800
in a sense--
unconscious bullying,

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.010
but asking you to
conform is a sense

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.240
of rounding out your
corners and dissuading you

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.614
from letting your joy out.

00:44:35.614 --> 00:44:37.780
Like, that's really all we
have in life to-- there's

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.530
a lot of downs.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.860
We have to pay bills, you know?

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.050
Life is inherently kind
of crappy sometimes.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.970
And the more joy we
could spread and connect

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:45.220
with other people, the batter.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.140
And that's what I think
the ultimate Polyanna

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.180
view of the internet is.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.782
Does that answer it?

00:44:51.782 --> 00:44:52.365
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:52.365 --> 00:44:53.240
Anne of Green Gables.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.090
Thank you.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.006
FELICIA DAY: Wait, what's
your weirdest thing?

00:44:56.006 --> 00:44:57.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.340
Furries?

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.925
AUDIENCE: My weirdest?

00:45:00.925 --> 00:45:03.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.800
I don't know.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.551
A lot of the big
stuff like Doctor Who.

00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:09.300
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:09.720
FELICIA DAY: Yeah.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.847
Doctor Who's a good one.

00:45:10.847 --> 00:45:12.180
AUDIENCE: Love, love Doctor Who.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.300
MALE SPEAKER: You freaked
out over Matt Smith, right?

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:13.590
FELICIA DAY: Oh, I did.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.555
Matt Smith's in here.

00:45:14.555 --> 00:45:16.680
I've seen him at parties--
anyway, there's a story.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.555
It's really pathetic.

00:45:17.555 --> 00:45:20.260
[LAUGHTER] You'll read about it.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.120
Well, thank you.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.880
AUDIENCE: I can't think of any.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.590
All right, I'm sorry.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:22.950
I'm putting you on the spot.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:23.720
I'm horrible.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.825
OK bye.

00:45:24.825 --> 00:45:26.450
MALE SPEAKER: When
was your first kiss?

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.780
No?

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.260
No?

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:27.360
OK.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.420
FELICIA DAY: Where
was your first kiss?

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.120
We want details.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.220
Was it juicy?

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.632
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, question.

00:45:32.632 --> 00:45:34.090
AUDIENCE: When I
think of, kind of,

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:38.280
five-minute video content,
episodic episodes,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.140
like The Guild, the Legend of
Neil, I kind of think of you.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.300
But I haven't really seen it
become popularized in any way.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.029
And I wonder if you had any
ideas why it's not happening?

00:45:48.029 --> 00:45:49.820
FELICIA DAY: Yeah, it's
really interesting.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.090
And I think early
in Geek and Sundry,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.280
I tried to maintain
that kind of content.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.300
And unfortunately, if you know
things about film production

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.110
is that anything scripted
is extremely difficult.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.610
If you walk on the
set of The Guild,

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.359
most fans were, like,
oh my god, I thought

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:04.649
it was just you and a camera.

00:46:04.649 --> 00:46:06.190
You can't-- you
know, "Supernatural,"

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.340
a show that I was
on for four seasons,

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.940
that's-- 300 people
work on that show.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.800
So the scale of making scripted
content, especially at volume,

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.091
is exorbitantly expensive
and advertising dollars just

00:46:16.091 --> 00:46:17.840
haven't been able to
be there to prove it.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.720
So, say, you have an investment
into, like, Geek and Sundry,

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.450
and you have minutes that
you need to make of content.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.450
What is a better investment
in a practical way?

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.889
$100 a minute or
$1,000 a minute,

00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:32.680
if you don't have the
advertisers out there

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.474
to really support this
brand new kind of content?

00:46:35.474 --> 00:46:37.390
Well, you have to make
cheaper content, right?

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.280
And then you have these
bloggers who are amazing

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.970
and they have one camera and
they're making $2 million

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:43.094
a year in product placement
and they, literally, do

00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:44.360
have a camera and themselves.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.760
And what is a better
economic landscape?

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.200
Well, The Guild is a
great economic landscape

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.910
in that it's an IP
that can be exploited

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:51.910
on different properties.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:53.470
I can make a movie one day.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.404
I license it to video
games and board games

00:46:55.404 --> 00:46:56.820
and t-shirts and
things like that.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.320
That has a long life.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.389
So that IP-- look at
"Star Wars," you know?

00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:01.180
That's the biggest.

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.265
But it's a much more
risky investment

00:47:03.265 --> 00:47:05.890
because you don't know if you're
going to make your money back.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.890
Better to just make lots
of low-budget content.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.780
And I think after The
Guild and Legend of Neil,

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.696
there was kind of the
potential of, like, hey,

00:47:11.696 --> 00:47:13.380
short-form scripted
is going to be it.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.140
And a lot of things tanked.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.140
So then you went the safe
route and you invested

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.380
in low-budget content,
which is now more popular.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.240
And those stars that are being
created now on those platforms

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.070
are now funding long-form
scripted content.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.810
So it's kind of
this weird cycle.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:31.925
And I'm excited by the fact that
long-form scripted-- especially

00:47:31.925 --> 00:47:33.300
YouTube is investing
in it, which

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.780
is amazing-- and all
sorts of other platforms,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.300
like Vessel and-- everyone's
making scripted content now.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.800
So it seems like the
pendulum went one way.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.030
And now it's coming back.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:43.840
But the short form
is just harder

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.050
to license in different
iterations across platforms.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.030
It's a bunch of wonky
business stuff that,

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.090
basically, is like, make a movie
or make really cheap content.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.110
That's kind of where
web video is right now.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:55.320
But who knows in five years.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:55.944
You never know.

00:47:55.944 --> 00:47:58.119
That's the cool thing
about this space.

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:00.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we have
time for one more question.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.204
AUDIENCE: I actually have just
a really light-hearted question.

00:48:03.204 --> 00:48:04.120
FELICIA DAY: Oh, good.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.870
Because that was boring,
what I just said.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:08.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.990
AUDIENCE: So I'm a mom of an
eight-year-old girl and we

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.680
both game together.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.300
And we have theme songs
for ourselves when we win.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.540
And my daughter asked me to ask
you what is your winning dance

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.010
or theme song?

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.130
Oh my gosh.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:23.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.011
MALE SPEAKER: You know
you have to get up, right?

00:48:26.011 --> 00:48:27.970
FELICIA DAY: I mean,
my-- please don't.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:31.530
You can dance for me.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.760
It's probably Eye of the Tiger.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.070
Or, take, these broken wings,
and learn to fly again.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.430
It's like my karaoke song.

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.375
I just have to rub really bad
'80s songs in people's faces.

00:48:42.375 --> 00:48:43.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.180
Yeah.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.300
That's probably an answer.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.717
That's a terrible song.

00:48:47.717 --> 00:48:49.550
But that's the cutest
story I've ever heard.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:50.415
Thank you for that.

00:48:50.415 --> 00:48:52.540
MALE SPEAKER: So you've
got the wonderful book out.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.664
You've got Geek and Sundry.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.140
What's next for you?

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.610
FELICIA DAY: I'm working on
a lot of different projects.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.720
I'm trying to get back
to more scripted content.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.030
The business has really
taken a lot of my time.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.180
The book took up last year.

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.890
And now I'm working
on a TV pilot,

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.030
whether it's digital
or TV, that's cool.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.570
I'm working on
something to direct.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.460
And hopefully, making another
long-form piece of content

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.590
that's scripted.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.700
That's really what I love.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.284
And just keeping
all the platforms

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:16.450
juggling on Geek and Sundry,
YouTube, and everything

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:16.950
that we do.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.154
So, I mean, I love
having 15 hats.

00:49:19.154 --> 00:49:21.070
And although it tends
to break my neck because

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.902
of the heaviness,
I just can't stop.

00:49:22.902 --> 00:49:24.360
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
you did mention

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.010
that you do keep all the gifts
that people ever give you.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.550
So we got this wonderful
Talks at Google Android.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.390
FELICIA DAY: What?

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:32.140
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.014
FELICIA DAY: Did you
get this free somewhere?

00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:34.542
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:34.542 --> 00:49:35.250
I'm just kidding.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:35.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:36.610
Is it a regift?

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.230
It's OK.

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.730
I want it.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.840
MALE SPEAKER: No, we
give them to our guests.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.131
FELICIA DAY: It's really sweet.

00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:41.670
Thank you.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.550
It's adorable.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:44.292
MALE SPEAKER: You're welcome.

00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:45.250
FELICIA DAY: I'm sorry.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.591
That was really tacky.

00:49:46.591 --> 00:49:47.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:48.090
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:48.740
Is it free?

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.930
So, yeah, You're Never Weird
on the Internet (Almost):

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:56.034
A Memoir, available-- it
comes out today, right?

00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:57.450
FELICIA DAY: It's
out today, guys.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:58.090
MALE SPEAKER: It is out today.

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.160
It's there in the back.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.610
Are there still any copies?

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.930
I don't know.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:04.660
On Amazon and of
course, Google Play.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.305
Get your copy.

00:50:05.305 --> 00:50:06.700
Pick up one if you haven't.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.390
So thank you for coming out.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:09.600
Everyone, please, help me.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.600
FELICIA DAY: Thank
you very much.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.100
Wonderful.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.450
FELICIA DAY: Thank you.
