00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.220
&gt;&gt; Michelle Bickert: Thank you
everybody for joining us today

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.440
and for moving down
closer to the front.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.520
We really appreciate it and
are happy to enjoy you and see

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.120
if you're really, really excited

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.390
or if you maybe make it easier
to throw tomatoes at us.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.690
I don't know.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.300
I hope everybody's having
a good DPLA Fest so far.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.040
Whoo! We are here to talk to
you today and give you an update

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.860
on library ebook platforms.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.850
As some of you may remember
from last year we were able

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.300
to do a really intensive ebook
workshop thanks to generous funding

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.930
from the [inaudible] Foundation.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.590
And a lot of good work
came out of that.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.850
I think most importantly I got
hired, so hold your applause.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.640 position:56%
And so I wanted to give you at least
a quick update on where we are,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.050
and then introduce my colleagues
who will talk more of the state

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.550
of ebooks and libraries
more broadly.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.460
So where are we now a
year after DPLA Fest 2015?

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.660
I've got a couple of our projects

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.350
that DPLA has been
working on up there.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.590
Open Ebooks has been mentioned
I know quite a few times today

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.210
and we're going to talk about
it even more as we go through.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.160
And I'm sure that Micah's probably
going to talk about that as well.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.760
I'll just mention briefly
what DPLA's role has been

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.790
in Open Ebooks as a partner.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.480
We put together a curation core of
the nation's top school librarians,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.260
librarians working with youth,
and they curated the 6,000 books

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180
that we have available
in Open Ebooks.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.280
They were able to take those
publisher donations and pick

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.570
out what it is that
students really want as well

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.940
as reflect the diversity.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.400 position:56%
We also run the social media for it,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.500
we help convene the community
conversations around it,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.190
we're helping to lead conversations
around accessibility in ebooks,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.750 position:56%
and try to improve even more some of
that native functionality that comes

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.980
through ePUB and working
with Readium.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.450 position:56%
And we really see that all of the
press that's been around Open Ebooks

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.870
as an opportunity to
help further some

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.650
of these initiatives
in the ebook community.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.700
And DPLA is helping to lead
that conversation along

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.520
with our partners NYPL
and First Books.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.020
Also, I have up there a
little graphic for LEAP,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.930
the Library eContent Access
Project, which is funded by IMLS.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.790
And DPLA's role in that is to be
the, again, the community convener.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.160
We're trying to figure out what
our role is in ebooks again

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.640
as we've worked in the past
year, and so we're helping

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.880
to organize the conversations
that are going to go

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.690
around creating a library-owned
marketplace

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.180
which again Micah's going
to talk to a bit more later.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.120
With that idea though, and
DPLA organizing these community

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.300
conversations, we're
also working on a sort

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.540
of broader ebook working group,
a broader ebook community,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.100
and this came out of the
conversations last year.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.380 position:56%
So how can we create an umbrella for
everybody who's working in ebooks

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.730
to come together and share
all of their information,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.370
share what they're working on?

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.160
We want to be able to
streamline the effort.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.850
If somebody in Massachusetts
is working with a publisher

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.250
and somebody in Texas is working

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.010
with a publisher how can we make
sure that they're connecting

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.470
with each other and talking

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.380
about what [inaudible] they
were able to make with content.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.500
We had some great discussions
over the last week for those of us

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.890
who were able to join at the Public
Library Association as well as some

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.860 position:56%
of us got together yesterday as the
LEAP partners, and are really trying

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.090
to see where we all fit in there.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.240 position:56%
And I think that those
conversations are going really well.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.150
I also have a little
graphic down there.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.960
DPLA has about two million items
that are categorized as books

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.830
within our site, and we're looking
at how we can open up that content.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.660
And there's going to be a whole
session right after this talking

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.920
about how we can try to open up
the content that our hubs have

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.750
and turn those into
accessible ebooks.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.440
So I'll just quickly add
going back to what I said

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.940
about the ebook working group,
we want voices to get involved.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.740
We want people to feel that they
have a community that they can come

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.850
into and talk about
ebooks, learn more,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.920
be connected with the resources
that they need for their library.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.520
So we have up here on the screen
a couple of different places

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.060
where you can look to get involved.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.930
We're still sort of figuring

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.990
out what our best options
are going to be.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.490
We've got a Google Plus
community, a working group listserv

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.430
and a Wiki page that posts our
findings, our final products.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.540 position:56%
I would recommend going again to the
dp.la website, Get Involved, Ebooks.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.450
We're really trying to
get this to bubble up

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.540
and making it easier
for you all to connect.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.330
So please just get in touch with
me if you know that you want

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.890
to be involved, if it's a
conversation that you want

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.520
to be part of and I can make
sure that you are plugged in.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.820
I'm Michelle.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.490 position:56%
You can find me on the DPLA website.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.000
Our emails are pretty easy.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.630
So with that I'll introduce
my colleagues who are here

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.980
to give you an update from
their world of ebooks.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.620
We have Christine Peterson who
is the Amigos eShelf Manager

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.430
for Amigos Library
Services in Texas.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.730
Greg Pronevitz.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.210
Oops, you guys switched
seats, spots on me.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.810
Greg Pronevitz on the end there
who is the Executive Director

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.110 position:56%
of the Massachusetts Library System.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.740
And Micah May who is the
Director of Business Development

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.160
for the New York Public Library.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.970
And with that I'll pass
it over to Christine.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.580
&gt;&gt; Christine Peterson:
Thanks for coming.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.880
I am Chris Peterson.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.920
I'm the Project Manager or Program
Manager for Amigos eShelf Project.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.540
But fortunately or
unfortunately I'm not here to talk

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.840
to you about our project.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.140
Talk to me afterwards.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.090
Okay? No laughter?

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.740
No nothing?

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.090
[ Laughter ]

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.120
Okay. So my role today is actually
not to talk to you about us

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.970
but to give you a little
bit of history,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.600
to give you the library-created
platforms that went before us

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.350
and where they are right now.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.200
But first I want to give
you the three reasons

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.680
that libraries started doing this.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.170
And it really goes down to
Douglas County which I will talk

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.940
about a little bit more in detail.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.010
There were three reasons
that Douglas County decided

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.910
to create their own
instead of continue

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.320
with the commercial vendors.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.750
The first was the loss of
ownership of the titles

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.480
that they were subscribing
to at the time.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.400
Also, the increased price.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.890
There was a specific
incidence with OverDrive

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.470
that really turned
the corner for them.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.850
And the third was the requirement
of their patrons having to learn

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.810
yet another user interface.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.820
And with all three of those things
they decided we can do this.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.900
And so I'm going to start with
Douglas County who's our first.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.740
Douglas County decided to integrate
their ebooks into their ILS,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.920
the one you're looking
at right here.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.030
I have about a minute per
here so I'm going to move

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.440
through these pretty quickly.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.630
They were the first ones that
said, "You know, we can do this."

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.760
And they went to IMLS and
they were fortunate enough

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.340
to get an IMLS grant to
help fund this change.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.250
They did decide to do what we all
claim we want to do which is try

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.740 position:56%
to bring everything together instead
of having silos and they were able

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.290
to bring everything
together within their ILS.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.340
Of course, they had
technical resources

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.620
to be able to back that up.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.480
So the question is where
are they right now.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.760
Oh, by the way, everything
they did was open source.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.770
If you go to the Evoke--
e, v, o, k, e--

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.870
website you will get
everything you need

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.310
to know to do this for yourself.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.520
I do want to tell you that
where they are now is kind

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.820
of questionable.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.750
Actually it's probably
not really questionable.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.370
They are not moving forward.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.350
There have been a number
of staffing changes

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.850
at Douglas County particularly
in the administrative area,

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.550
and their focus has been
moved to something else.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.610
Now I say that telling you
that they still have a server,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.350
an Adobe content server, sitting
there and it is still working.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.100 position:56%
They have not yet turned it off but
they are not moving forward with it.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.670
I also want to make mention here

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.910
that when they created
this they created it

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.510
without web-based ordering.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.330
I'll come back to that
explaining why that's important.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.580
Right after that, well, within
a year after that, Marmot,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.290
which is a consortium that
includes Douglas County,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.640
it's a multi-type library
consortium in Colorado,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.480
they decided to move
forward on this.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.920
And they created their own.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.380
Now they're a consortium so
they were not just dealing

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.630 position:56%
with a single library at this point.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.990
They decided to use View Find,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.550
which is an open source discovery
system, as their interface.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.110
So they already had an existing ILS

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.130
but they used View Find
as that discovery piece.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.780
So that when they added the ebooks
they were also doing the same thing

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.390
as Douglas County they were
just doing it the different way.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:02.880 position:56%
Douglas County used their ILS,
Marmot used the View Find interface.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.970
So they already had a very
robust ILS that was going.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.830 position:56%
They went ahead and included ebooks.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.590
They also integrated
ebooks with other resources.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.830
They are not just dealing
with OverDrive.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.770
They deal with multiple
ebook aggregators

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.270
and they bring all
of that in to one.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.620
They do an incredible job there.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.340
They also upgraded the
View Find functionality

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.640
so much that it forked.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.930
So now you have View Find Plus

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.240
and you have the View
Find Community versions.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.980
They also have decided not to
move forward with the ebook side

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.920
of this with the platform side.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.190
Mainly because they're
changing their focus,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.530
and into other types
of functionality.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.170
Now the interesting thing is
their Adobe content server sits

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.810
at Douglas County.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.230
They share that server.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.920
So as long as Douglas County's
server is up Marmot is still up

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.340
but they're just not doing
anything with the service.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.840
I don't believe, last time I
heard there was not a timeframe

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.530
for Douglas County to take that
server down but I would imagine

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.890
in the next year it might be down.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.290 position:56%
Marmot is right now starting to move
those ebooks that they purchased

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.180
on to other commercial platforms
that they have access to.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.310
Taking a little bit out of, I was
trying to do from oldest to newest

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.090
but I want to continue
with Colorado.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.310
This is probably one
of the newer projects.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.620
This is the Evoke 2.0 Project.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.520
And the reason Colorado did
this was because of the lack

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.730
of web-based ordering which
made it really difficult

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.390
for the smaller libraries
to be able to join.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.900
Too much time, they didn't
have the resources to do it.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.170
So they went back to
IMLS and got a grant

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.460
to actually create an
end-to-end solution

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.050
which included not
only web-based ordering

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.120
but also included a
really nice interface.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.260
It was a compliment to the projects

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.990
that had already been
going on in Colorado.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.800
And they did do this, they
got an agreement with Odilo

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.060
and Odilo went ahead and changed
their software to do this.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.520
Unfortunately it was
never implemented.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.300
So it sits in Colorado
and right now it sits

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.250
at the Colorado State Library.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.610
To this point nothing
has been done with it.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.130
That doesn't mean that
something won't be.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.320
But right now it's been a
year, maybe a little bit more,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.290
that the software hasn't been used.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.200
So we don't know where
this one is going.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.980
We'll see.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.280
I know that there's
a lot of interest

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.850
at the Colorado State Library to
do something with it and to be part

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.310 position:56%
of the ebook work that's being done.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:43.880 position:56%
The next group that came forward was
sorry, was Califa, sorry about that.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.910
Califa is a consortium
out of California.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.770
It's a public library consortium.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.130
And they are the third.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.310
So we have Douglas County, we have
Marmot and then we have Califa.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.580 position:56%
And all of these people I'm talking
about, you know those of us who came

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.630
after stand on the
shoulders of these people.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.100
I mean they did incredible work.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.960
They did incredible time,
experience, money that went

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.160
into this so even though
I'm telling you that some

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.790
of these projects have
stopped that doesn't mean

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.670
that we don't still value
the work that they did,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.410
and that continues with Califa.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.220
So they are a consortium.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.420
There are multiple ILSs there
that they work through and with.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.000
They use the View Find interface
that Marmot has created.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.630
They also started out with
a single-shared collection

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.730
and now they have moved to not
only a single-shared collection

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.270
but also collections
for each library.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.650
You might notice that
I have a note up there

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.620
that the Kansas State
Library is part of Califa.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.760
And so those of you who are in the
know know that there was an issue

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.610
between Califa, I mean, sorry,
Kansas State Library and OverDrive

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.560
when OverDrive upped their
cost by 700% the result

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.080
of that was Kansas
pulled their books out,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.170
and they are now a Califa member.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.430
So there was an interesting
story behind that.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.160
So where is Califa right now?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.900
Califa is moving forward.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.200
My gosh, yes.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.030
You don't want to get
in front of Califa

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.810
because they're going
to run you over.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.110
So there's a lot going on,
and there's Paula right there.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.410
You know, right there.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.740
So Califa is moving forward.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.610
Now the key right here
you might notice

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.920
that there's no web-based ordering.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.040
And I say that there's no
web-based ordering yet,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.580
because Califa is looking
into ways to bring that in.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.140
And, again, if you have that it
makes it easier for a library

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.960
to be able to use the service.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.760
So then I move on to ours and I
wish I could spend an hour here

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.060
but I won't.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.360 position:56%
I'll spend just a couple of minutes.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.660
We were next.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.960
We were the fourth ones.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.300
And because we stand
on the shoulders

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.870
of everybody else what
did we include?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.240
We included web-based ordering.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.590
So this is just a real
quick view of that.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.390
We are a multi-type consortium.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.030
We span, historically,
we span six states.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.870
When we decided to do this we
decided that choice was our,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.890
flexibility in choice is
what we're looking for.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.610
So when libraries come to us they
choose where they want these ebooks

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.970
to show up, we have
interlibrary loan agreements

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.320
with almost all the publishers.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.110
We're looking at multiple
licensing agreements.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.550
I mean, there's a lot of
things that we're doing mainly

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.720 position:56%
because we're straddling both public
and academic school and special.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.390
So where are we headed?

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.240
We are, can I say right behind
Califa, or right with Califa.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.290
I mean, yeah, we're
moving forward as well.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.990
The next one is the
Montana State Library.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.740
I did not even know they
were doing anything.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.550
I'm so embarrassed, until
about six or seven months ago.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.790
But Montana, and the
reason I didn't know is

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.280
because Montana was
doing it internally

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.840
and it took them a
long time to do it.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.050
There were a lot of
technical challenges.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.350
They didn't have a lot of staff.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.650
They didn't have a lot of money.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.950
But they wanted to see
if they could do it.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.600
So they did a pilot project

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.200
and their authentication
came just through SIP.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.690
They didn't do any
other authentication.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:57.160
They're dealing primarily with
ebooks that are about Montana

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.560
or written by Montana authors.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.700
There's nothing really
happening with it right now.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.440
It is up and running.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.630
They have 30 titles which
tells you it's a pilot.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.900
They are looking to broaden that
or possibly to become part of LEAP,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.870
or to look at Califa or Amigos.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.350
But they are looking to see
how they can become part

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.060
of this conversation.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.000
Whether it is to keep what they've
got or to hook onto somebody else.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.730 position:56%
The next one I have is Pennsylvania.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.290
There are two libraries-- Oil City
and Meadville public libraries,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.520
which are about 30 miles
apart in Pennsylvania.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.990
Meadville has a tradition
of using open source.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.650
They were one of the first
[inaudible] libraries,

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.480
and they do a lot of
open source there,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.360 position:56%
and they give back to the community.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.710
And they looked at this one
and they said, "We can do this.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.330
We're going to do it as a pilot."

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.950
And their hope was that the
Pennsylvania State Library would

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.530
look at it and take it on.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.290
That was the hope.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.890
You might notice that it says
"Ready to test with libraries."

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.120
They originally gave
themselves six months to do it.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.570
Sixteen months later
they're starting to test.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.950
Let me just say it takes a
little bit longer than you think.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.440
So this was built as
a proof of concept

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.030
and they have two publishers.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.390
They brought in Gutenberg
and they brought in ABDO.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.530
So they are also up and running.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.150
We'll see where they go.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.230
The last one that I have
here is Connecticut.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.390
Although Connecticut's not a
platform, Connecticut is important

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.710
because they were given $2
million to build a platform,

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.200
or possibly to support a platform.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.890
So there's a really
good story behind this.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.500
I don't have time to give you,
but LJ has an excellent story

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.800
about how this all worked.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.210
And you would all smile at
how the state process works.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.040
But they are now looking, and
they are intimately involved

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.340
in the LEAP project.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.450
So we'll probably see them
come out with something.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.610
The last big thing I do want

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.110
to mention is the National Ebook
Platform and that's kind of LEAP,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.340
sorry, that's kind of what LEAP is.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:01.360
I just want to say here that we
are not sure what this is yet.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.630
This is still a continuing
discussion of what this might be

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.700 position:56%
but the idea is it might be nice to
have a single place run by libraries

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.790
or run by a non-profit that
could bring down costs.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:16.080
It could reflect the values that
we have when it comes to licensing

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.610
and how we deal with ebooks.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.780
So we're looking forward to
seeing where this one goes.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.980
And I want to end this just by
saying that those of who are as old

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.290
as I do and you remember going from
manual card catalogs to computers,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.790
and those who remember
internet coming

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.150 position:56%
and you remember CDs going out,
this is another transition we're in.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.680 position:56%
And as frustrating as it is it is
an exciting time to be part of this.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.470
So I just want to leave
you with that.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.090
All of us who work
in this ebooks space,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.320
and we hope that you
guys will join us,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.010
we're all very excited
about what's coming.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.590
There's a lot of different
projects out there

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.510
and they are doing a
lot of different things.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.980
And who knows where
it's going to end up.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.120
But it's a great time
to be involved.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.530
And with that I'll let,
let's see, is it your turn?

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.510
It's all yours.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:06.590

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Greg Pronevitz: Thanks Christine.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.980
Can you hear me in the back there?

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.350
Okay. I can't really
see if [inaudible].

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.250
I'm Greg Pronevitz,
Executive Director

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.660 position:56%
of the Massachusetts Library System.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.880
And I'm here to talk about
a survey that I distributed

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.520
but it was developed in
collaboration with Michelle

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.210
from DPLA, Valerie Horton from
Minitex, and Veronda Pitchford

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:36.880 position:56%
from Rails where we're gearing up
to do a presentation at ALA Orlando.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.990
And this is sort of the preliminary
look at our survey results.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.010
I presented results
of an earlier survey

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.380
at a Minitex webinar last year.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.970 position:56%
And if anyone's interested in seeing
that my email address is up here.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:19:01.550
I'd be happy to send
you the link for that.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.360
So first of all we had 35
respondents to the survey.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.270
And I only have 10 minutes
to talk about them today

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.850
so it won't be comprehensive.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:16.420
But if you have a consortial ebook
platform or program that you would

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.300
like to be included in future
surveys please get in touch with me

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.410
and we'll get you a survey.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.710
In our survey of the
35 respondents four

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.750
of them had either national
or multi-state reach.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:39.260
Twenty of them were statewide
programs of one way, shape or form.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.110
And 11 of them were
regional programs.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.710
This map, I decided to put
in a political statement.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:52.740
What I see here is both
conventions become contested,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.270
Trump and Bernie switch
sides, and here's what we get.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:06.560
But really this is the red states
are statewide ebook projects

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.570
that are not OverDrive.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.350
The blue states are statewide
ebook projects that are OverDrive.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:19.210
And statewide is taken very
loosely, 90% availability.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.860
The black states I don't
believe have statewide projects

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.950
or did not respond to my surveys.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.590
Missouri and Virginia both have
multiple statewide projects.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:38.390
Here's what the 2014 survey
and the 2015 survey look like.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.620
The one on the right is
the newer one with more red

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:50.660
and I added one blue in
Ohio that I learned about.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:56.590
Of these consortia some of
them gave enough demographics

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.490
that I could talk about their
primary focus either public,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.440
academic or multi-type.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.330
None of them were primarily
K-12 or primarily special.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:14.480
The participating libraries were
chiefly K through 12 with well

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.610
over 2,500, public with about
2,500, academic in the 500 range.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.650
This is a total aggregate
not any one.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.970
Total number of libraries
participating is over 5,700.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.660
The tiny number of 13 special

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.950
or other libraries often
included a state library.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.810
The population served
reported by those

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:46.110
who reported populations served
total 58 million population.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.620
So these consortial ebook projects
really have a lot of reach.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:58.960
I did a little scattergram
of when these projects began

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.880
and of those reported you can
see they're really bunched

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.340
up around 2011 through 2013
there were a lot started.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.030
And one started this year.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.430
So congratulations.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:19.970
We asked our colleagues about
publisher agreements and three

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.840
of the projects talked
about having more

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.170
than 100 publisher agreements each.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.870
Amigos, [inaudible] and Techshare.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:35.570
And those libraries and others
that were interested in it all felt

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.970
that the trend of working directly
with publishers was on the rise.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.900
We asked folks about which
aggregators they're using.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.090
OverDrive was the big one.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.890
And this survey certainly didn't
include every single OverDrive

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.630
consortium out there by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:09.420
So the local OverDrive users will
probably grow way beyond this once

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.530
we get a wider reach
with the survey.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:17.010
EBSCO came in second in this case.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.180
Netlibrary was mentioned
specifically in a couple of cases.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.480
Baker and Taylor were next.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:30.160
BiblioBoard, Bibliotheca or 3M, EBL
and TotalBoox all came in with two

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.280
And then there were six others
that were just a sprinkling of this

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.070
that and the other thing.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.460
We asked respondents about
licensing uniqueness,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.170
and this was their own opinion
about what was unique about things.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.800
And one of the things that
we noticed in our own program

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.020
in Massachusetts, we have a
Baker and Taylor agreement

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.180
with statewide access,
and we found that Baker

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:04.300 position:56%
and Taylor really helped us open
the door to some Big Five publishers

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.480
that weren't available
when we started.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.650
Unlimited use of recorded books

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:15.180
in BiblioBoard were other
interesting features.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.760
We asked folks about what kind
of unique content they had

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:28.130
and they listed languages or
literacy in some local content.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.220
Other data, of the
groups that reported

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.690
about 900,000 total unique
titles are available among them.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.800
I don't have the number of
how many actually reported

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.210
but it certainly wasn't 35.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:50.810 position:56%
And of the ones that reported annual
spending it totaled $10 million.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.770
And that, again, was just a
small percentage of respondents.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.070
Not everybody did that.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.390
We need to get a better
handle on that, too.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:04.740
The funding formulas that these
groups use to gather contributions

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.760
from either state funding,
grant funding,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.110
local funding really varied.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:16.880
There's no way to really report
a trend in that at this point.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.610
So I wanted to talk about some of
the conclusions from the comments

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.310
that people made during this.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.660
And one of the common themes
in "What was your vision

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.370
for your project" and the
theme common throughout all

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.890
of that was expanding access to
more content for more patrons.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:45.170
The challenges that people were
dealing with were meeting holds,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.620
the costs to meet the holds demand,
collection development and weeding

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:56.730 position:56%
to stay fresh, and expanding content
to new lending models and genres.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:04.970
The opportunities that I see as a
result of this survey and the work

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.740
that we've been doing
in Massachusetts

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.370
and the past DPLA Fests, and
many discussions that have gone

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:19.050
on over the past few years are
really embodied in the IMLS grants

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:23.800
that are out there now to support
a national digital platform.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.070
SimplyE that went to
New York public library

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.260
and a large number of partners.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.200
The LEAP grant that I'm sure
Micah will talk about in detail

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.380
that we're a partner on and
many of you are partners on.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.530
And the SimplyE for consortia
which was granted to Minitex

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.800
with a large number of partners
to develop an app for consortia

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.890
to provide much enhanced
discovery check out

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.430
and ease of reading, simplicity.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.260
So I think our opportunity now
is to really take advantage

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.830
of the economies of scale.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:06.330 position:56%
Of the few that reported $10 million
in spending it's got to be double

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.100
or triple that from
what I'm guessing.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:15.650
And if we can put our
buying power together,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:20.890
put our technical development
power together

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:25.640
that we can really go places with
discoverability and simplicity.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.510
And I thank you very much.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:38.220
[ Clapping ]

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.520
&gt;&gt; Micah May: Thank
you Greg and Christine.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.390
I feel like that's a perfect
set up for what's next for me.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.040
And I have the luxury of talking
mostly about specific problems

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.840
that I've been interested in,
projects I've been working on.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.160
And I guess before I dive into that
I guess let me thank these folks,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.020 position:56%
and very personally, because I think
what Christine said about building

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.620
and standing on the
shoulders of the projects

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.880
from before us is absolutely true.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.180
And it's very much
true of these projects

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.250
that I've helped to
conceive and drive.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.730
And I think specifically Greg

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.120
and Christine are two
of those shoulders.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.570
So I met most of the partners
and found out they work in ebooks

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.250
because of the call that Christine
would convene amongst people doing

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.550
ebook work.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.950
And so very literally I found
the other people doing this work

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.250
through her.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.370
And similarly Greg has been a
constant voice and advocate for me

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.700
to do this in a big-scaled
way that has I think been one

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.550
of the most powerful voices saying,
"We're approaching this right."

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.340
So I think that as we think
about what's next in this space,

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.010
in my mind it is time
for a transition.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.680 position:56%
And I think the projects that
Christine gave a really nice history

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.240
of were groundbreaking,
and they were powerful,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.210
and they proved that we can do it.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.310
And I think that was a
really important thing

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.630
for libraries to go do and prove.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.680
But I think they also proved
something else which is

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.060
that they demonstrated that this is
work that just screams for scale.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.750
Once you build these
capacities you should share them

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.640
because it's very easy to
reuse them and to share them.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.280 position:56%
And so I think that we are
benefitting from the lessons learned

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.730
from those projects in that the
projects that I'm going to talk

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.050
about have been conceived in a way

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.560
that beg-scaling from
the very beginning.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.420
And I said this at PLA
last week I'm going

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.720 position:56%
to start saying it every time I talk

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.660
about this I think we are talking
precisely about building components

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.870
of a national digital
platform for libraries.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.350
This is precisely that.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.800
And we're starting with ebooks.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.020
And I think this will show
that we have the capacity

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.830
to build capabilities that can
very quickly expand beyond ebooks.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.840 position:56%
And I would say even this year we're
likely to be able to handle things

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.930
like audio And it will very
quickly be clear that this is not

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.030
about ebooks, this is about
delivering library content

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.570
to patrons on library-owned
infrastructure.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.870
So this is in my mind a first foray

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.240
into building the national
digital platform for libraries.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.990
And I think that's how
we should conceive of it.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.740
So I want to give another shout out
as I start this to ReadersFirst.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.580
I think the work that our projects
have done would not have been

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.660
possible without the tremendously
successful advocacy work

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:08.080 position:56%
of ReadersFirst to open up ebook
content and provide interoperability

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.970
between those platforms
so that you can serve it

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.060
in a library-owned environment.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.680
So Michael Blackwell who's
in the fourth row here,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.720
you want to give a wave, has I
think been one of many leaders

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.270 position:56%
that have stepped up, and are really
helping to rejuvenate or double-down

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.580
on ReadersFirst, and the promise
of interoperability that it offers.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.950
And I think that both
Greg and Christine hit

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.830
on something very powerful which
is the idea that our, you know,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.360
while we are small institutions
in some cases, even NYPL compared

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.410
to the Goliaths of
the technology world

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.510
that we sometimes hold
ourselves up against,

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.410
collectively we can
be very powerful.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.780 position:56%
And I think ReadersFirst showed that
when really just a small percentage

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.430
of these distributors'
clients started saying,

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.060
"This is our content
and we should own it.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.970
And we want the ability to take it
out and take the [inaudible] out

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.680
and serve it to users
in an interoperable way

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.400
that supports a high
quality of service."

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.880
And that principled stand worked
incredibly quickly so that whereas

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.950
in 2012 these distributors
just refused to give us APIs,

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.830
we now have high-functioning APIs

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.480
out of all the major public
library ebook distributors.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.200
And I think the next
phase of this work,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.460
one of the most important things
we can do is build on that success

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.300
and apply that same principle
and approach to the rest

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.640
of the library world so that we
can extend some successes we've had

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.230
focused primarily around
public circulating libraries

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.430
to also benefit academic
and school libraries

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.800
and special libraries as well.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.480 position:56%
And I think that ReadersFirst offers
us a model and a vehicle, in part,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.070 position:56%
I think there are many organizations
that can and should contribute

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.660
to this to continue
to move that forward

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.710
and give libraries the
raw materials they need

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:48.270
in order to own their service.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.470
And that really starts
with interoperability.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.560
And so I think that's a critical
underpinning of all of this work.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.280
So with that I'm going to start by,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.240
I mean most of you know these
projects so I'm going to try

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.540
to move through it quickly.

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:04.590
As you probably know the grant in
2012 that was awarded by the IMLS

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.500
to create the Library Simplified
Project now named SimplyE

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.610
as the product that came out of
that has been I think, you know,

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:14.690
we've been working
hard for three years.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.700
My colleague and partner
in this, James English,

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.840
who's the Product Owner
for that is also here

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.040
and has built a beautiful
simple ebook reading experience

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.340
which has now been released.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.550
The first instance of that
is the Open Ebooks App

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.850
that Michelle mentioned.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.190
And that is also now available
to libraries to start using.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.760
And my hope is that this year
we'll see many deployments

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.630
across library worlds and this
will start to become very real.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:40.970
So that's ready in the sense that
the technology is up, it's working,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.370
it's proving to be very scalable
in Open Ebooks implementation.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:49.240
And it is designed to be open
source and is inexpensive

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.040 position:56%
as possible for libraries to deploy.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.290
And the first step in them
beginning to take ownership

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.010
of their relationship
with their patrons.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.960
And I guess sort of philosophically
I'd like to emphasize

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.290
that that's why we started here.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.730
It is the app through
which people read.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.480
It is the primary mechanism
for discovery.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.060
It's the touch point where
we interact with our patrons.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.550
And what we wanted to
start with is the assertion

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:15.730 position:56%
that these patrons are our patrons,
our customers and our relationships.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.460
And our vendors sometimes would
like to both sell us content

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.760
and own that relationship.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.500
And I think we have begun to reject
that and say, "If a library chooses

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.900
to provide these services through
a vendor-hosted offering then

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.720
that is fine if it's
the libraries choice."

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.700
But that cannot be our only option.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.010
We as libraries have
the right and the need

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.600
to have the interoperability that
supports us in serving libraries

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.690
in an environment we
own and we control.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.590
And I think SimplyE is the
vehicle for that right now.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.950
So it allows us both to merge
all of our ebook content

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.210
from multiple distributors into one
place so that we can rationalize it

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.030
and put it all in one place,
which in turns allows us

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:59.590
to free our procurement
decisions of the user experience

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.420
so that we can buy from whomever
gives us the best deal whenever we

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.050
want, and that will drive
competition in the market.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.910
And I think in some ways even
more exciting and powerful

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:12.450
than what SimplyE can do today is
what it's going to be able to do

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:16.090
to tomorrow, which is that because
we own it we can do what want

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.390
with it.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.130
If libraries want to come together
and say that it's really critical

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.720
to be able to ingest an API feed
about programs we're running

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.950
in our branches so that we can have
push marketing and there's a pop-up

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.880
in your ereader saying,
"We're running our program

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.530
in a branch five blocks from you.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.440
In half an hour please come join."

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.070
That's something that
we can fully build now

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.540
because this is our
experience and we own it.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.030
This is providing library service
through library-owned channels

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.650
which I think is really the
point of all of this work.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.930
So briefly, specifically, SimplyE
right now today can integrate

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.910
through middleware collections
that libraries own and host

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:57.690
on the three major
existing library vendors--

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.730
3M Bibliotheca, Baker and Taylor,
and OverDrive, the BiblioBoards

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.800
or Biblio [inaudible] API is
within weeks of being finished.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.550
And then that, too, this year
will be able to be integrated.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:13.920
And so we continue to have more
and more content that we can roll

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.230
into one better comprehensive
experience.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.450
And I'd like to go
back to Greg's slide

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:22.710
about the other ebook platforms.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.040 position:56%
I think we've really turned a corner
in the last three years in that

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.600 position:56%
as I talk to other distributors, so
EBSCO is a standout example of this,

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.180
they were second on Greg's slide,
they're many state libraries,

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.520
many consortia and many
individual libraries

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.020
who own ebook collections
through EBSCO.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.580
Now EBSCO does not
yet have a content API

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.100
so it would be impossible
to merge their content

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.670
into anything but their app.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.080 position:56%
But in conversations with them in
the last month it's been clear to me

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.370
that we're in a very
different place.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.780
So in 2012 these distributors
refused to build the APIs.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.970
And we were trying to beat
and bludgeon and negotiate,

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.300
and we still kind of failed.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.190
And then we started
ReadersFirst with others

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.030
that had the same experience,
the demand access to our content.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.330
We're not there anymore.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:08.030 position:56%
So if you talk to EBSCO they will
tell you that they're perfectly open

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.330
to building a content API.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.250
They plan to do it and they're
willing to build to our spec

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.050
so that we can make
these interoperable.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.630
And that is an example of
this ReadersFirst application

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.600
that is the underpinning to be
able to doing any of this work.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.800 position:56%
So I think one of the most important
thing that libraries are interested

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.840
in this and need to do is to
start talking to their vendors

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.510
and their providers about the
importance of interoperability.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.440 position:56%
And even if it's going to take your
library another year or two or three

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.640
to roll out these platforms you
can help right now by underscoring

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.320
with your budget to your vendors
the importance of interoperability,

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.900 position:56%
philosophically, fundamentally which
will do nothing but open options

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.430
for you as a library
and for other libraries.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.450
And to Greg's survey and the
point about the financial power

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.020
of libraries, even just
within the 20 partners named

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.510
on the LEAP grant there's 28
million in econtent spent.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.880
And so nationally we know that this
number is hundreds of millions.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.450
So it is a substantial market.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.660
And we are spending a lot of money.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.840
And so if we can speak
with a unified voice

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.870
about what we want we
can change that market.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.260
And we can start saying
to our vendors

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.550
that interoperability
is table steaks.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.030
It's not an extra, it
is what we require.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.960
When we buy content it's ours and
we want the ability and the right

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.480 position:56%
to serve it in the best environment
for our users, and in an environment

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.050
that lets us control that.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.770
So the next series in
this project was LEAP,

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.690 position:56%
the Library eContent Access Project,
which you've all heard a lot about.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:34.050
This is basically the effort to
go further and build a backend

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.100
to this system that would be
a library-owned marketplace,

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.630
a library-centric marketplace
and distributor.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.340
So this is the whole right-hand
side of the six-part stack

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.130
at the bottom of this page.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.320
I think this can be
built and up, hopefully,

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.300
in a pilot version
this calendar year.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.300
So we're going to try
to push very quickly.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.990
Again, building on Christine's
point, we're learning

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:56.200
from what others have done
that started before us.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.070
And so we're conceiving this right

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.180
out of the gate as
a national platform.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.110
Every library in the country will
be free and we will encourage them

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.550
over time to enter and buy
through this marketplace.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:10.340
We'll start with ebooks but we'll
quickly move to other things.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.670
We will continue to follow and
pursue the ReadersFirst principles

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.840
of loosely coupled architecture
that gives libraries options.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.420
I think this offers a clear
win-win for publishers

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.220
because to the degree it
can save libraries money

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.520
that would have otherwise gone

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.450
to the distributors we will
all reinvest it in content.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.580
And publishers recognize
that and I think are eager

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.640
for a library-owned
option in the marketplace.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.900
And we want this to be as
decentralized as possible.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.820
So we hope that as we work, and
this is already very much starting,

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.390
we will build close collaborations

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.350
and that this although
being incubated right now

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.630
in New York Public Library
I think we are already

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.220
in deep partner relationships
with a number of you.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.130
In fact, many of the
successful programs

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.780
on a regional basis we're
already in deep conversations

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.080
about bringing them into formal
governance roles and sharing

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.970 position:56%
with them in the incubation of LEAP.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.110
And that includes the
Montana Library Association

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.810
that Christine talked about,
Califa and also the Denver Library

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.150
that carried the Evoke
Project forward.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.280
So I think I'm out of time.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.580
So I guess I'll skip this

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.560
and let you ask questions
about it if you'd like.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.290
But I do think there's a
number of ways you can help.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:14.970
And I think you're probably
here because you have questions

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.270
or something to say about this.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.750
So we'd love to hear what
that is and have a discussion

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.010
about how we can all move
ebooks forward in libraries.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.810
Thank you.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:30.040
[ Clapping ]

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.440
&gt;&gt; Michelle Bickert:
Is this working?

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.850
Can you hear me?

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:38.570
Okay. Apparently this has
been on the entire time

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:44.470
so it's a good thing I didn't
say anything embarrassing.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.190
So we only have about five
minutes left in this session.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.090
As Micah mentioned if
any of you are coming

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.050
to the reception afterwards you
can find me or Micah or Rachel,

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.850 position:56%
we have several other colleagues who
are here who can talk to Open Ebooks

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.150
or LEAP in some capacity.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.450
We're happy to help
connect you with them.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.750
So we'll take a couple of
questions with our time left.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.450
That's how good we did.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.250
&gt;&gt; Micah May: There's got
to be a question out there.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.970
Or a comment?

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.270
Thank you.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.570
I guess if there's really not
a question I've been wanting

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.650
to ask one which is I mean
you've heard us making the case

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.680
and if anyone is feeling
brave and wants

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.250
to volunteer I would be curious

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.980
of audience members what most
excites you about the opportunity

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.400
to own our ebook and our
econtent delivery channels.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.280 position:56%
What do you see as the most powerful
and compelling opportunities?

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.660
Anyone feeling brave and want
to step up and volunteer?

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.220
Why did you come to this talk?

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.710
What gets you excited about this?

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.170
Yeah. Thanks Michael.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.730
&gt;&gt; Michael: [inaudible]
thank you very much.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.260
It's certainly very exciting.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.310
I think that libraries have
learned in the last ten years

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.000
that branding is essential
and this is going

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.020
to be an opportunity
for us to do that.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:11.580
Second thing is it has been
too difficult for library users

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:16.100
to get access to content in
many cases, ebook content,

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.130
and if we can simplify that
and provide a better model

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:23.240
for the publishers to work with us

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.430
that we will see continuing
exponential increases

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.810
in library ebooks.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:34.440
And libraries are not ebooks
only its econtent, and this is

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.060
yet another way to make ourselves
more relevant and present

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.500
in an increasingly digital world.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.320
&gt;&gt; Micah May: I think
that's exactly right.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.640
We need to own this
from every angle.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.520
If I'm not seeing other
hands I guess I'd love

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.820
to build on that publisher point.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.880
I think many of us have
talked about the need

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.880
to evolve relationships
with publishers.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.460
And I think again projects
like Amigos

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.470
and Califa have been broken
tremendous ground there in showing

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.310
that smaller publishers are
willing to work directly even

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.550
with regional library associations,

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.810
and make their books available
through those platforms.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.990
I think one of the goals
of the LEAP Project

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:13.460
which is completely supportive
of that and hopefully consistent

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.990
with it is to allow
libraries all over the country

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.130
and library organizations like
Califa and Amigos to onboard

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.240
that content to a national
marketplace.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.710
So that we can not only buy content
on better terms but we can help

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.530
to bring those relationships
into existence

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.230
so that we can offer a more diverse
and a broader range of content

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.940
And then the second piece of that
is about getting to better terms.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.800
And I think we have begun to
show that that's also possible.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.770
Examples like Open Ebooks whereby
presenting the library values-based

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.080
argument we were able to get
these incredible donations

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.410
that are now making this
content free to low income.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.200
But also other work of the ALA
Digital Content Working Group,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.340
and actually NYPL directly pushing

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.350
with libraries I think
multiple voices

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.000 position:56%
from the library community have
helped both to bring libraries back,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.560
or publishers back into
the library market in 2012,

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.620
and can now go further in working
directly with those publishers

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.970
to get us the better deals.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.770
And I think that's one of the
important points about why we need

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.030
to take ownership of this whole
pipeline, this whole channel

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.900
because it's pretty clear
to many of us I think

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.370
that the commercial distributors

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.080
from whom we buy books their
incentives are just not

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.380
well aligned.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.560
If we get a better price term,
if we get a better term in terms

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.030
of options they don't
make any more money.

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:26.970
And that just, in fact, costs
them money because now they have

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.870
to go redoing their systems
to accommodate that term.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.220
So we need an advocate that
is a sophisticated sort

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.450
of a business advocate to deal

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.330
with publishers especially
the biggest publishers.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.350
And I think we can also
benefit tremendously

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.670
from a distributed capacity
that allows libraries all

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:47.970
over the country to be not only a
provider of content but a channel

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.880
for making content discoverable
and available in libraries

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.570
by working directly with
publishers, and potentially

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:57.360
in the future even authors in
their region to bring that content

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.990
into libraries and to
make it discovered.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.290

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.080
&gt;&gt; Micah May: Okay.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.380

two minutes past.
