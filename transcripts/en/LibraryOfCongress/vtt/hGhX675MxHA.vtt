00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:15.570
&gt;&gt; Hi, there.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.870
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.660
&gt;&gt; I just think it's
pretty miraculous

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.970
that we haven't actually
started this program yet,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.300
but you all got quiet and it's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.220
like we're going
to start a program.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.110
Thank you for that cue.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.410
You guys are terrific.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.710
[ Applause ]

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.010
Yeah, go ahead, clap.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.310
[ Applause ]

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.610
All right.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.910
So welcome.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.210
My name is Lee Ann Potter.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.510
I direct Educational Outreach
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.810
And it is my absolute
pleasure to welcome you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.110
to this very special event.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.410
And I really do need to
make a very special shout

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.640
out to our students.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.940
It's cold out there.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.120
Thank you for braving the cold.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.580
I know that you know
that today you're here

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.280
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.220
But did you know that here

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.310
on Capitol Hill there are
actually three buildings

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.870
that make up the
Library of Congress?

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.080
Did you know that?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.380
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.680
&gt;&gt; So there's a building
behind us

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.360
and it's named for John Adams.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.920
And we have a building
next to us

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710
and it's named for
James Madison.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.350
And the building that you're

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.570
in right now is named
for Thomas Jefferson.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.660
We could say that these three
men were former U.S. presidents.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.460
We could say that these
men were attorneys.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.820
We could say that these
men were lawmakers,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.610
that they were farmers,
that they were gardeners,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.550
that they were fathers,
that they were husbands;

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.910
because as you know,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.940
an individual is
never just one thing.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.260
And I happen to know
that you guys go

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.370
to a school that's also
named for somebody.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.030
Who is that?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.330
&gt;&gt; Harriet Tubman.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.310
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.510
Duh. Yeah, you guys go to a
school named for Harriet Tubman,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.930
and Harriet Tubman is exactly

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.300
who our program is
all about today.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.110
It is my hope that by the end of
our program that what you know

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.520
about Harriet Tubman
is a little bit greater

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.010
than what you currently
know about Harriet Tubman.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.030
And so at the end
of our program,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.240
I'm going to see how much
you've been paying attention

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.570
and what you know about her.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.470
But let me talk to
you a little bit

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.340
about the run of our show today.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.420
In addition to me,
you're going to be hearing

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.960
from four additional speakers.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.450
And at the end of our
program, you'll be able

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.430
to ask questions
of our speakers.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.920
With us today, we have a
senator, we have an author,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.320
we have an illustrator, and we
have a descendent of Harriet;

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.470
and all four of them are
going to visit with you.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.010
It is my pleasure to introduce
you to our very first speaker.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.390
I'm introducing you to
Senator Chris Van Hollen.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.400
He happens to be one of
my senators [laughs].

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.970
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.340
Senator Van Hollen is
one of two senators

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.300
who represent the people
of the state of Maryland.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.460
But there's more.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.410
He is also a lawyer and
a husband and a fisherman

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.510
and a father -- and I had to
do some digging on this --

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.180
a bicyclist, and
a world traveler.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:42.510
Senator Van Hollen,
thank you for being here.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.810
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.720
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Lee Ann,
and thank you for that research.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.290
And I really want to
thank you most of all

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.580
for the work you do here at
the Library of Congress as part

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.290
of the educational program

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.010
and especially the
Young Readers program.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.640
And it's great to see all of you
come to the Library of Congress.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.770
And this is one of our
great national treasures,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.950
this library, and I'm really
pleased that you're putting

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.510
on programs like this
for our students.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.480
And welcome to all the students

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.840
from Harriet Tubman
Elementary School.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.260
So I represent the
state of Maryland

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.940
in the United States Senate.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.450
And my Senate office
is not far from here.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.760
And when you go into my
office, we have a wall

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.200
that has photographs
and portraits of people

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.830
from Maryland who have
changed America for the better

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.100
and changed the world
for the better.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.060
And when you go into our office,
you will see a portrait there

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.530
of Frederick Douglass.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.880
And the reason I mention
Frederick Douglass is because,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.510
like Harriet Tubman, he
was a great abolitionist --

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.190
fought to end slavery --
he was also from Maryland,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.750
and he was born 200 years ago
this coming Valentine's Day.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.070
So we're going to be
celebrating the 200th birthday

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.370
of Frederick Douglas.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.760
And the Library of Congress has
an exhibit devoted to the work

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.520
that Frederick Douglass did.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.430
So also on the wall of my office

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.800
with the great Marylanders
who've changed history is a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.910
photograph of Harriet Tubman.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.070
And it's a picture
of Harriet Tubman

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.510
when she was more elderly.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.230
And you may have heard that
the Library of Congress,

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.530
together with the African
American Museum on History

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.170
and Culture, recently
came upon a new portrait

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.020
of Harriet Tubman
when she's younger.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.840
And I'm looking forward
to having both portraits

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.270
of Harriet Tubman on
our wall as you come

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.160
into our Maryland office.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.630
And I'm really pleased to
be here with two individuals

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.280
who have written a wonderful
book about Harriet Tubman.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.500
You'll be hearing
from them in a bit.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.890
But to Lesa Cline-Ransome,
the author, and her husband,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.850
the illustrator -- a great
husband and wife team --

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.710
Lesa Cline and James Ransom,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.770
who've written the book you're
going to be talking about today,

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.060
and were very fortunate
to have them with us.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.410
And to Ms. Tina Wyatt,
great to have a descendent

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.780
of Harriet Tubman with
us today and, I can see,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.210
keeping the spirit alive.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.850
And the reason it's so
important to gather and to talk

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
about Harriet Tubman is
because she did change the world

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.660
for the better.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.590
And we should learn
that history,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.000
and we should also learn
from her bravery and courage

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.750
as we address some of the
challenges we face today.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.690
If you haven't been to
Maryland's Eastern shore

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.620
in Dorchester County,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.330
you'll find the birthplace
of Harriet Tubman.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.870
She was born into slavery.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.450
And when she was very
young, she wasn't allowed

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.190
to learn to read and write.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.390
But she knew she should be free.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.270
She knew that all
people should be free.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.040
And she believed in God and
said that the North Star

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.670
that we can see on clear nights,
the North Star was the sign

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.470
to take her to freedom.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.410
And so she escaped and
won her own freedom.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.040
But she realized she
had an obligation

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.050
to help others, too, right?

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.760
And so she then returned
often as part

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.620
of the Underground Railroad.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.300
And she's known as one
of the great conductors

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.400
of the Underground Railroad
where she brought more

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.830
than 70 others who had been
held in slavery to freedom.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.040
She was also a nurse,
she was also a spy,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040
and it's really important

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.260
that we celebrate her
many, many achievements.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.040
And that's what this book does.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.940
And I do want to say to
all of you who've not been

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.120
out to Maryland's Eastern
shore, we invite you to do that.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.940
There's a national historic
park dedicated to Harriet Tubman

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:13.900
and many other memorials to
her work in Dorchester County

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.490
and around Maryland, including
the scenic Underground Railroad

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.780
route that you can
take in Maryland.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.570
So thank you all so
much for doing this.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.370
And it is wonderful to have
this team who wrote the book,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.220
and you're going to hear

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.940
from again the descendent
of Harriet Tubman.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.300
But I'm grateful to have
the chance to be here just

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.930
to say thank you to the Library
of Congress, thank all of you

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.700
as we keep alive the work of
Harriet Tubman and recognize

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.420
that her bravery and courage
helped change the world,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.460
and you can all help
change the world

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.190
for the better going forward.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.510
So thank you all very much.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.810
And --

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.110
[ Applause ]

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:02.250
-- unfortunately, I'm
going to have to run.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.550
We're debating the budget.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.830
If you sort of turn on
your cable news station,

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.810
we're about to vote
on the budget.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.200
We're putting the final touches
on it, which is good for lots

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.920
of reasons including the fact
that that contains the funding

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.350
to help the Library of
Congress and programs like this.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.490
So thank all of you very much.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.790
[ Applause ]

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.290
&gt;&gt; So Lesa and James,
why don't you come on up?

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.590
[ Applause ]

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.570
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.790
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.580
&gt;&gt; It is a pleasure,
pleasure, pleasure to be here.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.600
We always enjoy visiting
this area,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.430
enjoy visiting Washington,
D.C., and Maryland.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.640
So it's especially nice to
see all these young faces

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.500
and to be joined by Mrs.
Wyatt and everyone here

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.800
at the Library of Congress.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.970
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's truly
an honor to be here.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.030
We just enjoy coming to
the Capital so often.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.010
And it's a pleasure to have
all of you here today to talk

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.310
about this book that we did
that we are so excited about.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:14.130
It's a wonderful tale -- story
about a person who is a symbol

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:21.350
for all of us to fight
for freedom for everyone

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.560
so everyone has the opportunity

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.410
to have the type of
life they desire.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.290
So it was really a pleasure
working on this book.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.290
The idea came to me when I was

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.920
on a flight probably
coming here.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.480
And I had a copy of Harriet
Tubman on me and I wanted

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.780
to do something about her.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.990
Because she's such
a wonderful person,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.850
I think there can't be enough
books about someone like her

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.700
for kids to read and be
inspired by her story.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.740
So as I was reading
through this book,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.080
the idea about telling her story

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.140
from her being an
elderly person,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.830
going back to when she was young
would be maybe a different way

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.130
of telling the story.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.670
But also to highlight
all the different things

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.550
that Harriet did.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.990
Because we all know she
freed herself by escaping

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.740
and then came back and
helped others escape,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.370
but she also did more than that.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.720
So I wanted to highlight
those things.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.570
I turned to my wife and I said,
how about writing this story?

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.260
And she said no [laughs].

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.040
I said, but no, come on, it
could be such a great story.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.940
How about if we do it this
way, this way, this way?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.650
She said no [laughs].

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.350
So I said, OK, I'm
going to write it.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.070
So I started making some notes,
and I showed her my pitiful,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.860
poor notes, and she says, I
think you have something here,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.160
but I'm going to write it.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.540
And that's why we have the
book we have today [laughs].

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.050
&gt;&gt; So although James and I
have been working together

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.790
for many years, we've been
married for many more,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.830
one of the things that's most
interesting to people is,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.290
you know, how we collaborate.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.770
And so generally we
collaborate by brainstorming

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.250
and James throwing out
tons and tons of ideas,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.080
and generally I tell him that
those ideas are not that great.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.470
So it wasn't that I didn't want
to write the story of Harriet,

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.970
it's just that Harriet
has been a heroine

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.970
of mine since I was your age.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.140
She was for me the face
of courage and strength,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.230
and I felt almost overwhelmed
by the idea of writing

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.880
about your idol, your hero.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.380
And I felt that I didn't
know if I could really write

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.190
about her story, or
the idea of writing

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.200
about her seemed
so overwhelming.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.320
But when James came
to me with this idea

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.150
and I saw the direction that
he was going in, I realized,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.990
OK, let's give it a shot.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.000
We're going to start now
with our presentation,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.550
and we're going to kind of
take you through the process.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.340
And we're going to show you a
little bit about our beginnings

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.810
and what inspired us and
share with you a little bit

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.420
about before she was Harriet.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.890
&gt;&gt; It's going to show up
at the screen, I believe?

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we're
going to do forward.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.950
This [inaudible].

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.180
&gt;&gt; I think it has
to show up first.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Here we go.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.780
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.300
&gt;&gt; OK. Here we go.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.760
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.290
&gt;&gt; So we'll start
at the beginning.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.640
So I am from Massachusetts.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.050
I'm from a town right outside of
Boston, Malden, Massachusetts.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:24.260
And I grew up there with my
parents, a mother, and --

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.010
here I am in kindergarten.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.310
&gt;&gt; Aw.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.800
&gt;&gt; I love to show this picture
because it was really --

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.130
it's the last great picture
of myself that I have.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.880
Like, this is the
only picture I have

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.290
that I actually really like.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.060
So I grew up there
with my parents.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:42.830
And I grew up with
my mother, my father,

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.600
an older brother and sister.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.680
But this is where I
spent most of my time was

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.380
at the Malden Public
Library; and it was there

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.010
that I discovered
a love of books.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.910
My mother was really passionate
about reading and writing,

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.970
and she shared with
me her love of books.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.180
We used to go every weekend,
we'd take out stacks of books.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.730
And I would bring them home,

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.400
and we would just spend
our weekends reading.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.240
And it was there that I
discovered stories about girls

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.970
and about adventure and life
beyond Malden, Massachusetts.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.240
I love the stories about
Laura Ingalls Wilder

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.510
and Pippi Longstocking and Scout
Finch and all these stories

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.130
about these amazing women.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:31.140
As I got older, I discovered
other stories about women

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.010
who were strong and
courageous and tough,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.650
and those are the
stories I really loved,

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.170
stories about Sojourner Truth

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.720
and Eleanor Roosevelt
and all these women.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.300
And I've always been drawn
to stories about women.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.140
&gt;&gt; I was born in North Carolina

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.710
in a small little town
called Rich Square,

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.710
just across the Virginia border.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.610
In this little town
with two traffic lights,

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.010
I discovered my passion for
drawing and making images.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.510
This is me as a kid.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.810
&gt;&gt; Aw.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you [laughs].

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.410
&gt;&gt; So cute, so cute.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.710
&gt;&gt; Also, from this
very small town,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.010
we have a writer
named Sheila Moses

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.340
who has written books
for older kids.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.520
And we were so proud
to have a writer

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.800
and an illustrator
from this small town.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.990
One day Sheila and I are
going to do a book together.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.680
The story The Ledgend
of Buddy Bush is a story

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.140
that I heard growing up
as a child and is one

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.000
of her most popular books.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.290
So it was in that --
right in front of that --

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.310
that car's parked right in front
of the building I was born in.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.480
And growing up in a small
town, there were not a lot

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.270
of opportunities for someone
like myself who liked art

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.240
since the third grade and
wanted to be an artist.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.750
There was no art taught
in the schools I attended,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.250
there were no museums to go into
see art, there were no artists

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.000
to bring me to his
or her studio.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.130
So my first art teachers
came from that pharmacy next

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.210
to where I was born, and
they were comic books.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.230
Like so many kids, images
they see on television,

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.720
the cartoons they see on
television, comic books are some

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.950
of the first art forms we came
in contact with at that time.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.680
So I would copy these images and
make up stories of my friends

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.160
and I doing different things.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.400
My own little comment books
I would make as a kid.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.870
I also discovered Mad Magazine.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.860
And this was also a
great inspiration.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.740
Then I moved to New Jersey.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.920
I moved to a suburb of New
York City, and this is me

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.550
as a high school student.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.780
I went to Bergenfield High
School, and it was just my luck

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.590
that this school had
an amazing art program.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.720
I had someplace where I could
actually talk to teachers

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.450
and take classes on
art for the first time

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.510
after my freshman
year in high school.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.720
&gt;&gt; So James and I do
lots and lots of books,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.110
we do a lot of picture
book biographies.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.540
And one of the reasons
we're drawn to stories

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.910
of African-Americans
and their lives is

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.740
because when I was growing
up or when I was your age,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.360
I grew up at a time when there
weren't that many stories

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.590
that I could read about
African-American heroes.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.080
And it's really nice to
kind of write stories

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.310
about these unknown heroes who
went on to live amazing lives

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.800
and do amazing things.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.290
And often these stories
were ones

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.320
that I didn't read much about.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.950
And these were people
who weren't names

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.710
that were necessarily known;
but they came from very little,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.110
but they went on to do amazing
things and change the world

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.780
in ways that were big and small.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.980
And stories like Satchel Paige;
Major Taylor, Champion Cyclist;

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.080
and Young Pele, Soccer's
First Star.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.300
Before There Was Mozart,
the story of a young slave

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.760
who was born to a mother
who was a slave and a father

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.960
who was an owner who
inspired the work of Mozart.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.500
This is a story that
I'd never heard before.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.160
Just a Lucky So and So: The
Story of Louis Armstrong,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.940
who grew up poor but who
felt rich beyond means

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.900
because he grew up in a
community surrounded with love

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.010
and music and culture.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:20.090
My Story, My Dance, the
story of Robert Battle.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.720
And Words Set Me Free, which was
a story of Frederick Douglass.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.510
And this was a story
that really inspired me

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:32.240
because as a person who's always
loved reading and education,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.670
I really was motivated by
a story that was inspired

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.190
by a slave who wasn't
allowed to learn to read.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.150
It was illegal for
slaves to learn to read,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.540
but Frederick Douglass
equated reading

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.710
and education with freedom.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.260
Though he was an enslaved
person, he wanted the freedom

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.080
of an education, and he
sought that education out.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.830
And the words that he
discovered, he felt,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.150
allowed him a certain
level of freedom.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.320
And it was my research of
Frederick Douglass that led me

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.910
to many other stories.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.810
Go back a little bit.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.790
While I was researching the
story of Frederick Douglass,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.080
I discovered that after he
escaped slavery he found work

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.030
in New Bedford at a
whaling ship yard,

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.170
and I also discovered
the stories

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.960
about a whaling ship captain,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.890
the first African-American
whaling ship captain.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.910
And I started thinking about
perhaps writing a story

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.460
about the whaling industry
and about how we once used

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.850
to hunt whales but now
we go whale watching.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.260
And I thought, imagine writing
a story about whale watching

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.480
versus whaling, and I thought

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.410
about bringing those
two stories together.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.610
And that's what I did in
the book Whale Trails,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.970
where I write the story about
a young girl and her father

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.970
who own a whale watching boat.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.420
And I also in that book talk
about how 200 years ago,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:07.340
300 years ago, many escaped
slaves worked on whaling boats.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.400
And that book was Whale
Trails, Before and Now.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.760
And in my research of
Frederick Douglass,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.900
I discovered how many
enslaved peoples --

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.560
people also after slavery
-- sought out an education.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.710
And this is a piece of history
that I didn't know about.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.910
And often, I think this
is a piece of history

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.200
that was missing
that sometimes we --

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.350
African-Americans
were led to believe

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.040
that education wasn't important
to us, and yet research

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.120
and history shows
us that it was.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.310
This is something that we have
always sought out as a people.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:46.650
And so this is something I feel
is important for kids to read

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.210
about to put in books.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.110
So I wanted to use this in
many of the books that James

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.410
and I create together.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.290
And so in my research, I
discovered all these stories

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.900
about how many people
sought out an education.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.490
Even in the face of obstacles
and adversity, and that led

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.240
to the book Freedom School about
a brother and a sister who went

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.210
to the first colored
school in their community,

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.200
which was 10 miles from their
home in the book Freedom School.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.610
And the book Light
in the Darkness,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.240
a story about how
slaves learned in secret,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.540
and how these slaves
snuck out late at night

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.880
after working a full day in
the fields and how a girl Rosa

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.910
and her mom went out
late at night and learned

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.210
to read from other slaves.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:41.690
And of course, they
risked injury,

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.340
they risked death,
all to learn to read.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:48.800
And of course, no story would
be complete without the story

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.540
of Harriet Tubman, a
hero of both of ours.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.750
And we felt that her story
needed to be told, but it needed

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.550
to be told in a new
way, in a fresh way,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.000
in a way that kids could
understand and respond to very,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.230
very differently and
tell them something new

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.530
about Harriet Tubman.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.710
And so Before She Was Harriet,
we found new information

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.010
that we wanted to share.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.540
And I'm going to read
to you a little bit now

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.080
from Before She Was Harriet.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:21.030
"Here, she sits an old
woman tired and worn,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.770
her legs stiff, her back achy.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.790
But before wrinkles
formed and her eyes failed,

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.030
before she reached her twilight
years, she could walk for miles

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:36.490
and see clearly under a
sky lit only with stars.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.140
Before she was an old
woman, she was a suffragist,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.700
a voice for women who
had none: in marriages,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.740
in courts, in voting booths.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.540
Before her voice became soft and
raspy, it was loud and angry,

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.690
rising above injustice.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.980
Before she was a suffragist,
she was General Tubman,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.880
rising out of the fog armed
with courage, strong in the face

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.540
of rebels and planters
and overseers,

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.050
as they watch fields
burn and bridges fall.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:08.740
And 700 slaves stop chopping
and start running to a woman

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.350
who ferried them to freedom
Combahee River turned

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.430
River Jordan.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.860
Before she was General
Tubman, she was a union spy,

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.630
carrying secrets
across battlefields

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.580
to soldiers fighting
in the Civil War

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.880
for President Lincoln
to end slavery.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.120
Before she was a Union spy, she
was a nurse caring for those hit

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.670
with bullets and hatred
and fear, tending to them

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:40.440
with bandages and words and the
bloodied dirt of southern soil.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.690
Before she was a nurse, she was
Aunt Harriet, daughter of Ben

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.830
and Rit, who helped her
parents flee their master

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.720
and find their way through
woods and streams to the safety

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.680
of Canada and a new
home in North.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.280
Before she was Aunt
Harriet, she was Moses,

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.560
a conductor on Underground
Railroad with no trains

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.580
and no tracks, just passengers
traveling to freedom up north,

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.400
through swamps, past slave
catchers, across rivers,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.420
under the cover of night,
seeking the Promised Land

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:19.550
for her people led by dreams and
God and faith; a wisp of a woman

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.460
with the courage of a lion.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.090
Before she was Moses,
she was Minty of Maryland

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.340
of one slave owner and
then others who worked her,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:34.330
punished her with lashes, broke
her back, but not her spirit.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.090
Before she was Minty, she
was Araminta, a young girl,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:43.010
taught by her father to read the
woods and the stars at night.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.300
Readying for the day, she'd
leave behind slavery along

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.630
with her name, and pick
a new one: Harriet.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.030
And remember her days as a
suffragist, as a general,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.530
as a spy, as a nurse, as
Aunt Harriet, as Moses,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.420
as a conductor, as
Minty, as Araminta,

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.810
who dreamed of living long
enough to one day be old, stiff,

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.590
and achy, tired, and worn,
and wrinkled, and free."

that we were going to hear from
a senator and from an author

00:31:46.350 --> 00:32:05.380
and from an illustrator, and
then I said a descendent.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:12.360
Can one of you raise your hand

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:22.810
and tell me what
a descendant is?

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.520
Yeah?

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:36.850
&gt;&gt; A person from a family.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.700
&gt;&gt; A person from a family.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.000
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.740
&gt;&gt; Say that one more time.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:54.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So when we talk about
someone being a descendent,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:59.010
we're talking about
someone being descended

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:03.060
from their ancestors, and
that's exactly why when I said

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.440
that we were going to have a
descendent of Harriet Tubman

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.170
with us, that's exactly
who Ms. Wyatt is.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.470
All right.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:11.820
I'm going to let you -- Tina,
you get started talking,

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.120
and if you want me
to sit with you

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.550
and ask questions,
I can do that, too.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.890
&gt;&gt; I'll just start.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:24.770
Thank you for coming, and
thank you for having me here.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:30.110
You know, when I look around
and I see all these children

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:34.670
and I think about Aunt
Harriet and who she was

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:40.190
and what she did, the biggest
thing that I can tell you

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:46.010
that is relevant to everyone
is that she was just like you

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.900
and she was just like me.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.700
She had hardships,
she had trials;

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.300
not just slavery,
but even after.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.450
She had many obstacles
she had to overcome.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:04.660
And while doing that,
she had fear one time.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.970
And that was when
she first escaped

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:11.750
at the age of 27 in 1849.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.410
She and her brothers set
out -- two of them --

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.960
to escape, and they stayed out
for about two or three weeks

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.200
and then they returned
because --

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.610
mostly because of the fear

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.650
of her brothers and
not her as much.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.790
But as soon as they got
back, she set out again.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:36.330
And the reason why she set out
again is because when she was

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:44.700
around 12 years old, an overseer
from another plantation was

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.200
after another enslaved person
and wanted her to stop them

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.340
when she came into the store.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.100
And she wouldn't, but
she got in the way.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.480
And he threw a 2-pound
weight, iron weight,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.650
and hit her in the head.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:07.360
So it fractured or broke her
skull, and it drove in the cloth

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.270
that she had around her
head into her skull.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.470
After that, she had
seizures, or what --

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.950
you know, sleeping sickness.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:21.290
And that would happen
anytime, anywhere.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.070
But it was during that
time that God spoke

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.540
to her, showed her visions.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.860
Now we all have a
purpose in life.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.800
God brings us here for a reason.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.740
It might be something that we
have to do that's very small,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.030
or it might be something that's
very large, but it all has

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.360
to do with each other.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:52.040
And so when she started having
those visions, she said, not me,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.670
not me, you know, I
don't want to do this.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:59.200
And so He said, no, I want you
Harriet, I want you to do this.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.240
So she said OK and she
was obedient and she acted

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.520
and she went and she did
what He instructed her to do.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.860
So she never did this, never
made a move without Him,

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.220
without the instructions
and guidance of the Spirit.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.320
So when she did all
the things that she did

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:30.960
from the time she left and came
back 13 times into the land

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:38.250
where she could be enslaved
again to get her family,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:46.200
to get her friends, you
know, she didn't stop there.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.520
She continued on.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.140
And the reason why -- and
this is what I really want

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:57.680
to impress upon you children
-- is that it's about love,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.160
and she embodied that love.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:07.700
She embodied that
selflessness and what the word

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.480
of God says, love your neighbor.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.820
And that is exactly what
she did throughout her life,

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.720
sometimes to her own detriment

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.830
to where people would
take advantage of her.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:26.780
But she went on -- everywhere
she went, she was home;

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.760
everywhere she went, she made a
home for those who had no home;

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.860
for people who had no family,
she became their family.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.590
And she would take her own
money and she would see

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.810
to whatever need they had.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:49.110
When she came here to
Washington from getting orders

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.080
to be commissioned
in the military --

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.400
and she was commissioned.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.840
It is documented.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.010
She was commissioned to be
in the military and serve

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:05.440
in the Civil War, as
James and Lee had told you

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.150
about as a scout,
a spy, a nurse.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.790
But she was the first
woman, black or white,

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:19.170
to lead a military raid, and
she did it on the Combahee River

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:27.890
in South Carolina where she
brought up over 700 slaves.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.960
She freed them.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.840
And then after that --
see, the job wasn't done.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.610
For her, the job was not done.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.760
Because what are they
going to do after that?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.000
How will they earn a living?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.640
How will they take
care of themselves?

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.290
So what she did was she took her
own money, $200 that she had --

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:56.210
all that she had -- and
set up a wash house.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.690
She set up a kitchen.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:04.580
And she taught them, you
have skills; you have skills,

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:11.180
and you have a passion;
use it to earn a living.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.000
She showed them how to market
those things that they did,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.150
who to give it to,
who to sell it to.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.890
She did all of that.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:30.790
So I want you to understand
that she had many obstacles.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.600
You know, the term
courageous, heroic,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:42.620
all those adjectives
are said about her.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.340
But like I said, she was
just like you and me.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.800
She had to overcome
many obstacles,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.800
and she did not let
anything stop her.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.610
She didn't let it get her down.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.290
One time she walked out into
a water that she did not know.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:04.800
Most of the time, she knew
the waterways because that's

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.270
where she was raised
in Maryland,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.090
and she knew the
waterways and the land,

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.980
and she worked alongside
her father

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.010
who did -- who was a timberman.

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:23.580
He, you know, brought down the
trees and things like that,

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.160
and she was there with him.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:31.460
So she knew the land, and she
talked to watermen who were free

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.090
that came down through Maryland.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.840
And there, she learned about
what was going on in other parts

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.620
of the world other
than where she was.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.220
So she took all this in.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.500
Everything that she went through
became a lesson and a guide

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.110
for her as she went on her way.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:59.370
But as she kept doing this and
going further and going further

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:03.870
and going further, she
never forgot about the needs

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:08.700
of others; that was always
first and foremost in her mind.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.490
And after the Civil War,
she went back to her home.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.720
And the one reason why --

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.100
she had to make a decision
during the Civil War.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.650
She had to make a decision
during the Civil War,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.910
and that was to either stay
or go back to take care

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:28.200
of her parents who were in need.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.600
And that's where she
fought for her pension.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.470
She did not receive her
pension until many years later,

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.490
and that was as a nurse.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.850
She got it for her
husband first.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:42.320
But what did she do back
on her farm in Auburn?

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.260
Again, the needs of others.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.170
She set up a home for the aged,
for the sick, for the indigent.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.780
It was always first and
foremost on her mind.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.960
And she did this all
through God showing her what

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.320
to do, and she obeyed.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.620

&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Yasneve
[phonetic] and I have

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.560
to ask you a question is,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:27.080
how old was Harriet Tubman
when she was a nurse?

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.010
&gt;&gt; How old was she?

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.980
&gt;&gt; She was probably
in her 40's --

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.580
&gt;&gt; -- around that time.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.920
&gt;&gt; They didn't have birth
certificates at that time, so --

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.210
especially for slaves,
it wasn't really marked

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.580
when they were born, so
it's hard to tell exactly --

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.180
&gt;&gt; -- how old she was.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.180
&gt;&gt; But she was 27
when she escaped.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.690
We know that she
was born in 1822,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:53.890
but we don't know the date.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.430
And so it was 1849,
so you kind of got

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.250
to do the math a little bit.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:08.790
So she was, like, in her
40's, somewhere around there.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.090

&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is
Violet [assumed spelling].

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.940
Did some white people like her?

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.240
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.440
&gt;&gt; Do you want to say --

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.190
&gt;&gt; Yes. I mean, I'm sure that
some white people liked her,

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:41.930
but I'm also sure that some
white people didn't like her.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:47.740
You know, what she was doing
was essentially what --

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.250
in their minds, they saw her
as stealing their property.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:56.290
But what they were doing was
stealing away their own freedom.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.960
So I think that there
might have been a conflict

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.410
that they saw that
was happening.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.280
So, yeah, I'm sure that --

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.190
but there were white people
who were also fighting

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.710
for the freedom

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:10.290
of African-Americans
and there were --

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.590
&gt;&gt; In Newark.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.600
&gt;&gt; -- white soldiers
who were fighting, also.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.970
So yes, I'm sure
there were both.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.500
&gt;&gt; And, you know, a part

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.170
of her network was called
the Underground Railroad.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.680
And that was a network
of people, not trains,

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.000
but a network of people that
were in secret that helped her.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.840
And a lot of them were
white that helped her.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.050
So you had to know where to
go, and -- and Thomas Garrett,

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.350
which was really a good
friend of hers, you know,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.420
when she would come
and she'd want money.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.770
And one time he told her, he
said, well, if you're coming

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.350
for somebody else, I'm not going
to give it to you, Harriet.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.490
But she told him, she said,
well, you're going to give it

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.820
to me because it is
for somebody else.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.120
So, yeah.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:07.310
&gt;&gt; I think we have a question
on this side in purple.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.010
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is
Mykia [phonetic].

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:13.600
Why do you like to draw?

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.840
&gt;&gt; Oh. There's something
magical about it.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.460
When I was very young, I
wanted to be a magician.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.050
But, you know, you have
a white piece of paper

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.690
and you have something -- a
drawing instrument in your hand,

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:31.150
and just by passing that drawing
instrument across the paper,

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:36.070
you create shapes and images
that people appreciate.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:38.880
And that's one of the many
reasons why I love to draw

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.910
because you can make
something and you can see it,

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.510
what you made, almost instantly.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.430
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.520
&gt;&gt; OK. I see a couple
of hands going up.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.260
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Sarah
[assumed spelling].

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.160
How long did it take
you guys to make a book?

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.680
&gt;&gt; Well, it takes a long time
to make a book because you have

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.230
to do the research, and
then you do the writing

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.960
and then you revise it
and you revise it again.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.940
So generally for me,
it takes about --

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.750
let's say about six
months to write the book.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.250
And then it goes off
to the illustrator,

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.330
and then sometimes the
illustrator can take --

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Can I say --

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.390
&gt;&gt; The illustrator
would take about --

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:27.900
it takes me about a year to
illustrate a book, right?

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.950
It has to come from
Lesa, it comes to me,

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.250
and it takes about a year.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.670
&gt;&gt; And then it takes
about another --

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.970
&gt;&gt; Year.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.270
&gt;&gt; -- year or two
to print the book.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.550
So it takes a pretty
long time to make a book.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:38.910
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.210
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.510
Over here in the yellow.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:42.810
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Jairo
Torres [phonetic].

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:48.170
And when she was a slave, when
she tried to escape to houses,

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:50.350
she saw [inaudible]
to give her clues

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.700
that that was a safe house.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.920
A comment.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.870
&gt;&gt; OK. All right.

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.170
Go ahead.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.890
&gt;&gt; I didn't understand --

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.650
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Natasha
[assumed spelling].

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:07.570
And when are you guys
going to make a new book?

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.330
&gt;&gt; When are we going
to make a new book?

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:12.690
We're always making new books.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:19.040
We have a book coming out in May
about Venus and Serena Williams.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.810
I have a novel coming out,

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:31.060
and then we're always
working on new projects.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.690
&gt;&gt; Great question.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.860
&gt;&gt; How -- no, no, no.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.550
&gt;&gt; Are you sure?

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:42.560
&gt;&gt; It's all right.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.240
We'll come back.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.980
&gt;&gt; When Harriet Tubman slept,

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.200
did they hit her instantly
when she fell asleep?

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.500
&gt;&gt; When she did what?

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.800
&gt;&gt; When she fell asleep.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.100
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh?

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.400
&gt;&gt; Did they hit her?

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.700
&gt;&gt; Did they hit her?

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.000
&gt;&gt; To wake her up?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.300
&gt;&gt; To wake her up?

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.200
No. You know, everyone knew what
happened to her, so the people

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.820
around her would always
just say, well, you know,

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.540
there she is, she's
going off again.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.720
So they would wait
until she woke up.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.450
&gt;&gt; OK. Yeah.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.000
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is
Brian [assumed spelling].

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.780
My question is, how did
the illustrator become a

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.760
good drawer?

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.050
&gt;&gt; Lots of years of practicing,
which is a lot of fun

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:29.250
because I love drawing.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:32.720
So as a kid I drew a lot.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.270
High school.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.110
Then I went to college.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:39.070
I studied art in
college, illustration.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:43.070
And after I graduated, I
continued to take classes.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.710
I go to museums and
I look at art.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.400
I continue to practice and draw.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.640
If you like drawing,
it's a fun job

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.340
because you're basically doing
what you love all the time.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.010
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.310

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.110
I think you've -- nope,
maybe not [laughs].

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:00.410
Yes?

was the thing she got hit

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.360
with made out of?

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.660
&gt;&gt; Pardon me?

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.510
&gt;&gt; The thing that --
what was it made out of?

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:19.640
&gt;&gt; What was the thing
that she got hit out of --

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, iron.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.240
&gt;&gt; Iron.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.540
&gt;&gt; Iron, yeah.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.840
&gt;&gt; Very heavy.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.140
&gt;&gt; It was quite a blow, also.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:31.530
It really did change her
life, that blow to the head.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.830
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.130

[ Laughter ]

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.380
&gt;&gt; Actually, my --
I grew up with my --

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.750
I lived with my grandmother
for about 16 years,

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.280
and she really supported my art.

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.060
She always bought me supplies,

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.830
allowed me to buy
different supplies,

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:57.360
and she was my biggest
supporter.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.660
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.960
All right.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.520
Yeah, go ahead.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.940
&gt;&gt; My name is Samaya
[phonetic], and I want to know,

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.260
if Harriet Tubman
was alive today,

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.740
what advice would she give us?

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.040
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.340
[ Chuckling ]

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.640
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.940
[ Applause ]

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.240
&gt;&gt; Careful now.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.540
Be careful.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.840
[ Laughter ]

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.140
&gt;&gt; Well, what I think she
would do is tell you to --

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.440
&gt;&gt; Do well in school.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.670
&gt;&gt; I believe education
would probably be --

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:26.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.270
&gt;&gt; -- a very important thing.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:29.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it was
taken away from her.

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.170
&gt;&gt; She couldn't read,
she couldn't write.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.770
&gt;&gt; But I think she would
also tell you to stand

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.830
up for what you believe
and to love others

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.890
because that's what she did.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.490
&gt;&gt; Great questions.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:44.880
&gt;&gt; You know, a lot of things --
you know, one other thing I want

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.790
to say is that because
there's a lot of bullying going

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:51.470
on in schools today, and,
you know, of people saying,

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.970

to associate with other people.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.300
You know, she would
tell you to not do that.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.030
You know, to find something --
because there's always something

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.480
in everyone that you can find

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.080

there's something

that you can connect with.

in 1990, a long time ago.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:32.710
And your book was --

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:35.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Our first book
together was published in 2000.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.370
&gt;&gt; Very nice.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:39.670
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:40.970
Good, guys.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.270
[ Applause ]

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:48.930
So I want to thank you
all for your questions.

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:52.840
I also want to thank
you for your listening

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.140
because I was really good.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:57.110
It's hard to sit still for
this long and be as attentive

00:52:57.110 --> 00:52:59.270
as you all have been,
so thank you for that.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.440
I want to show you
two little pictures

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.640
up on these screens here.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.920
When Senator Van Hollen was
talking with you, he mentioned

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.320
that the Library of Congress
and the national Museum

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.680
of African American History

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.010
and Culture had recently
worked together

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:16.770
to acquire a new scrapbook

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.920
that includes a previously
before not seen image

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.220
of Harriet Tubman.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.590
And you guys are each
going to get a copy

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.990
of that photograph today, but
you're also going to get a copy

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.270
of a photograph that
we've seen before.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.570
How many of you have
seen this photograph

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:31.990
of Harriet Tubman before?

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.810
Yeah, it's kind of
a famous photograph.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.760
And it really reflects
Harriet Tubman

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.860
at the later part of her life.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.610
And the new photograph
of Harriet Tubman --

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:43.910
&gt;&gt; What?

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:45.210
&gt;&gt; It says right
there Nurse Tubman.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.510
&gt;&gt; -- is this one.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:50.830
&gt;&gt; And you can see that it's
significantly years prior

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.750
to the one we just saw.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:59.660
This is the new image that
we believe was taken in 1868

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.220
of her, so we have a sense
of what she might have looked

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.850
like when she was
in her late 40's.

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:09.230
Remember at the beginning
of this talk

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:12.320
when I mentioned how we
could describe people

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.140
like Thomas Jefferson and
James Madison and John Adams

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.680
in all those ways, and I
introduced Senator Van Hollen,

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.430
and I described him as
many different things

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.200
in addition to being a senator?

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.780
In the story that the
Ransomes read to us,

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.730
we learned a little bit
about Harriet Tubman

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.560
and the various roles
that she played.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.890
Can one of you raise your
hand and tell me one thing

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.210
that Harriet Tubman was?

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.420
What was one thing that -- yeah?

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.250
What was she?

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.550
&gt;&gt; Moses.

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:42.850
&gt;&gt; She was Moses.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.150
Excellent, yeah.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.490
She was a conductor on
the Underground Railroad

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.940
and referred to as Moses.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.240
That was awesome.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.540
What else was she?

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.840
Yeah, in the yellow.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.140
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.390
&gt;&gt; I can't hear you.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:56.690
Sorry.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.250
&gt;&gt; She was a fugitive.

00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.840
She was a fugitive.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.790
&gt;&gt; I still didn't hear you.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.090
I'm sorry.

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.390
&gt;&gt; A fugitive.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:05.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, she was a fugitive, yeah.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:06.990
Yes, she was.

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.290
OK, what else was she?

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:09.590
In the purple.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.890
&gt;&gt; She was a nurse.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:12.190
&gt;&gt; She was a nurse, excellent.

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:13.490
And right here in the
middle, what was she?

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.790
&gt;&gt; A spy.

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.090
&gt;&gt; She was a spy, yeah.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:17.390
I heard him, yep.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:20.210
Yeah. So she was a nurse,
she was a spy, she was Moses.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.510
Anything else?

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.810
&gt;&gt; A nurse!

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:24.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.830
&gt;&gt; She was a slave.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:29.600
&gt;&gt; She was enslaved early in
her life, but what else was she?

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.900
&gt;&gt; She was a scout.

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.200
&gt;&gt; She was a scout.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.500
You guys are good.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.250
Yeah. So Harriet Tubman
was lots of things.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:40.050
And just to repeat, the images
that you have give us a glimpse

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.340
of what she looked like at
different stages in her life.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.110
And the book that you
are all receiving a copy

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.950
of is the Ransomes' book
about before she was Harriet.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.140
And I hope that you
keep in mind that --

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.410
like, right now you guys are all
students, but I know that some

00:55:56.410 --> 00:56:00.300
of you are athletes and some
of you already are artists.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.290
And I know that some of you
like to cook, so you must be,

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:05.090
like, brilliant chefs.

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:06.850
But you are a lot of things.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:09.690
And you are also all of the
things that you're going

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:12.780
to become, and that's
exciting to think about.

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.080
It's exciting to think

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.560
about welcoming you all back
here someday to talk to us

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.960
about the books that
you've written or the books

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.450
that you've illustrated.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.900
So thank you for coming to
the Library of Congress today.

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:28.170
