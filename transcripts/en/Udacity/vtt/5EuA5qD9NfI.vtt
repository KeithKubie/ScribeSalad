00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.620
We showed a moment ago how to
go from prices to port-val,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.020
which is the daily total
value of the portfolio.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.950
Now that we have port-val, we can
compute a number of important statistics

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.310
on the portfolio, and
thus assess the portfolio and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
the investment style of whoever
is managing that portfolio.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.840
An important first calculation
is to compute daily returns.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.220
We've talked about how to do that
before, so I won't go over it here.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.920
But an important observation is
whenever you compute daily returns,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.980
the first value is
always going to be zero.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.860
And that's because on the first day,
of course, there's no change.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.390
So we want to exclude

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.540
that value from any calculations
we do across all daily returns.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.690
It's easy to accomplish this
with a simple python statement,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.230
which is just to replace
daily returns with

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.000
daily returns where we just
include the second row forward.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.180
And boom, we're rid of that first zero.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.860
Now that we have this information,
we can compute four key statistics that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.540
everybody wants to know about regarding
the performance of a portfolio.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.980
They are cumulative return,
average daily return,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.370
standard deviation of daily return and
sharp ratio.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.080
Cumulative return is just a measure of
how much the value of the portfolio has

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.990
gone up from the beginning to the end.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.560
So to calculate that, we take the last
val, which is port-val of -1.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.400
Which is this one divided by
the beginning and subtract 1.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.580
Average daily return is just
the average of these numbers, so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.610
we just take the mean.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.050
Very simple.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.300
And standard deviation of daily return,
again simple.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.010
Just use the standard deviation
function right there.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.190
Now sharpe ratio is a little bit
more complex than these other ones.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.230
So we're going to spend a little bit
more time diving into sharpe ratio.
