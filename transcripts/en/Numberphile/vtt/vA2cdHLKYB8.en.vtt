00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.660
Today, we're going to talk about the question...

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.480
"How do we know about numbers?"

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.260
When we ask...

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.740
How do we know about people, or trees, or any stuff like this...

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.980
It's kind of obvious.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.280
You go out there and you look at it...

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.520
... or you go and ask an expert who goes and looks at it, and the expert tells you about it.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.800
But numbers...

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.980
... or other mathematical entities, like sets or functions....

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.060
They're not...

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.980
...out there like that.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.240
You can't go and look at them.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.640
You can't listen to them.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.580
You can't go and see a film about them.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.640
So...

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.840
That's how we get stuck with this question.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.360
How do we interact with them?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.840
How can we kind of...

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.460
...get our hands on numbers...

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.180
... in a way that gives us information about them.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.300
The way you find out about the world...

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.600
...in nearly every case...

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.420
...is by having some physical, causal interaction.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.640
Either you see it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.380
you hear it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.340
you smell it

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.240
...or someone who's done those things tells you about it.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.400
That's all a causal interaction.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640
But numbers

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.800
At least on most people's theory

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.040
They're not physical things.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.560
They don't causally interact with us.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.600
So that raises the question:

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.880
Brady "Do you know the answer to the question?"

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.240
Mark "I guess I don't KNOW the answer

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.680
but let me tell you about some answers people have come up with.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.600
So here's one answer:

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.400
Numbers aren't out there in the world

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.720
they're really stuff we make up in our heads.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.960
The idea is numbers are these things we construct in our own minds

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.040
It's a special thing about human minds

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.800
that allows us to construct numbers and other bits to do with maths.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.120
If that theory works,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.920
it's got a really nice answer to the question "how do we know about numbers?"

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.400
well, it's because we've just made them up in our minds.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.800
We know about the stuff in our own minds, numbers are in our minds, so that's how we know about numbers.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.680
That goes by the name Platonism.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.960
Plato thought that properties like redness, and justice, and goodness

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.400
exist but not in the physical world

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.080
they exist in a world of forms.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.880
Platonism about mathematics is kind of like that,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.280
it's saying that these things really exist, but they are non-physical things.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.000
So you might think that fictional entities, like Sherlock Holmes,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.480
Or mythical entities, like Pegasus, they exist in our imaginations in our minds,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.760
in the minds of authors, and then they get passed on to the minds of readers.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.560
So that analogy, between on the one hand fictional entities, like Sherlock Holmes,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.480
and on the other hand, numbers-

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.400
Brady "i.e. seven?"

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.720
-yeah, being creations in the mind.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.680
That gives you some clue to why this theory about numbers has problems,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280
because on the one hand

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.560
it's really obvious to think one day somebody came along and invented Sherlock Holmes

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.760
It doesn't seem as if somebody came along and invented the number seven

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.360
there's always been the number seven

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.560
at least that's what I think, there's always been seven things

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.440
so how could there have not been the number seven?

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.080
So imagine we rewind the clock way back to the days of dinosaurs

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.200
suppose the dinosaurs aren't that clever, they don't have any conscious experiences,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.960
if you've got 24 dinosaurs roaming around

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960
it seems as if there's 24 of something

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.120
so you've gotta have the number 24.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960
So if we're not there to be thinking about it,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.080
it seems as if you can have numbers without human minds thinking about those numbers.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.940
Brady "you don't think that numbers are a human-made tool, you think that they're beyond that?"

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.600
I think if this theory was to run, it'd have to be made a bit cleverer.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.840
There's a way to do that.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.140
And that's to think of numbers as not as things that we actually create in our minds

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.080
but rather you think about a number as

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520
the potential for us to do something.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.760
The idea is something like this.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.000
Even before humans came along, there was always the potential for us to start counting.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.880
Going, ah, there's three trees, there's 24 dinosaurs.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.460
If that potential's there, then the numbers are there.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.300
That's how that theory goes.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.760
Here's a completely different way of thinking about the matter.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.060
What do we do when we do maths?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.540
Well, we look at some equations, we go through them, we try and solve them,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.560
we look at some axioms, we try and prove some stuff, we talk to mathematicians,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.820
and they do some squiggles on the boards...

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:27.420
So here's an idea. Mathematics, numbers, really just is about those equations, those axioms.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.940
So on this view, there really isn't anything to numbers beyond the kind of symbolism we have for them.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.400
This kind of theory has got the same kind of problems that I just talked about.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.980
Obviously there was a time before we had any kind of symbolism, you know, before we were around.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.740
So, how would you then explain numerical facts about the past?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.020
So these guys, if they're gonna try and make this theory work, they have to somehow explain,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.600
when we describe the past, those 24 dinosaurs, we're kind of using symbolism to do it.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.640
We'd write down the number 24, or we'd make the sound 'twenty-four'.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.100
So, even when we're describing the past, we're describing it now using these symbols, and that

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.260
kind of gives some support to the idea that the number really doesn't go beyond the symbol we use for it.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.900
And that goes by the name either intuitionism, or constructivism.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.420
That's actually really big amongst computer scientists

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.140
who think of numbers not so much as constructions in our mind, but constructions in a computer.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.340
I think we're in a bit of a bind when we come to thinking about our knowledge of numbers,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.260
because I think numbers are real things, I think they're objective things, so that

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.600
when I talk about the number 23, and when you talk about the number 23, we're talking about the same thing.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.200
I don't think the number 23 is something that we could bump into in the street. I think that it exists,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.560
but it doesn't have a physical presence in the world.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.740
Numbers don't bash into each other like, you know, cars or snooker balls do.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.780
So the bind is something like, numbers are real non-physical things,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.400
on the other hand, we know about the world by physically interacting with it,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.540
that looks a bit like saying we don't know about numbers,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.920
but I think we do.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.580
So here's one suggestion about how we solve this problem, and it goes like this.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.580
Numbers are real things, they're out there in the world, they're non-physical things.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.020
How do we know about them?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.400
We say that if it could possibly exist, it does exist.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.300
Suppose we come up with some mathematical theory.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.300
We go through all the axioms, we check all the proofs, and we go, ah yeah, this is consistent, this looks good.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.460
So these numbers, or these things that our theory talks about, they could exist.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.700
And then the philosophy goes, since it could exist, it does exist.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.700
So we know that because our theory is consistent, the stuff it talks about really does exist.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.740
Brady "I can imagine a lot of people who watch numberphile aren't gonna like that...

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.420
just because something can exist it does exist?"

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.560
Right. And in general, that's just crazy, right? I mean, Sherlock Holmes could exist,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.420
doesn't mean he does exist.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.380
But you might think that mathematical entities, because they're not physical, they don't take up any space or time,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.740
are different.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.640
So the mathematical universe seems to contain all these weird and wonderful things,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.400
and it almost looks sometimes like we can define things into existence.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.020
We can say things like, let's define a group out of sets as blah-blah-blah

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.680
Now how would that work? How could you just define something into existence?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.140
This theory has an answer. You're not making it exist.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.640
What that definintion is doing is saying,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.060
That goes by the name formalism.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.540
The formalism is the formal system of symbols that we write down,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.460
the axioms, the proofs, the rules we set ourselves

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.040
to say that's a good proof, that's a bad proof. Once we've got those symbols, and we've got those rules,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.100
hey presto, you've got the numbers.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.180
Interestingly, most of these questions were originally raised by mathematicians.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:15.680
And they were raised in a time, back in the early 20th century, where lots of areas of maths had gone bad.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.600
They discovered that lots of the theories they were using gave really weird and contradictory results.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.160
It was paradoxes discovered in the foundations of mathematics.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.780
So one really important concept was the concept of a set.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:37.080
This is an idea that came from Cantor, and Cantor thought, well, a set is defined by a predicate,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.560
like, "is tall". "Is tall" defines the set of tall people.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.100
And the idea was, you give me a predicate, I'll give you a set.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.920
But Bertrand Russell, in his famous paradox, showed why that's not gonna work.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.180
He said, take the set of all things that aren't members of themselves.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.860
That's a predicate.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.620
If you try and make a set out of it, you get a contradiction.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.580
So, established area of mathematics, we thought we knew it, gives us contradictions.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.520
And the whole industry based around making sure those paradoxes went away

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.000
really was a search for an answer to the question, "how do we really know about mathematics?"

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.700
What the fictionalist has got to do is try to explain away the success of mathematics and

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.680
the success of science, but without saying that mathematical claims are true.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.820
The mathematical theory, on the other hand, tells you, bet whatever you've got,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.600
stake any amount of money you can get your hands on.
