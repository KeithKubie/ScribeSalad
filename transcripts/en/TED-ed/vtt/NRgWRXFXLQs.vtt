As most of you know,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.186
QR code stands for quick response code,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.793
and it's a two-dimensional bar code

00:00:10.817 --> 00:00:12.686
that holds a good deal more information

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.044
than a traditional bar code.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.992
They originated in Japan
at the Toyota factory

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.803
to track the manufacturing of car parts.

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:22.532
Since then, they've taken
off in popularity,

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.664
and you'll see them everywhere
in consumer advertising.

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.863
When you scan a QR code,
you're instantly taken

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:31.787
to a variety of tech-based experiences:

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.246
Could be a text message,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.641
could be an audio message,

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.047
could be a website,

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.301
could be a video.

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:38.879
It's like magic.

00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:42.254
The tools to create a QR
code are essentially free,

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.278
and the tools to interact with the QR code

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:47.634
are increasingly easy and common to use.

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.111
So, we have this great, free, easy tool,

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.770
but what can we do with it?

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:54.426
Teachers have realized
there's a lot of potential

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.602
for QR codes in the classroom.

00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:58.817
Recently, I told my class
we would be learning

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.279
some new vocabulary words,

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:02.788
something we do
two or three times a month.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.217
They let out a groan

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.657
because it's kind of a boring activity.

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.415
Then, I passed out QR
codes to all my students

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.154
and told them we'd be interacting
with them with devices,

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:14.517
and that's how they'd find
their vocabulary list.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.546
The attitude in the class
changed completely.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.237
They went from groaning and moaning

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.836
to excited and enthusiastic.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.909
I could teach the exact
same lesson using QR codes

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.598
and not using QR codes

00:01:26.622 --> 00:01:29.183
and get a completely different attitude.

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:31.184
One fun activity to do with QR codes

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.644
is a scavenger hunt.

00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:35.438
I create QR codes with tasks
assigned to them.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.316
I hide them all around the room.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.769
Students go with their devices

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:41.236
and scan them and have
to complete the task.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.641
Recently, I hosted a technology
event at my school

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:46.366
and held a school-wide QR code.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.118
Students loved it.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:49.410
In grades K through 6,

00:01:49.434 --> 00:01:51.496
they were completely engaged and excited,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.187
literally running from code to code

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.628
because they were so excited

00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:57.339
to see what the next task was going to be.

00:01:57.363 --> 00:01:58.649
Students who didn't have devices with them

00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:00.089
were begging their parents

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:01.542
to pull out their smart phones

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.385
so they could participate as well.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.921
It was so refreshing to see

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:09.524
that level of enthusiasm
and excitement regarding learning.

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:11.950
A creative use for teachers for QR codes

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:14.120
is for positive reinforcement.

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:15.778
Put up a poster in your classroom

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.186
with numbered QR codes,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.115
each one leading to a different message.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.806
When a student needs some feedback,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.366
tell him, 'Go scan number 5.'

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.037
'Go scan number 22.'

00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.072
And the message will say,

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:27.866
'Great job today! I love your enthusiasm.'

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.451
'Nice work! I can see you're
working really hard.'

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:32.441
It's so much more exciting for a student

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:33.831
to get out of their seat,

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:34.925
scan a code,

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.296
and interact with something

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.177
for then the teacher
just to say, 'Good job!'

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:40.421
It's much more memorable.

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.695
Libraries have endless uses for QR codes:

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.233
scannable book reviews,

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:48.208
lists of reading suggestions

00:02:48.232 --> 00:02:50.012
and book lists on the walls,

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.225
biographies.

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:52.535
Imagine pulling a biography

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:54.600
of Martin Luther King, Jr. off the shelf,

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:55.811
scanning a QR code,

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:57.149
and being instantly taken

00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:58.894
to the "I Have a Dream" speech.

00:02:58.918 --> 00:03:01.982
It literally makes learning come alive.

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:04.237
QR codes can add a nice 21st century twist

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:05.904
to a traditional assignment.

00:03:05.928 --> 00:03:07.585
Each year, I have my class

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.616
create a poster for a book report,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.951
something we've all probably done

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:12.828
at some point in elementary school.

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.830
It's a little bit of a boring assignment.

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:16.368
The kids enjoy it okay.

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:17.871
This time, I changed it up,

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:19.657
and the second step of the assignment

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:21.828
was to have them record their voices,

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:25.209
recording an audio QR code of themselves

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.247
giving a book review of the book.

00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:29.469
They then printed the QR code,

00:03:29.493 --> 00:03:30.834
attached it to the poster,

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:34.111
and gave the poster a hands-on,
interactive quality.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:35.376
We put them in the hallway

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.009
and kids from all different classrooms

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:38.296
were walking by, scanning them,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.995
listening to these book reviews.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.263
It was so much more fun

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.463
than just a traditional poster.

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:46.633
My class recently had
the privilege of participating

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:47.900
in a QR code lesson

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:50.464
led by a teacher across the country.

00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:53.481
If the video chat weren't exciting enough,

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.659
the fact that she incorporated
QR codes into the lesson,

00:03:56.683 --> 00:03:58.361
my students, from their seat,

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:00.100
from the comfort of their classroom,

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:02.664
could actually scan the codes
on the computer screen,

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:06.001
interacting with her QR codes
from 3,000 miles away,

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.504
was incredibly exciting
and memorable for my students.

00:04:09.528 --> 00:04:12.571
They did not stop talking
about the lesson for weeks.

00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:15.002
You just don't get that kind of memorable,

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:18.021
engaging experience using a worksheet

00:04:18.045 --> 00:04:20.126
or reading from a textbook.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.643
QR codes have a possible use

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.430
in every grade level,

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:26.250
with every subject area.

00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:28.417
Kindergarten teachers
can have their students

00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:31.520
scan a QR code that leads
to a phonics lesson.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.296
The music teacher can
create audio QR codes

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.295
of their students playing
instruments or singing.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.743
PE teachera can post
real-time race results

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:41.495
or athletic event results,

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:43.463
all attached to a QR code.

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:46.300
The student council
or the PTO can advertise

00:04:46.324 --> 00:04:49.042
upcoming school events
all around the school

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:52.102
and send home on flyers via QR code.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:55.873
The possibilities with this
free and easy tool are endless.

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:59.062
If used properly, QR
codes have the potential

00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:00.397
to awaken a student,

00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.640
transform a lesson,

00:05:01.664 --> 00:05:04.435
and bring down the walls
of your classroom,

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.690
creating the ultimate 21st
century learning opportunity.
