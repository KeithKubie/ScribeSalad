00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is even though we sped up B by a factor of 10,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we've only made the whole program 1.1 times faster--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that is, 10% faster.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The problem is we've left A unchanged,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so our new program would have an execution time that looks like this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
B would be this tiny little slice here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It would just take 1 second rather than 10 seconds,

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but the whole program would still take 91 seconds.
