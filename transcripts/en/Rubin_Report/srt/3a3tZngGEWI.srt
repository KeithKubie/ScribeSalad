1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,110
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,510
joining me today is a gorilla journalist,

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:11,110
the head of Project Veritas and the
author of American Prob de James O'keefe.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,020
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Great to be here. Long overdue,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,220
I think is the way I'm going to start
this one because you are sort of right in

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,490
the center of a lot of the things
that I'm constantly talking about.

7
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:24,740
So it's good to have you. Great to be
here. Thanks for having me. Okay, so, uh,

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,880
before we get into all your work that
I think most of my audience knows,

9
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:31,540
at least a portion of, I don't think
anyone knows that much about you.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,230
What do we need to know about James
O'keefe, the man? How did he become this,

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,430
this rogue reporter and guy that was
unearthing all of the evil things that are

12
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:41,290
tech overlords are doing to us?

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,460
Well, I started in college doing
these undercover tapes. Uh,

14
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:47,230
I actually started 15 years ago,

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,110
started a newspaper in
college called the Centurion.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,970
And I quickly learned that the way to
expose these institutions is to sort of

17
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,270
make them live up to their own principles.
Like the Alinsky tactic.

18
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,100
I'd read rules for radicals by
Saul Alinsky in college and I,

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,400
I decided to expose hypocrisy by
making them live up to their own rules.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
And I realized that those rules were
race and sex and sort of abortion,

21
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:16,270
these sort of sacred cow institutions,
planned parenthood and acorn.

22
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:20,260
And I decided to use hidden cameras.
I went into the dining hall at Rutgers,

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,570
I on Saint Patrick's Day and I said that
lucky charms offends my Irish heritage.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,260
They took me seriously and told
us they would remove lucky charms.

25
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:31,210
Cereal is the first video that I did.

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,680
And from there I actually went on
to work with uh, uh, Lila rose,

27
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,560
who you had on the show recently and
some planned parenthood investigations.

28
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:43,561
Acorn with Andrew Breitbart and I have
done some 200 undercover investigations

29
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,940
in the last 10 years.
I assume as you

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,190
do more undercover things and now
you've got other people that are,

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,410
that are doing a portion of them,

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,200
it gets harder and harder to do as
people know who you are and know the

33
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,070
organization and things

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,990
you'd be surprised. I mean at the
moment we read the Society of waste,

35
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,720
fraud and abuse.
I suppose we will win the day,

36
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,780
but people are always
going to be in power,

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:09,250
tends to corrupt and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.
And money and, and, uh,

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
things that develop.
People all are always going to be corrupt.

39
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:15,880
So I don't actually wear the
camera these days very often.

40
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:20,080
I sort of go out into the field to,
to be a leader to the troops.

41
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,850
But for the most part it's,
it's,

42
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,210
we've got dozens of these people across
the United States with wearing these

43
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:29,440
little cameras. You put them in, you
can put them in a cup for, you know,

44
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,820
you can put them in a book, you can put
them in a watch. And as long as you're,

45
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,280
I ask you if there's more
than four cameras in the
studio right now. Cause I got,

46
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,530
there's a war. There's a few over
there. Yes. Um, but you know,

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,490
but as long as there's one party
consenting to the conversation,

48
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,560
as long as that you're,
you're talking to someone,

49
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,350
there's no expectation of privacy.
We would argue.

50
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,290
And we won in federal court in
Massachusetts a few months ago. We,

51
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,660
we changed the law.
So it's,

52
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:56,110
we believe that secretly recording
someone is a fundamental human right.

53
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,020
It's a constitutional right
because I have no duty.

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,550
Keep confidential what you tell me.

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,230
So the hidden camera is an extension of
the reporter notebook and the cameras

56
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,880
capture things that words don't, I mean
cameras capture, intonation, inflection.

57
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,570
And so we believe that this is a kind
of transparency revolution and there's a

58
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,660
movement of people doing
this in a weird way.

59
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,910
It is sort of depressing reality.

60
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,960
Like when I've watched some of your
videos and you get engineers at these

61
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,380
companies and we're going to, we're
going to talk about all of them, uh,

62
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,140
to admit things that we all are sort
of thinking or true related to shadow

63
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,660
banning or d boosting where everything
else, there's a piece of me,

64
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,620
even when they're, they're tipping off
the information that I suspect is true.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,380
There's a piece of me that's
like, this is, this is,

66
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,410
there's something sort of depressing
about this that this is what we've been

67
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,020
left with. Like we have
to go after, you know,

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,440
mid level and sometimes low level
engineers and sometimes the bigger ones.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,980
But because there's no transparency
when it comes to these companies.

70
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,410
So it feels almost depressing to me.
Does that mean, does that make sense?

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,430
I think the way that I would put it,
like it's unfortunate, I suppose I,

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
some people call it depressing,
some people say it. Could
we confirm suspicions?

73
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:04,810
I would say that what we do is
summon righteous indignation, uh,

74
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,660
at the tragedies in society,

75
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:12,250
including in these organizations
because they run so counter to what were

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,520
spoonfed the narratives that
were spoon fed by the media,

77
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,630
by the powers that be so Hidden Camera
Journal and investigative reporting,

78
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:24,310
whether it's hidden camera or print
does that it summons what I to Tarbell

79
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,480
termed as righteous indignation at the
tragedies. And it kind of, you know,

80
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,220
most people, I would say 80%, there's
a sort of consensus around what we do.

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,790
People say, well that's wrong
or they deny it. So Twitter, uh,

82
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,730
Twitter lobbyist in
Congress under oath said,

83
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,290
we do not shadow banned when his
engineer clearly said what we do.

84
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,860
Do is shadow band and we,
I don't know if we do that anymore.

85
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,580
That's what the engineer said. Clearly
meaning that he had shadow banned people.

86
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:55,060
So, um, it's, it's perjury to
lie under oath and, and you know,

87
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,650
these hidden camera videos really show
people what's going on at angers people.

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,770
I think the world is more
polarized than it was 10 years ago.

89
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,970
So maybe that 80% consensus
is, is, is going down.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,660
Are you worried at all though that will
always be videotaping each other and

91
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,960
that there will be nothing that's private.
I mean, even now if I go out to dinner,

92
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,710
like I'm aware that I'm some level of
a public person and sometimes people

93
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:20,590
recognize me and sometimes I was at the
airport and it was very obvious to me

94
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,120
that the guy,
I was sitting with somebody,

95
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,330
but that the guy next to me clearly knew
who I was and he was on his computer

96
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,360
and the whole time I can think of this
guy could be recording me, you know? And,

97
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,150
and just all like just this
endless big brother thing.

98
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,330
Even if the intentions of what you're
doing. I do believe to be good.

99
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,240
Are you just worried about just that
general state of we're all going to be

100
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,400
recording each other all the time?
There will be nothing private.

101
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,510
I'm not worried at all.

102
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,450
I mean there's an element of risk every
time you interact with strangers and you

103
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:47,110
talk to them, as long as there's one
party present to the conversation,

104
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,640
we would argue that it's ethical.
And again,

105
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,440
we think that camera's visuals are
merely an extension. I mean I could,

106
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,080
I could disseminate what
you tell me in private.

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,630
I could write it down and shout it from
the rooftops opt ins and clarity wrote

108
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,310
the jungle. He saw everything and then
he ran back to his hotel and wrote,

109
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:06,080
wrote it all down.
So surely society would would,

110
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,460
would rather a situation
where I accurately capture
what it is that you told me

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,390
and I have to use cameras. They indemnify
me because people call me a liar.

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,480
They say that didn't happen.
So I have to,

113
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,700
I have to record the
incidents because they would,

114
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,940
they would say that it did not
happen the way that I reported it.

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,600
And they also think that I think that
there are lines that we can't cross.

116
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,680
We don't go into people's bedrooms, we
try to stay away from the really personal,

117
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,740
intimate, you know, sexual
details about, about people.

118
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,000
But this is a revolution that's
aimed at the power structure at this

119
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,590
establishment, the powers that be not
against private citizens. And we don't.

120
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,790
And I think there was a duty,

121
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,290
there is a responsibility
that investigative reporters
have not to put people on

122
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,800
blast unless it really meets
a compelling public interest.

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,920
So you mentioned you started this in,
in college.

124
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:59,000
What was tipping you off to like that
there was something wrong with the media?

125
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,170
I mean,
what made you go,

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,800
I gotta go in there and say I'm Irish
and I'm offended by Leptin charms.

127
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,070
Like what really was happening that
you were seeing that led to that? Well,

128
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:10,730
I was in at Rutgers University in New
Jersey and it was so the political

129
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,380
correctness was run a muck like
most schools and all these daily,

130
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,230
there's something bad happening with the
grease trucks please. The grease trucks,

131
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,600
trucks, trucks, please tell
me that they're okay. It's
for those who don't know,

132
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,230
they're these trucks at Rutgers and it's
like they're all in the parking lot and

133
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,830
uh, and you get real fat real quick,
older, your collar, there was something,

134
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,470
you know what? There was something wrong
with the gross trucks. They had duct,

135
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:34,340
they'd put duct tape. This is
in 2005, over these sandwiches.

136
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:37,550
Am I allowed to curse on them?
There was one of them called the fat,

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,530
the fat bitch and the fat,

138
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,200
a dyke and other words that
were offensive. And um,

139
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,230
they had put duct tape over the names
because these words were considered

140
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:52,340
offensive. That's what was the, like what
compelled me to try to ban lucky charms.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,300
So I said, this is ridiculous. I also
had professors who were Stalinists.

142
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,030
I had professors who were telling me
how great communist Communism was.

143
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,920
And I was not political,

144
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,850
but I read the New York Times every day
front to back in college in the dining

145
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,860
hall. I was sort of an
introverted guy and I'd read,

146
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,510
read the paper and I was just, I said,
this doesn't accurately capture the world.

147
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,290
This doesn't, this doesn't tell
people what's really going on. So I,

148
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,730
I felt compelled to do something
about it and it wasn't comfortable.

149
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,920
It's not comfortable to confront
people with cameras and, you know,

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,840
get into their faces.

151
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:28,150
But I was willed to do it because I
believed in the cause and, and the,

152
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,860
the kind of Alinsky, uh, methodology,

153
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,790
which is to make them accountable
to their own principles. You know,

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,800
you had these Marxist professors driving
Bentleys and BMWs and had a little muck

155
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:42,950
raking newspaper and it was
like lifestyles of the rich
and Marxist. Right, right.

156
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,610
You know, track these people down. I
just feel that most people that do this,

157
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,900
most insiders inside these companies
coming to us now have what I call it

158
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,130
justice complex.

159
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,250
They think that there are things wrong
with the world and they feel compelled to

160
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,360
do something about it. It's
hard to explain. Uh, but
you know, I'm sure you know,

161
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,620
people who have this complex and these
people are willing to basically jump on a

162
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:08,730
grenade to wear a camera,
to film their employer.

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Some cases violating their
own nondisclosure agreement
because they believe the

164
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,060
public has a right to
know what they're seeing.

165
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,530
Are you shocked at the amount of people
at these big tech companies who now are

166
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:20,430
willing to speak?

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,300
Because I mean I know insiders
that I get some information from,

168
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,980
I mean I'm talking about Google,
Facebook,

169
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,260
Twitter like that really these things
have become so huge that now their own

170
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,800
people inside them are going, Whoa,
what, what did we help create here?

171
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,230
I'm not sure. Got a frack,
a Frankenstein Monster.

172
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,000
I mean I have you been to Menlo Park and
you go to San Francisco and I was there,

173
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:43,380
cause I did this Facebook story,

174
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:47,910
this insider inside Facebook and I went
to try to locate these engineers and ask

175
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,310
them for comment.
And there were just these buses,

176
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:54,300
just hundreds of buses filled
with millennials and end,

177
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,750
if you go to the campus, people are
sort of driving around these bicycles.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
The best word I can describe
it as their minions.

179
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,470
It's to sort of this little totalitarian
little mini state within a state.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,540
And it's just a group think or,
well Ian Place and I,

181
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,191
and I guess the,

182
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:14,010
the word that it was described to me by
the insights that they're all minions.

183
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,640
They're very intelligent people but they
don't have a lot of common sense and

184
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:19,470
there, and I, and I went there,

185
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,680
I was amazed by this Menlo
Park campus buses of,

186
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,170
of young people being bused in.

187
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,620
And I think that it doesn't surprise
me that people are willing to blow the

188
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,950
whistle because there's more to
life than, than making, you know,

189
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,690
a quarter million dollars a
year and working for these
companies. People want to,

190
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,910
people want to do something. One of the
things that I get told all the time,

191
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,900
what can I do? And, and there aren't a lot
of choices for people. You know, you can,

192
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,390
you can watch the shows,
you can buy the books,

193
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,750
but some people want to actually
participate in this country. And,

194
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,550
and solutions are increasingly, you
know, outside the scope of government,

195
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,910
the legislative process does not
seem to solve things. So there's,

196
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,690
there needs to be in a
different counterweight.

197
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
There needs to be a different solution
and I would say that 0.001% of people are

198
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,450
like put a camera on me. That's a lot of
people by the way. Yeah, right, right,

199
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,430
right. We're talking about a lot
of people at the end of the day.

200
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:15,210
So when did you realize that because
you've mostly focused or at least I think

201
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:15,950
the the,

202
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,620
the work that has gotten you the most
attention has been related to the tech

203
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:23,430
companies, not necessarily going
after politicians or academics per se,

204
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,510
although you've done some of that.

205
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,140
When did you realize that focusing
on the tech companies was,

206
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,200
was really the thing that was going to
strike the chord with most people because

207
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,990
that's what it seems to be. Well, because
I think the media has all the power.

208
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,310
I think that I've known this for ever
since I started this endeavor was that the

209
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,910
media has so much more
power than people realize.

210
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,330
Everyone knows the media is powerful,

211
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:47,331
but I think that people fear the
humiliating power of the press.

212
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,600
I think the press,

213
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,840
including the big tech companies
have more power than government.

214
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,870
They are more powerful
than all three branches of
government, executive, judicial,

215
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:59,380
legislative branch. So somehow we
need to hold these people accountable.

216
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:02,530
They're not a cat, they're not held
accountable by anybody who elects them.

217
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,190
And I don't know what the
solutions are. People say, well,

218
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,300
what should they be regulated?

219
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,890
I think they should be transparent
or there will need to be regulated,

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,470
but they have to at least
not deceive the people.

221
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,750
So because the media has all the power,
I,

222
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,770
I wrote this book called American Proverb
de and I believe that people don't

223
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,400
know that they're being lied to by CNN
and the New York Times and they don't

224
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:29,260
know that they're being d boosted in
shadow, banned by Twitter and Facebook.

225
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,240
And I think these companies need
to tell you that they're doing it.

226
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,970
It's not so bad if they take
your account down and restore it.

227
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,200
But the thing that's really scary about
the d boosting and the shadow banning is

228
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:45,580
that you don't know that it is
happening to you. And I have to see it.

229
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,810
You can kind of feel it.

230
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:50,860
There are times when everything I'm
doing is on fire or then sometimes where

231
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,790
it's just like nothing happens and those
usually have a certain political bent

232
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,780
to them and then you end up really feeling
like you're in a mental institution

233
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,400
because if you don't have
evidence of anything,

234
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,560
I don't want to be the guy that's
running around and screaming,

235
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,280
everything's a conspiracy and they're
coming after me and leaving the rest.

236
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,260
We're doing this on youtube right now.
And even when you do have evidence,

237
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:11,590
like we have video tape after
tape of people inside Twitter,

238
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,990
including the Twitter direct messaging
guy saying that they have certain key

239
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:18,820
words and they consider
to be a Russian Bot.

240
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,270
If you tweet about God
guns and the American flag,

241
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,690
most of these engineers are not,
some of them are not American citizens.

242
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:30,220
Then they don't share American values.
And this individual says,

243
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,070
if you tweet about fly, he's who
talks like that, who talks about God,

244
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,730
you must be a Russian Bot.
I have the videotape and they still,

245
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,270
they still say it's fake. So, you
know, I think that what, you know,

246
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:44,320
it's one of those things where people
need to see this stuff and the lead and

247
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,890
that just want these companies
to be honest about what
they're doing. They just,

248
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,530
I just want them to be honest. That's
why I want to be honest though. I mean,

249
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,440
we want them to be honest, right? So I'm
with you. I want them to be honest and,

250
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,990
and the reason I apply
as much pressure on them,

251
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,230
on Twitter and youtube particularly is
because I want them to be better. Right?

252
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,230
Like I, I always say this, it's
like I've got a million subscribers.

253
00:14:02,231 --> 00:14:06,070
I put out a television quality
show on Youtube for free,

254
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,160
and I don't even have an email
address to someone at Youtube.

255
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,360
I have no contact at someone at Youtube.
Like that's rigid. Timidly crazy.

256
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,000
They're a huge company
that offers a product.

257
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm a user of the product that helps make
them money through advertising and all

258
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,450
that stuff. I can't even
get a human there, but I,

259
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,250
but I don't think I can force
them to be better. Right. Well,

260
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,530
it's the job of investigative reporting
to hold people accountable to, to,

261
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,160
to test and affirm what
is an outrage to people.

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,530
And I think that you can't lie
under oath. You can't. I mean,

263
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:39,280
Mark Zuckerberg said in,
in Congress last spring,

264
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:43,620
some things that may be contradicted by
some of the documents we've unearthed,

265
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,930
there are laws against perjury and the,

266
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,930
and what people have to remember is I
don't have a position on whether these

267
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:54,080
companies should be regulated.
I honestly don't know what should be done.

268
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,800
I do know that people need to know
what is happening inside the companies,

269
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,630
and I think that because
they're so powerful, people
have no idea you when you,

270
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:05,000
when you digest content from
CNN and the New York Times,

271
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,190
all that stuff gets filtered
through Facebook. In fact,

272
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,390
when I did the Facebook story,

273
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:13,250
I was shocked by some people in
media telling me, while I don't know,

274
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,560
I love the story, but I don't
know if I can cover it. Why not?

275
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,900
Because we derive most of
our revenue from Facebook.

276
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,660
The same thing happened during
the 2016 election. When I,

277
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,110
when I did the Hillary Clinton tapes
and the Bob Creamer resigned. I mean,

278
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,200
people have to remember that these
companies are publicly traded companies.

279
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,020
They get their broadcast
license from the FCC.

280
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,780
In some circumstances there
sort of entanglements.

281
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:37,781
There's a symbiotic relationship between
the corporate press and the government.

282
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,550
And for those reasons,
again,

283
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,760
to go back to the campaign
to recruit insiders,

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,430
it's going to require citizens.

285
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,200
It's gonna require outsiders to blow
the whistle because no one in the

286
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,040
government is going to do it. Indeed,
many of them around the take. Okay.

287
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,330
So let's just do each platform or one at
a time. So you just mentioned Facebook.

288
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,290
So let's go to phase.
What do,

289
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,730
what do we need to know about what's
going on with the Facebook algorithm and

290
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,920
the way they're banning
people in suspending people
and the rest of it? Well,

291
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,620
I can tell you what our insider told us,
saying I can,

292
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,910
I try to only speak about
the things that I know.

293
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,911
100% in the insider was
working in the content review,

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,280
uh,
the content review tool at Facebook.

295
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,540
And she was a contractor
for the company and she, uh,

296
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,340
leaked us documents inside the company
showing I guess what would be called as a

297
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,920
de boost of a live stream video.

298
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,810
And she said she specifically saw
this on Steven Crowder's page. Um,

299
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,640
uh,
she saw it on a few other pages.

300
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:44,720
She took a screenshot of a Mike Cernovich
page and on the page it says I action

301
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:46,400
live distribution.

302
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,590
This was apparently some type of algorithm
written too from what we could see,

303
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,970
two to reduce content that
was suicidal or violent,

304
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,820
but none of these
individuals were talking or,

305
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,160
or doing anything that
would rise to that level.

306
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,370
And now there's two different parts of
Facebook. People need to understand.

307
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,870
There is a task system where it seems
like Facebook after the election hired

308
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,070
hundreds if not thousands of people to
monitor. And they do a fairly good job.

309
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:15,890
If your page gets taken down,
it can be reinstated,

310
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,760
you can file a complaint and they,
they have a pretty good process.

311
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,500
But then there's another part of Facebook
that this insight or told us about or

312
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,660
these were,
this algorithm was occurring.

313
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,700
And it was occurring automatically and
they were identifying certain key words.

314
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:35,270
So she leaks us this troll report,
it's called a troll report.

315
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,710
And after the election, Facebook decided
to Chino to get more involved in,

316
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:41,630
in,
in things,

317
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,680
I guess they didn't like the outcome of
the election and maybe that's what this

318
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,550
was. It was really about, I mean,
independent people having an impact on,

319
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,430
on society.
They don't,

320
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:52,680
they don't like that and they're
in hitting needs more control.

321
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,410
So they had this troll report.
There are certain key words, uh,

322
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,270
words that we're not racist or,
or problematic really,

323
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:04,740
but they were words that were appropriated
by, by right wing meme culture,

324
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:08,830
words like lulls and normy.
And even the, even the, the,

325
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,690
the MSM mainstream media
was in this troll report.

326
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,920
Since typically right wingers
use MSM more than the left.

327
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,420
And these are just words or phrases or
acronyms that usually are just men in

328
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:26,400
meme. Funny Sharon, silly ways. These
are not a threat to democracy. Msm,

329
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,910
mainstream media is not an implication
of racism. Well, they also blow up,

330
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,090
brought up Lauren Chen, they,
they, they brought her up. It was,

331
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:38,091
she was in there as an example of
someone who is needs to be dealt with.

332
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,730
Visa VI, the, the, uh, the product
intervention at Facebook. And I don't,

333
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:45,090
I don't know, I'm not aware of any
of any activities or problems with,

334
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,960
with her videos. I mean, she's just
someone who's sharing her mind on youtube.

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,910
I'm not sure what order
we're putting these up in,

336
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:53,540
but I've got Laura and chat and
coming in here. That's so cool.

337
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,440
Well that says it's a cosmic coincidence.
So, so she likes us these documents,

338
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,670
uh, we put the story out instantly.
What happens is the press, uh,

339
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,690
the verge was the name of the outlet
comes out, comes to Facebook's defense.

340
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,580
It always happens, by the way,
we did the story on Twitter.

341
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,880
And instantly buzzfeed comes out of the
Twitter says they don't do this because

342
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,660
that's not, that's not journalism. I mean,

343
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,270
Twitter says the job of
investigative reporting is to,

344
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,490
is to question what they tell you.

345
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,630
But it's always the case when we do these
videos that people come out and they

346
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,300
said, well, they say
they don't do this. Um,

347
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,040
and they came to Facebook's defense. But
the truth is these documents were real.

348
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,850
And the two engineers that we interviewed,
a guy named Sagey Yamamoto and Danny,

349
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:36,091
Ben,

350
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,260
David actually confronted these guys on
the street in San Francisco with a film

351
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,900
crew because no one would
give me any answers.

352
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:47,010
But the documents are pretty self
explanatory and it's, it's definitely, um,

353
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,940
it definitely,

354
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,910
I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg knows
that these things are happening,

355
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,360
but if he does, he was lying
under oath. Right. So wouldn't,

356
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,620
the sensible thing to do if you are mark
Zuckerberg would be make sure that you

357
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,400
don't really know what's going on at
your company so that when you get put in

358
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,270
the position where you're under oath,
you can basically say anything.

359
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,820
And I think this would
stand true for jacket,

360
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,060
Twitter and a bunch of these guys
if the buck never stops with you.

361
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,740
And I'm sure you saw, um, Jack from
Twitter on with Joe Rogan and Tim Pool.

362
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,680
And it was like, he just struck me as, oh,

363
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,010
I don't really know what's
going on with my company,

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,240
but that seems like it's by design. It's
not an accident. That's interesting. Um,

365
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,680
uh, there's a book by Blake Harris out
in the last couple of weeks about Palmer

366
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,450
Luckey and Facebook,
and I encourage you to read it.

367
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:36,530
It's unbelievable that this guy, uh, uh,

368
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,490
Palmer Luckey who founded the Oculus,
the virtual reality software was, uh,

369
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,910
was dealt with by Mark Zuckerberg
directly inside the company.

370
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:49,580
He was told not to be a Trump supporter,
him on the show actually. So, um, I,

371
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,660
I don't,
I don't know whether that's true or not.

372
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,630
I did see a Jack Dorsey,
uh,

373
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,940
he's never addressed
anything we've exposed,

374
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,070
they don't want to deal
with the actual evidence.

375
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:05,071
There's video tapes of Obenauf of a driver
was saying one strategy is to shadow

376
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:08,980
banned. I mean, there's, they don't
want to actually address the evidence.

377
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,710
They want to say, well,
they don't know what they're
talking about. Well, you know,

378
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,140
and by the way,
there is a difference between,

379
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,430
I think anytime you have human beings
in a room making content decisions,

380
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,440
subjectively you're going
to have these problems.

381
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,510
These are hard problems to solve.

382
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:26,590
But it goes back to the original point
of hiring hundreds if not thousands of

383
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,450
people do the content review.
I think at the end of the day,

384
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:34,420
if these companies don't
like an independent people
influencing the minds of

385
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,790
other people,
that's what this is really about.

386
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,340
And that would actually be okay if they
were transparent about it, sort of,

387
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,700
because then it would allow
competition to fill that void.

388
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,490
But this sort of neither here nor
there and instead of it seems to be the

389
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:51,930
problem. So, okay, so d boosting seems
to be the main problem with Facebook.

390
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,570
And that's interesting that
it was hitting Crowder videos,

391
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,420
Lauren and Shannon and a couple of
other people, and this means you're,

392
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,170
you're streaming, right? So this means
when he's streaming that the, the number,

393
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:02,980
it's just not going to feed,
is that

394
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,910
right? It's, it's when you're,
when you do a live stream video,

395
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:10,170
there are special tags, there are
special qualities in that live stream,

396
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,270
and they down rank the video,

397
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,680
they take away some of the
special qualities that make
it automatically show up

398
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:20,760
on other people's timelines according
to the insider that we spoke to.

399
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:23,280
The other thing about these videos
that are live streamers that they're

400
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:28,230
converted to text automatically
and machine learning goes
through the video and

401
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:31,890
identifies these keywords. So yes,
the video would be down ranked.

402
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,120
It would have its special
qualities taken away. And, uh,

403
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,570
I think that Crowder settled out
of court in 2016 with Facebook.

404
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:43,110
It's what he told me.
And I think that he's in the process of,

405
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,140
of doing some more litigation related to
some of the things they're doing to his

406
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:46,830
videos.

407
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,140
Yeah. Is there anything else that you
need to know on the Facebook front?

408
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,570
You've said they've gotten a
little bit better when it comes to,

409
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,870
they would ban people in suspend
people left and right all the time.

410
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,550
I used to have my, my friend Faisal Omar,
who's been on the show many times, who's,

411
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,630
uh,
an ex Muslim from,

412
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,170
from Iraq and really working
to secularize the Arab world.

413
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:07,320
I mean doing incredible, incredible
work. I mean this is a good man.

414
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,710
He would get banned all the
time. Right. And I would have,

415
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:13,920
I had a contact there so I was
able to help him get back on that.

416
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,780
Seems to be happening a
little bit less now. I logged

417
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,990
in there, the, the insiders showed
me how it works. There's it,

418
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,490
I guess what you call a task
function and um, and you know,

419
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,400
someone gets there. There are, there
are independent people in the company,

420
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:31,480
low level people who just make arbitrary
decisions to remove people and then

421
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:33,710
that's wrong and they shouldn't
do that. So what, so they're only,

422
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,550
there are adult supervision in the
room. There are, there are people,

423
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,630
there's like a conversation
thread under each task.

424
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,220
They convert these things
into what they call tasks.

425
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,680
And there are adults that say,
well that's no good.

426
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,170
And there relationships with a
lot of the publishers for um,

427
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,570
entities like such as your own and,
and,

428
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,110
and there was a relationship between a
sales rep at Facebook and there seemed to

429
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,130
be adult supervision.

430
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,970
But the problem is with the algorithm
side of things as far as I can see.

431
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,840
So He's part of it that the algorithm,
in many cases they will,

432
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,600
the algorithms were written by people,
you know, 10 years ago or 15 years ago,

433
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,940
probably aren't at the company anymore.

434
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:12,680
Nobody really like who really understands
what's going on with these algorithms.

435
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:16,760
Do the engineers at these companies even
have a sense of what's really going on

436
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,840
and how can they make sure that they're
not manipulated by the low level people

437
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,200
in? Well, one of the problems I have is a
reporter doing this is trying to, I mean,

438
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm not a tech person.
I'm not a,

439
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,460
I don't claim to have any
special expertise is trying to,

440
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,980
people's eyes glaze over when you start
talking about machine learning and uh,

441
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,600
and,
and SSI livestream distribution.

442
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,980
So trying to get the people indignant
about something that they have no idea

443
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,140
what this means. But
yes, I think Danny Ben,

444
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:47,141
David wrote the algorithm at Facebook in
2017 than it was apparently intended to

445
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,900
address violence or suicidal content.

446
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,850
And we believe that it was a applied
to politics and it was used for ill.

447
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,470
That seems to be what
happened at Facebook.

448
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,230
So you're saying the road to hell is
paved with good intentions, right?

449
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,770
Is that what you're telling me?
Uh,

450
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,470
anything else going on in Facebook
that we need to know about it? And,

451
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,140
and do you sense that Zuckerberg may
be because of being hauled in front of

452
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,030
Congress will do anything?

453
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,570
I can tell you that everyone inside
the company knows what we did. And uh,

454
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,670
there's one,
I don't know how many 60,000 employees,

455
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,380
they all know exactly what we did.

456
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,610
And I think that when we
personalize it by going to the men,

457
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,300
went to the engineer's doors,
we went to,

458
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,240
we went to the train station where the
guy gets on the train every morning and I

459
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,750
interviewed him and he said, I fear for my
safety. He's like, I'm scared. I'm like,

460
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,360
you're scaring. I should be
afraid for my safety. I mean,

461
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,790
you guys are the ones spying on
us and taking our videos down and,

462
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,200
and not to that, but I'm going after
this trillion dollar company. Um,

463
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,860
but we personalized it.
And I think that there's a lot in,

464
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,200
since I released this tape a month ago,

465
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:50,201
there have been many people inside the
company that have approached me and I'm

466
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,760
trying to,
you know,

467
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,820
it's always the question of do you want
to wear a camera or do you just want to

468
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,880
feed me things anonymously?
My medium is video.

469
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,320
I think that there has to be video
because if we don't take these things,

470
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,850
no one will believe it.

471
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,660
So then the person has to basically
lose their job and I'll hire them.

472
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,910
And that's how our,
our model tends to work these days.

473
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,940
How do you make sure that when someone
reaches out to you that they're not just

474
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,110
trolling you like a triple agent?
Yeah.

475
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,210
Well basically that they would reach out
to you knowing that you throw up one,

476
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,980
one bad thing and there's
been little moments, yes, we
can get into yes. Um, that,

477
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:27,950
that's going to blow up all of the
other good work that you've done.

478
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,240
So there's high incentive for something
else. It's a, it's a risk. It's, I mean,

479
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,390
listen, what we do is very high risk
for many different reasons, which,

480
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,920
which we can get into I guess.

481
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:40,220
But what we do is extremely
risky and an undercover work,

482
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,650
you're going to get burned.
You try to use common sense.

483
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:47,440
There are things that we do. Ew. Ew, ew,
ew, ew, ew. V Eagle. Very carefully. You,

484
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:51,210
you do your due diligence.
Oftentimes they send you something.

485
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,320
There is something called tortious
interference with, uh, with, you know,

486
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,840
violating a nondisclosure
agreement. Um, uh, the, the,

487
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,530
it's a lot of complex legal analysis,

488
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,790
but essentially they have to tell us
something first and then we can tell them

489
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:10,330
to film what they have told us. So there,
you know, we have to be very careful and,

490
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,880
and we have been burned by the way,

491
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,970
and you probably knows about some of
those things, but for the most part,

492
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,920
we're 95 to 98% successful.
Not everything that people bring to us,

493
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:23,700
do we publish? Not Every secret
conversation that I've recorded,

494
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,110
do we publish?

495
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:30,000
I think it's the choosing to publish
something at the video that we've obtained

496
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,790
is really where the ethical
calculation comes in.
