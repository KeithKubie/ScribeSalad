[music playing]

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.210
NARRATOR: Southeast Asia.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.540
Every year during the 9th lunar
month of the Chinese calendar,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.000
thousands of Taoists
throughout the region

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.830
celebrate a 2000-year-old
tradition called

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.380
the Nine Emperor Gods Festival.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.420
The Nine Emperor Gods Festival
is a very, very important

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.210
festival in southeast
Asian Chinese communities,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.830
and it revolves around a
carnival like ritual that

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.210
takes place for nine full days.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.750
The point of this festival is to
summon the very, very powerful

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.210
nine emperor gods,
because they're seen

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.750
as residing up in the skies.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
NARRATOR: The nine sky lords
are believed by Taoists

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.790
to have been the
original rulers of China

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.580
and the offspring of the
supreme god of creation.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.120
According to legend,
the nine emperor gods

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.290
come from the nine
stars that make up

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.960
the Big Dipper, seven
of which are visible

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.620
and two that are invisible.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.790
They are tasked with
controlling the universe

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.420
and keeping order on Earth.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
There is this belief in Taoism
and Chinese culture in general

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.750
that the supernatural
world takes

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.920
the shape of a
bureaucratic empire,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.290
and there is a very
detailed hierarchy

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.330
with ranks and bureaus.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.000
And the fact that these are
known as the nine emperor gods

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.960
show that are very
high ranking gods

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.330
in this celestial
bureaucracy, and that they

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.080
do have a very
important function

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.670
of governing basically
the celestial realm,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.500
but also the human realm.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.620
NARRATOR: In order to
assure the will of the gods

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.250
is honored for the upcoming
year, select devotees channel

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.170
and even embody the nine
emperor gods during the festival

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.920
processions.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.790
There are typically about
nine spirit mediums who

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.120
enter a trance and then channel
these gods to bring them down

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.380
and to keep them very
content and happy.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.880
The reason why it's
crucial to keep them happy

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.960
is because they keep
an account, a record,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.880
of everything that
happens on Earth.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.380
They control human destiny.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.540
At the end of the nine days,
when the festival reaches

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.040
its climax, the gods
eventually return to the stars

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.710
from which they came.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.670
NARRATOR: Curiously, this
idea of nine gods or overlords

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.960
watching over earth can
be found in cultures

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.420
throughout the world.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.830
The Aztecs of Mesoamerica were
known to worship nine gods

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.380
called the Lords of the Night.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.580
In the Norse tradition, nine
gods survived the Ragnarok,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.830
or earthly destruction.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.880
According to Buddhist
legend, the emperor Ashoka

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.540
consulted with a
secret society called

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.920
the Nine Unknown Men,
who were said to possess

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.670
the knowledge of the universe.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.380
The ancient Etruscans
of Italy also

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.210
believed in nine gods that
could be persuaded to influence

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.250
the fate of mankind.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.920
And in Greek mythology, Zeus
led a council of nine gods

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.960
created to oversee humanity.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.040
The canonical Olympian gods
are imagined to be about 12,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.580
and they have a sort of
governing body as well,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.120
and so they have a council.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.710
For the most part, the nine
most important gods are there.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.120
Sitting at the top
of that is Zeus.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.540
These make up sort of the
power structure of the heavens,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.290
and they occasionally meet
to determine what they're

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.290
going to do about mankind.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.540
Zeus created the
Council of Nine

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.790
and this was Aphrodite, Apollo,
Athena, Diameter, Hephaestus,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.120
Hera, Hermes, Poseidon,
and Zeus himself,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.170
and these are the gods that
then could interact with humans

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.790
I guess to keep us in line.
