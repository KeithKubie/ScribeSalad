00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; I think in the short answer, I think that
China will be able to pull

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.330
the economy out of the crisis.
And I reason I say that is because that in

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.030
for the GDP growth in China
had reached certain percent in the first half

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.230
of the year, and we see
that significant economic stimulus package

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.390
in China.
Just to talk about 3G in China, it would create

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.489
a one trillion R&amp;B, you
know, of GDP growth this year.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.250
So that I think that also is a lot of growth
in the consumer demand in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.559
China, so I think that will help China economic
definitely will help,

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.530
the situation the world economic in a much
healthy way in the longer

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.690
term.
