1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:01,960
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,260
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:08,220
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast, and ahhh.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:10,710
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,360
Yeah.
I'm just checking in on you.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,270
Just checking in to see how your
day's going and give you a quick,

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,300
some fucking half hour laughs.
You know,

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,780
keep me in your thoughts
and in your prayers.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,040
you're in. I've thought senior in our
prayers. Speaking of that. Houston, Texas.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,930
All right. I got a warning for everybody.
All right. Dan is going to be all

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,500
whole

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,060
bunch of people making money off
that fucking devastation down there.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,350
Yeah.

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,701
All right.

16
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:44,570
Be careful where you send your money in
because people are going to make videos.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,960
They're going to have your bottom lip
quivering. You're gonna feel bad for them.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,130
And the family fucking dog just makes
sure it's getting to those people.

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,920
New York Times put out
lists of shit that's legit.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,733
All right.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,100
Fucking sat there and somebody sent me
something of this woman saying she was a

22
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:08,990
single mom with two kids. Right.
And uh, I didn't know what the dope,

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,620
it's like, do I send,
does this get to you?

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,730
Is there a bald hairy back
guy on the other end of this?

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,380
So I'm sticking with the Red Cross.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,133
You know,

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,570
as I was looking at all those,
I just kept hearing that song.

28
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:27,500
How do I know that y'all really drown in,
right?

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,530
How do I fucking know?
How do I know this is not a scam?

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,980
Because people are such pieces of Shit Uk,

31
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,980
they will actually like I want to fuck,

32
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,530
I swear to God they could literally take
it when they find those fucking people,

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,340
they find those people. They should,
they should take all the money back,

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,520
give it to the victims. And when
the neck, next hurricane comes,

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,540
you dropped those fuckers right in the
middle of it, right in the middle of it.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,540
And then when they cry for help,
nobody sends them fucking help.

37
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,291
That's what they should do.

38
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,040
The kinds of pieces of the shit that
would fucking take advantage of people

39
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,720
during a situation like
that. So, um, yeah,

40
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,250
I would donate to the Red Cross.

41
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm not going to tell you whether I'm
donating or how much of doting it,

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,250
cause I'm sick of fucking people
talking about that. You know,

43
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,780
I like donate in Beijing named Kenny Kenny
Kenny, and not make it about yourself.

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,970
Fucking celebrities. Gee, what,

45
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:22,100
what would they be doing if they weren't
making everything about themselves?

46
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,250
Somebody else's absolute
fucking devastation becomes
an opportunity for them to

47
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,660
show how fucking amazing they are.

48
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,110
Ah,
okay.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Fucking horrific.
Anyways,

50
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,510
I shot nine holes of golf
when I was back east.

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,310
It was bag each leads your new family,
Baker's yeast and um, you know,

52
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,580
I love going out and playing golf. I let
him go out there. There's a force him,

53
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:49,060
everybody's talking Shit, I'm smoking
a cigar. I'm having a good time.

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,100
I don't keep score.
I don't give a fuck.

55
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,100
I think I got a 27 combined in the
first two holes. I was just, you know,

56
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,670
yeah, I go, I do like John Daly. Like
I don't, I don't sit there in line,

57
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,370
the Goddamn ball up.
I'm gonna waste everybody's fucking time.

58
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,280
I just walk up and hit it. I take
one practice swing, that's it.

59
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,740
Then I hit the fucking thing.
All right.

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,750
I just fucking wind up and you know, I
hit it straight. It just doesn't go for.

61
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,440
So, uh, those guys started giving me tips.

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,520
I started listening to him and I just
kept picturing how they swing on TV,

63
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,300
keep that front arm straight, you
know, keep your leg down, you know,

64
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:29,290
that type of shit. And I ended
up doing all right. You know,

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,780
I started breaking eight on holes.
I hate when they go,

66
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,810
you can't score more than an eight on
a whole. It's like, Oh yeah, watch me,

67
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,950
watch me. I'll still be 200 yards from
the hole, taking fucking shot number nine.

68
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,240
All right. That, that is, that
is a fucking myth, my friend.

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,280
It has to do with like handicaps or
something. It's just yet another way,

70
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,670
you know,
so there's no cheating or whatever.

71
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,730
It's the biggest fucking cheat and game.

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm trying to think. Other than like,
you know, business. Um, so anyways,

73
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,950
I got down to the last hole I got,

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I got like a seven on the eighth hole
was psych that I broke eight and then on

75
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,381
the last hole was a par four and I
shot a four sank a 30 fucking Florida.

76
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,870
Was that all right? It's all
right. And once again I just,

77
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,190
and then the guy who I was playing with,

78
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,780
the oldest guy in our group was like
looking like it was pushing 60 and he shot

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,240
potty pee part for nine holes.
Once again, proving it's not a,

80
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,660
it's not a sport, it's a
game. It's a fucking game.

81
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,230
There's no way it's 60
you know what I mean?

82
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,250
That's like the basketball equivalent is
still being able to dunk when you're 60

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,920
you know, and I don't mean
cause you're seven feet tall.

84
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:49,510
I mean you're like fucking six three he
used to throw it down a little bit back

85
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,600
in the day and then he come back for the
old timers game and you still fucking

86
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,560
dunking.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,730
He is still dropping 30 and then you're
doing it on people like 20 years younger

88
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,950
than you get the fuck out of here.
Um,

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,980
but I got to admit I really didn't join
somebody finally explained that why you

90
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,190
tee the ball up high?

91
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,740
I would teed up high and then try
to hit it flush with the club.

92
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,160
I didn't know you kind of swung
underneath it. That was a game changer.

93
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,970
And uh,
that was the,

94
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:21,410
I dunno my shit as I stink kitten
off the ground on the fairway.

95
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:22,340
I'm not good at that shit.

96
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:27,341
But I feel like I could take a couple
of lessons and I could go out there and

97
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,090
not embarrass myself.

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,233
MMM.

99
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,270
I only lost,
I only lost one.

100
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,540
I think two balls in nine holes is
pretty good for someone who never fucking

101
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,720
plays my pat myself.
Am I making this about myself?

102
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,220
Am I pulling some fucking move here?

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,640
Do you know how much money I donated to
that golf course when I saw all those

104
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,910
white men out there?
I knew I had to do something.

105
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:53,830
Um,

106
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,830
that's why I created the fun for this
cause named after me with my face on it

107
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,960
because I care. Um, all right,

108
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,670
why does this thing always do this to me?
And then I put,

109
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,180
I typed in the wrong fucking
password, didn't I? And Go
fuck yourself. God dammit.

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,240
All right. So yeah, so I, you know,
something, I actually enjoy golf.

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,700
I don't have the fucking time
for it, but I do enjoy it. Um,

112
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,170
I also,
uh,

113
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,500
was fucking with my first drum kit I
ever had and it's amazing now that I

114
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:33,080
actually know how to tune up the drums.
I've got the snare to sound great,

115
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,020
but my fucking base from,
I don't know what was going on with it.

116
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:40,600
There was like this vibration of
something, no idea what it was.

117
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,730
Maybe, you know, it's one of
those that's an old school.

118
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:46,150
Slingerland maybe I didn't have the,
uh, you know, he has the clause on it,

119
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:49,030
which sucks because if you're
gonna do like a quarter turn,

120
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,340
those ones that are on the ground,
you can't fucking do it.

121
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,150
You just got to be a guy. We're just
going to leave those ones alone. But, um,

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,230
I got the toms in the snare to sound good.
The bass drums, the last fucking thing.

123
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,210
Then I need to learn how to tune up and
then I have a nice jump off and I think

124
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:06,790
I'll actually someday actually be
able to tune up a set of drums.

125
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:11,110
Make him sound about right. That's the
goal anyways. That is the goal, you know,

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,240
shooting less than an eight when I go
out and golf every seven years and being

127
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,310
able to a fucking set of drums by the way.

128
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,450
Yeah.

129
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,150
Speaking of that Queens of the stone age,
his new album,

130
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:28,180
have you listened to it yet? Jesus
Christ. It's fucking amazing.

131
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,560
Listen to it twice. I loved it the first
time. It was even better the second time.

132
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,450
And um, you got, I don't know,
you don't have to check it out.

133
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:39,610
I'm just saying if you
like fucking great music,

134
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,560
I would definitely check that out.
That's what I've been listening to.

135
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,460
But listening to that and um,
what's his face there?

136
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,530
Where the fuck is my phone?
I can't remember anything anymore.

137
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,900
The fuck is that guy's name?

138
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,430
Yeah.

139
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,110
The Guy who sings a
Mala visa on file.

140
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,410
Yeah.
Uh,

141
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,010
[inaudible] the fuck is his name.

142
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,570
Okay.

143
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,530
Yeah. Jesus Christ. I gotta look up dream
weaver. Weaver. No. So when I got to do,

144
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,110
we'll, we'll, we'll drink Gary. Right?

145
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,950
Gary writes album the fuck's
the name of the album here.

146
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,830
Okay.

147
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,670
It's called the dream. We are no Nada. Is
that the, what's called the dream weaver?

148
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,360
It's under soft rock,
but we don't want,

149
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,750
Andy knew mach one of my new favorite
fucking drummers plays on it and he's

150
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,020
unbelievable. I just wished the
drums are more up in the mix.

151
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:39,650
Something about like drums in
the fucking seventies they just,

152
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,590
it was like they had a towel
over the entire fucking kid.

153
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,780
They can't hear anything. I'm once again,
the genius of John Bonam to be like,

154
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:52,770
dude, fuck that. You can't
hear the drums. I wish.

155
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:57,630
I wish they would remaster that fucking
album and bring Andy's drums up so I can

156
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,100
hear him.
It's fucking incredible.

157
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,640
Incredible player and
everybody sleeps on that album.

158
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,930
Everybody just downloads Dreamweaver and
love is alive. Can't find the is great,

159
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,320
let it out is great blind feeling.

160
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,210
I, if it's a fucking tremendous album and
what he wanted to do evidently was good

161
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,981
to get away from that.

162
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:21,420
You wanted to have like a fucking get
away from everything being guitar based.

163
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't think it's soft rock though.
Some of it is, but not all of it.

164
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,020
It's got some balls.
Right.

165
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,610
Does anybody know what I'm talking about
or who I'm talking about? Probably not.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,070
Oh,
look who's in town this week.

167
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:38,760
The Boston Red Sox had going to
the fucking New York Yankees.

168
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,200
I got two of my buddies. I'm Ben, 50 bucks
a game for the rest of the year. I'm up,

169
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,630
I'm up a hundred on both
of them. Uh, am I? Yeah,

170
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,200
I think I might put 100 bucks on both
of them. So I'm up 200 bucks total.

171
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,620
So I went to lose a hundred depending
on if the red sox win or lose.

172
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:59,910
So worst case scenario, I'm down
200 bucks this weekend, I believe.

173
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,560
I think that's what it is, right?
Yeah. That's what the fuck it is. Um,

174
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,810
I'm hoping we've been playing great.
They got swept,

175
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,450
but they played the fucking Indians.
The Indians are on fire.

176
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,960
So we'll see what happens. We're back
up to a five and a half game lead.

177
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:16,390
I'm loving that. And who knows? With
any luck we'll play the Yankees and the,

178
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,940
and the fucking playoffs hasn't
happened in a long time since 2004.

179
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,060
If I was a giants fan, I would
bring that up all the time. Um, Eh,

180
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,920
you remember when you
champion 15 years ago,

181
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,160
I believe one championship since
then. Yeah. But it doesn't matter.

182
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,400
You can do it that year.
Um, like Yankee Fan.

183
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,890
So you give a shit about 2004 considering
you one in 2009, does it really hurt?

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,360
You know what I mean? Exactly.
All right. So, um, all Billie,

185
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,690
no fun. 14 fucking days, no booze.

186
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,010
Once I get this far out in front of it,
once I get this far out in front of it,

187
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,770
I could literally go a year,
um,

188
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,330
you know, I could go the rest of my
fucking life. I just don't choose to,

189
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,620
you know, it's fun. I enjoy it,

190
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,940
but fortunately I don't have that fucking
chemical thing that I already talked

191
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,660
about this because I've started this
podcast like 19 times because I'm never

192
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:19,860
funny generally. And I'm really not
funny on days when I fucking fly.

193
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,280
Um,
so I'm 14 days in.

194
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:26,430
I did real good with the Eaton when I was
back east for the first couple of days

195
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:29,550
in the last two days I've
fucked up, uh, in a major way.

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,310
Lots of pizzas and that type of shit.
Um,

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,060
I went to my favorite pizza
spot twice and then, uh,

198
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:40,680
I got this other new spot where I got to
have them free some fucking pizzas for

199
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:45,660
me and I'm trying to send them out here
through dry ice and all that bullshit.

200
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,070
We'll see what the fuck happens
and we'll see if it happens. Man.

201
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,250
Um,
should I read some at this point?

202
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,170
Is that what I should do?

203
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,370
I think I've talked about everything that
I promote the surf ballroom and clear

204
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:04,240
Lake Iowa, by the way, it November 5th,
I think is when I'm going to be there.

205
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,140
That's where buddy Holly,

206
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,190
the big Bopper in Ritchie Valens last
plate and be there with Dean del Ray.

207
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,990
And I know I brought this up on Monday,

208
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,020
but I got to keep promoting this fucking
date because they don't do a lot of

209
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:18,850
standup dates. I'm performing there
because I'm a fan of music and uh,

210
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,060
I always wanted to see that it's like a
museum slash place where you can perform.

211
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,760
So I was like, why don't I just fucking
do both and make a little bit of money?

212
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,090
I get to see this, they get to pay
my respects. You know what I mean?

213
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:28,990
But I will tell you what,

214
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,840
I am not going to be playing any of that
fucking music that night cause I'm sure

215
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,841
everybody who works there is so God
damn sick of here in a pigsty you eggs.

216
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,190
Do you pick the big seat? I'm
not going to do the team. Um,

217
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,950
I'm going to do the, uh, the movie
version of it to Gary Busey version of it.

218
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,850
You know, just to switch
things up for you. All right.
What am I doing here? Let's,

219
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,300
uh, by the way, it's about
people given Donald Trump shit.

220
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,430
Whenever there's a
fucking natural disaster,

221
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,410
they always give the standing
president shit. Like,

222
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,280
like what is he fucking Zeus as he
supposed to stop it from happening?

223
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,133
You know,

224
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,290
I heard something today that one of the
problems was who's one of the people

225
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,300
that developed in Houston?

226
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:14,500
They paved over a bunch of wetlands that
would have absorbed a lot of that water,

227
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,640
which then got them talking about
how out here in La that they've,

228
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,950
they've built over land that was just,
it's just going to disintegrate, you know,

229
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:28,420
whenever we have a big earthquake or
something. Um, cause they were like, well,

230
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,180
what do we do about out here now that
we saw what's going on in Houston,

231
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,520
what should we do out here? I'm like,
there's no fucking hurricanes out here.

232
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,120
But there's always something. The old
earthquakes, Ernie Aaron, when Aaron,

233
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,860
he comes to town, um,
shaking everything up, right?

234
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,850
It's like your absentee father comes
off the road after a fucking three year

235
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:49,030
bender starts telling you to
make your bed. You're like,

236
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,580
I ain't fucking doing that. Then he
beats you like he doesn't even know you.

237
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,680
That's what an earthquake is like. Um, all
right, let's read some advertising here.

238
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,250
Okay. What do we got here? Oh,
Jesus. These people are new. Sooth.

239
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,620
Do you play sports or workout a lot?

240
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,820
Talk about how sore you can get from
that and now I can trigger injuries.

241
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,200
Why? Why isn't this shit ever edited
under the fucking reading? Oh,

242
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,680
I played golf this weekend. It's now
this week. It's not really a sport.

243
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,230
It's an activity.
I felt fine after.

244
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,910
It's certainly after I fucking sank
that 30 foot. Uh, I do work out.

245
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:29,590
I fucked up my, uh, my shoulder,
you know? Yeah. It's annoying

246
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,710
that I talk about it long
enough. All right. Lead into
your personal endorsement.

247
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,030
Talk about your personal
experience with your sooth massage.

248
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,140
I don't even know what it is. I haven't,
I haven't. How relaxed you are afterwards,

249
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,090
how easy it was to book, how excited
you are for the next booking, et cetera.

250
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,780
All right. Now, now that
after they wrote me all that,

251
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,640
I guess I'm supposed to look at
this shit before do this, sue.

252
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,640
There's an on demand
massage service. Wow. Jeez.

253
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,930
Oh Jesus. Now. Okay.

254
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,100
Do you get to see what you must
Seuss looks like he is swiping left.

255
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:13,130
What's going on here? Huh? Sue?

256
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:18,131
There's an on demand massage service
that delivers a hand selected,

257
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,790
licensed and experienced
massage therapists to you
in the comfort of your own

258
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,860
home hotel or office in
as little as an hour.

259
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,020
Sue's shows up.
I'm sure these people are above board,

260
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,870
but you know there's always a couple
of dirty cops out there that will take

261
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,770
bribe money. Sue, there's
an odd man or you read that.

262
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,410
Um, sue the shows up with everything.
They bring the massage table,

263
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,131
the sheets,

264
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:48,131
the oil and even music to
drown you out at the end.

265
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,970
Ah, so you can unwind no matter
where you are. I'm sorry,

266
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm being really immature. Really
mature. This is all above board.

267
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,520
There's no fucking way we would,
we would do something like that.

268
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,880
You choose to kind of massage
you want from Swedish and sport,

269
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:08,050
the deep dish and more. They just
fucking lob in this over the Internet.

270
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,840
You can even opt for couples
massages. Alrighty. Here we go.

271
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,220
Get a little fucking freaky,

272
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,540
set the length of your massage and uh,

273
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,800
get to also pick the gender
of your therapists are
right for the homophobes out

274
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:22,280
there.

275
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,280

half times what they make at as spa while

incredible schedule flexibility.

277
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,310
That means you can even book a
massage for 10:00 PM on a Wednesday.

278
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,210
This also brings the best
therapists to the PSU.

279
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:45,680

Soothed, Spock quality massage
anytime, anywhere. You know,

289
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,670
if they can legalize weed,

290
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:32,780
why can't they just legalize a hand
job at the end of a fucking massage?

291
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,470
You know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.

292
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,370
And just so like the women wouldn't
get all fucking upset because God,

293
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:43,400
they should have some for women too.
But I'm just saying like, oh my God.

294
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,740
Well it starts with dad
named white yet touching her.

295
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,520
Just have him strap you down like a
fucking La bottomy patient and you know,

296
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,390
and then that's it. Then you
can't touch him. Right. Um,

297
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,280
do you know how much mobile peaceful
the fucking world would be if every guy

298
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:02,640
started the day with the massage in a
fucking hand job? Do you know much more?

299
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:06,750
We would listen to you. I mean, and I
don't mean to be a fucking asshole here,

300
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:10,320
but ladies, we've been asking you to do
this for us for years. And evidently,

301
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,940
you know, after two, three months
into the relationship, it's out. It's,

302
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:18,660
it's not your pay grade anymore.
Okay.

303
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,410
And what's funny is you can,
you could,

304
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,610
you fucking ladies are going to come
at me like I'm a fucking animal.

305
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,900
Despite the fact,
you know,

306
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,660
this is how guys are wired and
you use it to your advantage.

307
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,280
Whenever you want to
fucking rounded drench,

308
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,530
you fucking let the girls
out a little bit. Right.

309
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,370
You look at somebody just long enough for
them to fucking throw down their card.

310
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,750
You get your drink and then he'd go,
oh,

311
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,960
excuse me that I have a very
important call over this way.

312
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,560
Would that table just opened up? Um, yeah.

313
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,030
And if elected had jobs at Deanna,

314
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,750
massages would be made legal provided
the male was strapped down by the rest.

315
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,763
Yeah.

316
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,020
Um,

317
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,520
can you get to have like
an express massage window
when you don't have time for

318
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:08,660
the full body massage and you just pull
up like those drive through Starbucks

319
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,980
with like your dick out and some,

320
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,070
some chick just reaches out and
fucking rubs went out. There you go.

321
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:17,860
Then you fucking drive to work, you know,
cause she's stopping at the yelled at,

322
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,700
at that point,
what the fuck do you care?

323
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,670
You know?
Yeah.

324
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,790
I hope women don't get offended
by this. I am who's kicked? No,

325
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,850
I don't give a shit. If you do or not, but
you know, rather than look down at med,

326
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,730
why don't you understand,
you know,

327
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,580
and try to have empathy and understand
what it is that we're going through.

328
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,050
Oh my God, that would be fucking
tremendous. Drive through fucking massage,

329
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,250
you know what I mean? And then, so you
know, this is what would shut it down.

330
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,640
Some dope would also try to add a coffee
machine to it and eventually someone

331
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:50,610
would spill coffee on the Dick and that
would be just a fucking lawsuit that

332
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,520
would take the whole industry
down. All right. I don't know.

333
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm just brainstorming
here. Alright. [inaudible]

334
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,833

336

I'll keep quiet. I won't
shout. If we can be legal.

337
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,360
Why not?
Bad Job.

338
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,990
And when you come in,
you're fucking Soffe shorts out.

339
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,540
Jesus that went off the rails.

is hard to find. Yeah.

342
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,430
Especially if you're a fat fuck like me.
You know what I mean?

343
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,600
Let's not blame the underwear here.

out of pickups. Where is he?

427
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,260
The new APP device uses color coding
to help passages find their drivers.

428
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,080
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week
plus tips. You want to earn more money,

429
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,920
drive more, or drive more. It's never
been easier to give yourself a race.

430
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,680
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers being happy passengers.

431
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:29,980
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft
rides get a perfect five star rating.

432
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,960
Go to lift.com/burger today and you
can get a $500 new driver bonus.

433
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,520
That's lyft.com/bar

434
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,240
lyft.com/burr or limited time
only terms do apply. All right.

435
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm laying on the floor
and my fucking back.

436
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
I'm trying to fix that
fucking crib downstairs.

437
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,093
Ugh.

438
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,410
So the thing, once your kid just gets
over like fucking seven, eight months,

439
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,940
you know, it's just like you picking
up this sack of potatoes. You don't,

440
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:01,950
you didn't have a squat down to do it
right? You bend at the waist, right?

441
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:06,530
Blowing out your lower back
is the fucking worst. Um,

442
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,210
all right,
what the hell did I want to talk about?

443
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:12,810
Was there anything to talk about beyond

444
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,190
okay,

445
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,580
what everybody else is talking about?
I try to stay outside of all of that.

446
00:26:17,581 --> 00:26:21,450
You know what I mean? Everybody's
like, you know, talking about it,

447
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:24,360
raining down in Houston, right.
The hurricane and all of that shit.

448
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:26,520
Am I going to be yet another file?
I guess I already did.

449
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,110
Yeah.

450
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,050
But I did it in a way. I actually told
you to watch out for these fucking scams.

451
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:32,550
How do,
right,

452
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,260
you always got to ask that because I
gave a bunch of money to that wounded

453
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:40,530
warriors thing and then I got all this
information that it was a fucking scam.

454
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,800
I don't know if it is a not, but there
was enough fucking articles that it was,

455
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,920
and it made me nervous that allegedly
that's what they were doing over there.

456
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,050
And that fucking turned
me off to charities that,

457
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,030
that they could possibly be
somebody out. And then, you know,

458
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,960
watching that pink lady in the NFL.
So make sure you fucking money,

459
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,411
you know,

460
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:04,150
gets to the people speaking in which
Ron White is doing a gig out in Austin,

461
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:06,240
Texas.
Um,

462
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,560
he's going out with some
other comedians in all,

463
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,050
all the proceeds are going
to be going to, uh, you know,

464
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,700
help out the people there in Houston.
Um, so there's a good one you can go to.

465
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,580
All right. I wasn't able to
make the GIG and I said, well,

466
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:25,150
who should I make the checkout
to? He said, Red Cross. All right.

467
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,040
So then I looked it up. Is the Red
Cross? I know, I saw him on mash.

468
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,590
Are they reputable? And they checked
out. They are reputable. So there you go.

469
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,430
All right. And with that, I am
completely out of shit to talk about.

470
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,390
I don't know what I've talked about cause
I've started this fucking podcast 15

471
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:46,630
fucking times. I have no
goddamn idea. You know,

472
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,500
so I don't know what to tell you people
other than this is the end of this

473
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,540
podcast right here.
But even though it is the end,

474
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,630
I'm going to continue to talk for another
fucking two minutes and three seconds.

475
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,110
Contractually obligated to do
a half hour here. All right,

476
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,690
there you go. You want to get
fucking first world problem.

477
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,810
I got bumped up to first
class, right? And, uh,

478
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,010
they sat me in the last
row right by the bulkhead,

479
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,200
so my fucking seat didn't
recline, you know, and that,

480
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:21,340
ladies and gentlemen is a classic example
of Code Lotion. Remember Cold Lotion?

481
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:24,670
I'm bringing it back.
Cold Lotion,

482
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,310
classic example of fucking cold lotion.
If you don't know what it means,

483
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,660
it's in the urban dictionary.

484
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,700
It's basically somebody gives
you something nice, but it
fucking sucks. It's like,

485
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:38,670
hey, somebody says, well, I'm puts it,
you know, your back's all dried out.

486
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,760
Your wife goes, Hey, can you put some
lotion on your back? You Go, absolutely.

487
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,290
She goes, thank you sweetie. But you know,

488
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,040
warming up in your hands yet you just slap
it right on her back. She's like, Nah.

489
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,960
Right, right there as some fucking cold
lotion. You get bumped up to first class,

490
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,110
you're in the last row. You seats
up against the bulkhead. See,

491
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,020
you can't fucking lean back.
Cold fucking lotion.

492
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:02,190
But I'll tell you what I watched.
Uh, I watched three movies,

493
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:05,170
two and a half movies. I watched, um,

494
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,960
founder starring Michael Keaton about,
uh,

495
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,760
how the whole Mcdonald's franchise
came about. And it was fantastic.

496
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:17,850
Movie, loved it. Then I
watched the original alien,

497
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,760
which totally holds up
other than their computers,

498
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,850
cause what's fucking hilarious
as they're flying through space,

499
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:27,930
doing shit we still can't do today.
But like the computers, you know,

500
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,640
it looks like fucking war games.
I know it's 1979 technology.

501
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,970
MMM. But everything about
movie was fucking awesome.

502
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:40,870
And Sigourney weaver was fucking bad ass
and everybody should have listened to

503
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:45,310
her. That fucking, I can't
say what happens. You know,
they didn't listen to her. Um,

504
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,320
she falls,
she wanted to follow protocol.

505
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,390
And then I watched the beginning of
chips because I wanted to see, uh,

506
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,350
I wanted to see the motorcycles. You
know, it's a couple of two counties.

507
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:59,770
That was cool. And then the plane
landed and then that was fucking it.

508
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,480
That was it. But I saw two good moods.
I didn't watch enough for chips to know.

509
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,800
You know, all I wanted to see is where
Erik Estrada was going to be in it. Right.

510
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,450
And John Baker, Larry Wilcox, you
know, they had to be in there. Right.

511
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,080
And I bet the sarge was there.
Baby Grossman. What about Berry?

512
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,650
You know,
you know what they should've done.

513
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,570
They should've put fucking
what's her face in them? Uh,

514
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,740
Caitlyn Jenner. Bruce Jenner did a
couple of seasons on that fucking thing.

515
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,380
Ben
[inaudible].

516
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,180
Fuck, I made it 30 minutes. There you
go. That's your podcast for this week.

517
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,070
I apologize. I know this one stunk. I
just, I suck when I'm on. I'm on a plane.

518
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,960
You know what I mean? I just, I don't
know what the fuck it is. I just, uh,

519
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,880
it just never seems to work out for me.
A separate bottle,

520
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:57,780
breathing dirty air, not
being able to recline my seat.
I have no idea. All right.

521
00:30:57,781 --> 00:31:02,130
That's it. That's the podcast. Thank
you everybody for, uh, for listening.

522
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,460
Enjoy the music. And now
we're going to play some, uh,

523
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,520
classic Thursday afternoon
podcast just before Friday.

524
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,320
Whatever the fuck I call this thing.
Um, enjoy the greatest hits. All right.

525
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,860
That's it. Have a great
weekend. You can't, and uh,

526
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:18,450
I'll talk to you later.

527
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,210
Do you ever get nostalgic for the
90s? If so, what part of the 19th.

528
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,560
Can you have your podcast guy used?

529
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,180
The friends theme song
for the Thursday podcast.

530
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:31,450
That's a question mark yet or
anything awesome from the 90s.

531
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,323
Uh,

532
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,313
[inaudible]

533
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,070
I dunno, I have the, have the
cock blocks all been defined,

534
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,280
like the different kind of cock blocks.

535
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't know if there's this
names for them, but I got a new,

536
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,600
I've got a new cock
block for you. Uh, this,

537
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,320
this cock block is very
special and a very obvious one.

538
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,710
And I think like this
happens all the time,

539
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:33,130
but for some reason I've never heard
anybody name it. So I'm, I'm gonna,

540
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:37,870
I'm gonna kick off the creative process.
I call this guy the announcer.

541
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,920
That's the,
uh,

542
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,580
that's, that's the name of this cock
block. This is what happened to me.

543
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,450
I was, I did a Gig in Jersey
and at the end of the night,

544
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:54,010
these two girls who waited to be at the
back of the line came up and they said,

545
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:57,190
hey, you want to go out and
get banana pancakes? You know,

546
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:00,040
making a reference to my joke saying
if I wanted to go out and hang out with

547
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:04,510
both of them. Right. And the
second day said it, I was like,

548
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:08,380
Holy Shit, here's a fucking,
here's something I never had.

549
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:12,400
Here's a two on one and I can't
fucking do it cause I'm with Nia.

550
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,980
Who's kidding?
Oh cool.

551
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,540
Not Cause I'm with Nia is
because everyone's got a
cell phone fucking camera.

552
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,374
And I get caught.

553
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,660
Honesty. Um, no, I couldn't deal
with the guilt. Um, uh, but I got it.

554
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,920
I'll be honest with you, and I
would say this, if Nia was here,

555
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:33,150
if two fucking tens came up to me and
said, let's do this. I, I, you know,

556
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,730
yeah, fuck it. Let's do it. I
never did it. You know, fuck it.

557
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,600
So anyways, so they said,
hey, you want to get a,

558
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:45,270
you want to go on and get bananas
and pancakes or something like that.

559
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,730
And then this fucking guy like 10
feet arrayed wages, it goes like, oh,

560
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,430
let's go. You know, those guys,

561
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,020
like if a girl just comes up to
you, just like, you know, you know,

562
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:00,630
I've always loved guys in
green shirts and your thinking,

563
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,000
raise your thinking like, holy
fuck, this is going to happen.

564
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,310
There's some other guy
like five. Yeah. Hey

565
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,820
and just makes the whole file the
whole fucking room. Look over at you.

566
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:13,590
The fucking announcer.

567
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,080
Fucking cock block mother fucker.
You know who would do that?

568
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,390
Yeah.

569
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,180
If I was standing there and I heard
two girls said to a guy and be like,

570
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,530
God damn,
it's going down right side of my mouth.

571
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,500
That blocky motherfucker I wouldn't be on.

572
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,293
Yeah.

573
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,800
Yes.
I mean why would you do that?

574
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,420
The fucking announcer. And if you
have a friend like that, all right.

575
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,340
The only way you can still hang out
with them is it. If he goes out,

576
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:50,080
if you guys are going
out trying to meet women,

577
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,650
he has to wear one of those old ABC
bright yellow Monday night football sport

578
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:56,554
coats.

579
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,873
Okay.

580
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,070
And if the girls, why is he wearing
that? You'll see. You'll see.

581
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,883
Okay.

582
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,930
And that'll be the, that would be
the funniest fucking thing ever.

583
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:08,500
Like if somehow if he couldn't figure
out the joke and he just thought the coat

584
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,750
look good and just the whole
night you just saw him.

585
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:15,140
Anytime you heard in the,
you know, 10 feet away,

586
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,680
what's this all about?
Hey,

587
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,800
just look over and you'd see this guy
dressed like Howard Cosell and you'd be

588
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,960
like, oh, that's the
announcer. He's the, he's the,

589
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,520
he's the guy he can cock block from.
Like, he's almost like a sniper.

590
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,930
If he wasn't so fucking loud, he's at
the same distance as a fucking marksman,

591
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,800
but he kills it with, uh,
with loudness. Oh my God.

592
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,860
Did that guy fucking annoy me?
Hey Mia, come here. Come here.

593
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,790
She just came and shaking her head.
You are loud.

594
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,460
What I am beyond,
come on over here.

595
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,580
I was just telling that story with
that Guy Cock blocked me with those two

596
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:57,630
chicks out in a Jersey where they
would just go with cock blocked you.

597
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,600
I told you this story.
No,

598
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,970
but you making it seem like you were
going to do something and no, no,

599
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,470
I wasn't going to do something.
This is the thing,

600
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,370
but I just admitted general cock blocking.
Yeah, but this is what I did admit.

601
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:12,060
If they were both tens, I would've,
I would've, I would've done it.

602
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,050
I never had a fuck two on one and you
know someone would you be that mad if they

603
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,170
were both smoking hot and
the cell phone video got out?

604
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,640
The video is even need to get
out when you got the announcer.

605
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,990
They the guy he just literally goes like,
yeah,

606
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:27,780
we'd like to get bananas and
Pancakes with Yoni Southern

607
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,343
[inaudible]

608
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,610
nothing. You're a jerk. Why
am I a jerk? So pajamas. Huh?

609
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,610
You are talking about cock
blocking and two, one one.

610
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:45,430
So what kind of podcast is this
turning into? You know what,

611
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:48,760
it's turning into a very honest podcast.
I was very honest.

612
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,140
I said this is good for you. This
is the thing I said I couldn't, uh,

613
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,990
I couldn't deal with the
guilt unless if they, if,

614
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,340
unless they were both Ted's, if they're
both fucking tends, give me a break.

615
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,680
Let me tell you something.
If you hooked up with Brad Pitt,

616
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,040
there's only so mad I could get.
Oh, it's fucking Brad Pitt. Okay.

617
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,350
Yeah. Good to know. Okay, well you
know what that would, that if I just,

618
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,800
if I just said some generic,
what a good looking guy.

619
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:18,490
If I just said some generic good looking
guy and you, and you just said that,

620
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:19,330
that would have scared me.

621
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,670
But the way you just acted like
you had Brad Pitt's phone number.

622
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:24,930
That doesn't scare me. Oh
really? Okay. It's going down.

623
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,830
And what if it's the like the regular
guy version of Brad Pitt. Is that okay?

624
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,100
Like he's just as good if you want to go
live out on the street and get the fuck

625
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:36,730
out of this house. Absolutely. But you're
allowed to have some sort of crazy two.

626
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:41,140
One one. Yes. That's bullshit. No it
isn't. It is. If you just, you know,

627
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,150
cause you're thinking on it on like, like
a, a very basic level. But if you really,

628
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,820
but if you really think about it, just
think about it. It makes sense. Bill,

629
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,830
you're not going to try to mind fuck me
into thinking that it's okay for you to

630
00:37:53,831 --> 00:37:56,230
have some sort of two on one
and I can, that's not, no,

631
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:59,290
it's not going down like that.
Yeah. But God, women are beautiful.

632
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,270
Where we lust after.
You would totally make sense.

633
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:04,870
You guys find like Dick's or weird.
They're gross. It's all hanging out there.

634
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:07,950
It's disgusting. You don't want
that. You know nothing about you.

635
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:08,680
You don't want that,

636
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,340
which has been proven time and time
and again and your stand up and in your

637
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,550
podcast. But that's a, that's another
discussion. You know what you,

638
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:19,510
you just set yourself up like you're
going to make some huge point and then you

639
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:22,330
just tapped out. You know nothing
about women but it doesn't,

640
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,960
but that's just another discussion and
I just don't want even to get into that.

641
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,720
So now what? You just gave me the face.
What are you doing today? Lazy. Huh?

642
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,870
What do you mean it?
Lazy Nini. Kubrick? Yeah.

643
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,350
I just filled my short film
over the weekend. Screw you.

644
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm working hard while you're in here in
your pajamas talking about two on ones.

645
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,300
Yeah. Well I have to do an hour's worth
of shit here. I'm coming up on it,

646
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,350
fill it up with whatever,
an hour and two minutes,

647
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:55,980
an hour to minutes. Have you done
your a dear viewer emails yet? Yeah,

648
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,180
I did.
You are listening or emails.

649
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,180
You did that already cause
you want to chime in? I Dunno.

650
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,380
What do you guys already did it? What
about overrated? Underrated. Didn't do it.

651
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,990
They didn't have any this
week. Oh, okay. Look at you.

652
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,410
I think you're a fan of
this podcast. No, I'm not.

653
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,080
Listen, it didn't go down. All right,

654
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,060
but I'm telling you right now,
Nia, if two tens come up to me,

655
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,670
it's going down. Okay. All right. Well
just be prepared for the retaliation

656
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,710
game set match. Really?
You're going to deny me that?

657
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,810
Can I just buy you some
stuff? Wow. Really? Yes.

658
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,530
Really?

659
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,400
Not some sort of fucking basketball
wife that can be placated with material

660
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:49,780
things to a point. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
If I'm going to be fucking honest here,

661
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,500
come on. This gotta be something
that I can buy. You know something.

662
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,860
This should be our Valentine's
Day. All right. For the guy,

663
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,270
the Guy Valentine's Day,

664
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,440
this is what Valentine's Day should be
every year is the guy gets a two on one

665
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,060
and then you get some nice stuff.
Well why can't I have it too on one?

666
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,140
Because you don't like that. What
do you mean? What do you know?

667
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,820
Women don't like sex?

668
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,540
You don't find like
when you guys fantasize,

669
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,990
you think about the guys in your life.
You don't think about other things.

670
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,240
Um, come on Nia. Just one. Just give
me one. You get one and I get one.

671
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:35,470
No you don't. You don't because you
don't want one. What do you mean?

672
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:39,080
I don't want you just being childish. No
I'm not. Yeah, you are. You do. You see,

673
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,550
see you think you think
you want to hook up with,

674
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,540
with Jake Gyllenhaal in a bread face,
whatever the fuck his name is. Brad Pitt.

675
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,610
Brad thread. Face pit. You
just think you do. See,

676
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,720
you know what to think about me is,

677
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,700
is like you have to hook
up with somebody famous.

678
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm actually just regular people. See
I'm down to earth with this shit. See,

679
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:02,570
that's what I'm saying. You like stuff
you like shiny, shiny things. Oh,

680
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,530
this is a deal. I get a two
on one and you, you get some,

681
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,120
some cracked up face old man
in Vegas like Robert Redford.

682
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,960
Like I used to be good looking
when Nixon was in office. No, no,

683
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,460
that's not how negotiating works.

684
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:17,740
Now you've got to come with
something else here. No,

685
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,400
I think we should both get an
equal opportunity thing going on.

686
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,630
This isn't an equal relationship. Why?
Why is it not an equal relationship?

687
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,531
Cause I wanted to,

688
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:29,950
I could pin you down to the ground right
now and tickle you until you passed out.

689
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:31,690
And there's not a fucking
thing you can do about it.

690
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,480
What did that has nothing to do with
anything. That's how the world works in.

691
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,090
Yeah. Why do you think America's
on top? Because we're right.

692
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,750
Well because we could. Oh, because?
Because we can blow you up more times.

693
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,210
So it's your,
your physical presence.

694
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,830
That's what makes it like an
unequal relationship. Yeah.

695
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,970
Cause I can beat you down.
Well maybe you're physically stronger,

696
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,130
but I'm mentally stronger than yeah.

697
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:52,630
Oh

698
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,440
snap. I'm smarter than you. Yeah.

699
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,570
So whatever physical power.
Let me ask you this.

700
00:41:58,571 --> 00:42:02,440
What do you have are trumped
by my mental fucking Goliath.

701
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,900
Notice those suck on that red.

702
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,030
Why do you think you're smarter
than me? Oh, that was good though.

703
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:13,420
You got a good one in a, now you're
storming off. I taught you. Well

704
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,430
[inaudible] man on needs of

705
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,720
[inaudible] all the way.

706
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,610
Hey,
what's going on?

707
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,060
It's Belper and this is the Monday
morning podcasts for Monday,

708
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,520
August 31st, 2009 and I am recording
this one from Stockholm, Sweden.

709
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,950
That's right. I'm a big shot
international traveler. You know,

710
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,740
not bad for some bomber. Used to work in
a warehouse. Stockholm, Sweden, people.

711
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,440
Um, I've been here for a week and uh,
it has been absolutely incredible.

712
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,790
I'm not going to lie to you.

713
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:23,530
It's one of the most beautiful cities
I've ever been to and has some of the most

714
00:43:23,531 --> 00:43:27,310
beautiful people I've ever seen.
And I'm not gonna lie to you.

715
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,250
I got to go with the Adolf
Hitler on this one. A,

716
00:43:30,251 --> 00:43:34,330
these are some good luck in sons of
bitches out here, you know? I mean,

717
00:43:34,331 --> 00:43:37,810
I don't think that's an excuse to go
out and try to eliminate all the other

718
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:42,430
races of people.
He took it a little far,

719
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,120
but I can definitely see what
he was enamored with. Like,

720
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,120
I'm not even kidding you like,
like these are some of the most,

721
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,480
even like the guys,
like I was walking down the street,

722
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:55,690
my girl and go look at that fucking guy.
Would you look at them?

723
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,630
How was that guy? Not famous stack.
I would be Brad Pitt and our country.

724
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,000
Look at them even. They are all people
are good looking. You know what?

725
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:09,750
All the younger dudes,
they all look like a, um,

726
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,430
who's that fucking dude with the,

727
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:15,060
with the Paul Mccartney haircut that
all the girls are screaming about.

728
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,600
He's got those Jim Breuer eyes,
you know,

729
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,320
those glassy eyes and he's got the
fuck and a Paul McCartney haircut.

730
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,650
I think it was in one of those
high school musical. I Dunno,

731
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,360
they all fucking look like
that except it's blonde and uh,

732
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,420
and I dunno. And then,
then the older guys,

733
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:39,640
they all look like fucking
like the bad guy in,

734
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:43,020
in a Mel Gibson 1980s movie,
you know,

735
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
something like that. And then the women
are just absolutely fucking ridiculous.

736
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,970
I saw this girl, uh, like, I
haven't even, you know, you,

737
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,550
when you walked down the
street with your girlfriend,

738
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,010
you try to like subtly look at women.
I was not doing that,

739
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,510
had absolutely no respect for,
I was just going, Jesus Christ,

740
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,040
and then she, she wouldn't even
punch me, but it was in the states.

741
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,980
She would fucking punch you. But here
she was just like, was, was that a VJ?

742
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,360
You know, it was that, uh, you
know, that just fucking gorgeous.

743
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:15,150
And I'm sitting there, I've
never felt like I had, uh,

744
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,640
that I was compromised genetically
until I came to a Stockholm, Sweden

745
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,170
and I was really starting
to get a complex.

746
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,090
But yesterday I took the subway or the,
the on the ground as they call it.

747
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,050
Do you want to find the underground?
Uh, they don't talk like that,

748
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,780
but that's my hacky foreign accent.
Um,

749
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,300
and I took the subway out of Stockholm,
Sweden, and I went to some of the, like,

750
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,390
it was almost like I got on the train
and I went up to the Bronx or like out to

751
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:45,930
queens.

752
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,780
And that's evidently where they
keep all their ugly people and a,

753
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,020
yeah, all of a sudden I felt
like I was in revere, you know,

754
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,990
or Medford. So there's
definitely some, uh,

755
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,350
there's definitely some struggling
people here. You know what,

756
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:02,100
you know what it looks like.

757
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,690
Like all his stock home looks like Soho
in New York where everyone's really

758
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:07,381
trendy,

759
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:11,850
really fashionably dressed and just
fucking ridiculously good looking.

760
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,930
And uh, you know, like I said,
I've never felt like, uh,

761
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,870
I've never felt like I should be
sleeping under a bridge before,

762
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,560
until I came out here.
But anyways,

763
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:28,350
so with that, I had one
show this weekend, um,

764
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,730
on the 29th, I was
working the, uh, I dunno,

765
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,190
some fucking theater, I forget
the name of it, but, uh,

766
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:38,670
I was all nervous because everybody over
here, even though they're bilingual,

767
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,400
you know, they, they fractions
fashion, fashion when they're
walking around, right?

768
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,260
So the comedians going on in front of
me are all up there, gone out loud,

769
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,630
shouting, shouting louder. Right. And
I'm fucking sitting back there going,

770
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,170
I don't think these people are going
to get what the fuck I'm talking about.

771
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:59,730
So fortunately I was smart and I,
uh,

772
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,020
I went up the night before my,
my theater Gig is what I did.

773
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,720
I went up the night before
and I kinda got all that,

774
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:11,700
like nervousness out and I was able to
figure out just a couple of things to

775
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:15,090
switch up.
Like I made a reference to kickball.

776
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,070
If you guys saw my tonight show set,

777
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,400
I did where I talk about the bankers
striking out playing kickball.

778
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,880
They don't know kickball over
here. So one of the other, uh,

779
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,600
comedians told me switch
it to soccer. I said, okay.

780
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,900
And just little adjustments like that.
So I kind of had an okay set,

781
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,140
um, Thursday, but I was really on my
fucking heels. I really felt like a freak.

782
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,890
Um, but then Friday came
along and um, I dunno, it was,

783
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,780
the theater wasn't packed.
It was sort of like maybe like half full.

784
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,020
So I have this weird psychological
thing where if a room is in full,

785
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,510
I don't feel nervous, but if
it's full, I feel nervous.

786
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,520
And it has nothing to do with numbers.

787
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,560
If you had a room that only held like
40 people and there was 40 people in

788
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,870
there,
I would feel a pressure to kill.

789
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,860
But if you stuck me in a theater
at that held like, you know,

790
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,850
700 people and there was
only 400 people there,

791
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,980
I would feel like I was
in this little last crowd.

792
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:22,030
So that's basically what happened.
And I went out and I had a great time,

793
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,470
destroyed, got a standing
ovation in the end and I was,

794
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:30,580
I can't even tell you how fucking
relieved I was because you know,

795
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:34,810
it took me 16 hours to get here from La.
So you really don't want to bomb.

796
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,790
And um,

797
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
one of the goals of coming over here was
to fucking destroy so that I can start

798
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:47,140
build building like a following
over here. Because, you know,

799
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,010
like most people,

800
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:51,790
I've always wanted to come to Europe
and see all this stuff over here,

801
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:55,210
but it be even better if I could come
over and make a little bit of money.

802
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,470
So that's Kinda my goal, you
know, going to start, you know,

803
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:01,690
getting a following over
here and I'll fly over here,

804
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:05,960
I'll make some kronas here in Sweden,
and then I'll go fucking blow,

805
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,930
blow it all in Italy or fucking
that Paris, if some shit,

806
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:15,910
why the fuck not right? Come over
here, drink like Ernest Hemingway,

807
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,560
act like I'm an actual fucking artists
rather than someone who curses every

808
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:24,130
other word. But, um, so this
is the funny part, right?

809
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:28,390
So I killed and everything was
great and I felt fantastic.

810
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,960
And then the next night, you know,
they go, well, hey, you know,

811
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,360
we're having this comedy festival,
this is big theater show.

812
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:38,320
It's going to be sold out even more
people who came out to your show,

813
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,900
do you want to do it? And
I said, yeah, fuck it.

814
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,610
I'll do it because I'll get
in front of more people.

815
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,490
Maybe they'll come to my show. And, uh,

816
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:50,020
like a fucking typical comic.
I couldn't just leave.

817
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:54,250
I couldn't leave on a high note. I had
to go for one more and I went up and a,

818
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,330
I only did okay.

819
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,970
Saturday night I came out
a little too cocky and, um,

820
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,110
I think I kinda came off like an ass.
I didn't suck, but it wasn't great.

821
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,820
But,
um,

822
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,900
I know it wasn't great because when
I got off one of the people was like,

823
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:12,280
how did you feel about that?

824
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,930
That's like, that's when, you
know, it could have been better.

825
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,060
It when they don't say great
job, when somebody says,
how did you feel about that?

826
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,080
Um, I dunno, I'm probably making a bigger
deal out of it than it was. But, uh,

827
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,400
but anyways, it was a, a,

828
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,120
it was a big success over
here and I really miss my
dog and I'm ready to go back.

829
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,900
I got one more day over
here today. And, um,

830
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,480
I actually went to a museum yesterday
and they have this, this, uh,

831
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,430
I can't explain what the fuck it
is basically in the 16 hundreds.

832
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,160
It's kind of a funny story. The, uh,

833
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:58,730
the king over here commissioned this big
battle ship to be built and it actually

834
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:02,820
had two gun decks. I think back in
the day. They only usually had one,

835
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,410
but they built two gun decks.
Literally. I like fuck.

836
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,430
And I counted when I want to
look at it like they had like,

837
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,710
like 20 some odd cannons on both sides.
It was absolutely huge.

838
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,320
The carvings and the woodworking in the
back of the ship. And you know, like the,

839
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,540
the little windows where you open up,
where you stick to the cannons out.

840
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:26,010
They had like these, these uh,
lion's heads carved in. I know,

841
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:28,620
I guess it was something
else to intimidate the enemy.

842
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,620
Like the fucking Canon's weren't enough.
You know,

843
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,970
I thought the 20 candidates were bad dude,
but they got a fucking,

844
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,530
they got a fake lion head and it doesn't
look happy, you know, so anyways,

845
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,770
so they commission have this ship
built so they build the fucking thing.

846
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,910
Everybody piles on the Goddamn thing.
They got the guns out and all this shit,

847
00:51:47,911 --> 00:51:48,590
you know,

848
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:50,540
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

849
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,130
I can go out in the bay.

850
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,950
So like a couple thousand people watch

851
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,520
and fucking sick.
Then I even got to use it.

852
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:06,390
It'd be like if you bought a brand new
car and you know you come home, do a,

853
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,660
what's it got got three 51 queen don't
fucking do a burnout and he just fucking

854
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,940
with like eight miles on the car,
you

855
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,030
wrap it around a pole.
And not only do you wrap it around a pole,

856
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:20,720
all your friends fucking watch.
And even though they're your friends,

857
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,380
you know they're fucking secretly happy
because they can't be happy for you

858
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,900
because you have a better car, which
means you're going to get better pussy.

859
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,240
So it's just in their DNA,
right?

860
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:34,241
So they fucking take this boat out
there and they say a squall came.

861
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,790
I didn't look up to see what a squall was.
Is that some sort of a storm?

862
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,990
Is it a gust of wind?
I know it isn't a rogue wave.

863
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,290
That's one of the worst
lines ever in a movie.

864
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,060
Did you guys ever see perfect storm?

865
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,800
A rogue wave evidently is like this
mini tidal wave that just comes out of

866
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,570
fucking nowhere. And a lot of times
it washes people off the boat. So,

867
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,460
um, most people are, you know,
they're not out to see like me.

868
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:03,290
So you have no idea what the fuck it was.

869
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:05,870
So if you just showed a
rogue wave and a movie,

870
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,830
if the seas were kind of calm and all
of a sudden this big wave out of fucking

871
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:14,410
nowhere, just washed a couple
people overboard, you, you,

872
00:53:14,411 --> 00:53:16,490
you would've been like me sitting
in the movie theater going,

873
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,630
what the fuck was that?

874
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:22,631
So they literally had to have
mark Wahlberg's character's
scream out rogue wave

875
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,880
as it comes in. Do you remember
that? Who would yell that out?

876
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,810
You know, what'd you yell
get, you know, get down or
whatever the fuck you'd, you'd,

877
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:38,400
you'd yell, Fuck Dude,
that's what you'd yell.

878
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,980
You wouldn't yell.
Like if someone pulled a gun on you and,

879
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:45,570
and started shooting at you,
you, you'd be screaming,

880
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,360
no running down the alley. You
wouldn't be like, you know, 38 special

881
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,620
anyways, let me fucking, let me,
let me plow ahead here. All right,

882
00:53:58,621 --> 00:54:01,440
so they send the ship out.
Everybody's standing on the shore.

883
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,340
Is everybody's all proud? Oh, do y'all
look at this size as they bought?

884
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,400
Look at these ions heads. Yeah. Right.

885
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:12,110
And the fucking thing is some
sort of squall hits it. Then they,

886
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,901
I don't know what happened.

887
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:17,901
It started to right itself
and then another one hit
it and it just fucking went

888
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:22,020
down. And when you got two decks
of guns, you go down quick,

889
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,400
like 50 people fucking drowned.
It was just a nightmare.

890
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,100
And evidently they had some sort of
stones at the bottom of the boat,

891
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:32,100
but they didn't have enough.
I think that's to make it
sort of sit in the water.

892
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,780
You don't really came across. It kind of
came across like a, what Chrysler said,

893
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,160
this Zukie Samurai was where it said a
tipped over at like two miles an hour

894
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,580
because of its center of gravity,
which evidently was a total fucking lie.

895
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,110
They just wanted to sell more jeeps.

896
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,450
But I think that that's
basically what happened.

897
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,250
They built this big grand
fucking boat and uh,

898
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,680
oh yeah, they had, they had
trials trying to figure out,

899
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:58,350
everybody was blaming each person.
But Anyway,

900
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:02,520
so the motherfuckers sinks to the bottom
of the bay and over time people kind of

901
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:06,400
forgot where the fuck it was.
And uh,

902
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,250
it stayed down there for 333 years
before they, they, they brought up,

903
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:12,061
somebody found it,

904
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,950
they brought it back up and it was
in pristine fucking condition. Jesus,

905
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,500
this is a long way to go. And me and my
girl went to the museum and we saw it.

906
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:19,981
I'm going to tell you,

907
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:22,140
it's one of the most amazing
fuck it things I've ever seen.

908
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,850
And which is funny because if you tell
anybody in Sweden that you're going to go

909
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:30,180
see it, they just laugh at
you. Because I guess his kids,

910
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:33,090
they always get dragged there and they
have to do book reports on it and they

911
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:36,750
fucking hate the thing. It's the typical
thing. Think about where you live.

912
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,850
Think about what the
tourist attractions are.

913
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,240
You never go to the tourist
attractions in your own town. Okay.

914
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:45,750
There's just something in human
beings DNA where you're like, dude,

915
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,680
I'm not standing in line in
my own fucking town. You know?

916
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,840
It's like when I lived in New York,

917
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:55,740
I never went to the statue of Liberty
or the empire state building unless some

918
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:59,820
friend of mine came to town
and they wanted to go and
I hated every second of it.

919
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,590
You know, that's basically the deal.
But if you ever go to Stockholm, Sweden,

920
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,330
I'm telling you, you have to
go. You gotta go, you know,

921
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,790
you got to go check it out if you're
into that type of shit. It was,

922
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,430
it was unbelievable.
I don't read a lot of this stuff either.

923
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:16,860
I was getting like sleepy when
I start reading the plaques.

924
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,030
I just like looking at the shit and the
little fucking boots that they have.

925
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,650
People were so small back then,
you know?

926
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,040
I always wondered if I could go
back in time, like the size I am,

927
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,370
if I would be like the
toughest guy in town, you know?

928
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:31,691
Especially if you've mentioned,

929
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:35,470
if you took like Jujitsu classes and
all the latest fucking fighting styles,

930
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,770
what a Goddamn Badass you
are. You'd be, you know,

931
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,800
now wait a minute.
They had like those fucking spiky

932
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,690
balls that were at the end of the chains.
All right.

933
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,320
Do I sound dumb enough to make this an
official fucking podcast? All right,

934
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,450
let's get on with the
podcast. Um, Oh, before I do,

935
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,750
I just want to thank everybody who
came out to my, uh, to my show at,

936
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:59,720
at rival arrive out of the
whoever the fuck you said. Um,

937
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,400
I had a great time and it was an absolute
thrill to go onto the other side of

938
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:08,030
the planet and actually have
people know who the fuck I was.

939
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,900
I haven't brought up my dog and somebody
in the crowd yelled out Cleo that there

940
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:14,840
was actually people who,
uh, listen to the podcast,

941
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:19,530
which was really awesome and fucking scary
all at the same time. I was like, yeah,

942
00:57:19,531 --> 00:57:24,080
I got a dog recently and somebody
yelled out, cleo. I was like, yeah,

943
00:57:24,081 --> 00:57:28,160
it was really, uh, you know, you'll
papers please. Yeah. You know,

944
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,620
there was that in somebody else was like,
what is that to do out here?

945
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,420
What should I be doing out here?
And some in the crowd fucking yelled out,

946
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,790
come to my house,
we'll have a party.

947
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,270
I'm not even exaggerating.
That's what it fucking sounded like.

948
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,230
And I wanted to record that guy and my
cell phone and have that as my outgoing

949
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:54,150
message that if you called me and it
went directly to my, my outgoing message,

950
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:57,630
that's what would come up rather
than, hey, this is bill. Uh, you know,

951
00:57:57,631 --> 00:58:00,630
leave a message. You can't,
you know, it was actually,

952
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:04,050
it would be him just going come
to my house. We'll have a party

953
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,313
boot.

954
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,680
All right, let's plow ahead here. Oh,

955
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:10,530
somebody actually informed me that
last week was the first time, uh,

956
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,120
in the history of my podcast,

957
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:17,100
I did an entire podcast without
using the word content. Um,

958
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,000
I don't know what that says
about that person, but a,

959
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:24,690
they're definitely into the podcast.
Okay. Um, let's move on here.

960
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:27,210
Getting on with the podcast. Uh, this is,

961
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:30,410
somebody sent me a really good
email about last week when I was,

962
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,430
I was going off on how,
um,

963
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,870
somebody had made fun of Ringo Starr
and said something to the effect of,

964
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:37,704
you know,

965
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,400
cause Ringo said that he wasn't going
to be signing anymore anything anymore

966
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:46,020
after like October, basically after
50 years of signing autograph,

967
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,220
the guys approaching 70 years of age,
his wrist is going to fall off.

968
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,510
He's probably going to die within the next
decade. Right. That's still a good run.

969
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,580
He wants to go do some shit.

970
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,630
So of course all the fans get
pissed and someone's like, you know,

971
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,180
we told us he wouldn't be famous.

972
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:08,040
And I was saying that that
was really a, a, an arrogant.

973
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,690
Did somebody just knock on the fucking
wall telling me to shut up on tissue

974
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:16,490
yelling? Yeah. Um, oh, go fuck
yourself. I'm doing a podcast. Um,

975
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,290
anyways, so I thought that that was
just an arrogant statement. Like,

976
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,220
like the fans,

977
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,810
like if it wasn't for the fans, he
wouldn't be famous. It's like, yeah,

978
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,700
totally discounting the man's talent.

979
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:31,280
He's considered one of the
greatest drummers of all time.

980
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:36,170
He inspired an entire
generation to play drums. Um,

981
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,310
I dunno.
So anyway,

982
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:40,310
I can't really even explain my point of
view because so much so many of my point

983
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,190
of views are just spur spur of
the moment, you know. So anyways,

984
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,250
the guy writes 'em on your last podcast,

985
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:49,130
you were talking about how the fans
don't make someone who they are.

986
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,580
The fans in this guy says,
the fans don't make someone talented.

987
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,410
You're right about that.
But without the fans,

988
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,320
all the talent in the
world doesn't mean Shit.

989
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,400
How many talented performers have faded
away because they failed to find an

990
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:02,234
audience?

991
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:06,500
How many Notel and hacks hacks are
making a living in entertainment in the

992
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,520
entertainment industry just because
they somehow managed to get a bunch of

993
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:14,780
mindless fucktard's to buy their crap.
Um,

994
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,510
uh, yeah, I mean you know some,

995
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,130
I understand what you say in
there and he brings up this,

996
01:00:20,131 --> 01:00:24,950
this great point of how, uh, that that
show carnival or Carney val, however, the,

997
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,920
however the hell you said it was
on HBO and he said to this day,

998
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,690
it's probably the second best show
they've ever had behind the wire but they

999
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:36,770
cancel the show up to two seasons claiming
that the DVD sales weren't sufficient

1000
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:41,450
to justify the amount of money they
were spending on making the show.

1001
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:42,320
Um,

1002
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,410
yet stale shit like 24 which is retelling
the same fucking story every goddamn

1003
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:47,930
years and its eighth season.

1004
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,580
Just being talented isn't what keeps
entertainers employed. The fans do.

1005
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,020
Okay. Now that's actually, that's
kind of a different argument.

1006
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:03,170
Okay. I was saying that fans are not
the reason Ringo Starr is famous.

1007
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:08,171
If you wanted to say like if it wasn't
for the songwriting ability of Paul

1008
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:14,030
Mccartney and John Lennon, Ringo Starr
might've ended up washing dishes,

1009
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,130
I would go with that.
I would definitely go with that.

1010
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,930
All right. And I can definitely
see that aspect of it.

1011
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:28,820
But to sit there and, and like put
it this way, if it wasn't for ACDC,

1012
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:32,660
I wouldn't have had a life
in my teenage years. Okay.

1013
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:37,661
And at no unknown level do I feel like
Angus and Malcolm should thank me for

1014
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:44,900
back in black for the success of back
black. They made a fucking killer album,

1015
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,663
you know,

1016
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:52,030
and they worked their asses off
on it and it was so fucking good.

1017
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,760
My ears couldn't ignore it.
All right. I'm not part,

1018
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:58,340
I wasn't part of this group of
people who sat there and said,

1019
01:01:58,341 --> 01:01:59,750
you know what we're going to do today?

1020
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,140
We're going to make ACDC
famous and God dammit,

1021
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,940
those sons of bitches better appreciate
us because if it isn't, well,

1022
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,790
if it wasn't for us,
did back in black album would suck.

1023
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,660
I guess if we didn't buy it, they
would have disappeared into obscurity.

1024
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:19,661
But like I just give ACDC more
credit because they're an organized

1025
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:25,310
group of people creating something
and I'm just a fucking jackass walking

1026
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:30,690
around. I don't know. I don't look at
it that way, but I definitely see, yeah,

1027
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,440
if people don't listen to your shit,
um,

1028
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,510
then you don't sell any of it then then
yeah, your career is over. Absolutely.

1029
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:44,511
But I don't feel that buying the
shit is in the control of the fans.

1030
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:50,160
I think the artists make something so
great. You have to buy it, you know?

1031
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,800
And as far as like a TV show,

1032
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:57,420
I hate this expression because I don't
hunt, but I'm going to use it anyways.

1033
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:02,040
As far as a TV show goes, that's
an entirely different animal, man.

1034
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,470
I hate when people say that,
but it kind of fits here.

1035
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,420
A TV show is different because
what you're doing there is your,

1036
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,070
you're trying to go like
you're commercially fishing.
You don't give a fuck you,

1037
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,980
you're trying to grab as
many people as you can.

1038
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,453
Okay.

1039
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:22,160
As opposed to just doing what you do.

1040
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:23,991
I can't explain it.

1041
01:03:23,991 --> 01:03:27,500
Having a TV show goes beyond doing
what you do and if they like, you know,

1042
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:32,390
build it, they will come.
It goes beyond that because,

1043
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,560
you know, just because they weren't
selling enough DVDs, that's,

1044
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:41,580
is that really a fan thing or is that
the cons in the industry who have this,

1045
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,650
this corporate mentality where every
quarter they have to make more money?

1046
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:47,683
You know what I mean?

1047
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:52,100
So it causes them to do
things after only two seasons.

1048
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,610
I mean, I don't know. I'm not trying
to belittle people who are fans.

1049
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:59,240
I don't think that artists should
take their fans for granted,

1050
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:02,030
but I don't feel as a fan of
all the people I'm a fan of.

1051
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:05,120
I don't feel like they
owe their success to me.

1052
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,450
And if they don't want to sign something,
I'm fine with that.

1053
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,520
Does that make me fucking weird? I don't
think Ringo Starr 70 fucking years old.

1054
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,460
What, what the, what
more is he going to say?

1055
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,520
How many more pairs of tits
connect guy sign? All right.

1056
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,640
It's probably got diarrhea
every other Thursday. I mean,

1057
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:27,410
can the guy fucking live his life? I
don't know. All right, let's, uh, let's,

1058
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:32,540
let's move on here. All right.
You know what I mean? Like,
I just went to Stockholm,

1059
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:35,360
Sweden, I, I just said thanks to
every, all the fans you came out.

1060
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:38,150
I don't take them for granted.
You know,

1061
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,200
I was fucking kissing babies and
shaking hands at the end of my show.

1062
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:42,801
But I've got to admit,

1063
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:46,550
if I'm coming over here at 70 I want to
be wheeled back to my hotel and drink

1064
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:47,384
some tea.

1065
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,090
And that wouldn't mean that
I'm taking them for granted.

1066
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,220
It just means I'm fucking
old and I'm tired.

1067
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,893
Okay.

1068
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,350
Do you know how many autographs
Ringo is? Probably, you know,

1069
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:02,500
I've already been through this. He
gets no credit. 50 years of autographs.

1070
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:06,160
It's not enough. And then people are
going to take credit for his success.

1071
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:08,350
I just thought that that was a
little out of line. All right.

1072
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,860
That's all I'm fucking trying to say
there. You know, and like I said,

1073
01:05:11,861 --> 01:05:14,230
having said that,
I will be kissing babies and sell it,

1074
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:19,231
signing DVDs and taking pictures with
awful fucking digital cameras that for

1075
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:22,930
some reason take like he just don't shoot.
You know,

1076
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,280
you've got to hold the button
down for like 19 minutes and,

1077
01:05:25,281 --> 01:05:29,910
and you gotta is it the 18th flash or the
19th flash where I can finally stopped

1078
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:34,810
smiling. Um, alright.
Plowing ahead. Uh, Bill. Uh,

1079
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:38,230
so something kind of ridiculous happened
to me the other day and you're the only

1080
01:05:38,231 --> 01:05:41,320
person who I think might appreciate
my point of view on the matter. Okay.

1081
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:45,050
So this is really good looking lady,
uh,

1082
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,100
that works at the sandwich shop
around the corner from my job.

1083
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,490
So I've been going there for like a
year now and I've always wanted to say

1084
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:54,880
something to her but never did because
either the place was too busy at the time

1085
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:57,280
or I just pushed it out,
usually the ladder.

1086
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:01,240
So the other day I finally man up and
decide to say something and it went a

1087
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:05,560
little something like this. I go
in after two, so it's not as busy.

1088
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,910
I place my order, she makes me a
rep, she hands me a wrap and I say,

1089
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,510
excuse me.
Uh,

1090
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,210
I've been coming in here for a while and
I've always wanted to introduce myself

1091
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:21,520
and before I can even get the words out,
her smiling expression turns blank,

1092
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,960
her lip seal tight and she kind of
looks up at her eyebrows with that.

1093
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,710
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Look all over face.

1094
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,510
I can only equate a shit. I just hit
the wrong button on my computer. Um,

1095
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:38,980
he goes, I can only equate the
look to an a to an employee,

1096
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,030
what an employee might have when they're
done with their work for the week and

1097
01:06:43,031 --> 01:06:45,700
on Friday evening, right as they feel
like they're going to get out of there,

1098
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,420
the boss comes and drops another hour's
worth of paperwork on their desk.

1099
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,410
They can't say anything, but you know,
they're thinking, you fucking prick.

1100
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,680
So what I ended up saying after
I get this look from this chick,

1101
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:59,260
is this is basically what the
guy says. He said, excuse me,

1102
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,920
I've been coming in here for a while and
I've always wanted to introduce myself.

1103
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,530
You know what? Fuck it. Never mind.

1104
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:15,300
And he goes, I turned around.
I just walked out. All right.

1105
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:19,260
And he goes, now, here's my issue,
dude. We've all been there. All right,

1106
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,030
we've all fucking been there. Um, all
right. So he goes, now here's my issue.

1107
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,500
It's not that I was rejected.
Big Deal. That should happens
all the time, right? Uh,

1108
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,750
that's like an ongoing theme in an adult
life and I've learned to live with it.

1109
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,050
Jesus do don't jump off a
cliff here. Um, he goes,

1110
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:38,310
my problem is that's success sis as a
society, I can't even talk Acessa society.

1111
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:38,890
The,

1112
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:42,630
my problem is society dictates that the
guy should approach the girl and all the

1113
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:44,460
girl really needs to do is look pretty,

1114
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,180
throw a few signals and wait for
dudes to start clamoring like morons.

1115
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,810
Is it fair? No. But then again,
it's really not a big deal.

1116
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:53,970
It's one of the situations
you grow accustomed to.

1117
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:59,160
But if that is the case and if
all women have to do is be pretty,

1118
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,340
then say yes or go fuck yourself.

1119
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:07,610
Could they at least wait 30 seconds
for me to say whatever, retarded shit,

1120
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,800
whatever. Retarded Shit I'm
thinking before they shoot me down.

1121
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,590
All she has to do is wait a
minute and say, no thank you.

1122
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:16,820
But instead I get cut off
by Stinkeye mid sentence.

1123
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,800
Should I have told her to go fuck herself?

1124
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:23,330
What are your thoughts on this sort of
shit? Your true and loyal fan? Bobo.

1125
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:27,140
The douchebag. Alright. Um,

1126
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,610
what am I failings on this? All right.
First of all, dude, we've all been there.

1127
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:35,270
We've all, you know, you got on
your head, you're going to come up.

1128
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,650
They're like fucking Sean Connery and
one of those early James Bond's even feel

1129
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:43,010
like you got to fucking Tuxedo on and
then the second you open your mouth,

1130
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:47,360
you sound like fucking Arnold Horshack
and you even want to shoot yourself down

1131
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:51,110
at that point. Okay. Um,
but in answer your question,

1132
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,080
should I have told her to go
fuck herself? No, that's not. Oh,

1133
01:08:56,210 --> 01:09:00,760
I mean, um, I'm just, you
know, having not been there, I,

1134
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,890
I can't,
it'd be,

1135
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:07,160
it would depend on what the look
on her face was or how she looked,

1136
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,410
you know, if, uh,

1137
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:13,460
if she was just some hot girl who
didn't have a brain in our head, yeah.

1138
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:14,840
Then you tell her to go fuck herself,

1139
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:18,260
but this is a really cute girl and you
actually feel like, wow, I, you know,

1140
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,740
I'd like to get to know that girl. No,
you don't tell her to go fuck herself.

1141
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,340
It's actually in that moment when she
gives you the stink eye is when you have

1142
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:29,390
to come up with something funny to say
something, something clever, something,

1143
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:32,300
see show that you're not
going to quit in life.

1144
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:34,760
Cause that's what I hate to say do.
But that's what you showed her.

1145
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,830
You showed her that you have,

1146
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:42,100
you have the quit DNA in your fucking
ball bag and she's not gonna want to meet

1147
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,124
with you.

1148
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,810
But fortunately there's plenty
other gazelles out there
on the fucking Serengeti

1149
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,420
that you can try to run down.
You see the discovery channel,

1150
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,880
Cheetah doesn't always
fucking run the thing down.

1151
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:59,450
Sometimes he gets kicked in the face
and then it sits there feeling stupid,

1152
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,110
especially when it realizes it's being
filmed. It's going to be on basic cable.

1153
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,270
There's where you can,
you can actually look at a bright side.

1154
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:09,270
It wasn't filmed did you? You just gotta
kind of come up with something, um,

1155
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,350
in that moment. That's funny. And I
actually kind of thought about it,

1156
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:16,160
what I would have said and I would have
choked even if I tried to come up with

1157
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:19,700
something funny because in the moment
I would've felt like a Douche and I

1158
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:21,830
probably would've attacked
what she did for a living,

1159
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:26,450
which is the worst thing you can do and
be like, really? You know, you fucking,

1160
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,400
you've been working here for
a year and a half, two years.

1161
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:29,750
I've been seeing you making sandwiches.

1162
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:34,070
You're not getting any younger
this sweetie. All right. You know,

1163
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,780
I would have been bad. It would have been
bad. It's very easy for me, you know,

1164
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:41,060
for me to sit here and tell you
what you should've done. You know,

1165
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:43,310
it's kind of like, uh, you know, when you,

1166
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:48,311
when you watch a football game or
something like that and once it ends and

1167
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:50,780
whatever the game plan was,
didn't work out. They do.

1168
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:54,300
What did they give it to Marshall
Faulk? I don't understand. Um,

1169
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,240
it's easy to do that. So, um,

1170
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:02,120
I don't know what to tell
you. Like, you know, be funny,

1171
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:04,460
you got to go back there and keep
ordering sandwiches. I don't know.

1172
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,890
That's fucking humiliating.
You might,

1173
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,720
you might have to find a new
place to get a sandwich. Dude.

1174
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,690
I gotta be honest with you. I don't know
how you pull yourself out of that one.

1175
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:17,670
What, what did you say?
You know what? Fuck it. Oh,

1176
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:20,050
this is what you do. Jake Heights is
just walking, just kind of be a dick.

1177
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,110
You know, when she, you could just
walk up to a sunshine or something.

1178
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,740
I don't listen to me. All my shit
just always ends up with, you know,

1179
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:32,790
there's a reason I get heckled as much
as I do because I'm an asshole. Um,

1180
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,950
but as far as like a,
what you said earlier,

1181
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,560
cause I know there's a lot of women
pulling their fucking hair out right now.

1182
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:41,670
When you say all the woman has to do
is be pretty and wait for the offers to

1183
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:45,660
come in. Um, I dunno dude, if you
ever had a girlfriend, first of all,

1184
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:50,070
that whole thing of looking pretty from
my standpoint and my experience takes at

1185
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:54,120
least four and a half fucking hours.
And um,

1186
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,020
and you never know that girl might've
been giving you the stink eye because

1187
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:01,380
she's a really good looking girl and she,
she has a public,

1188
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:06,240
she has a job where she deals with
the public. So believe it or not,

1189
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,840
the amount of ugly fucking honest shape
dudes who actually don't have a problem

1190
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,100
approaching beautiful
women, uh, is actually,

1191
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:22,020
it's the, it's pretty high. I mean,
personally I think it's funny, but, um,

1192
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,760
if you're a woman it's not as funny.

1193
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:29,040
And I think that's something that took
me a long time to realize how like I'm

1194
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:33,060
uncomfortable. That feeling can be,
you know, cause guys, thank dude,

1195
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,100
I would love to be standing
there and women hitting on me.

1196
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,130
But would you have to do is you've got
to see how we're physically made up.

1197
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:40,330
The fact that a guy,
you know what,

1198
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:44,580
what if there was this thing
that physically could beat
the shit out of you and

1199
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:46,170
it wanted to enter your body?

1200
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:53,490
That's the only way to try to put
yourself in the, and what if it's,

1201
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:57,810
if you're not attracted to it and you
feel it getting angry when you're trying

1202
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:01,680
to communicate that, you know
you're all set, you know,

1203
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,950
and then there's the option
that if they wanted to,

1204
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:09,870
they could give you a forearm shiver and
begin to execute their plan. You know?

1205
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,090
Oh Jesus, how do I talk myself out
of this one? You know what it's like,

1206
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,000
put it this way for all the guys listening
out there, if somebody said, hey man,

1207
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:20,670
I'll give you a 10 bucks. This is
like an old joke. I just do my act.

1208
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:25,110
I'll give you 10 bucks to walk over to
that birth key birthday cake can stick

1209
01:13:25,111 --> 01:13:29,880
your finger in it. Yeah, yeah. 10 Bucks.
Yeah. Fuck it. I'll do it. You know,

1210
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:32,850
20 bucks or whatever. Just
something, you know, you'd do it.

1211
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,400
He wouldn't think anything
about it. Whatever. Stick it in,

1212
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:37,410
you take it right back out. You
know, you wouldn't give a fuck.

1213
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,330
What if somebody said,
dude, I'll give you,

1214
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,410
I'll give you 20 bucks to take
that cake and put it in your ass.

1215
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,820
See what I mean? There'd be
a difference then. Then you,

1216
01:13:48,821 --> 01:13:52,890
you would have some questions,
you know,

1217
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:56,070
where's that kicked Ben?
Are you going to tell anybody?

1218
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,490
I usually don't do things like this.
You know, that's, that's why women,

1219
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,580
they approached sex that way.
You know,

1220
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,380
they've got to have rules on when they're
going to fuck you and all that to its

1221
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,510
did that the, that example. But I
know on some level it made sense.

1222
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:13,120
I'm a little jet lagged if I haven't done
that joke in a while and I got to meet

1223
01:14:13,121 --> 01:14:15,670
halfway through what, it didn't even
make sense to me. I'm just saying it,

1224
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:19,780
you know. Did I answer your question? Um,

1225
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,680
so this is what you gotta do. You gotta
treat a, you've got to treat women like,

1226
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,930
uh, like I treated open mikes. Okay.

1227
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:28,450
You just know you're going to bomb and
eventually you're going to get good at it.

1228
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,440
So just keep,
you know,

1229
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:34,870
make some notes what you're going to do
the next time that happens. You know,

1230
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,270
maybe try to come up with a
couple of lines and I help women,

1231
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:38,810
I hope you appreciate,
uh,

1232
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,480
what a fucking pain in the acid is for
a guy to get laid. You know what I mean?

1233
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:48,580
And that's why there's the whole,
um, stud whore double standard.

1234
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,460
Because basically for guy to get laid,
this is what he has to go through.

1235
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:55,360
This guy actually has to develop
skills to get laid. You know,

1236
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:58,150
all you have to do is show up,
you know, I mean for a guy,

1237
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:02,020
the brass ring is getting a
two on one. No TV credits. No,

1238
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:04,990
my dad has a yacht.
You just get it from talking shit.

1239
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,770
That is the brass ring for a guy now,
a woman, her first night of fucking,

1240
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:11,200
all she'd have to do is
lay down in a pool table.

1241
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,980
She could fuck every guy in the bar.
It's not a skill. It's gluttonous.

1242
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,500
You know, it's gotten us, it's like
watching a fat guy eat an ice cream.

1243
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:24,850
You never count on, you don't cut him
any slack. Haven't you had enough?

1244
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,213
Um,
all right,

1245
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:32,980
I'm really glad I read this podcast
because this other one was not nearly as

1246
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:35,980
fucked up as this one. I don't know if
it's funny, but it's definitely fucked up.

1247
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:39,400
Okay, here we go. Uh, there's
another one. I'm bill.

1248
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,620
I'm getting laid off at the
end of the month. Naturally,

1249
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,530
I would like to go to the dentist
before my benefits run out.

1250
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:49,330
What a sad fucking state. You
know what I mean? Jesus Christ.

1251
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,830
I really believe that people should have,

1252
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,510
you should have some sort
of fucking healthcare.

1253
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,720
We really need to overthrow these
fucking bankers because there's plenty of

1254
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:56,554
money out there.

1255
01:15:56,590 --> 01:16:00,760
If those banker cunts weren't fucking
charge in the u s government interest for

1256
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,770
its own fucking money plowing
ahead. Um, anyways, here we go.

1257
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,160
Uh, since I did not care
much for my current dentist,

1258
01:16:09,161 --> 01:16:12,640
I asked my fiance for the name of hers.
All right,

1259
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:16,900
so just get you caught up if you didn't
get lost in my moronic rant with no

1260
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:19,810
information behind it there.
Okay. This guy's getting laid off.

1261
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:22,450
He wants to get his teeth cleaned
before his health insurance runs out.

1262
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:25,990
He doesn't like his dentist, so he
asked his fiance for the name of hers.

1263
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,161
He says my,
uh,

1264
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:30,520
my fiance is Vietnamese and gave me
the name of her dentist who is also

1265
01:16:30,521 --> 01:16:34,420
Vietnamese. Bear in mind, this is a
typical Vietnamese dentist's office.

1266
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,460
You have a dentist and office manager
who's usually a woman over 50 and two or

1267
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:44,230
three and he writes this in capital
letters, hot Asian hygienists.

1268
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,000
I had a cleaning for one of the hygienists
who couldn't have been more than 20

1269
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:52,300
years old and screamed of junior college.

1270
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,440
This was the high point of her career
until she landed that Mrs. Degree,

1271
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,800
I don't even know what that is.
Maybe I'm dumb. I'm so, anyways,

1272
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:02,770
I'm getting my teeth cleaned.
We were flirting back and forth.

1273
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:08,070
The appointment ended and we headed to
the old 50 plus office manager before I

1274
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:13,400
could even a word. The old bag of
bones said, and broken, broken English.

1275
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,990
This appointment is covered, but you can't
come back until you find another job.

1276
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,450
Jesus Christ. Anyways, he
says, my heart hygienists,

1277
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,880
who up until that time
was totally into me,

1278
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:30,290
quickly looked at the floor and made
an immediate beeline to the nearest

1279
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,620
unoccupied exam room.
Now,

1280
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,950
I am not a racist,
but I was so mad.

1281
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,820
[inaudible] a sentence like
this never ends good. Okay.

1282
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,510
Anything that starts with I'm not racist.
Okay? But these motherfucking, anyways,

1283
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,300
um, he says, now I am not a racist,

1284
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:51,500
but I was so mad that I could've slapped
that bitch back to the Vietnamese rice

1285
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:56,840
patties of 1974. Here we go. He's not
racist, everybody. How could she say that?

1286
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:01,340
Especially in front of the Hottie,
who was obviously as dumb as she looked,

1287
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,580
Jesus Christ. Dude. Uh,
when I got back to work,

1288
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:08,090
I told my coworkers to story and they
implied that I was a victim of reverse

1289
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:12,680
racism. If I was Asian and had eyes
that couldn't see through a key hole,

1290
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,110
Jesus Christ, dude, she would,

1291
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,930
she would have bit her tongue or
said something more appropriate.

1292
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:22,820
What do you think? Uh, okay.
What do I think? All right.

1293
01:18:22,821 --> 01:18:25,610
Let me go with my first thought.
Uh, thought number one, dude,

1294
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:30,170
you should not be getting married.
You should not be getting married.

1295
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,033
Okay.

1296
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:35,210
Especially because not only are
you hitting on these fucking women,

1297
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:40,070
you're so fucking
like end of this shit.

1298
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:44,810
Like you just told me you were engaged
and now you're dragging me into your

1299
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:46,100
bullshit. And I, when people do that,

1300
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,260
like I don't mind if a guy cheats
on his girl. I don't give a fuck.

1301
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:50,560
Just don't drag me into it,
you know?

1302
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,460
So then I got to fucking fix my face
to the next time I see your girlfriend.

1303
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:58,690
Don't you hate when people do that?
You know, do what you do. What you do.

1304
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,220
Do what you do. Do it over there.
Don't do it near me. See what you,

1305
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,680
now you're telling me you're,
you're fucking engaged and now you're,

1306
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:08,260
you're hitting on, first of all,
why are you hitting on this girl?

1307
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,240
You know why I'll tell you why?

1308
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:15,450
Because you're not done fucking and
because you're not done fucking,

1309
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:20,070
you're setting yourself up, dude,
for a brutal, brutal situation.

1310
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,110
The last thing you should
be doing is getting married.

1311
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:26,130
You shouldn't even have a fucking
girlfriend right now. Okay.

1312
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,250
And then there's a whole weird thing
where your girlfriend's Vietnamese,

1313
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:30,030
you go in here,

1314
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,150
they got all these hot Vietnamese girls
and you're saying you're not racist,

1315
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:34,770
but then you're saying
fucked up shit about him.

1316
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:38,330
But I will give you the benefit of the
doubt, doubt, benefit of the doubt,

1317
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:41,060
because this is written.
Okay?

1318
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,750
And the one thing that sucks about
writing shit is you lose the tone.

1319
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,030
And a lot of times people
are trying to joke around.

1320
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:50,450
So it might've been the way I read it.
So we'll leave all of that out of there.

1321
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:53,240
But Dude, I'm a tell you
right now, you, you should,

1322
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:55,820
the biggest fucking thing about
this is don't get married.

1323
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:58,250
You're not ready to get married.
Okay?

1324
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,850
I think you're ready to go to Vietnam
and fucking hit a single's bar.

1325
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:05,990
I think you're ready to do that.
But you are not ready to be married,

1326
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:09,060
so don't fucking do it.
All right? You know,

1327
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,740
just sit down and ask
yourself, am I done? Fucking,

1328
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:19,800
I guess other women, because
that's what you sign up for. And,

1329
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,730
um, you're gonna lose half your
shit and you're going to have to,

1330
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,670
even if you don't have a kid,
you're going to have to pay alimony.

1331
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:30,810
At least that's how it works in
New York where you have to pay.

1332
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,450
How about if you're married seven
years for three and a half years,

1333
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:38,130
you have to pay alimony to a healthy
human being who really should just go out

1334
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:42,270
and get a fucking job, but for some
reason they don't have to. So, um,

1335
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,960
that's my advice. I would say
don't get married, but as far as,

1336
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:50,460
were you an example of reverse
racism now? You were, uh,

1337
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:56,540
you were a victim of a 50 year old woman
who is the typical front desk person at

1338
01:20:56,881 --> 01:21:00,780
any medical place.
They always yell out intimate information,

1339
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,660
like information,
you know,

1340
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,470
constantly because they're so in the
job that they stop understanding that

1341
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:15,940
they're in front of the public. That
shit. He, you know, you walk in there, oh,

1342
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:20,140
you know, Mr. Johnson. Oh, did you get
that ointment? How did it work out though?

1343
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,200
Yeah. Yelled at across they, you know,

1344
01:21:23,201 --> 01:21:28,030
I actually worked in a dental office
and I saw people get haggling over money

1345
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:31,140
all the time at the
fucking front desk and a,

1346
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:35,020
I sought bother a lot of people and Uhm,
I dunno,

1347
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,930
um, I, I don't think you are
a victim of reverse racism.

1348
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:44,820
I think that the old bag of bones as you
call her a pro probably would have said

1349
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:47,220
that to anybody else. She
sounds like, you know,

1350
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:51,480
you kind of have to be a tough person
to work the front desk because a lot of

1351
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:55,920
people try to get out of paying
their shit. So, um, your,

1352
01:21:56,010 --> 01:22:00,030
what you should've done was talk to
the dentist or even taken her aside and

1353
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,330
that's what you do in that situation.
Just be like, look, you know,

1354
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,430
I understand that I don't
have a job right now and I,

1355
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,640
you really don't need to be yelling that.
I think you owe me an apology.

1356
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,890
That's the way you handle it.
You know what I mean?

1357
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,580
I wouldn't have go the reverse rate.

1358
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:16,170
You gotta understand this constant
every race. So don't take it racially.

1359
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,370
You know, if she said, hey, round die.

1360
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:22,050
Why once you go get a job at Dunkin
donuts so you can afford the next fucking

1361
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:25,680
payment. All right, you fat. Fuck. You
know she said something like that. Yeah,

1362
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:29,940
but she kind of laid the facts
that she was rude. She was rude.

1363
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,930
Um, that's what I would go
with on that one. Then again,
I wasn't there. All right.

1364
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:39,230
What am I up to here? 39. Okay.
I gotta read this revenge story.

1365
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,990
Then I got to get off my day cause this
is my last day in Stockholm. Sweden. Yeah.

1366
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,800
And I want to go have a good time. All
right. Um, I called this part revenge.

1367
01:22:46,801 --> 01:22:50,430
The revenge stories. All right, here's
a revenge story that comes back.

1368
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:54,870
I'm bringing this, this topic back.
Here's this guy's revenge story. Um,

1369
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,750
you always hear about people
fucking up someone's car.

1370
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,230
I actually use this guy's
car to fuck him up and no,

1371
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:04,410
I didn't run him over or any
stupid shit like that. Like that.

1372
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:06,040
This was more subtle and much more fun.

1373
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,570
I was employed by a company that made
electronic equipment for computers a

1374
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:13,960
number of years back and
I drove one of my, uh, uh,

1375
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:18,550
I drove one of the many forklifts in the
warehouse during the regular day shift.

1376
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:22,120
It was one of those warehouses,
um, where the warehouse,

1377
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,520
he administration was
an all in one building,

1378
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,900
which meant that everyone employed in
the company worked in the same location.

1379
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,930
I'm the warehouse manager at the time.

1380
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:36,490
My boss's boss was this short Mexican
dude who stood about five foot five and

1381
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:41,230
was a fantastic shitbag asshole.
Oh,

1382
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,670
I'm just going to let you digest that.

1383
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:46,090
I never heard that vulgarity put
together that way. Fantastic.

1384
01:23:46,091 --> 01:23:48,730
Shitbag asshole to anyone taller than him,

1385
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:53,530
which meant pretty much the entire planet
with the exception of China and maybe

1386
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:58,150
one island in Indonesia,
Indonesia got on bed. Um,

1387
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:02,230
he believed that leadership meant he
could be an asshole to him or whoever,

1388
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,071
whoever damn.

1389
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:07,240
Well he pleased and it pleased him a
whole fucking lot to be an asshole to me.

1390
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:10,510
I won't bore you with the issue with
or your listeners with the details,

1391
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:14,530
but as Napoleon complex drove his
actions more than any other reason,

1392
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:17,290
this is what always happens
when I start to read them bad.

1393
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:21,400
I think if I read it faster, I
will, uh, start reading it better.

1394
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:26,380
Why don't I take a breath, slow down
and read the rest? Okay, here we go.

1395
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:30,820
Here comes to revenge. Uh, my job would
be on the line if I outrage outright,

1396
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:33,670
fuck outright faced off with this guy.

1397
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,180
So abroad would be out of
the question and frankly,

1398
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,150
the whole morale of the
workplace with lift a little bit.

1399
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:42,520
If this shit bag was
taken down a notch or two.

1400
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,690
So I decided to take matters in my
own hands without the use of physical

1401
01:24:46,691 --> 01:24:51,460
violence or property damage. Now this
here is actually a unique way to go.

1402
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,890
All right, here we go. He said, uh,
what I did was, is I, I put up the A,

1403
01:24:56,891 --> 01:25:00,100
I put up his car for sale
and here's how I did it.

1404
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,650
At the time I worked for this company,

1405
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:07,750
the PT Cruiser had just come out and
this Mexican closet case went out and

1406
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:08,770
bought himself one.

1407
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:12,550
Maybe he thought they weren't as gay as
everyone else knew they were, but hey,

1408
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:17,470
this fuck nut didn't have both oars
in the water in the first place. Um,

1409
01:25:17,471 --> 01:25:21,040
some months before I struck up a great
friendship with this chick who worked at

1410
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:24,160
the front desk who also doubled
as a human resource assistant.

1411
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,570
I took her out to lunch as a,

1412
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:30,940
at a place of her choosing and exchange
for this shit bags, home phone number.

1413
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,770
Here's where the fun begins.

1414
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:37,030
I picked up two different local newspapers
and I took out ads for the in the

1415
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:41,830
classifieds for this guy's car and arrange
to have the, have them run for a week.

1416
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:47,080
The ads basically said that I had a brand
new PT cruiser for sale for less than

1417
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,710
half the cost of the new one and I had
to leave the country soon but couldn't

1418
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:51,700
take the car with me.

1419
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:56,470
I also worked at odd hours and the best
time to get ahold of me would be between

1420
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:58,210
the hours of one and five in the morning.

1421
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:03,040
Newspapers got really lax about
their classified ads, used to be,

1422
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,810
call the number you gave them
to make sure it wasn't bullshit.

1423
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:09,230
But since the Internet and craigslist
took over, they rarely checked.

1424
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:13,370
I placed the same ad and two papers on
Monday afternoon and quietly waited.

1425
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:17,390
Wednesday rolls around and I can
already see the result of my handiwork.

1426
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:20,480
This fucker shows up to work
without a shave. Pores themselves.

1427
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:23,750
Fuck loads of coffee all day
while cowering in his office.

1428
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:27,200
Like one of those baby monkeys
with the wire cage mother.

1429
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,670
I don't know what that means.
Um,

1430
01:26:29,671 --> 01:26:32,730
he'd obviously been getting calls at
fuck all hours of the night and couldn't

1431
01:26:32,731 --> 01:26:35,940
sleep for shit. It may have cost me
a couple of bucks to get the ads up,

1432
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,640
but to see this asshole bloodshot
and out of his head more,

1433
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,330
more than made up for it,
that's actually pretty decent.

1434
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,080
Um, and with that I'm going
to do overrated, underrated,

1435
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:49,140
and I actually have to come in that guy
cause there was no physical violence,

1436
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:54,290
didn't chop his hair off. He
didn't fuck up his car. He
just had people, uh, he had,

1437
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:59,330
I like all of you also like somehow had
other people doing his dirty work for um

1438
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:04,710
, I give that one in eight. Alright.
Overrated. Underrated televised poker.

1439
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:08,340
Who wants to watch a group of
Asians with mullets sit at a table,

1440
01:27:08,341 --> 01:27:11,550
sober playing cards.
You know,

1441
01:27:11,551 --> 01:27:14,090
you guys are really getting good
at this writing shit, I think, uh,

1442
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:17,610
with each week when you write these in,
it's making it easier for me to be funny.

1443
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:19,620
Uh,
Nancy Grace,

1444
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,220
this media whore needs to change your
fucking Tampon or get a good night's Dick

1445
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:27,990
in her. All right? Child beauty pageants.

1446
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,480
Mom never won any beauty contests,

1447
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:34,800
so it's real important for her to her
fucking space that are fucking spawn does.

1448
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:37,380
All right. You know what? I'm done
reading. I don't know what happened.

1449
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:39,870
I can't read anymore.
These are all great.

1450
01:27:39,871 --> 01:27:42,990
I should read the rest of them next week.
I'm too fucking tired.

1451
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:45,420
I've been stuttering over everything.
Um,

1452
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,240
let's just end this Goddamn
podcasts abruptly. Um,

1453
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:55,260
I want to thank the person who sent
me the, a ram Superbowl and, um,

1454
01:27:55,650 --> 01:28:00,650
I actually went on the
Internet and watched a number
of other Superbowls and uh,

1455
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,160
I'm not gonna tell you where they are
for fear that the NFL is going to take

1456
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:06,290
them down.
But they had

1457
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,810
the,
um,

1458
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:13,530
the original broadcast,
not the NFL film version.

1459
01:28:13,531 --> 01:28:18,531
They had the original broadcasts of
a Superbowl three and all four of the

1460
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,530
Superbowls that the
Steelers won in the 70s.

1461
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:27,531
And I gotta tell you it's a real football
education to watch those games without

1462
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:33,150
like, I mean I love NFL
films style. Beautiful.

1463
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:36,750
They make it in the drama and the
music and everything. But to watch the,

1464
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,260
you know, some of them even had the
commercials. They were fucking incredible.

1465
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,870
If you want to know where they're at,
just email me and I'll,

1466
01:28:42,871 --> 01:28:44,820
I'll let you know where they're at.
But um,

1467
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,300
which is stupid cause if someone
from the NFL is listening,

1468
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,100
did this say, send me an email,
whatever, you can find them. But anyways,

1469
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,080
like I just, I watch
Superbowl three and, um,

1470
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,710
you know, Joe Namath was, I like
really reminded me of Dan Marino.

1471
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,800
Like he couldn't sack the guy.
He's totally picking up the blitz.

1472
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:07,110
He had that quick release.
He was,

1473
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:11,100
he was really picking them apart
and uh, but I could admit, man,

1474
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:14,490
the cults just fucked themselves.

1475
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:19,080
They threw three interceptions
in their own end zone,

1476
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:21,900
not their own end zone and
the jets end zone. Like they,

1477
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:26,820
they literally like conservatively
left like 23 points on the table in the

1478
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:30,390
first. Um, and the first half alone,

1479
01:29:30,391 --> 01:29:33,810
and I'm not taking anything away from
the jets here because they played a

1480
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:38,670
phenomenal game, but like,
uh, that Earl moral man,

1481
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:41,590
he just,
he was the MVP of the NFL day year,

1482
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,670
took over for Johnny Unitas, I
guess the guy's elbow was, uh,

1483
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:50,580
was all tore up so he couldn't play. But
I mean, he had one, he had a touchdown.

1484
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:52,360
It's like a three yard
pass any through it,

1485
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:57,070
like Brett far be through it like 90
miles an hour to the guys outside shoulder

1486
01:29:57,071 --> 01:30:00,490
at the flecks off them. Easy touchdown
in. It'll shoots up in the air,

1487
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:02,140
it gets picked off.

1488
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,940
They had a flea flicker at the end of
the half and this Guy Jimmy or is wide

1489
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:09,130
open jumping up and down.

1490
01:30:09,131 --> 01:30:12,040
He misses him and he
throws into two fucking,

1491
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,130
I mean tactically it
wasn't double coverage,

1492
01:30:15,131 --> 01:30:18,040
but there was jets all around the guy.
They throw another fucking pick.

1493
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:20,223
I watched three

1494
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,770
watch Superbowl nine
which is a great game.

1495
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,560
The first half total defensive struggle.

1496
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:29,430
And then in the third quarter of Franco
Harris starts running wild and it really

1497
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:33,990
wears down the front four of the
Steelers and the Steelers defense is just

1498
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:35,010
fucking incredible.

1499
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,570
And I'm something I didn't
know Terry Bradshaw was fast.

1500
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,810
See,
I was too young to,

1501
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,730
to know that I saw older Terry
when he couldn't run anymore.

1502
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:49,200
He ran a four or five 40 and
he was a definite threat.

1503
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,210
But,
um,

1504
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:56,120
and then super bowl 10 killed me
because I was a huge cowboy fans in the,

1505
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,080
in the 70s and watching them

1506
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,880
kind of,
you know,

1507
01:30:59,881 --> 01:31:03,840
they went up 10 to nothing in the first
half and just they were playing real

1508
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:07,170
loose and then they went like halfway
through the second quarter they started

1509
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:10,170
playing Marty Ball.
They just do a sitting on there,

1510
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:13,410
this 10 nothing lead with two
and a half quarters to go.

1511
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:15,960
I fucking could not understand it.

1512
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:19,920
And then all of a sudden the Steelers
just creep back into the game and next

1513
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:22,410
thing you know they're down by
like, I don't know, six points.

1514
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,290
Then they open it up again and
they fucking score touchdowns.

1515
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:28,680
I was really frustrating as a cowboys fan,
but I gotta tell you,

1516
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:32,940
watching those great Steelers teams was
incredible and super bowl 10 Lynn Swann

1517
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,290
has,
I believe,

1518
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,620
the greatest performance of any
wide receiver in Superbowl history.

1519
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,970
And that includes Jerry Rice. He, he,

1520
01:31:40,971 --> 01:31:44,790
he has arguably two of the
greatest catches in NFL history.

1521
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,080
Forget about the Superbowl.

1522
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:51,260
The guy had like four catches for like
160 yards and that last past that Terry

1523
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,750
Bradshaw's throws him is one of the
best passes I've ever seen in my life.

1524
01:31:54,751 --> 01:31:58,110
I'm telling you, go on, go
on the Internet, find them.

1525
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:00,130
There's lot of shit up there.

1526
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:04,420
There's that game where a Joe
Montana becomes a superstar.

1527
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:08,320
That game where he fucking throws it to
Dwight Clark. If you're an uh, you know,

1528
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:11,230
if you're a younger guy and you never
got to see those games, I'm telling you,

1529
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,360
just go on the Internet.

1530
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:18,010
You know where the fuck to go and
find them because they're, uh,

1531
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:21,940
they're absolutely
incredible. And um, I dunno,

1532
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:24,370
I got to watch three Superbowls
I'd never seen before.

1533
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:28,090
I'd basically plus the rams.
So I watched four Superbowls.

1534
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:32,350
That's what I did in Stockholm,
Sweden when I couldn't sleep. Um,

1535
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:37,351
I know I'm babbling right now and this
is only interesting to a football fans.

1536
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,660
God Damn Man, I forgot to talk
about that. Kegerator again.

1537
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:46,180
I saw this story on the Internet.
I saw this TV show with this guy.

1538
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,020
He got a Kegerator,
which I'd never heard of before.

1539
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:54,940
It basically looks like a big desk,
you know, some of the bigger ones,

1540
01:32:54,941 --> 01:32:59,230
but it basically, it holds a keg in
there and you just have beer on tap.

1541
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:03,850
And he wheeled it. He had an
in his kitchen and of course
his wife is like, honey,

1542
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:07,300
it's ugly.
It Dad's in Mad Cheney thing.

1543
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,230
[inaudible] and what does
this fucking sad sack do?

1544
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,960
Does he say it's my kitchen til eh,

1545
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:19,390
they give a shit back? No. He's like, Ooh.

1546
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,630
And she,
you know,

1547
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:25,000
they fucking wield the
thing out into the garage

1548
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,730
and he's like, well have the garage and
I'll turn this into a man cave. Why?

1549
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:31,301
You know something?

1550
01:33:31,301 --> 01:33:35,880
If you're a man and you've been banished
to your basement or your fucking garage,

1551
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:39,370
I don't, what the fuck is wrong
with you? You know what I mean?

1552
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:41,710
I don't understand that.
Why?

1553
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:47,620
It's just not a partnership. I
couldn't believe it. But you know what?

1554
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,130
It didn't really make me do as I
want to get it fucking keg of Reda.

1555
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,240
The only reason why I'm not going to,
it's cause if I had one,

1556
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:55,030
not only want it to be a
fucking raging alcoholic,

1557
01:33:55,210 --> 01:34:00,040
I would weigh a good two 40 I could have
blocked for Franco Harris and fucking

1558
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:04,750
Superbowl nine if I had a Goddamn
kegerator. But I'm telling you, you know,

1559
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:08,110
if you're one of those people who
doesn't give a fuck and you're already an

1560
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:12,380
alcoholic, if you want to cut down
in some of the expenses of, you know,

1561
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,940
we're always having to go to a store
and then everyone's trying to have an

1562
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:19,270
intervention and try to help you not
be an alcoholic so they won't go to the

1563
01:34:19,271 --> 01:34:23,800
store anymore and you don't have to be
standing there going get me the booze.

1564
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:28,780
Like that dude on intervention.
Get a fucking kegerator. It's,

1565
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:33,100
it's, I'm telling you, I didn't
even know that they existed.

1566
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:35,440
I just wish I was like,
you know,

1567
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:39,580
1520 years younger and
those things existed.

1568
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,040
Or maybe they did.
I had never heard of them.

1569
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,750
But I would have had one in my apartment
back in my old bachelor fucking days

1570
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:49,510
and that would have had shit on
tap because that's back then.

1571
01:34:49,511 --> 01:34:53,110
You remember back then your twenties
was a tail end and we could fucking eat,

1572
01:34:53,111 --> 01:34:57,530
drink 12 beers and eat McDonald's and
somehow wake up with a flat stomach and

1573
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,920
barely a headache.
I swear to God,

1574
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,740
I've never done,
uh,

1575
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:09,020
I did a commercial early on in my
career long fucking time ago, my career.

1576
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:15,080
Um, but now I kind of got away from it
after a while. I don't know why, but uh,

1577
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:18,500
that's something I would have no
problem doing a fucking commercial for.

1578
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:24,410
[inaudible] I would have no
fucking problem whatsoever
doing a commercial for a,

1579
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:29,690
uh, for a Kegerator, you know, cause
that's something I would fucking use.

1580
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,440
Oh, by the way, somebody sent
me this hilarious fucking email.

1581
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,200
This is going to be when these
classic podcasts where I,

1582
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:40,040
Sam wrapping it up and then I do another
15 minutes, where the fuck is it?

1583
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:42,290
This guy sent me this hilarious email.

1584
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,140
Remember last week when
you guys asked me about,

1585
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:50,160
somebody asked me about the
bloggers and, uh, I, you know,

1586
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:55,170
that, that supermodel who outed
the blogger and I basically said,

1587
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,900
uh, that I could see, you know,
I could see both sides of it.

1588
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:04,330
Where the fuck is it somebody who was
really pissed at me for a God damn it,

1589
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:06,720
where is it on any level

1590
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:13,260
supporting that supermodel?
I can basically paraphrase what they said,

1591
01:36:13,261 --> 01:36:17,610
but what they wrote was so
fucking funny though. Ah,

1592
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:21,430
God damn it, I can't find
it. They basically said, uh,

1593
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:23,770
sticking up for celebrities.

1594
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:28,540
I knew you moving to La was a bad move.
Uh,

1595
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,030
and it was something else about me
being a sellout and then it just said,

1596
01:36:34,031 --> 01:36:35,830
fuck you,
bye.

1597
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,930
You know, and I, yeah, I just
wrote back, I was just like, okay,

1598
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:48,410
have a good one. I just
thought it was funny. You know,

1599
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:51,950
I just think it's funny
when people complain, uh,

1600
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,620
I don't know that people have that thing.
If you moved to La,

1601
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:55,970
like you become a phony.

1602
01:36:56,030 --> 01:37:01,030
It's like all that road really
proves is was I was already a phony.

1603
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:05,650
And that you don't become a
phony moving out to la. You're,

1604
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:09,230
you're either a phony or you're not this
phony people on the fucking east coast.

1605
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:13,460
How many times you fucking cunts back
on the east coast got to get fucked over

1606
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:17,060
by somebody in business or like,
dude, yeah, I'll be there. Yeah,

1607
01:37:17,061 --> 01:37:18,050
I'm going to pay you back.

1608
01:37:18,051 --> 01:37:21,170
How many fucking times of people got
to do shit like that before you realize

1609
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:23,970
that there's, this cuts all
over the country. All right.

1610
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,130
This constant la too. It's just
better whether that's, see,

1611
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:31,680
that's the only difference. All
right. All right. That's it.

1612
01:37:31,681 --> 01:37:32,760
That's the end of the podcast.

1613
01:37:32,761 --> 01:37:35,380
Thank you guys for listening and
thanks to everybody in Sweden who, uh,
