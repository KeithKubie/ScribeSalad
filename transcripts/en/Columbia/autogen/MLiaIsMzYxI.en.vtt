for a much more confusing picture but

00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:00.289
for a much more confusing picture but
 

00:35:00.289 --> 00:35:03.000
for a much more confusing picture but
that makes one point that is Afghanistan

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.010
that makes one point that is Afghanistan
 

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.609
that makes one point that is Afghanistan
matters and matters in a much deeper way

00:35:06.609 --> 00:35:06.619
matters and matters in a much deeper way
 

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:10.839

base might or might not be reestablished
 

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.039
base might or might not be reestablished
and in that sense it means that the

00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:18.049
and in that sense it means that the
 

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.529
and in that sense it means that the
force discussion between do we care

Quetta Shura in gulbuddin Hekmatyar is
 

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:57.750
Quetta Shura in gulbuddin Hekmatyar is
out there in in one particular part of

them in the eastern Afghanistan we all
know the the new yours of that at the

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880
know the the new yours of that at the
 

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.420
know the the new yours of that at the
same time there is such a thing as a

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:06.430
same time there is such a thing as a
 

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.460
same time there is such a thing as a
national political project and because

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:11.470
national political project and because
 

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.599
national political project and because
there is that that means that any effort

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:15.609
there is that that means that any effort
 

00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:19.200
there is that that means that any effort
just to to build a nation by a series of

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:19.210
just to to build a nation by a series of
 

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:23.099
just to to build a nation by a series of
of local deals I mean there is something

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:23.109
of local deals I mean there is something
 

00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:27.990
of local deals I mean there is something
fundamentally missing there and more

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000
fundamentally missing there and more
 

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.750
fundamentally missing there and more
than that I think of the French

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760
than that I think of the French
 

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.990
than that I think of the French
experience in Algeria with where there

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000
experience in Algeria with where there
 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.260
experience in Algeria with where there
was a lot of attempts to sort of get

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.270
was a lot of attempts to sort of get
 

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:45.510
was a lot of attempts to sort of get
defectors from the movement the FLN the

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520
defectors from the movement the FLN the
 

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.750
defectors from the movement the FLN the
momentum in the the algerian fighters

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760
momentum in the the algerian fighters
 

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:55.859
momentum in the the algerian fighters
who were fighting the French rule that I

00:37:55.859 --> 00:37:55.869
who were fighting the French rule that I
 

00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:58.049
who were fighting the French rule that I
mean some of those efforts were quite

00:37:58.049 --> 00:37:58.059
mean some of those efforts were quite
 

00:37:58.059 --> 00:38:02.579
mean some of those efforts were quite
successful and it's a normal part of a

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:02.589
successful and it's a normal part of a
 

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:05.370
successful and it's a normal part of a
military strategy to try to get people

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:05.380
military strategy to try to get people
 

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.740
military strategy to try to get people
on the other side to defect I mean it's

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:07.750
on the other side to defect I mean it's
 

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.980
on the other side to defect I mean it's
I mean who wouldn't do it but at the

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:10.990
I mean who wouldn't do it but at the
 

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:17.190
I mean who wouldn't do it but at the
same time it is not a political strategy

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200
same time it is not a political strategy
 

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.109
same time it is not a political strategy
and when you have a national movement at

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119
and when you have a national movement at
 

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:22.410
and when you have a national movement at
some point you have to ask yourself in

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:22.420
some point you have to ask yourself in
 

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.720
some point you have to ask yourself in
weather that can be the whole strategy

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:26.730
weather that can be the whole strategy
 

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.070
weather that can be the whole strategy
whether it can really be be successful

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.080
whether it can really be be successful
 

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.670
whether it can really be be successful
and coming back to my governance point

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680
and coming back to my governance point
 

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.520
and coming back to my governance point
what that means is that governance

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:38.530
what that means is that governance
 

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.150
what that means is that governance
having him in what Claire was describing

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160
having him in what Claire was describing
 

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.860
having him in what Claire was describing
is not just about robbing the Taliban of

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:47.870
is not just about robbing the Taliban of
 

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.050
is not just about robbing the Taliban of
their support by building institutions

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.060
their support by building institutions
 

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.060
their support by building institutions
around which the people will rally it's

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:55.070
around which the people will rally it's
 

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.450
around which the people will rally it's
also creating a base around which a

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:58.460
also creating a base around which a
 

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.870
also creating a base around which a
negotiation I mean some measure of

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880
negotiation I mean some measure of
 

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.810
negotiation I mean some measure of
national consensus can be built because

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:04.820
national consensus can be built because
 

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.720
national consensus can be built because
the Taliban will never negotiate and

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:07.730
the Taliban will never negotiate and
 

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.380
the Taliban will never negotiate and
come to any agreement with a government

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.390
come to any agreement with a government
 

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.180
come to any agreement with a government
that they despise and so building a

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.190
that they despise and so building a
 

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.850
that they despise and so building a
measure of credibility for a government

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:18.860
measure of credibility for a government
 

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.870
measure of credibility for a government
is part of a negotiating strategy not

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880
is part of a negotiating strategy not
 

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.690
is part of a negotiating strategy not
just to weaken the adversary but to

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:25.700
just to weaken the adversary but to
 

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.420
just to weaken the adversary but to
build a platform with which you can

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:28.430
build a platform with which you can
 

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.260
build a platform with which you can
negotiate with the adversary now what

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:32.270
negotiate with the adversary now what
 

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:36.300
negotiate with the adversary now what
does that mean in operational terms I

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:36.310
does that mean in operational terms I
 

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.970
does that mean in operational terms I
think it's all about the time frame this

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:39.980
think it's all about the time frame this
 

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.150
think it's all about the time frame this
is something that was alluded to

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160
is something that was alluded to
 

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.310
is something that was alluded to
throughout the day but I would want to

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:45.320
throughout the day but I would want to
 

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.850
throughout the day but I would want to
to go a little to push on that

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:48.860
to go a little to push on that
 

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:54.040
to go a little to push on that
particular point we tend to think again

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.050
particular point we tend to think again
 

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.940
particular point we tend to think again
in binary terms either we shoot them or

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:57.950
in binary terms either we shoot them or
 

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.670
in binary terms either we shoot them or
we negotiate and we're looking for the

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680
we negotiate and we're looking for the
 

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.500
we negotiate and we're looking for the
kind of data and moment in Afghanistan

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:04.510
kind of data and moment in Afghanistan
 

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.950
kind of data and moment in Afghanistan
that is not going to come that is I

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960
that is not going to come that is I
 

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.950
that is not going to come that is I
think from everything we heard today

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960
think from everything we heard today
 

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.240
think from everything we heard today
it's very unlikely that a Dayton moment

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.250
it's very unlikely that a Dayton moment
 

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.310
it's very unlikely that a Dayton moment
is coming it's very unlikely because

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:18.320
is coming it's very unlikely because
 

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.110
is coming it's very unlikely because
when you look at the preconditions of

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.120
when you look at the preconditions of
 

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.700
when you look at the preconditions of
both sides they're just totally

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:21.710
both sides they're just totally

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:58.850
overlap between the position of the two
 

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:02.830
overlap between the position of the two
sides at the moment and that means that

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:02.840
sides at the moment and that means that
 

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.400
sides at the moment and that means that
what is most likely is that we have to

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.410
what is most likely is that we have to
 

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.370
what is most likely is that we have to
gear form in a protracted and that I

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:09.380
gear form in a protracted and that I
 

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.770
gear form in a protracted and that I

very much even agree with what Jim was
saying on that point we have to gear for

saying on that point we have to gear for
 

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:19.540
saying on that point we have to gear for
a rather painful protracted multi-year

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:19.550
a rather painful protracted multi-year
 

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.200
a rather painful protracted multi-year

both military engagement and political
 

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.170
both military engagement and political
engagement now the political engagement

but what that means is that fighting is

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560
but what that means is that fighting is
 

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.090
but what that means is that fighting is
going to continue and negotiating more

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:46.100
going to continue and negotiating more
 

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.490

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500
accurately talking before negotiating
 

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.010
accurately talking before negotiating
probably proximity talks and that's why

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:51.020
probably proximity talks and that's why
 

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:54.370
probably proximity talks and that's why
at some point the UN will probably be

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:54.380
at some point the UN will probably be
 

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.080
at some point the UN will probably be
involved your knee you will need a third

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:56.090
involved your knee you will need a third
 

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:00.340

you know in a context of war talking

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:03.650
you know in a context of war talking
 

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.430
you know in a context of war talking
would be talking directly would be a

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440
would be talking directly would be a
 

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.820
would be talking directly would be a
sign of weakness and so none of the

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:09.830
sign of weakness and so none of the
 

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.630
sign of weakness and so none of the
fighting parties will want to talk

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640
fighting parties will want to talk
 

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.170
fighting parties will want to talk
directly and that's a very strong

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:16.180
directly and that's a very strong
 

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:20.050
directly and that's a very strong
argument for a third impartial party

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:20.060
argument for a third impartial party
 

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.090
argument for a third impartial party

probably will have to get involved
 

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.819
probably will have to get involved
because of that incompatibility

00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:40.829
because of that incompatibility
 

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:44.150
because of that incompatibility
and because of the fact that direct

timeframe is the sequence do you I mean
 

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:03.229
timeframe is the sequence do you I mean
will we inflict on ourselves what in a

that is not to have a real solid deal
 

00:43:10.229 --> 00:43:15.559
that is not to have a real solid deal
before the Soviet Union left which

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:11.310
you do keep military pressure but you

you do keep military pressure but you
don't have as a goal notion that you're

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:13.350
don't have as a goal notion that you're
 

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:15.440
don't have as a goal notion that you're
going to fragment more and more the

going to fragment more and more the
 

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.060

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.620
agreement on that and I think it will it
will probably come from an evolution of

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:33.630
will probably come from an evolution of
 

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.290
will probably come from an evolution of
military operation and the recognition

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:35.300
