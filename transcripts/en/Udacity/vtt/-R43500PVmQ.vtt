00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.140
We saw that how structure of the data
that is stored in an interrelational

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.600
database changes the way
we do access control.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.280
We also saw that certain
kind of queries,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.470
in particular queries that
return arrogate results,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.250
can leak potentially sensitive
data via inference attacks.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.030
So we studied this new kind of attacks.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.270
Inference and injection attacks.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.380
And ways in which we can address
those attacks for database systems.
