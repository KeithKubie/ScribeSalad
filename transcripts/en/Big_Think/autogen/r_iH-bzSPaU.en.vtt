00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
was unable to disconnect the oxygen and
 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.650 align:start position:0%
was unable to disconnect the oxygen and
therefore<00:04:53.520><c> had</c><00:04:53.790><c> to</c><00:04:53.820><c> ride</c><00:04:54.090><c> down</c><00:04:54.360><c> with</c><00:04:54.540><c> the</c>

therefore had to ride down with the
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
therefore had to ride down with the

tried<00:05:00.420><c> to</c><00:05:00.510><c> get</c><00:05:00.690><c> out</c><00:05:00.840><c> of</c><00:05:01.020><c> his</c><00:05:01.710><c> balloon</c><00:05:02.390><c> you</c><00:05:03.390><c> know</c>

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
tried to get out of his balloon you know
 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
tried to get out of his balloon you know
he<00:05:03.660><c> had</c><00:05:03.990><c> trouble</c><00:05:04.440><c> getting</c><00:05:04.560><c> out</c><00:05:04.830><c> of</c><00:05:04.860><c> the</c><00:05:05.040><c> seed</c>

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
he had trouble getting out of the seed
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.460 align:start position:0%
he had trouble getting out of the seed
so<00:05:06.090><c> there</c><00:05:06.480><c> was</c><00:05:06.600><c> lots</c><00:05:06.810><c> of</c><00:05:07.080><c> different</c><00:05:07.380><c> issues</c>

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 align:start position:0%
so there was lots of different issues
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.950 align:start position:0%
so there was lots of different issues

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 align:start position:0%
really bad thing about a capsule is if
 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
really bad thing about a capsule is if

the nice piece about a scuba like system
 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
the nice piece about a scuba like system
is<00:05:31.410><c> that</c><00:05:32.370><c> I</c><00:05:32.550><c> have</c><00:05:32.880><c> you</c><00:05:33.510><c> know</c><00:05:33.540><c> five</c><00:05:33.900><c> hours</c><00:05:34.200><c> of</c>

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 align:start position:0%
is that I have you know five hours of
 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
is that I have you know five hours of
oxygen<00:05:35.010><c> so</c><00:05:35.520><c> there's</c><00:05:35.730><c> nothing</c><00:05:36.120><c> compelling</c><00:05:36.810><c> for</c>

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 align:start position:0%
oxygen so there's nothing compelling for
 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.010 align:start position:0%
oxygen so there's nothing compelling for
me<00:05:37.650><c> to</c><00:05:37.830><c> get</c><00:05:38.100><c> out</c><00:05:38.420><c> disconnect</c><00:05:39.420><c> and</c><00:05:39.600><c> get</c><00:05:39.810><c> down</c>

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
me to get out disconnect and get down
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.350 align:start position:0%
me to get out disconnect and get down
right<00:05:40.350><c> away</c><00:05:40.470><c> I</c><00:05:40.830><c> have</c><00:05:41.310><c> lots</c><00:05:41.550><c> of</c><00:05:41.700><c> time</c><00:05:41.940><c> so</c><00:05:42.210><c> if</c><00:05:42.270><c> the</c>

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
right away I have lots of time so if the
 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.570 align:start position:0%
right away I have lots of time so if the
parachute<00:05:42.810><c> opens</c><00:05:43.110><c> hi</c><00:05:43.290><c> that's</c><00:05:44.040><c> not</c><00:05:44.310><c> an</c><00:05:44.460><c> issue</c>

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
parachute opens hi that's not an issue
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.850 align:start position:0%
parachute opens hi that's not an issue
so<00:05:44.940><c> there's</c><00:05:45.450><c> a</c><00:05:45.510><c> lot</c><00:05:45.690><c> of</c><00:05:45.840><c> safety</c><00:05:46.260><c> aspects</c><00:05:46.710><c> that</c>

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of safety aspects that
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.250 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of safety aspects that
come<00:05:47.070><c> in</c><00:05:47.280><c> to</c><00:05:47.460><c> this</c><00:05:47.610><c> particular</c><00:05:48.180><c> design</c><00:05:48.510><c> a</c><00:05:48.780><c> lot</c>
