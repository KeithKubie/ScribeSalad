00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.370
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.390
I'm Helena -- yes, good afternoon.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.690
[laughter] Wake ourselves
after lunch a little bit.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.190
I'm Helena Zinkham, director
for Collections and Services,

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.100
as well as chief of the Prints
and Photographs Division here

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.710
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.580
And it's my genuine pleasure
this afternoon to welcome you

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.010
to a special program featuring
Bob Adelman and Ira Glasser.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.690
They're going to talk about
their book "Visions of Liberty."

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.730
The subject matter is actually
quite serious, isn't it?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.960
Human right, civil
rights, civil liberties.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.410
But these are two imminent,
life-long advocates for justice,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.840
who happen to be quite
lively speakers as well.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.240
So this topic is going to come
alive for us this afternoon.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.530 position:56%
Back in 1991, when Bob and Ira --
documentary photographer Bob Adelman

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.560
and American Civil Liberties
Union president Ira Glasser,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.220
they teamed up for a book
called "Visions of Liberty,"

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.340
honoring the 200th anniversary
of the American Bill of Rights.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.870
Now almost 25 years later,
I'm looking forward to hearing

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.330
if you think we've made progress
or not, but we're also here

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.210
to celebrate the 800th
anniversary of the Magna Carta

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.610
and the 50th anniversary
of the Civil Rights Act.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.500
That's a lot of anniversaries
colliding, isn't it?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.790
Piling up.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.170
And they too will help us both
appreciate the achievements

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.420
and how much further down
the road we have to go

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.790
to actually reach social justice.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.840
To introduce you in a more
formal way to our speakers,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.330
you have wonderful biographies in
your program, so I am just going

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.920 position:56%
to mention briefly, on behalf of the
videotape, that Bob Adelman is one

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.750
of the foremost photographers
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.400
Born in New York City in 1930,
he grew up on Long Island

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.810
and has degrees from Rutgers,
Harvard, and Columbia.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.190
He studied photography with Alexi
Brodovitch, the famed art director

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.260
of Harper's Bazaar Magazine.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.380 position:56%
With an avid interest in social and
political events of the early 1960s,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.400
Bob was drawn to the sit-ins
staged by young students

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.360
across the American south.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.540
He volunteered to take photos of
the demonstrations for the Congress

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.370
of Racial Equality, CORE, and
has continued to be involved

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480
with Civil Rights issues and
the human condition ever since.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.300
In 2014, Bob was invited to
serve at the Library of Congress

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.270
as a consulting photographer,
to expand awareness

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.670
of our visual collections.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.510
Thank you for that.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.630
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.380 position:56%
Ira Glasser served with the American
Civil Liberties Union for 34 years,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.380
executive director
from 1978 until 2001.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.840
Glasser has published widely

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.490
on civil liberty principles,
as well as issues.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.610
His writings have appeared in the
New York Times, Washington Post,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.170
Village Voice, Harper's, New
Republic Nation, Christianity,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.430
and Crisis, along many others.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.320
He's also been a frequent
guest and debater on such radio

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.700
and television shows as William
F. Buckley's Firing Line.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.140 position:56%
Born and raised in New York, Glasser
achieved a bachelors in mathematics

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.490
from Queens College and
a masters in mathematics

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.660
from Ohio State University.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.610
A few words of thanks,
first to the Prints

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.180
and Photographs Division
staff, the Law Library staff,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.040 position:56%
and the Interpretive Programs Office
staff, who collaborated seamlessly

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.060
to bring a lot of disparate
parts together

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.410
for our program this afternoon.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.800
To see more of their talented
work, please be sure to take a look

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.610
at the very popular Law
Library blog, In Custodia Legis.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.200
The valuable Vision Materials
blog, called Picture This.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.990
And of course, the Civil
Rights Act exhibition,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.990
which is up in the
Jefferson Building all the way

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.450
through January.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.560
I also want to acknowledge
Roberta Shaffer.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.000
Are you here today?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.420
There you go.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.930
[laughter].

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.920
So quiet in the middle.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.990
Roberta, our inspirational
leader, a library leader.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.340
Former law librarian, associate
librarian for Library Services.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.950
But most importantly today, the
personal sponsor for this project.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.510 position:56%
Mr. Adelman's consultancy and
photography at the library is funded

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.550
through Roberta, a
self-described futurist.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.200
And here's one thing
I admire a great deal.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.840
Roberta, you see connections

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.260
that build a stronger future
direction for all of us.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.350
I don't think I ever would
have thought of the potential

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.220
for combining well-reasoned law
with the artistry of photography,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.360
and yet you knew how
to make it happen

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.790
so that there are creative
agents together

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.520
to make sure the world
changes and grows better.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.820
Robert -- [applause].

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:37.640
Great, thank you.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.530
So we almost called this
the Program of the Roberts.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.900
We have our sponsor, Roberta.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.680
Our wonderful chief of
staff, Robert Newlen.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.760
Bob. Would you like a new
middle name today, Ira?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.320
[laughter]

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.010
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: You're outnumbered.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So more seriously
then, our wonderful chief of staff,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.880
Robert Newlen, formerly associate
law librarian and mastermind

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.440
for the Magna Carta exhibition.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.290
You're going to tap your three
worlds of expertise, law, art,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.770
history, as a great moderator
for our program today.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.570
Thank you.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Thank you
Helena, for that nice introduction.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.080
It beats the last introduction
I had at a program recently.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.380
Maybe some of you were there.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.800
I was introduced as Robert
Newlen, who has been chief of staff

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.500
at the Library of Congress,
since December 1914.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.800
[laughter].

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.600
And I said, "That's why I
remember the Russian Revolution."

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.190
So Helena, thank you.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.080
That was really very nice.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.190
I think it's very appropriate today

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.490
that this program is
entitled Visions of Liberty.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.420
And I would also like to
acknowledge Roberta Shaffer

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.840
and making programs
like this possible.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.190 position:56%
And Roberta, we owe you a great deal
and are just very grateful for all

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.280
that you have and are doing
for the Library of Congress.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.180
With that said, it's a little
intimidating to be sitting

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.470
with two extremely iconic gentlemen
in the areas of civil liberties

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.800
and social justice, but here I am.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.010
And here's how I propose
that we spend the next hour,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.370
or whatever we have left now.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.570
We're going to start off talking
a little bit about how this,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.950
my dog-eared copy of "Visions
of Liberty: The Bill of Rights

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.160
for All Americans," came about.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.630
And then we're going to move to
Bob's photographs in several areas.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.780
And it's really Sophie's choice,
trying to choose photographs

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.380
that we want to talk about today,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.960
but thanks to Verna
Curtis, we have done that.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.420
And so gentlemen, I'm going to
open the question to you now.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.970
How did this book come about?

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.870
How did this collaboration start?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.170
And spare no details.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:06.830
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Well, he goes
like this, but it was his idea.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.810
[laughter] And those of you
who may not know him know

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.550
that he is pathologically
stubborn about his ideas.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:22.640
And he proposed this book to
me many times over many years,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.910
and each time he did, I
told him it was impossible.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.880
I couldn't do it, I
couldn't work with him.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.850
I already had a job as the
ACLU executive director

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:39.020
that occupied me 95 hours a
week, and what spare time I had,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.810
I was trying to reserve for
my children so that they could

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.100
at least remember who I was.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:51.070 position:56%
And he acknowledged that, a man of
great feeling, and then said, "Yeah,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.850
but it's a really important book.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.150
We really should do it.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.450
There isn't a book like it."

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.490
This went on, and on,
and on, and on.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.930
And I kept successfully
resisting it.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.700
Then it got to be close to 1991 and
the 200th anniversary, and he said,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.220
"This is really a compelling
time to do it."

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.250
And I resisted it again.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.600 position:56%
It was impossible, I couldn't do it.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.590 position:56%
So he said, "Well, maybe we can get"
-- you know, it was really supposed

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.660
to be a book of photographs
with captions

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.330
or maybe a paragraph caption.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:28.000
And so he said, "Well, maybe we can
get somebody to write the captions

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.900
and to write the paragraphs,"
and we thought of a few people.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.450
And I asked Kurt Vonnegut
if he would do it,

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.050 position:56%
because he was a big ACLU supporter.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.650
And he said, "No, you should do it.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.720
I don't know enough about this."

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.780
And this went on, and on, and on.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.170
We couldn't find anybody to do it.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.380
And finally, I don't remember
how, I agreed to do it.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.810
And then somewhere along the
way, because as you can tell,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.290
even by my story now, I'm
not a man of few words,

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.880
what happened is it turned out
from being a book of photographs

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.500
with captions to being a
book of text with photos.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.140
And then Bob basically
produced the book

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.020
with Richard Seaver
of Arcade Publishing.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.870
And I must say, I'm glad I gave it.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.610
And having the opportunity
to sort of put

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:29.620
on paper what I had been talking
about to countless audiences

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.960 position:56%
and trying to explain the importance
and origins of our basic values

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.320
of liberty in this country,
and having it accompanied

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:47.580
by the really glittering array
of photographs that we were able

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.500
to assemble, most of which
were Bob, and the others

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.240
that weren't his were ones
that he found and selected,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:01.990
was a great privilege and a great
joy, and I still love to leaf

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.920
through all those pictures.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.370
And they illustrate
things that words can't,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.250
and that has been Bob's
great genius, in my view,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.170
in tracking so many
movements of social justice

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.500
in this country as he has.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.720
So you have a right to reply,
if you have a different view,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.370
but that was how I [inaudible].

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:38.880
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the -- I think one
thing that we should all be aware

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:47.320
of is that, at the
time, if you remember,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.480
it was a very vivid
political process

00:11:51.480 --> 00:12:00.470
that the Constitution was
celebrated, the 200th anniversary

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.580
of the Constitution was celebrated.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.940
And Ira reminded me, it
was not the Bill of Rights

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.700
that was being celebrated,
but the Constitution itself.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.160
And when we published this book,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.980
there was very little public
acclaim for the Bill of Rights.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:33.030
Now, the reason I was always
so persistent in getting

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:39.410 position:56%
after Ira was because, first of all,
I didn't know anybody who knew more

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:46.970
about the Bill of Rights and had
more penetrative things to say.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:55.590
But I envisioned somehow
photographing all these landmark

00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:05.000
decisions and, you know, all the
social processes that led up to it.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.540
As it turned out, once
I got into it,

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.670
it was extremely difficult
to photograph.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.950 position:56%
For instance, I wanted to photograph
the tension of an immigrant

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:23.380 position:56%
or something, and getting permission
to go to Miami at that time,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.570 position:56%
where they were retaining a lot of
Cubans, it was virtually impossible.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.370
I couldn't get in, you know.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:37.170
So it was really very unfortunate.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:43.520
Yet my experiences are
that, for most Americans,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.450
the Bill of Rights is what
it means to be an American.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:56.190
And as Ira brilliantly points
out in the book, it is the place

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.310
that individuals interact
with government,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.930
and it's extraordinary individuals
who've won for us our freedom,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.680
our growing freedoms,
or contracting,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.920
depending on what the moment is.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:20.820
And so I'm glad we got the
book done, but I was very,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.590 position:56%
very frustrated in trying to do the
book, in terms of finding photogenic

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.400
and photographic opportunities.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:37.320
But the thing that someone
just mentioned to me,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.310
that a Russian woman,
who is a journalist,

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.150
has come to America just
to have her child here.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.050
She will return to Russia.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.550
But she wants her child
to be an American citizen

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:02.680 position:56%
so that he will be assured a freedom
if worst things happen in Russia,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.330
and that's just something
to think about.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.050
Imagine bringing another -- I
mean, she's not the only person.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.100
Apparently it's a very
real phenomenon,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:23.190
that to enjoy the benefits that we
have as Americans is so precious

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:28.700
that a woman would really
risk her lie traveling here,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.580
just to make sure her son, or
child, or daughter was free.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.880
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Terrific.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.530
I'm going to save the
Magna Carta question,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.770
because I think you've
given such a great segway

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.460 position:56%
to begin looking at the photographs.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.320
So Verna?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.890
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Were you
going to comment on --

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.660
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Yeah,
we'll come back.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.960
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Later.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.060
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Verna, can we
take a look at the first group?

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.780
And this first group of photographs
we're going to look at are all

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.860
about Martin Luther King.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.320
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: That's
during the Selma march.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.020
He was having foot trouble.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:17.120
And in fact, he didn't march a
couple of days because of it.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.150
And I particularly
like this picture,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:28.080
because he looks sort of militant.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.360
You know, when I first saw this
statue here, I didn't really

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.460
like it, because I always
thought he reached out to people,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.770
but this statue here,
he's closed in.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:46.810
But really, underneath all
that, he was very determined.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.120
But in addition to that,
he was a master tactician.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.370
You know, I think of the
Civil Rights Movement

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.770
as the last battles
of the Civil War.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:09.420
And compared to the Civil
War, in which hundreds of --

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:17.110
I think 600 or 700,000 people
were killed in the war that,

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:23.310
in these last battles of the
civil rights, waged in major part

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.770
under Dr. King's direction.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.120
There were very few casualties.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.290
We all believed in non-violence.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:36.370
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Ira, what kind
of thoughts come to your mind

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.320
as we're looking at
Bob's photographs now?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.620
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: How
much younger I was.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.680
[laughter] I mean, I
grew up in New York,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:56.310
and with that white liberal
illusion that many of us had,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.290
that racism was a southern
phenomenon,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.110
and all of this stuff was
going on in the south.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.800
And the first big demonstration
I ever went

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.650
to was the March on
Washington in 1963.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:20.340
And I was only 25 then, and I
was not yet working at the ACLU.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:29.390
And the feeling of people, black
and white, marching together

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:35.530 position:56%
in those numbers for what they were
marching for at that particular time

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:41.550
in your history was a
feeling that sort of can't --

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.050
it can be remembered, but
it can't be recaptured.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.220
And it's something that if I talk
about to my grandchildren, who,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:56.990
as they come of age, and this to
them is history, what that meant

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.620
at the time, what these
photographs document,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:09.950
was a participatory feeling
of turbulence, and change,

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:18.570
and great things underway that
it was difficult to describe.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:25.550
And these photographs, I don't
know if the slides include one,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:31.950 position:56%
but the ones particularly that Bob
did of the firehouses in Birmingham,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.830
I remember what it felt
like to first see those

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.670
in the early '60s, there.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:44.470
And that -- you know, I
remember thinking it reminded me

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.770
of an El Greco painting.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.550
It was not just an
extraordinary documentation

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.820 position:56%
of an extraordinary social struggle,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:59.660
but the art of those
photographs was just incredible.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.040 position:56%
And I remember asking Bob for a
copy of this, which I had on my wall

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.040
in my apartment in New York
as my kids were growing up.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.350
And every time they would
go back from the kitchen

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.220
to their bedroom, they
would see that.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.850
And sooner or later, they
would ask me, "What was that?"

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.630
I mean, you couldn't even tell
what it was without explanation.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:27.930
But to document that
sort of stuff in a way

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:35.040 position:56%
that somebody's words could never
reproduce comes as close as possible

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.620
to capturing the feeling of what
it was like to sort of be alive

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.430
at that time and take part in it.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.730
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Terrific.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.200
Verna, can we move
to our next section.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:53.560
And this group photographs
deal with civil disobedience.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.550
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Well, you know, I
might say something about Dr. King

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:06.690
that maybe some of
you know or don't.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.480
But, you know, he died at 39,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:20.230
and he traveled 24 million
miles as part of his mission.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.760
Most of that travel had to
do with going out to try

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.260
to fund civil rights activities.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.030
He was arrested, I
think, more than 30 times.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.190
Attacked numerous times.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.210
And he, you know, of course,
led the movement in Birmingham.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.080
That picture of the
hosing is actually --

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.170
Lillian Smith, the great southern
writer, told me we were going

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.240
to work together on
something that never,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.610
unlike our book, didn't come about.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:00.010
But anyway, she said, "Bob,"
she said, "don't pay attention

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.120
to what the whites are doing.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.600
They're doing the same stuff."

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:13.310
She says, "It's the blacks
in the Civil Rights Movement

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:19.620
who are taking their bodies,"
which were chained, and beaten,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.160
and slaved, "and they're
using their bodies.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.070
They're going to sit down.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.600
They're, you know,
standing up to vote."

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.360
And she said, "Just
watch what they're doing.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.170
That's what's new.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:42.900
The white people are just,
you know, resisting them."

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.300
And of course, she
also explained to me

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.050
that segregation wasn't
just separating the races.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.560 position:56%
It was an organized system of terror
to prevent blacks, essentially,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.810
from voting, but from, you
know, enjoying the full equality

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.930
that we fought the Civil War
to, you know, bring about.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.600
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Can you
tell us what was happening

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.900
in this photograph?

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.460
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Oh, well,
this is in Brooklyn, Ira.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.460
[laughter]

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.760
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: It was there too.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.590
Some of us didn't know
it, but it was there too.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.850
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: It's
at a building site.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:27.220
And this woman is preventing
a truck from exiting.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.270
There was -- at that time, the
building trades were quite --

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.150
they were very good
jobs, well-paying jobs,

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:42.150 position:56%
and they didn't have enough black
workers, and so they were protesting

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:49.440
that this was a state project or
something, building a hospital.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.300
And so -- and of course,
why is this woman out there?

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.520
Well, if the men can't get jobs,

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.620
they can't be husbands,
they can't be fathers.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:05.600
So anyway, they stopped
the trucks at that point.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: That was a big issue
in New York that a lot of people

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.430 position:56%
who regarded themselves as advocates
for racial justice, like me,

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.730
were not aware of for
a very long time.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.330
I mean, the New York City,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.360
particularly the construction
building trades,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.710
was a locked down union town.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.020
You could not have a job
in the building trades

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.810
if you were not a member
of the union.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.270
And labor unions, because of
the heritage of what happened

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:39.100
in the '30s, labor unions were seen
as an instrument of social justice.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.590
But in New York, they were an
instrument of racial exclusion.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.550 position:56%
My father was a construction worker,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.320
and he grew up d during
the Depression.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.470
And I still remember,
as a small boy,

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:56.290
that he hardly ever worked a
full week, and it was a struggle.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.370
But the only reason he had a job
was because somebody black didn't,

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.550
because they were excluded
from the competition.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.330
Even though there were
large numbers in New York,

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.550
they couldn't get into the union.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.790
And if you couldn't get into
the union, you didn't work.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.630
And I remember as a small boy
going to the union hiring hole

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.500
with my father and never noticing

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.270
that there weren't any
blacks there, ever.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.870 position:56%
And the reason I never noticed it is

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.840
because there weren't
any blacks anywhere.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.190
Not in my school, not in the
stores where my mother shopped.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:35.970
When I say not in my school, I
don't mean just not teachers.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.270
Not students.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.610
You know, New York was a
multiracial, multiethnic place,

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.770
but you lived in neighborhoods
that were entirely singular.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.860
There were Czech neighborhoods,
and Polish neighborhoods,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.640
and Irish Catholic neighborhoods.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.820
I lived in a neighborhood where
if you came down from my building

00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.170
and walked, you know, as far
as I could walk as a child

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.640
in any direction, you
never saw anybody

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.420
that wasn't white and
Jewish, you know.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.110
So one of the things that happened
is that not seeing black folks

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.440
in places where they
were being excluded

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.080
from with dire consequences,
like the labor union holes,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.090
or the voting lines, was not
unusual, so you didn't notice it.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.200
And that's why all of that
stuff that we was going

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.250
on in the south was also going on
in the north in different ways,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.970
but in ways in which the people who
supported racial justice movements

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.910
in the south managed to insulate
themselves from in the north.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:43.530
And the man who changed
that was Jackie Robinson.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.830
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: There you go.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.130
There you go.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.670
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Because,
I mean, this was 1947.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.820
This was what I like to call the
first great civil rights event

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.090
of the post-war era.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.030
And it was an event -- I was nine
years old, and if you were trying

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.750
to teach me about this
stuff in school,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.630
I probably would have glazed over.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.470
But the Brooklyn Dodgers were the
most important thing in our lives,

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.490
and all of a sudden, we were
involved in this racial struggle.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.320 position:56%
And what mattered to us, you know --

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.400
I often said if the Yankees
had bought up Jackie Robinson,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.850
I would have been a racist,
because we hated the Yankees.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.200
[laughter].

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.990
And what was important to us was
not the color of a man's skin.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.710
It was the color of his uniform.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.010
[laughter].

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.670 position:56%
And but of course, it was impossible
for the Yankees to have bought

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.940
up Jackie Robinson, because
the Yankees were a different --

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.040
we all knew that, you know,
if you were a Dodger fan,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.720
you grew up to believe
in social justice.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.330
If you were a Giants fan,
you were kind of confused.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.530
But if you were a Yankee
fan, you grew up to believe

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.440
in oil depletion allowances.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.540
And the Yankees were one of
the last teams to hire --

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.550
they didn't hire their first
black player till 1955, you know,

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.670
when almost every team
had every black players.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.590
But the important thing
is that Robinson went

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.120
through all this stuff, that
if you saw that movie 42,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.170
which was a pretty accurate
rendition of that history.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:08.740
You're nine years old,
this is your favorite team,

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.600 position:56%
and he was the most exciting player,
and this is your favorite player,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.370
and they are tearing him up.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:21.020
And the way I first learned
about racial exclusion in hotels

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.750
and restaurants was because
of hearing on the radio,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.150
during the broadcast
of the Dodger games,

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.580
that when the Dodgers played
the Cardinals in St. Louis,

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.590 position:56%
Jackie Robinson, and Roy Campanella,
and Don Newcombe had to stay

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.370
at a different hotel and
eat a different restaurant.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.390
28:35 And that's how I came to
learn about racial exclusion

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.340
and public accommodation,
and that's why I hated it.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.760
Nobody taught it to
me in moral terms.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.890
Nobody -- you know, you
just -- this was your guy.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.240
And it was an extraordinary
thing for --

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.200
people wrote later about what
Robinson meant as a role model

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.700 position:56%
for black kids, but nobody wrote
for many, many decades what it meant

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.970
as a role model for white kids.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:11.490
On my block, because
Robinson was our favorite,

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:18.180
we all imitated his batting stance,
his style of running the bases.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.080
He became a hero to us.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.530 position:56%
This was something that what I later
called the integration of the soul.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.230
I mean, it was an integration
that was going on psychologically

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.820
that we weren't even aware of.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.790
And I was never aware of it
until I came, decades later,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.280
to work at the ACLU, where I
discovered a strange thing,

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.580
which I first used to joke about,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.950
and then I realized
was not an accident.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:47.630
That was that every male person
who worked at the ACLU who was

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.900
about my age was an old Dodger fan.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.200
[laughter].

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.770
There were no Yankee
fans at the ACLU.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.070
[inaudible].

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.660
And that was -- and because one of
the things that happened is, also,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.250
you went to Ebbets Field, and
Ebbets Field in 1947, '48,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.110 position:56%
'49 was probably the only integrated
public accommodation in the country,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.840
because now, suddenly, black
folks came out to see Robinson.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.450
And so I'm 9, 10, 11 years old.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.640
I'm starting to go to
Ebbets Field by myself.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.150
I go to the game, and
I'm sitting next

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.090
to a black guy about, I don't know.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.390
He was 40.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.690
He was in undershirt.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.900
He was drinking beer, you know,
doing what baseball fans do.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.250 position:56%
And we were on the same side, and
we were rooting for the same things.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.140
And when somebody did
something good on the Dodgers,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.360
we were slapping each
other and hugging.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.060
This was an experience that a
white boy could not have had

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.310
and did not have anywhere
else in this country.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.320
And what it did is it
created a sense of humanity.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.520
These were no longer
people who were others.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.090
These were people who were us.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.240
And none of this was conscious.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.650
Nobody talked about it.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.790
Nobody -- but that's what happened.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.220
And this is the only place

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:03.080
where I ever saw black
folks in a normal setting.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.840
I didn't see them in stores, or
in movies, or in voting lines,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.790
or in union holes, or
in school, no place.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.340
I saw them at Ebbets Field.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.690
And it changed the country.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.380
That's why it was a great civil
rights event before anybody

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:24.400
recognized it as such, and not
just a great baseball event.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.700
And all of that stuff
that was happening

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.780
in the north was happening not
by law or the Ku Klux Klan.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.170
It was happening by
custom, and acceptance,

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.190
and complicity, and blindness.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:44.400
But it happened as strongly in the
north as it happened in the south.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.530
And at the beginning of
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.460 position:56%
nobody recognized that in the north.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.080
And after they were told
about it, they denied it,

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.420
and it became a big -- and the
labor union stuff, and the business

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.940
about that woman blocking the
construction was all about that

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.900
in a way that was not
explicit or understood by a lot

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.340
of well-meaning white
folks at the time.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.640
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Wow.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.660
Verna, can you go back to the
photograph of the soda fountain?

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.430
What was happening here?

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.680
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Oh, this was in --

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: The
white tower, right?

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.730
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Yeah,
White Castle in the Bronx.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:37.220
And CORE was trying to get jobs
for, you know, black workers.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:46.550
And there, the pickets
are outside, picketing,

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:55.190
though sometimes they came in
and sat in at the facility.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.560
But, you know, people will
often say, "Well, you know what,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.860
there was already discrimination,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.030
and in the south, there
was segregation."

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.450
But in fact, at certain
points, you know,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:16.290
denying somebody a job really means
often denying them a way of life.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:23.710
And you know, this is how,
you know, crazy all this is.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.310
Burning crosses in the
Bronx and all that.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:35.720
But if a black family moved into
a predominantly white neighborhood

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.590
or bought a house, that house
could be fire bombed or,

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.710
you know, blown up.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.440
So you know, the racial line was --

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.630
I mean, wasn't so different
on some bases.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.640
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: And you know, until
I saw that photograph years later,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.950
I didn't realize -- and I said,
you know, the March on Washington

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.890
in '63 was the first big
demonstration I ever went to.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:07.110
This was the first
demonstration I ever went to.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:13.780
It was a few years earlier, and my
oldest friend and I went up there

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.330
to take part in this picket thing.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.810
And you know, it was New York.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.590
We weren't afraid.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.820
And we went up there, and there,
you can see on those faces,

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.770
those are the same faces that you
see in pictures of Little Rock.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:36.530
And it was scary, because it was
-- the violence was just palpable.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:42.420
It didn't happen there, but
you could just feel it outside.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:49.910
And as Bob says, you know, this
stuff was as present in New York,

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:55.000
and Philadelphia, and Chicago,
and Boston as it was in the south,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.360
but in very different ways.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.550
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Verna, let's
move to the women's rights portion.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.090
Okay, here we go.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.730
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Is
that where it starts?

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.970
Oh. Is this the first picture?

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.270
[inaudible].

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.190
Ah, yeah. Because that's
a very well-known picture.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.490
This is, what, 1970?

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.570
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: '70 or '71, yeah.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.200
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Yeah, yeah, 1970.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.890
And this was the first
women's right demonstration,

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.620
at least I know about.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.260
And scholars have told me
that this is kind of one

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:43.560
of the definitive pictures
of the women protesting.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.380 position:56%
And the -- I mean, well [inaudible].

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:53.760
They were all girls in their
20s, young women in their 20s,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.460
holding up this enormous banner.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.860
It's going across Fifth Avenue, and
they're barely able to hold it up,

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.990
but they're determined, and
they had wonderful spirit.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:12.360
Now, I guess -- what's the next
-- yeah, you see, that's the --

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.790
they're all in, and
they're full of fervor.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:23.650
As we go through the pictures,
we will see more complications.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:24.950
This is -- [laughter].

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.250
It was --

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.600
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: One of the ironies

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:43.030 position:56%
of social justice equality movements
is that it demands the participation

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.760
in things you should
be opposing, you know.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.140
One of my gay rights
activist friends

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.430
in New York has always railed to me
about his disquiet about the push

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:01.330
to have gay people in the
army, because he said,

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.860
"I don't want anybody
in the army," you know.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.180
"Nothing good comes from that."

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.390
And you know -- and so this whole
-- but the point, of course,

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:15.440
is to overcome the
involuntary exclusion.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.770
So what happens is you very often
get involved in pushing for things

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.670
that every other part of
you is active in opposing.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.110
And so you had a lot of people
who were against the draft

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:35.100
in those early '70s [laughter], you
know, saying, "Let's draft women."

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.400
What?

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.180
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: I'll
give up my superiority.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.480
[laughter].

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.990
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: For equality.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.590
Verna, can you go back
to the photograph

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.990
of the [laughter] gentleman
with the hand gesture?

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:57.760
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: What does that say?

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.060
[inaudible].

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.360
[laughter].

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.660
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Bob,
I have to ask you this.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.230
He wasn't gesturing at you, was he?

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.650
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: No, no.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:08.640
He was going at the --

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.000
the demonstrators are
marching down Fifth Avenue,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.300
and he's in the crowd watching.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.360
And I think he's saying,
"Fong goo [phonetic]."

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.660
I think --

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.010
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: There you go.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.680
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: [laughter]
That's okay to say, right?

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.980
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Yes,

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.330
it's a well-known New
York ethnic reference.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.700
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: There you go.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.000
There you go.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.390
We were just bleeped on
the tape, but that's okay.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.750
[laughter].

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:36.050
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Oh, yeah.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.350
We saw that.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.650
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: One of the
things that's really interesting

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.370
about all demonstrations, and so
many of Bob's pictures show this,

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:49.420
is that the violent reaction that
peaceful demonstrators provoke

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.090
in people who are opposed to
the content of what they say.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.910
You know, sometimes the violence
is by construction workers.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.460
Sometimes the violence
was by men against women.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.220
Sometimes it was by
whites against blacks.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.370
Sometimes it was by
straights against gays.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.670
But it's always the same.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:11.650
There's always this almost
deformed look of anger and hatred,

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.890
and impending imminent violence
that people who are opposed

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.940
to the content of what is
being said feel on the outside.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.690
And all of those --
that's why it's very hard,

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.840
unless you've taken the pictures,
to know where they're from,

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.000
because there's something very
similar about all those faces.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.570
Susan B. Anthony, by the way, was a
very big supporter of prohibition,

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:52.230
just to balance things out a little
bit, and all of the depredations

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:58.000
of liberty that that involves and
still involves in respect to drugs.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:11.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Well, there's, you
know -- here we are, 50 years later,

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:17.500
and that still hasn't been
-- women are getting, what 75

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.830
or 80% of the salaries of men?

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.130
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Right.

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.590
It was 59 back then, so that's
what we call progress in America.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.500
[laughter].

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.100
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: The thing
that impresses me so much, Bob,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.830
about your photographs, it's
just, like, they're so fresh,

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.520
they could have been
taken yesterday.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:43.640
And also, just the other
thing, how intimate they are.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.460
How, you know, I really feel your
engagement in the photograph.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.900
You're not a bystander.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.100
You're a participant.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.990
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Well, I
photographed things I cared about.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.450
I mean, it's very funny.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.020 position:56%
I taught photography for many years,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:13.380
and whenever I had a
female photography student,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.930
we'd have discussions about
what they should photograph.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:21.830
I'd say, "Why don't you
try to photograph how

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:28.050
in your life you feel you're
not treated equally somehow?"

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.990
It's a great assignment,
but nobody ever did it.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:45.010 position:56%
Well, I think it's very, very hard,
and I couldn't do it quite that way.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.310
[laughter].

00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:05.480
And some of it, you
know, got pretty ugly.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.780
The --

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.080
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Yes.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.380
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: But I always --

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.440
in my own field, two of the great
photographers I had the privilege

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:20.400
of being friends with were
Diane Arbus and Dorothy Lang.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:27.610
And the idea of people not
being equal, very strange.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.830
42:30

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.490
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Verna, shall
we move to our last segment?

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.380
Which deals with gay rights,
and what a timely topic.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.320
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Oh,
I love this picture.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.420
[laughter].

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:50.550
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Yeah,
I never saw that one.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.890
That's great.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:56.360
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: You can see the
mother -- I mean, maybe I'm --

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.740
you' always interpret photographs.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.650
But the mother is with her son.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:07.730
Father, you see, he seems a little
more [inaudible] about this.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.910
Or is -- do you read
it that way, or --

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.230
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: I do.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.730
But God bless him, he's there.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.230
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Yeah.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:18.420
[laughter].

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:23.050
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: That's
a great photo.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.440
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: Well, this dates
back to the 1960s, you know,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:32.140
when people -- this was during
an anti-war demonstration but,

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.560
you know, people say, "Oh, look
at all of this sudden change."

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.630
Well, this has been, you
know, since Stonewall.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:45.870
But I mean, since the '60s, there
have been protests, and efforts,

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:55.700
and attempts to change laws
and give, you know, equality.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.000
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Yeah,
and one of the things

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.420
that is not well understand
still, I think,

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.930
is how infectious these
rights movements were,

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.320
that each one became
a model for the other.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.010
And this was explicit.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.970
I mean, I remember when gay people
first started coming to the ACLU

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.020 position:56%
to ask about lawsuits, when high
school students first started coming

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:24.370
[inaudible], when prisoners, mental
patients, children in foster care.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.650
All of these groups that were
somehow outside the protections

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.200
of the Bill of Rights.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.430
The Civil Rights Movement became
a model for, "Well, what about me?

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.730
What about us?

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.190
Can we do the same thing?"

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.060
There was the disability movement.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.710
I don't know if I saw
this in a picture of yours

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.170
or if I saw it somewhere else,

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:49.810
but there was this disability
rights demonstration in Syracuse,

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.340
New York in the mid '70s.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:58.350
And there was a young person in
a wheelchair with a big poster

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:03.670 position:56%
that said -- they were demonstrating
against the March of Dimes,

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:07.150
because the March of Dimes
had become very paternalistic,

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:11.590
and they had their
grievances, whatever they were.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.510
And then of course,
there came a time when,

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.390
once polio was virtually conquered,
the March of Dimes became passé,

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:22.940
and people stopped caring about
contributing to disability,

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.830
and they wouldn't contribute
to disability rights movements.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.990
And this kid had this big sign
that said, "You gave us your dimes.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.100
Now we want our rights."

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.310
It was a great, you know,

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.440
sort of startled reaction
that everybody had.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.600
And these movements
all fed on each other.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.850
If you look at the history of
the development of the law,

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.950
and the litigation, and the cases,
and the Bill of Rights applying

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.130
to blacks, and then the Bill
of Rights applying to women,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.550 position:56%
and then the Bill of Rights applying
to prisoners, and then the Bill

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.080
of Rights applying
to mental patients,

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.750
and the Bill of Rights applying
to children in foster care.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:01.630
Each time those cases came in,
they asked the same question.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.660
"Well, why doesn't the
Bill of Rights apply to me?

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.600
Why can't a prisoner have the right
to free speech that's involved

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.350
in keeping a diary in which he's
critical in the prison ward?

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:13.650
Why can't," you know.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.060
And so the issue of the First
Amendment as it applies in prisons.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.670
And all of these cases
became precedents

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.970
for all these other cases.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.780
So these movements
were never separated.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.960 position:56%
There were, to some extent, copycat.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.330
They were, to some extent, taking
the lessons of one movement

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:37.060
and applying them to my problem.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.740
And what happened in the '60s,
in a single summary phrase,

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.010
is that the Bill of Rights
became alive for people

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:51.030
to whom it had never applied,
and it happened over and over

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:54.550
and over again, and it happened
within a pretty brief period

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:58.030
of time, from about 1954,
when Brown against Board

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:02.920
of Education was decided, to 1973,
when Roe v. Wade was decided.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.960
Virtually of the rights that we
wake up with every morning and take

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.270
for granted were established
as enforceable rights

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.600
for the first time in
that 20-year period.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.180
And not just by the Supreme
Court, but by those movements,

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.860
which really forced
the issue on everybody.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.330
Yeah, that's right.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:31.760
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: I don't know --
I photographed important pictures

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:37.400
in Willowbrook, which helped
close that despicable facility

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.540
of the mentally retarded.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.060
I was just reminding
Ira [inaudible].

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.530
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Yeah, there's
a picture in the book of that.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.120
&gt;&gt; Bob Adelman: But
these are Dykes on Bikes,

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:57.990
[laughter] who are a wonderful
addition to the protest.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.130
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Well, we
have about ten minutes left,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.340
and I want to be respectful
of everyone's time.

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:12.070
First, I want to thank Bob and Ira
for this just amazing dialogue.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:13.870
And I will start the applause.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:21.480
[ Applause ]

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.750
And now I'd like to open
it to your questions.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:31.230
And Cliff has a handheld mic.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.530
Yes, ma'am.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.830
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.280
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Oh,
let's give you a mic there.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:43.210
During your experience, did you
ever talk to the people and find

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:45.270
out about what they were thinking?

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.450
For example, if you had talked
to me about the women's movement

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.630
and anything that I had
experienced, I would say,

00:48:54.630 --> 00:49:00.330
during one of my interviews, the
question was, "How do you feel

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:06.910
about taking a job away from a
man who has to support a family?"

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:11.620
I also grew up where my father
said to me, "It's more important

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.190
to support the boys than the
women, because you're just going

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:18.500
to have babies, to go to college."

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:24.530
&gt;&gt; Ira Glasser: Well, you know,
the -- it has always been true,

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.030
especially with respect to jobs,

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:32.630
in an economy that has never
had enough jobs for everybody,

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:39.210
the people who have access
to the jobs always benefit

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.930
from the exclusion of the
people who are shut out.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:49.070
When I used to talk
about affirmative action

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.970
to white college audiences,

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:57.610
who would ask about what they
called reverse discrimination,

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.550
because preference was
being given to blacks,

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.850
I would tell them my story.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:09.690 position:56%
And my story was, is that, as I said
earlier, my father took jobs away

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.550
from black construction
workers in New York

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:17.060
and never knew it,
and I never knew it.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.590
But I'll tell you what,
he benefited by it.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.970
I benefited by it.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.950
And I came to understand
that because,

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:29.560
on the day before Jackie
Robinson came to the Dodgers,

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:37.290
there were 400 baseball jobs,
25 per team for eight teams.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:44.260
And on the day he had a job,
one white person didn't.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.300
And you could say that he took that
job away from the white person,

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.470
but the white person and
never should have had that job

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:52.870
if there was an open
competition among all the people

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.520
who were excluded for reasons
that had nothing to do with merit

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.630 position:56%
or their ability to perform the job.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:01.470
And nobody talked about
women taking jobs away

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.970
from men during World War Two, when
they were all over there fighting

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:09.250
and when our economy and the war
effort was supported by women,

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:13.480
who after the war, were thought
to be unsuited for the very jobs

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.820 position:56%
that they were doing during the war.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.610
I mean, so the same thing is
sort of always true, you know.

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.300
And what happens with
those kind of questions is

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.760
that they play victims off
against each other, you know.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.010
When there are not enough jobs
to go around, it helps the people

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:31.730
who have them if whole classes

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:34.530
of people are excluded
from competing for them.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.700
And it's always -- I mean,
the reason why poor whites

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:45.500 position:56%
in the south were always supporters
of racial injustice in the south was

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.650
because the blacks were the
only people who were below them,

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:52.300
and their position in
the social and economic

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.280
and political hierarchy was
dependent upon the subjugation

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.580
of black people.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:01.130
So they had an interest in
maintaining that subjugation.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:07.650
And so the whole issue of taking
jobs away, taking housing away,

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:11.130
taking all that -- voting
is a perfect example.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.260
If you're going to let blacks
vote, whites aren't going

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.560
to dominate the election.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.860
If you're going to let --

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:21.450
I mean, women in this country
couldn't vote till 1920, remember.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.160
This was the land of the
free and the home of the --

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.850
this was, you know, all men
are created equal, you know.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:28.830
Turns out they really
did mean all men,

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.650
and they didn't even mean all men.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:31.950
They didn't mean black men.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:33.290
They didn't mean American
Indian men.

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:37.070
They didn't even mean white
men who didn't own property.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:42.610
The narrowness of the application
of the rights that we regard today

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:47.430
as universal, the narrowness of
the groups to which they applied

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:50.580
and the groups who were
excluded and on the outside

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:55.510
of those protections
is still something

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.440
that most Americans
don't understand.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:06.730
And we are all -- I mean, my
father was able to buy a home,

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:11.680
a suburban home, in 1950,
because he had a job

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.710
that black folks couldn't
compete with.

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:18.070
Then he was able to have that home
in the suburbs because he was able

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:24.540
to get a mortgage that black
folks were excluded from getting.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:31.450 position:56%
Then that home became the major form
of wealth for working class people

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:34.160
when they died and had bequest.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.690
And so people like me, and
then subsequently my children

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:42.800
and my grandchildren, had
benefits, financial benefits,

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.380
along the way that were the direct
result of the fact that my father

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.500
in difficult economic times did
not have to compete with blacks.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.920
Not for a home, not for a
mortgage, not for a job.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.590
And that's how I get to go to
college, and that's how my kids get

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.130 position:56%
to go to college, and that's how I
get a small inheritance from a house

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.290
that other people couldn't own.

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:08.600
And so when white,
of my kids generation

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.220
and my grandchildren's generation
who don't know any of this.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:16.640
Talk about reverse discrimination
and how utterly unaware

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.800
of how they were the
beneficiaries of discrimination.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.600
They say, "But I didn't
discriminate.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.900
And you didn't discriminate.

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.150
You spent your whole life
fighting against that, Grandpa.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:32.330
So why" -- but the fact
that we didn't discriminate,

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.330
the fact that we were
opposed to discrimination,

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.630
did not mean we didn't
benefit by it,

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:41.650
and that's where the moral
obligation comes from.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:45.770
And that's really a matter,
as the generations pass on,

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:49.690
you have to find some way to
teach that, because there's no way

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.940
that kids who are ten years
old today could know about it.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.240
[inaudible].

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.100
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Bob,
you've got the last word.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.350
Just tell us [inaudible].

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:02.030 position:56%
Lovely. Gentlemen, thank you so much

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.530
for this extraordinary
collaboration.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.120
Thank you for being here today.

relevant today as it was

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:10.530
when you published it in 1991.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.510
Thank you all.
