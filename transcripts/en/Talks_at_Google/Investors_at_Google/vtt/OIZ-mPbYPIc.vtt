MALE SPEAKER: Hello
and welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.320
Our speaker for
today is Jason Zweig.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.600
Jason writes a weekly column,
"The Intelligent Investor,"

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.710
for the "Wall Street Journal."

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.160
It's a very, very
popular column.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.210
He's also going to be speaking
about this book, "The Devil's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.180
Financial Dictionary."

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.590
So I'm not going to give
away more on the subject

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.110
of that book, though.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.200
But it's very interesting.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.880
If you look at the
array of subjects

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.460
that Jason has written about
over the last 30 years,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.250
he's written "The Little Book
of Safe Money-- an Investing

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.970
Guide."

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.390
He's also assisted the Nobel
Prize-winning psychologist

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.780
Daniel Kahneman in writing his
book "Thinking Fast and Slow."

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.815
Daniel Kahneman, for
those of you that know

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:54.150
gave a fantastic talk
at Google some time ago.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.910
And Jason frequently speaks
to CFAs, investors, students,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.080
journalists.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.810
So in talking to him before the
talk, I was asking him, hey,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.230
when did you get your CFA?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.050
And he said, I don't have one.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.990
And I said, do you have a CFP?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.070
He said no.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.680
And I said, well, at least
tell me you have an MBA.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.470
And he said no.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.080
And I found that
pretty interesting.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.320
And I guess he might talk more
about why or why not that is

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.780
a good or bad thing.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.680
Jason is guided largely
by a saying of his

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.240
father's-- it's remarkable how
much you have to learn in order

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.140
to realize how little
you need to know.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.800
It also brings to mind what
Einstein said when he mentioned

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.190
education is what remains
after one has forgotten

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.440
what one learned in school.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.650
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.363
please join me in
welcoming Jason Zweig.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.480
JASON ZWEIG: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.010
And it's my pleasure to be here.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.289
Like, I think, everyone
who writes and researches

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.820
for a living, Google has
been an enormous help to me

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.560
over the years.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.740
So I think turnabout
is fair play.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.040
I'll try to give you
some useful ideas today.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.320
And of course for the folks
who might be tuning in

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.620
later on YouTube, welcome to all
of you, and thanks to everybody

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410
for coming today.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.112
So I'm going to talk
about my new book,

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:32.570
"The Devil's
Financial Dictionary,"

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.570
but I'll also talk a little
bit at the end about my role

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.270
in editing the Benjamin
Graham book, "The Intelligent

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.230
Investor"."

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.380
And as many of you know,
Graham was probably

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.580
the greatest investment
adviser of the 20th century,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.240
the founder of the modern
discipline of security

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.900
analysis, Warren
Buffett's teacher.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.300
And it was certainly
one of the great honors

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.080
I've had in my
career, to be involved

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.280
in editing his book, "The
Intelligent Investor."

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.230
So this is "The Devil's
Financial Dictionary,"

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.400
and it was inspired very
directly by "The Devil's

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.500
Dictionary" by Ambrose Bierce.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.750
And thank you, Google
Books, if we have anybody

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.160
from Google Books in the room.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.740
This is the title page.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.780
The book first appeared in its
final form over a century ago.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.340
And many people would
regard it as one

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.870
of the funniest
books ever written

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.960
in the English language.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.060
I'm among them.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.900
And this is Bierce.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.490
He was born in 1842.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.920
He is believed to
have died in 1914,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.880
although no one
really knows for sure.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.780
He is believed to have died
when, weary of human folly,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.810
he walked across the border into
the Mexican Revolution hoping

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.890
that he would be shot.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.540
And no one really knows what
happened to him after that.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.570
But he did not
suffer fools gladly.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.560
And here are a few
examples of definitions

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.440
from the original
"Devil's Dictionary."

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.170
This is probably his
best known definition.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.580
Those of you who are
married-- [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.040
perhaps you can
sympathize with this.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.590
Love, noun-- a temporary
insanity curable by marriage.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.340
Another favorite of mine--
once you are in love,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.720
you should remember this.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.020
Jealous, adjective--
unduly concerned

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.420
about the preservation
of that which

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.920
can be lost only if it
is not worth keeping.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.880
Here's one of his few financial
definitions that's quite good.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.710
Finance, noun--
the art or science

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.530
of managing revenues and
resources for the best

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.140
advantage of the manager.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.540
And I've included this one.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.240
It gives you a sense of how dark
Bierce's view of the world was.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.330
I don't really
endorse his pessimism.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.940
You can draw your
own conclusions

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.600
about his personality.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.220
But I put it up
because those of you

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.580
who buy "The Devil's Financial
Dictionary" will encounter

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.870
some definitions that I've
written that also feature

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.830
these little-- I
call them flights

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.710
of fancy, in which an
imaginary character helps

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.410
us understand a definition.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:48.360
And in this case, Bierce is
giving two lines of poetry

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.940
from a non-existent
medieval English poet

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.860
named [? Bori ?] the Bald.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.570
But in any case, so why did
I want to write this book?

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.820
Well, some of you might be
familiar with the 19th century

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.560
British essayist and historian
Thomas Carlyle, who is today

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.120
perhaps best known for
saying that economics

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.290
is the dismal science,
which is a little quip

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.070
that he made in an article he
wrote, I believe, in the 1840s.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.230
And what I would argue after
almost 30 years of writing

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.750
about investing is
that if economics

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:42.280
is the dismal science, then
investing is the abysmal art.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.690
It is rendered boring
and overly complicated.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.940
A few words I've heard over the
years about various investing

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.760
books are some of these.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.290
I'm sure anyone in this room
who's read a book on investing

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.200
might have adjectives of your
own you would tend to apply.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.260
But it's never really
been clear to me

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.824
why there's no sense
of fun involved

00:07:12.824 --> 00:07:16.190
when we talk about
investing, and also

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.540
why so few people point
out the ridiculousness

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.030
and the absurdity that often
is involved when people manage

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.820
other people's money.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.900
So that's some of the spirit I
wanted to get at in the book.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.910
And the other thing
is it occurred to me

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:43.730
as I was thinking
about recapturing some

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.900
of the spirit of Ambrose
Bierce that maybe

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.070
if you can make people laugh,
you can help them learn.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.450
And I think one of
the real pitfalls

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.850
of traditional
financial advice is

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.650
it's so somber and
deadly serious, and sort

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.080
of self-referential, and
often self-righteous.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.350
And one of the things I've
learned over the years

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.620
is that yes, it's true.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.390
In the very long run,
financial markets and returns

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.680
on investments-- they're
driven by economics,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.230
the fundamental forces
of supply demand.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.450
But in the short-term,
the medium-term,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.039
even the fairly long-term for
many years on end-- 3 to 5,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.090
sometimes 10 years-- markets
are driven by psychology--

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:43.510
often crowd psychology,
sometimes abnormal psychology.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:51.750
And another wonderful thing that
a satirical dictionary format

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:58.250
enables a writer to do
is to look at etymology,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.630
the derivations of words.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.870
Because often one of
the things we pick up

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.490
when we learn where
words come from

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.840
is the hidden meanings that lurk
within the heart of terminology

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.190
we use every day without
really being very aware of it.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:24.280
One simple classic
example is-- and I'll

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.170
ask, does anybody in the room
know what do the words happy,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:35.270
happen, and perhaps
all have in common?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.090
Does anyone know
what the root word

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.660
"hap" means in early English?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.640
AUDIENCE: Chance.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.650
JASON ZWEIG: Exactly.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.050
Means luck.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.690
So remember the next
time you're happy, which

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.770
I hope will be in
a couple minutes

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.710
from now, remember that you're
happy because you're lucky,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.170
and to some extent, to
be lucky is to be happy.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.410
So I wanted to have some
fun with ideas like that.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.130
But it's also I wanted to
bring in financial history

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.990
because one of the critical
things investors need to do

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.910
is learn from mistakes.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.300
Now, we can learn
from our own mistakes,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.150
but it's a lot cheaper to learn
from other people's mistakes,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.590
right?

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:31.610
And a really simple, useful
definition of history

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.800
is it's the record of
other people's mistakes,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.070
and also their regrets.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.770
So we can learn from that.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.460
And then the final
thing that I think

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.100
satire is useful for is to
fight confirmation bias.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.120
To prevent us from
digging ourselves

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.370
into an ever deeper hole
of our own decisions,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.600
and just constantly
drilling down

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.090
to prove that what we've
already done is right,

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.730
and just to sink into this
sinkhole of our own sunk costs

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.530
until we can't get out.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.770
And if you can bring
a little sense of play

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.350
and make a little bit of
fun of people's ideas,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.440
maybe you can jolt them
out of that complacency.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.270
That at least was my hope.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.550
So I'm just putting up one
illustration from the book

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.630
just to give you a
sense of the feel

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.500
that the publisher and
I wanted to get across.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.680
Some you may recognize this is
a 16th century Dutch engraving

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.630
taken from a painting by the
great Dutch master Pieter

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.390
Brueghel the Elder.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.300
And this was
engraved around 1558.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.720
And the queenly character
sitting in the middle

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.410
is Avarizia, or greed.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.650
And you can see
all of these people

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.870
and creatures are
worshipping her, serving her

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.340
in one form or another,
filling her chest with gold.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.340
Her lap is full of gold.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.510
There's a frog in
the foreground,

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.320
or it might be a toad.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.080
Frogs and toads were symbols
of greed in medieval Europe.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.810
And there are all kinds
of other things going on.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.670
And at the risk of
bothering people

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.010
who are eating their
lunch, I'll point out

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.070
that on the far
right, a stork is

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:37.640
feeding from the bottom of that
figure immediately to the left.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.490
And so I wanted
to give you a few

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.050
of the definitions
in the book just

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.750
to give you a feel for
what I'm trying to do.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:54.170
And those of you who are in
the market for financial advice

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.340
should probably keep
these first two in mind.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.510
So big producer, noun-- a
stock broker or insurance agent

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.100
who produces big commissions.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.650
The term is erroneous, however.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.080
The broker or agent doesn't
produce the commissions.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.650
It is his clients
who produce them.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.760
He just collects them.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.970
So then financial
advisor-- often

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.670
someone who cares deeply
about being prudent, diligent,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.480
competent, and
honest, in which case

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.610
his or her services
will be priceless.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.360
Sometimes, someone
who cares only

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.300
about being a big
producer, in which case

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.803
you are in for big trouble.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.860
This is one of my
favorite definitions.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.810
It's very short.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.350
Potential conflict of interest,
noun-- an actual conflict

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.850
of interest.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.740
Every prospectus you
read, every document

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.430
your financial advisor
might hand you,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:06.780
will mention this term,
potential conflict of interest.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.820
And you should remember
that the real meaning

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.580
is actual conflict of interest.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:22.390
Forecasting, noun-- the attempt
to predict the unknowable

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.160
by measuring the irrelevant.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.730
A task that in
one way or another

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.850
employs most people
on Wall Street.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.090
Because the human mind
hates admitting the truth

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.510
that the world is largely
random and unpredictable,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.910
forecasters will
always be in demand

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.430
regardless of their futility.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.440
Wall Street follows what
marketing Professor J. Scott

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.660
Armstrong has called
the seer-sucker theory.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.960
For every seer,
there is a sucker.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.960
In the real world, as
with weather forecasts

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.740
or predictions about who
will win a sporting event,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.880
those making the
projections typically

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.210
estimate the likelihood
that they are correct.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.360
Wall Street forecasts,
on the other hand,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.180
almost never have
probabilities attached.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.630
As decision scientist Baruch
Fischhoff wrote in 1994,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.200
when both forecaster
and client exaggerate

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.110
the quality of
forecasts, the client

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.175
will often win the
race to the poorhouse.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.250
And long-term is another
favorite of mine,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.660
and I think it's one that's
very useful for people

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.310
to bear in mind.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.230
Long-term, adjective--
on Wall Street, a phrase

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.610
used to describe a period that
begins approximately 30 seconds

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.635
from now and ends at most
a few weeks from now.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:54.800
Now, here I've put up one
of my favorite images.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.500
This is a clay model
of the liver of a sheep

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.470
from ancient Babylonia.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.160
It was made sometime
between 1900 and 1600 BC,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.610
so it's well over
3,500 years old.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.550
Almost 4,000 years old.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.010
And here's the definition.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.610
Baru, noun-- in
ancient Mesopotamia,

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.910
a priest who specialized
in predicting the future

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.570
by studying the contours
of a liver or lung taken

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.930
from a sacrificed sheep.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.260
The baru worked from
an intricate template,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.700
often rendered as
the clay map, that

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.100
charted dozens of variations
on the surface of the sheep's

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.110
organ, as in this example
from the British Museum.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.270
We may safely presume that when
the baru's predictions didn't

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.810
come true, he blamed
it on the dead sheep.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.800
The modern version of
a Mesopotamian baru

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.895
is known as a technical analyst.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.810
This is another
illustration that I love.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.130
This is from a 15th
century British manuscript.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.010
And it might look a
little mysterious to you,

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.890
but I think you'll understand
when I read the definition.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.460
Bonasus, noun-- a
mythical creature

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.829
described by the ancient
Romans, and often included

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.960
in medieval bestiaries,
the bonasus closely

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.640
resembles a bull
but with its horns

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.910
curled back toward its tail.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.700
Because the horns are only for
show, as the Roman naturalist

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.800
Pliny wrote, the bonasus has
no way to deter predators

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.840
and will run away as
soon as it is threatened.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.870
When it becomes
panic-stricken, the bonasus

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:49.730
spews immense quantities of
flaming hot manure in its wake.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.610
As the next stock
market crash will show,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.120
the typical investor who
believes himself to be a bull

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.710
will turn out to be a bonasus.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.311
Do not stand too
close behind him.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.170
Irrational,
adjective-- a word you

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.184
use to describe any investor
other than yourself.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:20.390
So here I have a little set of
some of the behavioral finance

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.030
definitions in the book.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.850
They form a little bit of a
theme, as you might imagine.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.380
Overconfidence-- a belief
unjustified by the evidence

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.920
that one knows more or
is better than others.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.000
The predominant
personality trait

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.310
of most investors and
nearly every amateur trader.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.770
To be overconfident is to be
ignorant of your own ignorance.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.400
In the financial markets,
overcoming overconfidence

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.370
is essential and
extremely expensive.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:19:00.210
Bull, noun-- a person who
believes that an asset will

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.850
go up in price.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.590
A belief often based
exclusively on the fact

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.760
that the person
happens to own it.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.290
A bull in full stomp is
almost incapable of absorbing

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.325
any evidence suggesting that
the asset might go down instead.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.080
Bull market, noun-- a
period of rising prices that

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.060
leads many investors to
believe that their IQ has

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.140
risen at least as
much as the market

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.750
value of their portfolios.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.750
After the inevitable
fall in prices,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.523
they will learn that both
increases were temporary.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.720
And this one is very
important, and we'll

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.830
circle back to this when
I talk about Benjamin

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.380
Graham toward the end.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.440
Career risk, noun-- the risk
that by thinking independently,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.980
a money manager might lose
clients endanger a big salary,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.550
and harm his or her career.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.200
For money managers, the
only risk that matters.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.100
When professional investors
are right, no one will ask why.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.980
Their clients will be too
busy counting their profits

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.070
to seek an explanation.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.550
But when money
managers are wrong,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.350
their clients will
immediately want

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.000
to know why they
made the mistake.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.080
Portfolio managers can either be
wrong in a crowd, in which case

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.610
no one will blame them for
making the same mistake

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:32.260
everybody else made, or wrong
and alone, in which case

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.510
they will look like idiots.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.712
Option, noun-- sorry,
hang on one second.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.590
Like everything in life, this is
a little harder than it looks.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.560
Option, noun-- the
right to buy or sell

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.670
a financial asset
at a fixed price

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.400
on or before a specific time.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.880
From the Latin optio-- I choose.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.160
A boon for stockbrokers
whose clients

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.730
don't understand
how options work,

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.190
and generate a fortune
in commissions as they

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.830
attempt to learn.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.480
And here I have a
little flight of fancy.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.770
Explain [INAUDIBLE] asking me,
a client of the brokerage firm

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.880
born rich, and how?

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.230
I put two children through
Harvard by trading options.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.190
Unfortunately, they were
my broker's children.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.980
Perhaps the earliest
recorded options

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.350
trade according to
Aristotle was made

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.660
by Thales of Miletus
circa 624 to 547

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.880
BC, one of the seven
sages of Greece

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.240
who put down deposits on all
nearby olive oil presses one

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.140
winter when his knowledge
of astronomy purportedly

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.490
told him that the next year
would bring a good olive crop.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.960
Thales paid almost
nothing and profited

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.740
hugely when the
abundant harvest created

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.670
high demand for
presses, thus making

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.250
him one of the first
individual investors

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.470
to make more money trading
options than his brokers did.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.430
He was also one of the last.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.930
Now, obviously I have to
remind all the Googlers

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:20.970
that this refers to exchange
traded options rather

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.030
than incentive options.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:30.220
Broker-- the comparative
form of broke.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.640
Also, used as a noun, a
person who buys and sells

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.210
stocks, bonds, mutual funds,
and other assets for people

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.340
who are under the delusion that
the broker is doing something

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.510
other than guesswork.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.340
One early definition
of a broker sometimes

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.250
attributed to the
British lexicographer

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.790
Samuel Johnson is a negotiator
between two parties who

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.340
contrives to cheat both.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.710
And here I'd like to show you
this wonderful, although maybe

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:08.200
not so tasteful, engraving
from 1720 which illustrates

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.260
the South Sea Bubble and the
various other speculations that

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.440
swept through
Europe at that time.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.900
And these are two brokers who
are distributing securities.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:30.150
And you can see that hostility
to the financial industry

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.810
is not exactly a
contemporary phenomenon.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.000
This is almost 400 years ago.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:46.800
Panic, noun and
verb-- contagious

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.880
fear that sweeps across a
crowd, a market, or a planet,

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.810
frightening multitudes of
people into selling and leaving

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.500
the rest wondering
whether they should.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.350
Like swarms of cicadas long ago,
there were panics roughly every

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:11.660
17 years-- in 1819, 1837,
1857, 1973, 1893, and 1907.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.350
The word derives
from the god Pan,

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.280
who haunted the pastors and
wild places of ancient Greece.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.290
In the form of a grinning but
ugly man with the horns, ears,

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.290
and hairy legs of
a goat, Pan was

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.950
the god of herds and flocks,
serenading them with his pipes.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.550
Fittingly, Pan was
the son of Hermes,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.920
the god of shepherds,
messengers, diplomacy, travel,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.380
trade, and thievery, suggesting
that the relationship

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.800
between panic and trade is
as old as commerce itself.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.150
And this illustration
comes from September 1873,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.720
immediately after
the panic of 1873

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.230
that swept through Wall Street.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.870
And the caption is "Panic
as a health officer

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.040
sweeping the garbage
out of Wall Street."

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.000
New York, only a
few years earlier,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.210
had been subject to several
cholera epidemics that

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:15.590
were believed to have been
caused, very likely correctly,

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:20.050
by the abundance of
garbage in the streets,

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.800
including horse manure
and other things.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.990
And so sanitation workers
were organized and hired

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.960
by the city, and these sweeping
crews would go through.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.200
But here what the artist
has done very cleverly

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.950
is he's transformed one of
them into the Greek god Pan

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.090
to symbolize the financial
panic that had just struck.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.530
Risk, noun-- the
chance that you don't

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.610
know what you are doing
when you think you do.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.060
The prerequisite for
losing more money

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.530
in a shorter period
of time than you

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.270
could ever have
imagined possible.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.260
Risk can be formally
defined as the odds

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.450
of an adverse or
undesirable outcome.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.320
When the forecast is for
an 80% chance of sunshine,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.230
for example, then the
risk of rain is 20%.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.350
Or as the extent to
which extreme outcomes

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.060
differ from the average.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.680
It has been
philosophically defined

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.600
by finance professor Elroy
Dimson of London Business

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.830
School this way-- risk
means more things can

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.560
happen than will happen.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.710
In the end, risk is the gap
between what investors think

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.680
they know and what
they end up learning

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.050
about their investments,
about the financial markets,

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.032
and about themselves.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.080
Stock, noun-- the right to
own a fraction of a business,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.030
regarded by most investors as
the right to play a video game.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.930
So that gives you
a taste, I think,

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.320
of some of the definitions
I have in the book,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:12.110
and how I hope using a
little bit of a forked tongue

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:17.020
might help shock people out of
accepting things at face value

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.490
when they're dealing with
the financial markets.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.870
And here, just getting back to
the idea of disconfirmation,

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.730
are a couple of quotes from
Warren Buffett and his business

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.570
partner Charlie Munger
about Charles Darwin.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:37.570
And I think the main thing I
learned in working on this book

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:44.134
is how hard it is
to mock an idea

00:27:44.134 --> 00:27:49.450
and to poke fun at it
fairly if you don't

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.030
know what you're talking about.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:57.220
In order to hit the
target and to find

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.520
the humor or the
absurdity that's

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:06.100
lurking at the heart of an
idea or a marketing pitch

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:11.190
or any other investing concept
you might be confronted with,

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.020
you have to understand
it pretty well.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.700
Because if you poke fun at it
without fully understanding it,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.370
it just comes across as mean.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:27.940
And so far, in the 3 months
this book has been out,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.970
I haven't had anybody on
Wall Street complain to me

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.610
that I was unfair.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:37.040
In fact, a lot of investment
bankers and fund managers

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.910
have said to me, oh,
you were way too nice.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.470
So I think there's an
important lesson in this, which

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:52.720
is it can be quite
useful for you

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.040
as individuals and maybe as
members of an organization

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:08.760
before you commit to an idea,
an investment, a project,

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.600
or a significant
new initiative, it

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.790
might be worth privately seeing
if you can ridicule it first.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.490
What's funny about it?

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.040
What makes no sense?

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.996
And I think that can be
a useful mental exercise.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.190
Obviously I would run that
passed my supervisor before I

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:34.040
tried it if I were
you, but I think

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.450
there's a lot of
wisdom that can come

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.490
from trying to find the
absurdity, the humor that's

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.700
lurking inside an idea.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.410
Believe me, it's much better to
do it in advance, before hand,

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.340
than to find out after
the fact that what we just

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.490
spent all our time and
money on was ridiculous.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.620
So let me talk for a few
minutes about "The Intelligent

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.140
Investor."

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:07.100
In 2003 I had the great
honor of editing the book,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.400
and I learned a great
deal from doing that.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.890
Benjamin Graham
was born in 1894.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.810
He died in 1976.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.980
He was one of the most
successful investors

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.420
of the 20th century.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.480
And interestingly, he
spent a great deal of time

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.610
in the first edition of the
book on this question-- what

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.190
makes an intelligent investor?

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.170
And he took great
pains to emphasize

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.500
that it's not the
kind of intelligence

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:48.410
that we might normally associate
with intelligence measures.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:52.750
It has nothing to
do with IQ or SAT

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.390
scores or GREs or any
other standardized test.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.390
It also doesn't have anything
to do with credentials.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.030
And he was very
specific what he meant.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:08.530
As he put it, it's
a function more

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:14.750
of character than intelligence,
as most people define it.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.430
And he also, throughout
his writings,

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:22.690
enables us to see what
he meant by character.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.670
What makes that kind
of intelligence?

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:31.640
And these are critical
virtues for anybody

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.610
who wants to succeed
as an investor,

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.720
regardless of what
investing approach you take.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.650
So you have to be patient.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.890
You have to be prudent.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.650
It's very important to be
independent and skeptical.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.980
That's at the heart
of everything.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.380
You have to be curious
and eager to learn.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.860
That one, at least, has
stood me in good stead.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.820
You don't have to
be disciplined,

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.200
and that really
means self-control.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.710
So Graham drew a key
distinction between investment

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.580
and speculation.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.130
This paragraph I think every
investor should memorize.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.450
An investment operation is one
which upon thorough analysis

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.270
promises safety of principal
and an adequate return.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:24.460
Operations not meeting these
requirements are speculative.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.690
And then he defines
each of these terms.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.870
Thorough analysis--
the study of the facts

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:34.040
in the light of established
standards of safety and value.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.250
So you have to work at it.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.930
Safety of principal--
protection against loss

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.810
under all normal or
reasonably likely

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.680
conditions or variations.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.350
And here I want to
emphasize he's not

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:51.730
saying that the asset you're
analyzing can't lose money.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.590
What he's saying
is you should be

00:32:54.590 --> 00:33:00.650
very confident based on
evidence that the business

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:01.890
risk is minimal.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.700
That you're not buying into a
company or a market or an asset

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.570
class that will simply go away.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:15.130
You're not going to lose
90% of your money or more

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.630
because you didn't foresee an
obvious flaw in the business

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.860
model or in the valuation.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.890
And a really simple
example from the headlines

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.290
of the past few months would
be Valiant Pharmaceuticals,

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.700
which really built its business
on the idea of acquiring one

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.990
drug company after another and
then drastically raising prices

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.310
immediately after
the acquisition,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.150
which any number of
people said probably

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.300
isn't a sustainable
business model.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.770
And, at least based on what
we've seen in recent weeks,

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.380
that seems to have
been borne out.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.700
And this is the most fascinating
part of Graham's definition

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.340
of all, I think.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.840
What does he mean by adequate?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.230
Or he sometimes used the
term satisfactory return.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.310
Any rate or amount of
return, however low,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.409
which the investor
is willing to accept

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:15.370
provided he acts with
reasonable intelligence.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:19.520
So what he's really saying
is when you are investing,

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.730
you should ask yourself what
is the minimal rate of return

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.699
I'm willing to accept to
enter into this investment?

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.409
And that's a very helpful
way of steering people away

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.960
from having unrealistic
expectations,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.360
which is so often a problem.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.280
So Graham drew another
really helpful distinction

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.350
that I think is
often overlooked.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.840
He talked about two
kinds of investors--

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.239
defensive and enterprising.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:56.620
And the conventional
definition of investor-- I

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.950
think we've all heard it.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.880
Many of you have probably
taken questionnaires

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.360
that financial advisors
give you asking

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.820
you how much risk you want
to take or you can take.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.990
And often it breaks down
into these three categories

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:16.480
that I regard as kind of
silly, actually-- conservative,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.310
moderate, and aggressive.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:22.600
The notion that there are 100
million investors in the United

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.400
States, and only three
types seems a little silly.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.880
And there's a much
more basic problem,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.450
which is that it's
extraordinarily difficult

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.750
to measure individual
risk tolerance

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.466
before the risk
comes home to roost.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.130
Many of you may have taken a
risk tolerance questionnaire

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:51.740
that asks you if the stock
market went down 20%,

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.430
what would you do?

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.970
Would you stay put?

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.150
Would you buy more?

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.270
Would you sell?

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.560
I see people nodding.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.030
The problem is until
it goes down 20%,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.000
everyone says, oh
yeah, I'd buy more.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.410
Then it goes down 20% and
people sit on their hands,

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:15.100
or it goes down 50% and they
sell, or it goes down 80%

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.350
and they don't buy
another stock for 20 years

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.760
even though this risk
tolerance questionnaire said

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.330
they had plenty of tolerance.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.040
So Graham instead draws
a completely different

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.450
distinction, and it
has nothing to do

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.580
with appetite for
risk or the capacity

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.080
to take risk or withstand it.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.460
It's how hard you're
willing to work.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.600
How interested are you?

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.710
Presumably everyone in this room
and most of the people watching

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.590
online are interested
enough in investing

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.460
to spend a few minutes
listening to a talk.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.870
So you are probably
enterprising, or at least

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.000
tilting in that direction.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.900
And so Graham says,
if you're defensive,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.600
what you're trying to do
is avoid big mistakes.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.610
And, very importantly, you don't
want to work very hard at it.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.320
You don't want to spend
your Saturday afternoon

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.910
reading 10-Ks or downloading
financial documents

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.760
from the SEC website.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.160
And that's fine.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.820
If you are enterprising,
then you're

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.740
probably willing to
commit a lot of effort

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.200
to investing as an enterprise.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.230
That's why he chose that word.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.570
Because it is an enterprise,
it's an operation,

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.770
Graham called it.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.130
An operation.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.510
It's work.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.850
And for people who enjoy
it, it's a lot of fun.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.690
It's enormously challenging.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:45.840
The critical
observation here is it

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.130
doesn't matter whether you're
defensive or enterprising.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.680
What matters is that you
know which one you are.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.740
If you are defensive but you
think you're enterprising,

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.530
you're going to be very sorry.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.950
If you're enterprising and
you think you're defensive,

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.030
you'll be disappointed
because you

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:15.730
won't have done as well as
you could in bull markets,

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:19.330
and you probably will be
disappointed in bear markets,

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.280
as well.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:25.980
So for people who are
defensive, a simple portfolio

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.550
of index funds that you
never touch and never trade

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:35.440
is perfect-- totally
defensible decision.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.100
If you're enterprising,
that one's

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.580
not going to be very satisfying.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.990
And the virtue of all of this
is unlike the conventional way

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.270
of separating investors,
this is very easy to measure.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:51.690
Everyone intuitively
knows how interested am I

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.480
in investing as a process?

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:56.940
So another very
powerful idea for Graham

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.760
is the margin of safety,
and I'll summarize it

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.550
in a very simple
way, which is just

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:08.510
this-- that most people,
most individual investors,

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:12.390
ask themselves, how much money
will I make when I'm right?

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:18.820
And particularly among men, this
is a very standard question.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.620
Now, on Graham's terms,
the intelligent investor

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.460
instead will ask, or
in addition will also

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.930
ask, how much money will
I lose if I'm wrong?

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:35.200
That forces you to focus
on your margin of safety.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.590
Then just a couple of
quick distinctions here.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.930
So all of us in this room
are individual investors.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.270
Most people watching
online are also.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.550
And we've been told
for our entire lives

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.870
that we can't compete with big
institutions like mutual funds

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.370
and hedge funds and pension
plans, insurance companies,

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.910
banks, all the other
professional investors

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:03.800
with millions of dollars worth
of research and resources,

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.470
high frequency trading
platforms unavailable to us.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.560
And there is a calendar
ideology that you often hear,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.550
which is individual
investors can

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.750
beat the pros at their
own game if you just

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.380
are faster and smarter.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.880
And you heard this
a lot in the 1990s.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.690
It's been cropping up
a lot again lately.

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.150
But I would ask an entirely
different question,

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:38.750
which is why would you
want to play that game?

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:43.112
The pros can't
even win that game.

00:40:43.112 --> 00:40:47.890
Every year, typically, 70%, 80%
of all professional investors

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.540
under-perform the market.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.030
So why would I want to play
the game that they don't even

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.440
know how to win?

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.000
Wouldn't it make more sense
for me to play my game?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.830
And one of the reasons it's so
hard for professional investors

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.700
to win is because of the
way victory is defined.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.740
So they have to
measure success by how

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:18.270
they do relative to a market
benchmark like the S&amp;P 500.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:22.980
And, short-term, how are
they doing year to date?

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.230
Over the past 12 months?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.950
6 months?

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.700
3 months?

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:27.120
1 month?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.890
Week?

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:32.230
Often, many of them measure
their results daily.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.630
And that leads to an
obsession with the short-term,

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.560
and a complete myopia
for the long-term.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.090
But how would individual
investors-- how can you,

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:47.810
how should you measure success?

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.670
It seems pretty
obvious to me, instead

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.500
of measuring your success
relative to the S&amp;P

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.720
500-- who cares, right?

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.340
And instead of measuring
it short-term, just

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.190
measure it against what
you're trying to achieve,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.340
which probably isn't beating
the S&amp;P 500, and certainly

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:15.270
isn't beating it over the
past 60 days or 60 minutes.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.840
Many of you have probably read
the wonderful Richard Feynman

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.920
book "What Do You Care
What Other People Think?",

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.070
which I love.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.150
But I also love the
title of the book.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.870
This is such a helpful reminder.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.310
Why would I care whether
I'm beating the market?

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.960
That doesn't make
me richer or poorer.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.980
If I want to match the
market, I can do it

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.420
for almost free
with an index fund.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.250
Maybe I have other goals.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:46.140
But certainly
measuring my success

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.284
by what other people
are doing is not

00:42:48.284 --> 00:42:49.700
something I'm
interested in, and I

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.440
don't think anybody should be.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.420
And one of the critical
advantages for individuals

00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.170
is how long your time
horizon can and should be.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.760
I mean, many of you are young.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.420
You're in your 20s, your 30s.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.900
Those decades are
well behind me,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:16.120
but I measure my time
horizon in centuries.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:21.460
I often say I'm investing
for the next 100 years

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.110
because I have children, I
have causes I care about,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:31.090
and I'm not going to be able
to build the long-term legacy

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:35.620
with my family's wealth if
I focus on what's happening

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.440
today, this hour, this minute.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.810
So here are two wonderful
things that Graham said.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.280
This is from "The
Intelligent Investor,"

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.610
and it's so important,
I will read it out loud.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.990
"But note this important fact.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:57.820
The true investor scarcely ever
is forced to sell his shares.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.700
And at all other times,
he's free to disregard

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.720
the current price quotation.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.300
He need pay attention to it and
act upon it only to the extent

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.060
that it suits his
book, and no more."

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.100
And by suits his book, Graham
is using an old fashioned Wall

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:17.290
Street term for your
interim profits and losses.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.670
"Thus,"-- and I highlighted
this in red-- "Thus,

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:24.820
the investor who permits himself
to be stampeded or unduly

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.640
worried by unjustified market
declines in his holdings is

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.980
perversely transforming his
basic advantage into a basic

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.470
disadvantage.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.600
That man--" and of course
Graham was writing in the 70s,

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.210
and we could say, "that
investor would be better off

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:47.630
if his or her stocks had
no market quotation at all,

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:50.000
for the investor
would then be spared

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.800
the mental anguish caused
him by other persons'

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.480
mistakes of judgment."

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.540
And Graham often used
the term quotational loss

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.230
to describe what
happens when there's

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.230
an interim decline
in the market.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.370
So think about what
he's saying here.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:11.110
What's he's saying is that
as an individual rather than

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:16.910
an institution, you have
this massive advantage of not

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.870
needing to care about
what the market is

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.450
doing in the short-term.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:27.850
And if you do care, you have
taken your biggest advantage

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.620
over the institutions
and turned it

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.340
into a crippling disadvantage,
because what you've done

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.120
is you've shifted
yourself from playing

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.770
your own game on your
own playing field

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:46.420
or pitch to playing their
game, which they can't win,

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.040
and you surely can't
win because you don't

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.840
have the resources they do.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.760
Not that it would
help them win, either.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.040
So then Graham
said later in 1974,

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.240
"We have heard many complaints
that institutional dominance

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.820
of the stock market has
put the small investor

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.450
at a disadvantage
because he can't compete.

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.720
The facts are
quite the opposite.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.170
I am convinced that
an individual investor

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:17.420
with sound principles
and soundly

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:23.570
advised can do distinctly
better over the long pull

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.440
than a large institution.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.060
Where the trust company"--
which, of course,

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.500
today we would think of as a
mutual fund company or maybe

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.740
a broker or an investment
bank-- "may have to combine its

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.520
operations to 300
concerns or less"--

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.870
the biggest companies in
the country or the world--

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:46.530
"the individual has up to 3,000
issues for his investigations

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.480
and choice.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:52.010
Most true bargains are not
available in large blocks.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.650
By this very fact,
the institutions

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.880
are well-nigh eliminated
as competitors

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.390
of the bargain hunter."

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:02.140
So what he's really
saying is not only

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.310
can individuals do well
competing against institutions,

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.010
but there's some
reason to believe

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.230
if your head is in
the right place,

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.810
you could do even better.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:18.670
So what do I take
away from all of this?

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.200
The first is just to emphasize
the point Graham was just

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.870
making, which is you need
to position yourself.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:30.700
If you are an enterprising
investor, you need to ask,

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.500
where can I go where the
big institutions can't?

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.780
And one obvious
choice would be stocks

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.490
that are smaller than average.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.400
Another would be, just for
lack of a complex term,

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.590
stinker stocks-- companies
that have done terribly lately,

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.660
that professional
investors are throwing out

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.250
of their portfolios.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.320
They're throwing them
overboard as fast as they can,

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.110
creating value for the future.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.730
Stocks that are
hard to understand.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:06.560
You may, as engineers or
quantitatively inclined people,

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.300
be able to fight your way
through prospectus better

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.390
than a lot of
professional investors.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.850
Another way to be intelligent is
to be patient, extend your time

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:23.740
horizon years and
decades, as I mentioned.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.410
Be independent.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.590
And there's a wonderful
passage from Graham--

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.650
"You are neither right nor wrong
because the crowd disagrees

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:32.636
with you.

00:48:32.636 --> 00:48:37.000
You are right because your data
and your reasoning are right."

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.310
One of Warren Buffett's favorite
passages for good reason.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.180
And then there is
a wonderful saying

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.760
from Ralph Waldo Emerson,
the essayist and philosopher,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.930
that I love.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:53.180
"It is easy in the world to
live after the world's opinion.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.020
It is easy in solitude
to live after our own.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.670
But the great man,"-- the great
investor-- "is the one who,

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:06.230
in the midst of the crowd,
keeps with perfect sweetness

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.160
the independence of solitude."

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.080
And I wouldn't recommend
this in the workplace

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.840
or at home as a way to get
along with your family,

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.420
but as an investing philosophy,
it's absolutely brilliant.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.660
And if you look at the careers
of the world's greatest

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.610
investors, people like Graham
or Warren Buffett or Charlie

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.320
Munger, you very much see
this kind of mentality

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.050
at work-- people who
separate themselves

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:42.340
from the prevailing tides of
emotion in the marketplace.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:46.790
When other people are euphoric,
they find that troubling.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:51.300
When other people are miserable,
they find that exciting.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.750
And the only way you can
do that is with this kind

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:56.110
of emotional detachment.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.431
So thank you.

00:49:57.431 --> 00:49:58.930
I would love to
take some questions.

00:50:03.869 --> 00:50:05.160
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Jason.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.297
This was fantastic.

00:50:06.297 --> 00:50:08.380
Folks, if you have questions,
just raise your hand

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.280
and I'll pass on the mic.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.230
JASON ZWEIG: Yes, I'll
take this one first.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.854
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:12.854 --> 00:50:13.318
Thank you.

00:50:13.318 --> 00:50:13.782
A great--

00:50:13.782 --> 00:50:15.740
MALE SPEAKER: If you
don't mind me [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:17.517 --> 00:50:18.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.180
Very great, entertaining
presentation.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.500
But one issue we have, I
think even other people here,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.280
with the picking stocks
is that we don't really

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.880
believe that we can actually
pick stocks that are not

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.509
going to go out of business.

00:50:33.509 --> 00:50:35.300
See, it's very great,
like you were saying.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.770
So where is the stock that I
know for sure, if it goes down,

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.730
I'm going to buy more?

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.460
Even IBM is not
like that anymore.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.190
Like, there's no blue
chips or nothing.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:48.740
If we go to small
stocks-- it'd be

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.140
arrogant to believe
that we can investigate

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.570
their annual reports,
their management.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.380
They could be lying
in their reports.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.630
So that's why, I guess,
maybe we should just

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.170
declare ourselves
defensive investors

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.930
and go with the index, because
you know the index's not

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.040
going to go to 0, right?

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.581
JASON ZWEIG: So we hope.

00:51:09.581 --> 00:51:11.580
AUDIENCE: But if you can
say, maybe if you know,

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.250
which were the stocks
that maybe the large gaps

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.850
that we know that
Benjamin Graham used

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:21.280
to invest his core portfolio.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.220
Was it, like, the
standard [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.030
or whatever it was at that time?

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:29.920
And kind of what you think
could be equivalent this time.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.490
JASON ZWEIG: Well,
thank you for that.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:37.500
And I think you largely
answered your own question.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:42.210
I think the critical
factor for everyone

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.910
is to be well calibrated.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:49.440
You need to know about
yourself-- how defensive

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.700
or how enterprising
am I prepared to be?

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.580
And how qualified do I feel
to become enterprising?

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.750
If you're not
comfortable with it,

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:04.240
or you've done a
reasonable analysis

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.080
and you can't get comfortable
that you could ever

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.620
assess the probabilities, then
you should stay defensive.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.440
Now, being defensive
in Graham's terms

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.300
doesn't mean that your
portfolio should all be cash.

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.030
It just means you're
not going to analyze

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:22.170
individual securities.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:25.100
You could put all your money
in stocks if you wanted to,

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.690
and putting it in index funds is
a perfectly defensible choice,

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:33.910
and a classic defensive choice.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:36.720
I would add one
thing, I think, which

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.020
is that both Warren Buffett and
Charlie Munger, his partner,

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:46.370
have often talked about
the importance of combining

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:51.080
patience with what Charlie
Munger likes to call gumption--

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.530
you know, extreme determination
at the right moment.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:00.680
And if you have the
sort of temperament

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.610
where, in a period like
the fourth quarter of 2008

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:08.680
or the first quarter
of 2009, you can say,

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.480
I don't think the world
is coming to an end.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.900
I think financial
assets are cheap.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.360
I'm going to add more.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.440
So one way you can
be enterprising

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:24.010
is you could be enterprising
with a defensive portfolio.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.310
You could say, the
next time there's

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:30.370
a financial crisis or a crash,
and there will be one probably

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:34.220
sooner rather than later--
although I have no idea when.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.420
But the next time there's a
market panic, you could say,

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:41.530
I'm going to add a
substantial amount of money

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:43.710
to my portfolio.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.150
Now, you don't have to do that.

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.040
And the next crash might
be the final crash,

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.730
and it might turn out
not to be a good idea.

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:56.020
But if history is
any guide, people

00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:00.770
who take that step in
times of extreme disruption

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.960
tend to do very well
in the long run.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.650
I think we had
another question here.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you
for coming today, Jason.

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:09.630
Just had a question.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:12.980
Who do you think are the
Benjamin Grahams and Warren

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.540
Buffetts of the 21st century?

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:19.387
Your top three candidates
in your opinion.

00:54:19.387 --> 00:54:20.220
JASON ZWEIG: Oh boy.

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:31.660
I'm not sure I want to go on
record with that, actually.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.010
AUDIENCE: Stop the recording.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.510
JASON ZWEIG: I don't know that
that would make a difference.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:45.000
I think it's really
important to be

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.100
humble about anybody's
ability to identify

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:55.700
skilled managers in advance.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:01.050
And there certainly are
plenty of people out there

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.940
who are building great
track records right now.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.270
But the amount of
statistical analysis

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.680
you have to do on
their performance

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.720
to have any confidence
that it isn't just luck

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.240
is really significant.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:25.610
And in most cases, what
we have is reputation that

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:29.240
has gone largely unanalyzed.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.750
And there are not
that many managers

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.530
whose records I've really
statistically analyzed yet,

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.650
because typically
by the time I get

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:47.820
ready to do that, their
performance has deteriorated.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.800
So maybe talk to me afterwards.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.160
But for now, I'm going to pass.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.660
It' a really
interesting question,

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.895
but I'm going to pass
on that one for now.

00:55:57.895 --> 00:56:00.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Jason,
for a great, insightful

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:00.740
presentation.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.010
I have two-part
question, if it's OK.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:06.300
One is a follow-up on the
question that was just asked.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.140
If you were asked the same
question in the 70s and 80s,

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.010
would you have named
Buffett at that time,

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.300
or would you not have for
the exact same reason?

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.250
And if you would have,
why would you have?

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.560
JASON ZWEIG: Yeah.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.770
I think in the 70s,
very few people

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.110
would have named Warren Buffett.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.650
And there's a really
interesting, useful lesson

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.602
in that.

00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:32.470
In many cases, just
given the standard

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:34.440
margins of
out-performance we tend

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.220
to observe in the
stock market where

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:43.690
someone who out-performs a
benchmark like the S&amp;P 500

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:48.900
by 1 percentage point
a year compounded

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.400
is regarded as an
extraordinary achievement.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.710
So over a period when
stocks are up 7% or 8%,

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:59.570
someone who earns 8% or
9% gets an enormous amount

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:01.020
of favorable attention.

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.480
It's a pretty narrow margin.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.680
And then given the standard
deviation that is usually

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.890
embedded in a track
record like that,

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:16.060
often you need 50 to 80
years to have 95% confidence

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.360
that the person is
skillful and not lucky.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.560
And at that point,
you've pretty much

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.980
dealt with a human lifespan--
your own and the money manager.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.710
So there's kind of a
paradox that by the time

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.680
you can be confident
that the person is

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.880
really good at what
he or she is doing,

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.030
you're both about to die.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:43.220
So I don't think most
people would have

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.010
identified Buffett in the 70s.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.290
Quite a few did in the 1980s.

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:52.160
Carol Loomis, the great
financial journalist

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.620
at "Fortune" identified
him almost immediately

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.740
when she met him in the 60s.

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.720
Carol is a good friend of mine.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.310
And some other
people did, as well.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:08.810
But most people who've
invested in Berkshire Hathaway

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.560
arrived later.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.850
The ones who made the
most money from Berkshire

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:17.570
are the ones who
identified him earliest.

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:19.910
AUDIENCE: So second question--
during your presentation

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.080
you referred to one
specific example

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:29.310
where investors had a
loss of principal Valeant.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:33.750
When I look at the 13Fs, there's
quite a few renowned value

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.860
investors-- some
mutual funds that

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.490
go back all the way to the
70s that Buffett in the 70s

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:43.770
talked highly about,
some hedge funds,

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:48.030
some that actually worked
with Buffett in Geico.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:52.340
So a lot of past successes.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.430
What do you think,
in your opinion,

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.040
were errors of judgment?

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.720
You're obviously
looking in hindsight.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.030
And then were there
lessons that one

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.390
could have learned
from, say, something

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:08.230
like investigative journalism
that maybe the investors didn't

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.070
apply to dig deeper?

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:12.530
JASON ZWEIG: Yeah.

00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:19.320
I think the recent collapse
in the stock price of Valeant

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.200
Pharmaceuticals is going to
be a case study for years

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.650
to come in investing classes.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:30.860
And I don't think we have
the full explanation yet

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:34.370
of what the cognitive
errors were,

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:37.130
the analytical errors
that professional money

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:38.670
managers made.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:46.770
But I do think that what often
happens in situations like this

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:49.793
is-- and I'm speaking
in general terms

00:59:49.793 --> 00:59:53.550
because I haven't done any
direct research on Valeant,

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:56.610
and I haven't spoken
directly about it with many

00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:58.690
of the investors
you're referring,

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.250
so I'm just speculating.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:04.600
But I think in
many cases, people

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.250
rely on the assurances
of management

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:18.320
and let qualitative factors
skew judgments that otherwise

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.480
would be quantitatively based.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.980
And as an investor,
you always have

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.280
to be very sensitive
to retroactive

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.370
revisions of the reason
you own a security.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:41.950
If originally you invested
based on quantitative measures,

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.330
and you now find
that you're using

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.910
qualitative justifications
for continuing to hold it,

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:51.660
then that is a red flag.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.870
And certainly one
of the things I've

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.670
learned over the past
decade is the importance

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:03.690
of having a structured
decision process

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:09.940
and working off a checklist
or another template that

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.460
compels you to organize your
thinking and your rationale.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.050
And it also makes it harder
for you to migrate away

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:19.750
from that over time.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:23.600
And I think what we'll
learn with hindsight

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.780
is that many of these investors
bought the stock for one

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:33.720
set of reasons, and then
held it for a different set,

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.870
and that is always a
red flag in investing

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.010
as it is in a lot of
other things in life.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:44.790
I mean, someone who married a
spouse for one set of reasons

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:47.660
and then stays with the
spouse for another set

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.140
is probably not likely to
have a very happy marriage.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.410
And the same thing applies in
the financial world, I think.

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.910
Yes.

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:55.780
MALE SPEAKER:
Yeah, I noticed you

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:57.390
have a lot of comments
about marriage,

01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:04.020
and I'm wondering if your wife
is going to be watching this.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.250
We have time for
one last question.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for a great talk.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.410
JASON ZWEIG: Oh, you're welcome.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.464
AUDIENCE: My question
is on the definition

01:02:15.464 --> 01:02:18.880
of potential
conflict of interest.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.430
In managing other
people's money,

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:25.660
do you see any
model that does not

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.800
have the potential of
conflict of interest?

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.250
And then follow-up on it is
what do you think about the VC

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:37.980
model, where they charge
management a fee, and and 20%

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.010
on the profit, I think?

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:40.310
JASON ZWEIG: Right.

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:48.930
Well, there are many groups in
the asset management business

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:54.240
who will tell you that they
have no conflict of interest.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.340
In fact, I had a long email
dialogue about a year ago

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.830
with a financial
adviser who said to me,

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:08.430
my financial planning
practice is conflict-free.

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.490
I have no conflicts
of interest at all.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.100
Just ask my clients.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.760
And I tried to point out to him
that, in fact, no matter how

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:23.560
he charges, he can't help but
have conflicts of interest.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.350
In fact, if he
didn't charge at all,

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:27.810
he would still have a conflict.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:31.050
There's an irreducible
conflict in the fact

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.320
that someone who is
managing your money

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.880
is managing your money,
not his or her own.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.410
And I don't think there's
any way to eliminate that.

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:48.390
The key is for the asset
manager and the client

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:51.310
to be on the same
page and to understand

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:54.980
where the conflicts are
and what the conflicts are.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.050
So someone who is charging,
for example, 2 and 20

01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:02.370
as a hedge fund might,
or some VC funds might,

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:08.790
has a clear incentive to raise
money, hang onto the money,

01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.930
often take very
substantial risks.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:15.510
And one of the things
you want to look for--

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.200
and again, this is just
a bit of general advice--

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.860
is as engineers, you're
very familiar with this sort

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:22.770
of approach.

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.050
You want to look at
the dispersion, right?

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:29.240
You want to say, well, who
out there is doing this

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.970
more cheaply, and
what does it look

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:34.870
like over at this end
of the distribution?

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:37.510
And then who's doing it
much more expensively,

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.180
and what does that look like?

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:44.530
And then where in that continuum
does this person or fund fall?

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:46.580
And am I comfortable with that?

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.920
Is there a better,
cheaper way to do it?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:55.430
Or do the results seem to
be improved by higher fees?

01:04:55.430 --> 01:05:00.540
I mean, I guess it's
theoretically possible.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.920
But certainly what
you want to do

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.590
is you want to look at
the alternative ways

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.900
that you could be charged, and
ask yourself whether you're

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.720
more comfortable with one of
those other models of paying

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.800
fees rather than this one.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:23.020
You don't have to pay 2 and
20 if you don't want to.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.230
You might get stuck
doing it if you

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.520
like the people or
the process, but I

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.150
don't think you should accept
any fee structure as a given

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:34.970
or set in stone.

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:40.230
Increasingly there's
a diversity of ways

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:43.120
people will charge
to manage your money,

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.710
and I think, also, individual
investors tend to underestimate

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.910
their own negotiating power.

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:55.920
You should always get the form
80V, which is the standard SEC

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.970
disclosure that any
registered investment

01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:01.400
adviser has to provide.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.510
And often, when
you read the 80V,

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:07.350
you will see something
very interesting

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:10.730
that the person you met
with never mentioned.

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:12.600
Our fees are negotiable.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.460
Very few asset managers
will volunteer that fact,

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.810
but by law, if
they may negotiate,

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:30.440
they must say they negotiate
in the disclosure form.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.880
They don't have to
tell you directly,

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.340
but they do have to tell
you in the disclosure form.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:39.520
And if you see it there,
you should bring it with you

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.170
when you meet with the person.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:46.410
So I would just encourage you to
be as aggressive on that front

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:49.380
as you're comfortable
being because fees

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.230
are the primary determinant
of the difference

01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:57.230
between good performance
and great performance.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:01.100
And it's one thing that
you can control probably

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.890
much more so than you've
been led to believe.

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.600
So I would just encourage that.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.650
MALE SPEAKER: Fantastic.

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:08.390
This was great.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:11.510
And I really do hope that
when your book on marriage

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.930
is out, that you visit us again.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.020
JASON ZWEIG: I'll bring
my wife, [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.210
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
thank you so much.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:19.626
JASON ZWEIG: All
right, thank you.

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:20.750
My pleasure.
