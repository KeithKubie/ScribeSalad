00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.393
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's try this with some practice. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you think the solution set is

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:09.163
to this compound inequality? This last answer might look unfamiliar. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:13.618
two separate regions on the number line. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; When we want both regions, we use

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:17.890
the simple union, because we could have these answers or these answers. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So,

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.664
what values of x make this inequality true and this inequality true? Try your

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:22.955
best.
