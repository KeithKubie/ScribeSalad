about the Android platform is that we
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719
about the Android platform is that we
control how fast we iterate on the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
control how fast we iterate on the
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090

can do rolling rollouts of the product
through testing we typically roll out a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
through testing we typically roll out a
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429
through testing we typically roll out a
new release to about 10% of our user

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
new release to about 10% of our user
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679
new release to about 10% of our user
base and we monitor how the application

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
base and we monitor how the application
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080
base and we monitor how the application
is behaving we monitor both performance

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
is behaving we monitor both performance
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.830
is behaving we monitor both performance
and usage of the application and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
and usage of the application and
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.179
and usage of the application and
typically after a half a day we roll it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
typically after a half a day we roll it
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700
typically after a half a day we roll it
out to 50% of our user base and perhaps

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
out to 50% of our user base and perhaps
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.969
out to 50% of our user base and perhaps
after 24 hours we roll out to 100% it's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
after 24 hours we roll out to 100% it's
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.789
after 24 hours we roll out to 100% it's
been a great help in making sure our

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
been a great help in making sure our
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.219
been a great help in making sure our
application is flawless one of the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
application is flawless one of the
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350
application is flawless one of the
examples of leading a feature on Android

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
