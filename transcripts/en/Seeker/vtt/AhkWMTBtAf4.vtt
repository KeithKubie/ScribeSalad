00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.959
There’s a hole in the sun!!!

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:09.240
But no need to panic….unless you play Pokemon
Go...

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.740
Hello fellow sun-worshipers!

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.750
Ian here for DNews and I have a twisted story
of magnetic solar drama to tell.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.779
Now, you may have seen this video of the sun
from last week.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.179
It’s an observation taken by NASA’s Solar
Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, and it shows

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.730
the superheated solar atmosphere, or the corona.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.829
But you see that big, scary dark patch that
looks like a hole?

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.660
That is the thing that may affect your Pokemon
mojo… but more on that later.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.310
First, let’s get to grips with what’s
happening deep in the sun’s atmosphere..

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.290
So the cool thing about the solar corona is
that it is a highly magnetic region surrounding

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.290
the sun.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.240
Huge arcs of magnetism erupt from the sun’s
interior, trapping the sun’s ionized gases

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.480
-- called plasma.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.210
Through magnetic processes, this trapped plasma
is heated to crazy high temperatures to well

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.510
over a million degrees Celsius.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.329
So, what’s this “hole” all about?

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.210
Well, if you look at this SDO observation
of the sun, you can see the corona is filled

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.350
with beautiful bright loops of plasma trapped
in magnetism.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.370
These are known as coronal loops and they
are closed magnetic fields.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.729
Because they are closed, plasma is trapped
and heated, causing them to shine brightly

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.229
in extreme ultraviolet wavelengths.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.329
But often, these closed field lines give way
to “open” field lines -- basically regions

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.079
of magnetism that project from deep within
the sun, through the sun’s outer layers,

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.890
reaching out through the corona and far out
into the solar system.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.619
The sun’s plasma will use these open field
lines as a guide, blasting out into interplanetary

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.319
space like a firehose.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.439
These open field lines are the source of the
fast solar wind and as the sun rotates, these

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.030
“coronal holes,” as they are known, will
blast a stream of high-speed plasma through

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.270
Earth’s orbit.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.310
When observing the sun in ultraviolet wavelengths,
we see these coronal holes as dark patches

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.649
surrounded by bright coronal loops.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.720
Currently the sun is in a lull of activity,
approaching the solar minimum of its 11 year

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720
cycle.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.069
At solar minimum, the sun’s magnetic field
becomes less chaotic, so when these coronal

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.749
holes form, they can look pretty big and dramatic.

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.029
Now I know what you’re thinking: when is
he going to tell me about how this affects

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.029
me catching Pokemon??!!

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.020
As I mentioned, coronal holes are a source
of the fast solar wind.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.810
These high intensity streams boost the radiation
environment surrounding Earth and, if the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.690
conditions are right, auroral activity can
intensify even when the sun is pretty quiet.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.780
Auroras form at high latitudes when solar
wind particles rain through the upper atmosphere,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.830
causing atmospheric gases to glow.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.810
These geomagnetic storms can create global
electric currents that could overload national

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.830
power grids.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.920
Though unlikely, solar storms could even impact
satellites -- knocking out GPS and messing

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.730
with your search for Pokemon.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.640
Solar flares and coronal mass ejections can
also cause global radio outages, possibly

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.330
impacting air traffic control.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.450
Astronauts in orbit will also need to be extra
careful to avoid exposure to these radiation

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.450
hazards.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.390
So yes, the sun can impact our everyday, high-tech
lives, but in this case the sun’s coronal

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.140
hole looks way more dramatic than it really
is.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.480
