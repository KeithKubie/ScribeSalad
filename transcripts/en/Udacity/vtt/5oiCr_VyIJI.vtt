00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.220
Since our concern in this course is with operating systems, I'm going to

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.130
leave you to explore most of the physical layer on your own,

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.970
and focus on the part that has implications for the operating system

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.280
at the edge of the network, and end users like you and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.380
me. The most important piece of hardware for us, then, is the

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.850
network interface card, or NIC. This typically is a direct memory access,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.540
or DMA device. Meaning that once connected to the memory bus, it

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.490
has the ability to read and write from memory, on its own,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.930
independent of the CPU. Typically, the CPU specifies through the

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.490
bus, the range of memory it wants to be sent, whether

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.510
it's a read of write, and then sets the go

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.000
bit, to let the NIC begin. The NIC then tries to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.810
copy the data, as requested. Because the NIC controller puts

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.780
all of the copy instructions on the bus, the CPU doesn't

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.660
have to. He can go about his business, to the extent

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.080
that he finds the information he needs in the CPU cache,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.695
there won't be any contention on the memory

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:55.490
bus. Only when the NIC finishes either sending

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.440
or receiving a packet, need he bother the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.130
CPU with an interrupt. The NIC controller is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.720
also responsible for putting hardware specific headers and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.410
footers on the data. For physical ethernet, this

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.890
would include an inter-frame gap of silence, and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.250
a special preamble, to indicate the startup of frame.
