00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.490
Hi there everyone.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.070
You probably noticed over the
past few weeks, I haven't been

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.430
producing any videos either
here on Numberphile or my

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.780
other channels.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.360
That's not some bad omen
relating to the fact that our

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.300
last film was about
the number 6-6-6.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.830
In fact, I've just
been on holiday.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.130
I actually went and saw
something I've always wanted

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.960
to see, and that's
Mount Everest.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.750
So before we get back into the
usual swing of things here on

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.100
Numberphile, I thought I'd
share a few numbery facts

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.320
about the biggest mountain
in the world.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.170
So Mount Everest probably nudged
its way to become the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.900
world's highest mountain about
200,000 years ago.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.645
But of course, it wasn't
recognized as such until about

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:48.330
the mid 1800s during the Great
Trigonometric Survey of India.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.880
Peering into the forbidden lands
of Nepal and Tibet from

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.580
nearly 200 miles away, I
should say, surveryors

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.490
calculated what they called
Peak B, or Peak 15, to be

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.150
exactly 29,000 feet high.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.710
Now they didn't think anyone
would believe it was exactly

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910
29,000 feet high, so
they published a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.590
height of 29,002 feet.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.940
That's 8,840 meters.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.080
Now, the British weren't really
too clear on what the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.280
local names were for
the mountain.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.470
And that's still a reasonably
complicated debate today.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
So they decided they'd name it
after the foremost survey

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.395
boss, a guy called George
Everest, or Everest as we call

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.080
it these days.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.670
Now in the mid 1950s, not long
after the mountain had been

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.470
climbed for the first time, it
was remeasured and the more

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.690
accurate height of 8,848
meters was adopted.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.080
That's the familiar number
many of us know today.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.510
More precise measurements were
made in the 1990s, and things

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.040
didn't change very much, still
about 8,848 meters.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.940
But in 1999, some Americans
came along using GPS.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.980
And they put a spinner in the
works, publishing a new

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.690
height, 8,850 meters.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.830
For many people, that
still stands.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.880
Then in 2005, the Chinese came
along and published a lower

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.230
figure, 8,844 meters.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.600
They said the snow cap on
top of the mountain

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.830
shouldn't be counted.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.510
And they were using the
rocky summit instead.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.440
Now Nepal doesn't accept
this argument.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.960
They're sticking with 8,848.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.880
Now more measurements are
planned at the moment.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.860
These things are always
going on.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.480
And it's also worth noting that
Mount Everest is actually

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.500
growing by about half a
centimeter, one centimeter

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.620
every year as the Indian
continental plate smashes into

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.540
China forcing the
Himalayas up.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.290
In fact, in about a million
years, Everest would

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.820
theoretically be twice
as tall as it is now.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.150
But gravity and earthquakes,
things like that are unlikely

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.850
to allow that to happen.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.740
And of course, Everest is only
the king of the mountains when

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.180
measuring above sea level.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.020
The highest mountain measured
from its base to its summit is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.940
actually Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.350
Most of this mountain, of
course, is below the sea.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.900
And the furthest point from
the center of the Earth is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.880
actually the peak of this
mountain in Ecuador, which

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.870
benefits from the Earth's
bulging waistline.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.720
But whatever the numbers say,
whatever definitions you like,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.060
it's always going to be Mount
Everest that captures the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.790
imagination of people like me.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.350
Now there's a few numbers and
figures about Mount Everest.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.850
But that's enough of
my holiday photos.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.110
Our next Numberphile
video will be back

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.360
to business as usual.
