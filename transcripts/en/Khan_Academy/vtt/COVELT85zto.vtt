00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Narrator] Hi, this is
Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.800
and today I'm learning
more about Article III

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.070
of the Constitution.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.180
Article III establishes the
judicial branch of government,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.930
including the Supreme Court,
whose job is to interpret

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.600
the laws of the United States.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.840
To learn more about Article
III and the judicial branch,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.350
I asked two experts to give
me some more information.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.840
Jeff Rosen is the President and CEO

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.640
of the National Constitution Center,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.960
and he's written
extensively about the courts

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.700
and the Supreme Court in particular.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.680
Richard Garnett is a professor
of law and political science

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.670
at the University of
Notre Dame School of Law.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.190
Jeff, can you tell us a little
bit about the Framer's vision

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.350
for the judicial branch?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.300
How much power did they intend

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.460
for the judicial branch to have?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.690
- [Jeff] Let's start by reading the text.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.176
That's always the best place to start.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:51.440
The text of Article III, the
very first sentence says,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.180
"The judicial Power of the United States,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.800
"shall be vested in one supreme Court,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.495
"and in such inferior
Courts as Congress may

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.490
"from time to time establish."

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.490
The Framers expected that we
would have a Supreme Court

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.370
and that would be separate
from the legislature

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.990
and the president, but
it was up for Congress

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
to decide what other federal
courts we'd have, if any.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810
And it's so interesting that the Framers

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.530
are so focused on a
system where state courts

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010
are the main interaction that people have

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.380
with the judicial system.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.130
They didn't even require
Congress to set up

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.850
inferior federal courts at all.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.660
- [Kim] So what does Article III tell us

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.860
about how the judicial branch
is supposed to be structured?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840
- [Richard] Well, it
doesn't say a whole lot.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.673
It's interesting.

00:01:39.673 --> 00:01:41.710
So some people are surprised
when you actually read

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.140
the text of Article III.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.050
It sets up the Supreme
Court, and it says that all

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.760
of the federal judicial power is gonna be

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.740
in that Supreme Court, but
it doesn't tell us anything

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.160
about, say, courts of
appeals or trial courts.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.370
It clearly envisions that
Congress is gonna create some,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.720
but it really did leave
it to Congress to decide

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.270
how to structure the judicial system.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.020
- [Kim] So what are some
of the ways that the role

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.580
of the Supreme Court
has changed over time?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.206
- [Richard] I think it's fair to say that

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:16.280
there's a lot more federal
law than there used to be,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.460
and so there are more
questions that are potentially

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.030
questions for the Supreme
Court than there used to be.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.290
I mean, if you think of the
country's early history,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.470
most of the legal action was in the states

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.110
and the state courts and
the state legislatures.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.240
There wasn't that much, there
weren't that many questions

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.270
for the Supreme Court to answer.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.150
As the federal government
grows, as federal law expands,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.450
that creates more work
for the Supreme Court.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.150
What does equal protection mean?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.710
What does due process mean?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.700
What's the balance between
the freedom of speech

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.050
on the one hand and intellectual
property on the other say?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.960
These are questions that
the Founders might not

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.120
have been able to envision
being judicial questions.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.100
- [Jeff] Alexander
Hamilton, Federalist 78,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.560
famously said that the
judiciary would be the least

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.180
dangerous branch because it
had neither purse nor sword.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.970
The Framers thought the
Congress would be the most

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.910
dangerous branch because it
had the most enumerated powers.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.615
The presidency second,

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:15.000
'cause limited but constrained powers,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.180
and judiciary the least dangerous

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.860
because it didn't have the
army and it had no money

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.191
and all it could do was issue judgments

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:25.360
and hope that they would be
accepted by the other branches.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.550
- [Kim] So say that I'm
a Supreme Court justice.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.891
Good work, me.

00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.370
(laughing)

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.750
And a case comes before
me and it's up to me now

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.010
to interpret the
Constitution in such a way

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.190
that I can answer questions
about this certain case.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.710
So what would be some of
the tools that I could use

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.614
to help me in my interpretation?

00:03:49.614 --> 00:03:51.530
- [Richard] Well, there's obviously deep

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.470
and fascinating disagreements among people

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.070
about how exactly courts should do that,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.200
but one place where you could start,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.300
and I think there'd be common ground here,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.506
is that all justices believe
that it's important to ask,

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:06.520
how has the Supreme
Court answered questions

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.760
like this in the past?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.590
So the first place you would look would be

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.177
to the court's own precedents.

00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:14.170
Has the court answered
questions like this before?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.280
And if so, what did the court say?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.880
Because there is a strong
sense that the rule of law

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.020
needs predictability and consistency,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.189
and so courts really do make an effort

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.268
to have their rulings
be consistent over time.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:32.179
- [Jeff] You might also be interested in

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.960
empirical facts.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.910
What would be the effect

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.450
of a particular decision on the country?

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.180
You might also be interested
in theories of natural law,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.833
which we talked about in
discussing the 9th Amendment.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:49.160
Even if the right being
asserted isn't written down

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.190
in the Constitution, is
there some case that it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.280
is rooted in the history
and tradition of our law

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.680
and that it might come from
sources like God or nature

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.910
and not government?

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.660
Generally, judges have been
reluctant to enforce rights,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.430
natural rights, that don't
have a positive foundation.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.350
A positive right is a
right that's written down

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.860
or codified in some explicit way.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.870
A natural right comes from God or nature.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.150
But in practice, most of the
natural rights have tended

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.230
to be codified in history or tradition

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.350
and in state constitutions or state laws,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.520
so those would be other
places you'd look too.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.600
But what's really important
for viewers to remember,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.927
and I want all of you guys
to try to do this yourselves,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.830
try this yourselves at home,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.950
separate your constitutional conclusions

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.520
from your political conclusions.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.900
When you're evaluating a law, don't ask,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.790
do I think that this form of,
say, gun control regulation

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.950
is a good or bad idea as a policy matter.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.880
Ask yourself, do I think
the 2nd Amendment allows

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.240
or prohibits it, and
entertain the possibility

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.440
that your constitutional
conclusions might diverge

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.580
from your political conclusions.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.610
You might think gun
control is a good idea,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.650
but the 2nd Amendment prohibits it,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.770
or it's a bad idea but the
Constitution allows it.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.580
And that basic separation of political

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.290
and constitutional conclusions is central

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.280
to Hamilton's very theory
of judicial review,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.690
because that's what stops
judges from being policy makers

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.630
in robes and ensures that
they're preferring the will

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.710
of the people expressed
in the Constitution

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.730
to those of the legislatures,

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.660
which represent fallible policy views.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.170
- [Kim] As we learned from early cases

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.520
like Marbury versus Madison
and then even later cases

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.610
like Brown versus Board of Education,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.100
the Supreme Court can render decisions

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.100
that then no one enforces.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.830
So how has the Supreme
Court avoided becoming

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.340
kind of a moot point?

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.110
- [Richard] Yeah, there's a story,

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.860
and it might be apocryphal,
but it's a good story anyway,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.840
that President Andrew Jackson said,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.650
after the Supreme Court issued an opinion

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.750
that he didn't like, he said,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.194
"The Supreme Court has issued its opinion,

00:06:51.194 --> 00:06:53.320
"now let them enforce it."

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.470
Basically making the point
that all they could do

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.260
was issue an opinion
and it was up to others

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.010
to decide to comply.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.760
I think American culture,
and this is something for us

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.050
to be grateful for, it's been
built up over a long time.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.990
It has generally been that
we have a strong norm,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.700
that elected officials
should follow the law

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.460
as it's been declared
by the federal courts.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.930
Now there've been, as
you know, controversies

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.240
about court decisions
throughout our history,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.250
whether it was the Dred Scott case,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.460
which President Lincoln
hated, or, as you said,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.235
Brown versus Board, which was resisted

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:29.620
by some Southern officials
after it came down.

00:07:31.088 --> 00:07:34.950
The court's ability to
get its judgments enforced

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.330
depends on its credibility
and on America's culture

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.900
of respecting the rule of law.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.850
If the court's credibility goes away,

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.640
or if Americans stop
respecting the rule of law,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.210
then the court's judgments
will have less force.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.383
- [Kim] So the Supreme
Court exercises the power

00:07:52.383 --> 00:07:55.840
of judicial review, which
means that it reviews

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.710
the actions of the executive branch

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.070
and the legislative branch

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.010
and can declare those
actions unconstitutional.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.960
Do you think the Framers
intended for the court

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.130
to use that power to check the
other branches of government?

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.590
- [Richard] Most scholars
would agree that it was widely

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.660
believed that the Supreme
Court would have the power

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.370
to review the acts of both
other federal officials

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.710
and of state governments
and to decide whether or not

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.580
those acts were consistent
with the Constitution.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.650
There was a lotta
disagreement about how excited

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.280
people were about that power, and again,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.060
some people worried that the
Supreme Court might abuse

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.750
its power of judicial review.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.180
But the basic idea that it's
one of the jobs of a court

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.475
to make sure that the
acts of other officials

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:45.000
are constitutional, are
consistent with the written

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.950
Constitution, that idea
preexisted Marbury.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.610
That idea was clearly in
the minds of the Founders

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.018
when they created the Supreme Court.

00:08:53.018 --> 00:08:54.690
- [Jeff] I'm happy to say yes,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.740
the Framers did intend for the courts

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.382
to have the power of judicial review.

00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:01.056
I'm confident of that
both because the power

00:09:01.056 --> 00:09:06.056
was exercised by courts
before and after the framing,

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.270
and also because Alexander Hamilton,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.630
in Federalist 78, so
explicitly puts the case

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.463
for judicial review.

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:14.110
It's such a shame that
in that great musical

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.320
we've got the room where it happened

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.360
but we don't have the judicial
review where it happened,

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.910
because Hamilton would be a great song

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.910
about why Hamilton thought
that judicial review followed

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:30.690
logically from the very
theory of popular sovereignty.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.220
- [Richard] It really isn't
the job of unelected judges

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.050
to try to update and
improve the Constitution

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.530
that the people ratified.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.210
In some cases, this isn't
much of a challenge,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.290
but in others, say, in cases having to do

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.330
with the freedom of speech
or in cases having to do

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.420
with the war powers and so on,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.320
it can be a challenge.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.700
It can be a challenge to
figure out what exactly

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.750
the provision meant to
those who ratified it,

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.930
and it can be a challenge
to decide whether,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.280
if at all, the original
meaning needs to be updated

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.830
in light of more current events.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.330
- [Jeff] Now, there is,
of course, much to say

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.947
in response to Hamilton,
and we could have a whole

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:16.270
constitutional law course on
the responses to Hamilton.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.650
His very theory of
judicial review is premised

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.490
on the idea that the
Constitution represents the will

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.210
of the people more
emblematically or profoundly

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.010
or fundamentally than
those of ordinary laws.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.590
The obvious first response is,

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.450
"Hey, how can you say that
the will of a bunch of dead

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.750
"white guys from 1787

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.322
"really represents the will
of we, the people of today,

00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:42.860
"more accurately than a
law that Congress passes?"

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.830
The answer to the objection is, well,

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.320
it's because the Constitution was passed

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.660
by a special procedure.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.980
It was unusually deliberative.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.790
It took a long time to propose,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.940
and it didn't gain the
status of supreme law

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.010
until it was ratified
by special conventions

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.730
that were specially
called for the purpose.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.240
It was that long process of deliberation

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.210
that gives that
constitutional text the right

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.840
to speak in we the people's name.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.700
- [Kim] How could the
legislative or executive branch

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.850
check the power of the Supreme Court?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.360
- [Richard] Yeah, our
Constitution has a number

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.840
of these interesting checks
and balances features, right?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.000
So the three branches are distinct,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.770
but there's various ways in which they get

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.190
into each other's business.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.120
The President can veto a law.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.580
The President appoints
justices, but of course,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.030
the Senate has the say about
whether to confirm them,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.863
and so on.

00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:36.300
So the branches are separate,
but they are related

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.570
and they check each other.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.610
- [Jeff] Well, we remember
from the text of Article III

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.690
that the Constitution authorizes Congress

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.120
to set up such inferior courts as it may,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.110
from time to time, choose
to ordain and establish.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.210
Congress didn't have to
create inferior courts.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.770
It can create them, it can change them.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.740
There's a debate right now

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.002
about whether the Ninth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals,

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:02.640
which occupies much of the west,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.850
should be split up.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.950
Congress can split it up if it wants.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.560
Congress can change the number
of Supreme Court justices.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.790
There were originally six justices

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.590
and the number went up and down

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.428
before settling around nine,

00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:18.910
or rather settling at nine,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.920
in the 1860's.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.170
So Congress could change
the number of justices

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.320
to punish a president
on political grounds.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.720
When Thomas Jefferson was
coming in after the election

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.590
of 1800, the outgoing Federalist
Congress was so determined

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.340
to punish him that they changed the size

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.070
of the Supreme Court to deny him the right

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.170
to make any appointments.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.240
- [Richard] The other
branches can check the court

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.100
in a number of ways.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.580
So the most dramatic would
be you can impeach a justice

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.810
for high crimes and misdemeanors.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.340
That doesn't happen very often.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.790
Another way, which doesn't
happen all that often, but could,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.780
is Congress can

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.330
check the court by, for
example, not funding it,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.438
or by limiting the issues that
the court is allowed to hear.

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:09.410
Congress can control what's called

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.140
the jurisdiction of the court.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.870
The court only gets to
answer the questions

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.310
that Congress gives it
the power to answer.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.630
Now again, Congress is
reluctant to do that,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.710
but it has sometimes in the past,

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.860
and it could if Congress
thought it were necessary.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.280
- [Jeff] Congress can engage
in jurisdiction stripping.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.433
There's only a small category of cases

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:32.460
that the Supreme Court
is required to hear.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.060
But broadly, the court
has a broad discretion

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.310
over its docket.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.050
If Congress wanted to
say, "Hey, Supreme Court,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.930
"you're not allowed to hear
any cases involving abortion,"

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.640
for example, it arguably could do that,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.620
although such a law might be
constitutionally challenged.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.040
I remember being in law
school just kind of indignant

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.110
at the idea that Congress
could violate the separation

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.210
of powers so flagrantly.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.620
My great law professor
Akhil Amar convinced me

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.390
that this had been done
throughout American history,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.510
that before, during the Civil War,

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.750
Congress deprived the court of the right

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.420
to hear certain cases
involving national security

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.800
and so forth.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.240
So Congress can, if it chooses,
exempt certain categories

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.610
of cases, those that are not
in the original jurisdiction

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.440
of the court, from being heard.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.770
There's also the question
of whether Congress

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.160
can impose term limits for
Supreme Court justices.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.160
There's a proposal floating
about to have 18-year terms

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.670
for the justices and get
each president the right

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.840
to appoint two justices,
and have justices retire

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.470
after 18-year terms.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.067
There's a vigorous debate about
whether that could be done

00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:39.910
by an ordinary statute, or
whether it would require

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.220
a constitutional amendment.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.720
- [Kim] Well, if you had to
say there was one big take away

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.460
about Article III that
students should remember,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.950
what might it be?

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.450
- [Jeff] That when courts strike down laws

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.230
as unconstitutional, they're
not thwarting the will

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.420
of the people, they're
supposed to be supporting it.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.520
Because the Constitution
represents the will of the people,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.883
ordinary laws represent the
will of our representatives.

00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:06.180
The Constitution is supreme law,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.490
so that's why it trumps
ordinary legislation.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.530
- [Richard] You know,
Americans of good faith

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.080
and good reason have been disagreeing

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.360
about the court's role for the long time.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.530
I think a challenge for
the court is finding

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.800
the right balance between
asserting its independence

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.550
and exercising judicial
review on the one hand,

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.120
but on the other, being
mindful of the fact

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.160
that it is undemocratic.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.640
The judicial review sometimes
involves setting aside

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.360
what the people have decided they want.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.360
That's an awesome power, and
it shouldn't be overused.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.810
So the court, from time
to time in history,

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.070
has been criticized for,
perhaps, going beyond

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.340
what the Constitution actually requires,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.840
and instead enforcing, perhaps,
their own policy preferences

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.520
or their own political morality.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.430
- [Kim] So we've learned
that Article III is crucial

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.160
to the system of checks
and balances that limits

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.510
the power of government
in the United States.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.930
The Supreme Court exercises
judicial review to ensure

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.930
that the executive branch
and legislative branch

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.320
act within the confines
of the Constitution.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.230
But the other branches
have plenty of checks

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.820
on the judicial branch as well.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.010
One of the most central
questions about the Supreme Court

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.650
is the relevance of the Constitution

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.450
to the issues we face today.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.160
As Richard Garnett points
out, some scholars might say

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.660
it's undemocratic to overrule
the will of the people

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.430
as expressed through their
elected representatives

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:35.900
based on the Constitution.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.720
But, as Jeff Rosen
argues, the Constitution

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.500
is the supreme law of the land,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.560
and therefore striking down
a law as unconstitutional

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.410
isn't thwarting the will of the people,

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.830
but rather preserving it.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.390
