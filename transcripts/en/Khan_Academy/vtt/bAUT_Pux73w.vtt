00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to the presentation
on age word problems.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Let's get started.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.800
Well, I already have
one written down here.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.630
It says in 4 years, Ali will be
3 times as old as he is today.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.510
How old is Ali today?

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.520
Well, let's just say that x --
that's a little too big for

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:29.910
what I want to write -- x
equals Ali's current age.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.170
Or his age today.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.170
Please forgive my handwriting.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.530
If x is Ali's current age --
and here we say, in 4 years.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.400
So how old is Ali going
to be in 4 years?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.440
Well, if x is his current age,
in 4 years, he's going to

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.020
be x plus 4 years old.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:56.940
So that is equal to
Ali's age in 4 years.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.155
Let's read what other
information there

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:02.600
is in the problem.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.560
It says, in 4 years.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.040
So in this situation, that's
a 4, x plus 4, in 4 years

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.150
Ali will be 3 times as
old as he is today.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.750
Well, today he's x.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.116
So we say, in 4 years.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.140
x plus 4.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.520
And that's just --
so, in 4 years.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.360
So we could translate
that into x plus 4.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.010
That's going to equal 3 times
as old as he is today.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.210
Well, we know today he's x.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.820
So that's going to
be equal to 3x.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.110
And now we just solve for x.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.350
Subtract x from both sides.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.530
You get 2x is equal to 4.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.280
x equals 2.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.100
So Ali is 2 years old today.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.990
Let's do another problem.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.340
That makes sense, because if
he's 2 today, in 4 years

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.500
he's going to be 6.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.890
Which is going to be 3 times
as old as he is today.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.820
So it all works out.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.780
Let's do another problem.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.204
Let's clear this and now I'm
going to attempt to type.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:08.660
Hope I don't mess up.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.110
OK.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:24.420
The problem, is Nazrith is
4 years older then Omama.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:36.470
2 years ago, Nazrith was
5 times as old as Omama.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.690
How old is Nazrith today?

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.106
This one seems more difficult.

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:51.820
But I think we'll be
able to get through it.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.140
Let's figure it out.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.960
All right, so once again what
are we trying to solve for.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.270
We're trying to solve
for Nazrith today.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.450
So, let's say this is Nazrith.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.454
We'll say Naz for short.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.040
And let's say this is Omama.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.352
And this is today.

00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:16.780
I'm making a little chart.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.960
And let's say 4 years from now.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.580
4 -- oh, no, no.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.600
Not 4 years from now.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.640
I'm confusing myself.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.990
This would be 2 years ago.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.830
I'm still remembering
the last problem.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.600
2 years ago.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.980
So this is today, 2
years into the future.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
Let me make a little chart.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.910
It's not the cleanest chart,
but I think it'll do the job.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.500
So we're trying to solve for x.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.600
How old is Nazrith today.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.340
So let's just say Naz
today that is equal to x.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690
It says Nazrith is 4
years older than Omama.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.420
So this piece of information up
here-- let me underline it.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.240
Nazrith is 4 years older Omama.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.530
Well, that piece of information
tells us that Omama today, if

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.890
Nazrith is x, then Omama's
going to be x minus 4.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.740
Which makes sense because Naz
is 4 years older than Omama.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.090
Now we go into the past.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.430
Let's write like this.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.680
So, 2 years ago -- so if
Naz is x today, how old

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.900
was she 2 years ago?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.050
Well, she was going
to be x minus 2.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.080
That makes sense.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.940
If I'm 10 years old
today, 2 years ago,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.970
I'll be 2 years less.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.960
I'd be 8 years old.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.900
So, if she's x today, 2 years
ago she was x minus 2.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.690
And if Omama is x minus 4
today, than 2 years ago

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.580
she'll be 2 less than that.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.730
So she'll be x minus 4 minus 2.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.230
And that equals x minus 6.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.940
Which makes sense.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.230
And, notice that she's
still 4 years younger

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.050
than Naz, or Nazrith.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.890
Now we have one final piece of
information in this problem.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:12.330
It says, 2 years ago Nazrith
was 5 times as old as Omama.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.980
So, we're in this situation.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.500
2 years ago -- that's what the
sentence says, 2, years ago, so

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.570
it's this situation -- Nazrith
was 5 times as old as Omama.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.450
So Nazrith, which is x minus
2, was 5 times older than

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.010
Omama, which is x minus 6.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.030
So let's just write that down.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.160
So, Nazrith, 2 years
ago, was x minus 2.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160
We get that from the chart.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.050
Nazrith was x minus
2, 2 years ago.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.140
And that sentence tells us,
Nazrith was 5 times older

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.670
than Omama was 2 years ago.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.860
Omama, 2 years ago,
was x minus 6.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.670
Well, now we just solve for x.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.590
x minus 2 is equal
to 5x minus 30.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.450
Now we could subtract
x from both sides.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.280
And if you get 4x, I'm going
to switch it around, to

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.120
hopefully confuse you more.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.870
4x minus 30 equals minus 2.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:15.060
And then we get 4x is equal
to 28 and x is equal to 7.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.880
So we solve the problem.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.160
Nazrith, today is 7 years old.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.560
And does this make sense?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.620
Well, if Nazrith today is 7
years old, then Omama today

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.390
is going to be 3 years old.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.530
And that makes sense, because
there's a 4 year difference.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.500
2 years ago, Nazrith
was 5 years old.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.940
And 2 years ago Omama
was only 1 year old.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.890
Because x minus 6.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.080
So it makes sense.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.570
Nazrith is 4 years older
than Omama; Nazrith is

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.430
7, Omama is 3 right now.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.130
2 years ago, when Nazrith was
5 times as old as Omama.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.340
2 years ago, Nazrith
was 5 and Omama was 1.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.600
So it all works out.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.000
Pretty deep, no?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.990
Well, anyway, I think you're
ready to at least try some

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.200
of these age problems.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.120
And I'm going to do some
more example problems.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.060
So that you can come back
to this video page and see

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.620
more if you're still a
little bit confused.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.230
Have fun.
