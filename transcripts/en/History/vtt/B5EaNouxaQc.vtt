00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.758
The case was brought to Allen
Hynek by a man named Francis

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.971
Wall, who had been a private
first class in Korea during

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:16.975
the Korean War in 1951 where
his company was engaged

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.145
in hostilities, and they noticed
an object he described as kind

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.231
of like a Jack-o'-lantern
type maneuvering

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.109
where they were firing their
ordnance, their weapons.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.069
And they got its attention.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.781
So it starts to move
toward their position,

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.867
and they get permission
to fire on it,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.244
and they're shooting it
with their M1 rifles.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:37.912
And he says, to
Hynek, you could hear

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.624
the pinging sound on the
craft from their bullets.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.712
It begins to hit them with this
kind of ray which burns them.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.506
They get this uncomfortable
tingling sensation.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.717
It's obviously affecting
them neurologically,

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.802
and they retreat, at
which point this object,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.055
he says, just shoots up
into the sky and it's gone.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.475
They get evacuated out of
their position a couple of days

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.894
later, and a lot
of these soldiers

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.854
had high white blood
cell counts, which

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.647
is symptomatic of an infection.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.733
And then what he
said to Hynek was

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.693
that in the aftermath
of this a lot of them

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.945
had medical discharges and were
just sent home because they

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.697
couldn't function anymore.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:16.785
I think those cases are very,
very difficult to explain away

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.162
where they've obviously
being irradiated

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:24.834
with some form of energy
scrambling their body.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:28.463
And those have happened
before, and some of that

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.924
has happened in
connection with UFOs too.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.468
RICHARD DOLAN: Presumably
this came to Hynek many years

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.722
later to the Center for UFO
studies in Evanston, Illinois

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:38.890
where he worked.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.434
Private Wall, he's
the only person

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.020
to come forward with this
story, unfortunately,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.897
so there's no corroboration.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.233
According to what
he said, the Army

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:52.070
passed off the event
as war-induced trauma,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.322
hallucinations,
that type of thing.

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:59.536
And given the controversial
nature of the subject,

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:04.374
it's understandable that both
scientists and even witnesses

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.293
are reluctant to come forward.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.756
This was a terrifying
experience which medically

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.175
makes absolutely no sense.
