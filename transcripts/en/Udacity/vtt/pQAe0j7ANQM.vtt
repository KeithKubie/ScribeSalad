Okay, quiz. Why do we hash passwords? To keep snooping sys admins

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.520
from knowing everyone's passwords? Because people

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.160
often use the same password for many

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.980
websites. If the database is compromised,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.310
the passwords are reasonably safe. Or, you'll,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.680
if you don't hash, hash them, you'll regret it. Check all that apply.
