00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.790
Maybe we don't want all of
the listings to appear right away.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.250
We want to let the user chose to show or
hide them all on the click of a button.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.380
First we'll add two buttons,
show listings and

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.520
hide listing and a little bit
more HTML to structure our page.

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:17.985
I also added some CSS
to go with the HTML.

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:23.845
Each button has a unique ID,
show-listings and hide-listings.

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:25.865
Let's keep the naming simple here.

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:27.415
We'll create an event listener for

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:30.820
each button to make some functions
happen when the buttons are clicked.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.311
Here are our event listeners.

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.826
Clicking the show listings button
calls the showListings function, and

00:00:36.826 --> 00:00:41.134
clicking the hide listings button
calls the hideListings function.

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:45.205
Now, in the initialized function, we're
going to keep almost everything else

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:49.038
the same, in that we'll still create
an array of markers on initialize.

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:53.604
However we're not going to set the map
parameter on those markers right away.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.818
We also won't extend the bounds
of the map just yet.

00:00:56.818 --> 00:01:01.308
Instead we'll move that stuff
into our showListings function.

00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:05.310
So the showListings function will
loop through our markers array,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.740
set the map to map on
each of the markers and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.130
extend the bounds of the map
to fit each of the markers.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.570
Conversely, we'll create
the hideListings function which

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.280
loops through our markers array again
and sets the map to null on each marker.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.800
This doesn't delete the markers,
it just hides them.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.100
Awesome!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.850
Now we have some points on the map,
some interactions with the user, and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.110
lots of room for creativity.
