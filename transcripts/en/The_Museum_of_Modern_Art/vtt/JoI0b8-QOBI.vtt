00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.520
Could you take a baby step this way?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.280
Was I blocking “Starry Night?”

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.499
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:08.660
My name is Anne Umland.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.640
I’m a curator in the Department of Painting
and Sculpture here at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.800
I often get asked, “So just what is it that
you curators do all day?”

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.820
Curators are responsible for acquiring works
of art for the collection.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.380
We discuss how to display those works.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.440
When, where, why, how?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.250
Some of you may have seen me in episodes of
“At the Museum”

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010
or “How to See.”

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.729
And in response to those episodes, you’ve
sent in all sorts of great questions.

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.000
We thought we’d do a Live Q&amp;A to answer
some of those questions.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.739
Like, well, “how do you become a curator?”

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.469
Or “how do curators decide what works go
on view in a gallery or in an exhibition?”

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.299
Or “once you’ve decided what's
going to be in a given gallery, how should

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.299
it be framed?”

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.720
“How large should a pedestal be? How much space should you allow?”

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.120
Oh my goodness, this is one of my most favorite
galleries in the Museum.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.149
I hope that you will submit some questions
down in the comments section.

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.640
You also will be able to post questions to
me live on April 24.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.960
In advance of that, I’d encourage you to
subscribe to the Museum’s YouTube channel,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.120
and there you’ll be able to check out some
of the other great videos that the team here has made.
