00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
&gt;&gt; My name is Ilana Weiss, and I work on the
Leadership Development Team as part of Google

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.420
University.
And today, it is my pleasure to welcome Tim

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.709
Brown to the "Authors at Google" series.
Tim Brown is the CEO and president of IDEO,

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.550
a global design consultancy focused on creating
impact through design.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.690
IDEO has won more industrial design excellence
awards than any other firm, and has been ranked

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.010
in the top 25 most innovative companies in
the world by BusinessWeek.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.650
Tim is an industrial designer by training.
And his own work has earned him numerous design

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.800
awards, and has been exhibited at MOMA in
New York City, Axis Gallery in Tokyo, and

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.400
the Design Museum in London.
He has participated in the World Economic

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.350
Forum and the TED Conference.
Tim has led strategic client relationships

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.200
with organizations such as Pepsi, Mayo Clinic,
Proctor &amp; Gamble, and Steelcase.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.180
Many of us are here today because IDEO is
a company that we really admire.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.080
Innovation is a core value that drives what
we do here at Google, and who better to understand

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.370
and also reflect that value than Tim?
We're also lucky here today, because we're

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.320
among the first to hear about his new book,
hot off the presses last week, "Change by

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.190
Design: How design thinking transforms organizations
and inspires innovation."

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.909
Please join me in welcoming Tim Brown.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.210
&gt;&gt; [applause]

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.140
Tim Brown: Okay.
Well, thank you.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.490
It's great to be here.
It is great to be here.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:38.390
So, I'm going the talk for maybe 25 minutes
or so on what happens when we move from design

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.450
to design thinking.
I'm going to start off with a little bit of

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.900
autobiography.
And this rather lousy image is actually the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.439
first thing that I ever was hired to design
professionally.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.830
I wasn't even out of design school yet, actually.
And it's a woodworking machine, or at least,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.700
it's a piece of woodworking machine.
And I was hired to make it a little bit easier

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.240
to use, a little bit more attractive, so that
this company could sell more spindle molders

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.550
and wood saws and other machinery that many
of you may have used; I don't know.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.599
And, you know, I think I did a pretty good
job.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.840
In fact, if you happen to be on your vacation
in England, and happen to visit a woodworking

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.200
shop, somewhere in the north of England, as
you may do -- I don't know.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.400
I do often -- you'll actually find these machines
still being used today.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.840
Unfortunately, you won't find the company
that makes them, because that went out of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.880
business, actually, quite soon after I'd done
my project.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.840
The next project that I did is a fax machine.
And, again, I was hired to put an attractive

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.989
shell around some -- what was then -- relatively
new technology.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.290
And again, to make it a little bit more attractive
and easy to use.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.890
This is actually one of those things that
ended up in the design museums.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.099
But again, 18 months later, the product was
obsolete.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.160
And, of course, now the whole technology is
obsolete.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.660
My teenage daughters don't even know what
faxing is.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.550
Many of you may not either.
So, you know, it occurred to me that what

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.940
passed the design maybe wasn't all that important.
You know, making things a bit easier to use,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.110
making them a bit more attractive, making
them a bit more marketable.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.239
By focusing on "a design," I was being kind
of incremental and not having very much impact.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.330
But I think this kind of small view of design
is a relatively recent phenomena, and actually,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.650
kind of emerged in the latter half of the
20th century as design became a tool of consumerism.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.340
So, when we talk about design today and, particularly,
when we read about it in the popular press,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.970
we're often talking about products like these.
Amusing? Yeah.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.300
Desirable? Probably.
Important? Not very.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.170
But this wasn't always the way.
And I'd like to suggest that if we take a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.730
different view of design, and instead of focusing
on the products, focus on design thinking

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.590
as a process, then design perhaps ends up
having a bigger impact.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.849
So, again, this is a bit of a Brit-themed
talk today.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.669
And I apologize, but that's where I come from,
as you may recognize from the accent.

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.069
I don't know. Does anybody recognize this
guy?

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:24.279
Not including the people who already watched
my TED poll.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:30.610
Okay, so this is, you know, perhaps the 19th
century equivalent of Larry Page and Sergey

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.449
Brin.
This is where people wore more interesting

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.449
clothing, I think, maybe.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.449
[laughter]

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:43.580
But this is Kingdom Brunel, and he was a truly
great engineer, and I think, design thinker

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.930
from the 19th century in Britain.
And he built many firsts, including the Clifton

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.610
Suspension Bridge, one of the first suspension
bridges in Bristol.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.960
And the Thames Tunnel at Rotherhithe, one
of the then longest, underwater tunnels in

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.219
the world.
His most famous creation in the south of England

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.259
 -- I grew up very close to it -- and it's
called the Great Western Railway.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.759
And, in fact, one of my favorite things to
do as a kid was to ride my bicycle along the

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.800
edge of the railway line waiting for the big
express trains to roll past, much to the consternation

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.780
of my mother.
You can see it represented here in JMW Turner's

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.759
painting, "Rain, Steam and Speed."
What was remarkable about Brunel when he built

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.710
this railway was that he wasn't just thinking
about, "How do I engineer a railway?"

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.740
He said that what he wanted to achieve for
his passengers was the experience of floating

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.199
across the countryside.
It's a really great way of thinking about

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.499
building a railway.
And, in order to do that, he had to create

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.389
the flattest gradients that had ever yet been
built.

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.139
And that meant long viaducts over river valleys.
This one is actually over the river Thames,

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:01.659
at Maidenhead, and long tunnels like the one
at Box in Wiltshire, but he didn't stop there.

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.469
He didn't just stop with trying to make the
best railway journey he could.

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:11.889
He imagined an integrated transportation system,
where it was possible to get on a train in

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:20.409
London and get off a ship in New York.
One journey from London to New York.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.699
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built
to take care of the second half of that journey,

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.990
one of the first transatlantic steamships.
So now, although this was a century before

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.349
the emergence of design as a profession, I
really think that Brunel was using design

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.139
thinking to come up with great innovations
and world-changing designs.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.740
And I'm going to talk a little bit about what
that is.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.499
Design thinking starts with what Roger Martin,
the University of Toronto Business School

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:53.689
dean, calls "integrated thinking," this ability
to hold opposing constraints in one's head

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:00.619
and, from that, get to new solutions.
In design, this means balancing desirability

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:06.249
 -- what people need and want -- with technical
feasibility and economic viability.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:11.729
And with breakthrough designs, like the Great
Western Railway, we often stretch that balance

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.479
to the very limit and sometimes break it.
And I'm sure many of the things that you do

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:22.839
do the same thing.
So, somehow we went from this to this.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:29.469
We went from systems' thinkers who were reinventing
the world around us to a priesthood of folks

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:35.300
in black turtlenecks and designer glasses
working on small things.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:41.649
As design emerged as a profession, it focused
on a steadily smaller canvas, until it came

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:47.849
to stand for fashion, aesthetics, and style.
And, you know, I have to admit -- I'm a fully

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.419
paid member of that priesthood, and somewhere
my jacket has my own pair of designer glasses

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:55.039
in it.
So, I'm throwing stones at myself, as well

00:07:55.039 --> 00:08:02.360
as my colleagues, in the design industry.
But, I think design is getting big again.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:10.360
And I think that's happening through the application
of design thinking to new kinds of problems:

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:19.110
things like climate change, healthcare, clean
water, security, social welfare.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.149
And, as we see this reemergence of design
thinking as something that can have perhaps

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:30.629
greater impact, then we can observe some basic
ideas that design thinking kind of operates

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:34.209
through, and we can perhaps learn from it.
So, what I'd like to do is talk about a few

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:38.629
of those for the next few minutes, and talk
about some of the kinds of projects and problems

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:46.779
that they're being applied to.
So, now, design thinking starts with the idea

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:51.519
of being human-centered.
It may integrate the constraints of technology

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:58.220
and economics, but it begins with what people
need or might need: what makes life easier,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.980
more enjoyable, what makes technology useful
and usable.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.230
But this is more than simply good ergonomics,
putting the buttons in the right place, whether

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:13.240
they're software buttons or hardware buttons.
It's often about understanding culture and

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.819
context before we even know where to start
to have our ideas.

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:23.160
So, when a team was working in India on a
new vision-screening program, they wanted

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.420
to understand what motivated and excited these
kids, to understand how they might play a

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:36.459
role in screening their parents.
Conversion Sound is a small start-up -- actually

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:41.379
based here in the Bay Area -- that's developed
an ultra-low-cost, very high quality, digital

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:46.860
hearing aid for developing markets.
Now, here in the West, these hearing aids

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.430
are fitted by highly-trained technicians.
In places like India, those technicians simply

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.259
don't exist.
And so, it took a team working with community

00:09:56.259 --> 00:10:05.329
health workers and patients to understand
how a PDA application might replace technicians

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:11.060
in the diagnosis and fitting service.
But, again, the team -- instead of starting

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.430
with technology -- the team started with people
and culture.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:23.819
And this idea of closely observing people
can lead to recognizing behaviors that can

00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:28.519
ultimately lead to breakthrough innovations.
So -- when a team was interested in studying

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:33.639
families in the U.S. to see how they managed
their money, they saw two interesting behaviors.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:37.650
This is one of them.
They saw people who were rounding up their

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.420
utility bills when they paid them.
And when they asked, "Well, why did you do

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.550
that?"
The response was, "Well, I don't like to get

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.529
behind.
I don't like to feel that I owe the utility

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:50.360
company money."
And another behavior that they saw -- which

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.300
is one that I think many of us exhibit -- was
that when people went and paid for a cash

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.220
transaction, they would take the coins that
they got in exchange in change, and take them

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.360
home, stick them in a jar or somewhere, and
then every so often, take those to the bank,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.779
or give them to the kids to take to the bank
and pay into their savings accounts.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:12.439
Again, when we asked them about this, this
is this idea of saving invisibly, saving without

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:17.730
thinking about it.
So, that led to the idea of a new savings

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.519
account for Bank of America called "Keep the
Change."

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:23.930
I don't know if any of you use it.
And what happens here is that when you go

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.980
and pay for a transaction with your debit
card, the payment gets rounded up to the nearest

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.480
dollar, and the change gets put into your
savings account.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.519
So, it takes this kind of behavior of automatic
savings and staying ahead, and applies it

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:42.380
to a very simple piece of technology to create
a new kind of service.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.839
Again, it started with recognizing a behavior
and led to an innovation.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:53.819
So, if design thinking starts with the idea
of being human-centered, then it moves quickly

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:59.170
to learning by making things.
Instead of thinking of "what to build," we

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.480
"build in order to think."
Because prototypes help us learn about our

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.740
ideas, and, the faster we put our prototypes
out into the world, the faster we know about

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.319
the qualities and strengths and weaknesses
of our ideas.

00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:18.829
The faster that we can evolve them, the faster
we can improve them.

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:22.730
Now, a lot has been said about the Aravind
Eye Clinic in Madurai, India.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:28.430
I'm sure many of you have heard of it.
It manages to serve vast quantities of very

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.430
poor patients by taking the revenues from
those patients that can afford to pay, and

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:41.019
using them to cross-subsidize those who cannot.
They're an incredibly efficient organization,

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:47.019
but they're also very innovative.
And the thing that I noticed when I visited

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:51.459
was this willingness to prototype new ideas
very quickly.

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:56.499
So, this is the manufacturing facility for
one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.

00:12:56.499 --> 00:13:04.180
It's actually where they manufacture the intraocular
lenses that they use to replace damaged lenses

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.639
 -- our own lenses that are damaged by cataracts.
And by doing this, they brought the cost down

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:15.310
from $200 a pair, when they're made by western
producers, to just $4 a pair.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.709
That's a huge, huge cost savings.
And the way they did this was, I think, through

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:25.009
a prototyping approach.
Instead of building some fancy, new factory,

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:28.570
they put the facility in the basement of one
of their hospitals.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.529
Instead of using the fancy, large-scale machines
that western producers use, they use low-cost,

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:38.639
CAD/CAM technology to produce their lenses.
And they're now the biggest manufacturer of

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:44.720
these lenses in the developing world, and
actually, they just recently moved into a

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.249
custom factory.
So, if human need is the place to start and

00:13:49.249 --> 00:13:55.249
prototyping a vehicle for progress, then there
are also questions to be asked about the destination.

00:13:55.249 --> 00:14:00.699
Instead of seeing consumption as its primary
goal, design thinking is beginning to explore

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:07.470
the idea and potential of participation.
The shift from a passive relationship between

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:14.050
consumer and producer to the active engagement
of everyone in experiences that are meaningful,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:22.290
productive, and profitable.
And clearly, a lot of this capacity to explore

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.000
more participative experiences has been driven
by the web and many of the things that you

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.790
all work on.
Another Brit, my apologies.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.389
You're getting a great British history lesson
today.

00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:39.319
When Sir William Beveridge created the first
of his famous reports in 1942, he proposed

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:46.639
what became Britain's welfare state, in which
he hoped that every citizen would be an active

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:52.430
participant in their own social welfare.
By the time he wrote his third report, he

00:14:52.430 --> 00:15:02.769
confessed that he had failed, and instead
created a society of welfare consumers.

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:08.220
Hillary Cottam, Charlie Ledbetter, and Hugo
Manassei of Participle in England have taken

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.740
this idea of participation and, in their manifesto
entitled "Beveridge 4.0," they've described

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.589
a model for reinventing the welfare state.
One of their projects is this one.

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:24.660
It's called Southwark Circle, in which a small
team of designers worked with local residents

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.639
in Southern, South London to develop a new
membership organization that helps the elderly

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:36.129
with household tasks.
Ideas were developed and refined with 150

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:42.129
elderly people and their families, before
the service was launched earlier this year.

00:15:42.129 --> 00:15:47.620
And the service itself is a combination of
"Can a for-profit like activities and volunteer

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.790
activities," and it's really an idea about
taking a lot of what currently is the responsibility

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.690
of the healthcare providers and social workers
providers, and bring it back out into the

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:03.930
community where it can be done a lot less
expensively and often to a higher quality.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:10.980
And, you know, I think that this idea of designing
participatory systems where value -- over

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.449
and above cash -- is both generated and measured,
isn't only going to be a major theme for design

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:21.170
as we go forward, but perhaps a major theme
for our economy as a whole.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:27.410
And we can take this idea of participation
to its logical conclusion and say that perhaps

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:32.809
the way that design can have its greatest
impact is if we take it out of the hands of

00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:38.459
designers and put it into the hands of everyone.
So, a team of nurses and practitioners at

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:44.649
Kaiser Permanente, a local organization, tackled
the problem of improving the patient experience.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:49.779
And one thing they focused on was the exchange
of knowledge between nurses.

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:55.050
In particular, one particular project was
how they changed shift.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:17:00.290
And so, based on a process of observation,
brainstorming new ideas, and rapid prototyping,

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.999
the team developed a completely new way of
changing shift.

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:09.059
And instead of retreating to the nurse's station
to share and tell each other about the various

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:15.130
states and needs of patients, they developed
a method for changing shift on the ward in

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.799
front of patients using a simple software
tool.

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:23.699
The innovation brought the time that nurses
are away from patients down from 40 minutes

00:17:23.699 --> 00:17:28.400
on average to just 12 minutes on average,
increased patient confidence because now they

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.159
know what's going on, and increased nurse
happiness.

00:17:33.159 --> 00:17:39.860
And you multiply that savings by every nurse
on every shift on every ward in the 35 hospitals

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.240
that Kaiser has in their system and that results
in a lot more nursing time.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.220
And I think this is just one example of thousands
of opportunities there are in healthcare alone

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.029
to create innovations if we can get these
kinds of processes into the hands of the people

00:17:55.029 --> 00:18:05.270
that are actually providing the service.
But, unfortunately, good ideas don't sell

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.649
themselves.
Any fans of Madmen might recognize the image

00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:13.880
in the background.
The 20th century saw the rise of an industry

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:21.050
built to tell stories to encourage us to consume
more -- the advertising industry.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.899
And yet, when the goal is to create consumption
but not participation, stories aren't sufficient;

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:33.390
we need movements.
One example of that, I think, is this one.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.260
It's not every day that you get the prime
minister of a G-8 country to launch your campaign,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:45.600
but that's exactly what a team of Japanese
Creative Agency Hakuhodo did when they launched

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.070
this idea called Cool Biz.
Have any of you heard of Cool Biz?

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:55.090
It's a great idea.
So, this was the, then, prime minister Koizumi

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.580
of Japan.
And the idea of Cool Biz was, in order to

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.890
try to bring down the carbon footprint of
Japan, they wanted to be able to lower the

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:09.350
 -- or raise, I guess -- the temperature settings
on the air-conditioning systems in offices

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.529
during the summer.
One of the biggest things that was preventing

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:16.630
this was the formal dress that Japanese businessmen
wear.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.399
You guys wouldn't have a problem with this.
But, all Japanese businessmen would turn up

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:24.210
in a suit and tie all the way through the
summer.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:29.330
And so, the idea was that, "If we could persuade
Japanese businessmen not to wear a tie, we

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.520
could raise the temperature on the thermometers
and save gigatons of carbon, or whatever it

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.470
is."
So, how do you persuade very conservative

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.390
Japanese businessmen to stop wearing a tie?
Well, the way they did it was, they had a

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.169
bunch of Japanese fashion designers design
a whole range of new clothing, and then they

00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:52.809
had all of the CEOs and the prime minister
 -- all of the CEOs of the major corporations

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:55.580
in Japan -- do a fashion show with all of
this new clothing.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.049
So, that was one thing they did.
The second thing they did as part of this

00:19:59.049 --> 00:20:03.320
campaign, they got these cool, little badges,
and any company that signed up for the Cool

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.590
Biz Campaign, if you were wearing one of these
badges, you simply couldn't tell somebody

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.690
that they were wearing inappropriate dress
at work.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.029
So now, again, in California, we don't need
badges for that, but in Japan, they needed

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:18.679
badges for it.
But, this movement has ended up with thousands

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:26.640
of companies in Japan signing up for the Cool
Biz Campaign, and you know a lot of carbon

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.140
is being saved as a result.
They have a similar program in -- oh, one

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:38.460
of the other downsides, by the way, of having
the temperature set so low in offices was,

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:44.669
you'd see most of the Japanese women, who
were also formally dressed in skirts and jackets,

00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:48.380
in the offices with blankets over their knees,
because they were freezing cold.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.309
So, it had another kind of comfort advantage
benefit to women.

00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:56.960
And there's a similar program that goes on
in the winter called Warm Biz. Same thing.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:03.360
"Wear a woolly sweater to work, and we can
lower the setting on the thermostat."

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.289
So an example of, I think -- of going from
the idea of just telling a story to creating

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:13.880
a movement -- in a similar vein, we've been
working on a project for the International

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.620
Campaign Against Unwanted Pregnancy.
And, you know, there's some kind of interesting

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.210
statistics.
Six out of ten pregnancies to women in the

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:31.750
20 to 24 range are unplanned and unwanted.
And the goal of the project was to reduce

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.240
this unplanned pregnancy amongst unmarried
adults.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.929
Now, the core of this is a website with lots
of services on it.

00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:42.929
This is just one, helping people select various
forms of contraception.

00:21:42.929 --> 00:21:45.669
Some don't come highly recommended, like champagne
corks perhaps.

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:48.080
[laughter]
I think there's a piece of string somewhere.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.630
I'm not sure what you are supposed to use
that for.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:59.870
But, anyway, sounds very painful.
But the service is only going to work if we

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:05.640
kind of get people to engage with it.
So a couple of parts of that, there was this

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.580
whole series of posters rather insulting to
the parenting capabilities of young men.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.010
And then, this one -- which is a little hard
to tell from this image, but, it'll be a bit

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.419
more obvious for the next one when you see
the prototype.

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:24.100
This is a sticker that goes on a mirror in
the women's bathroom, women's restroom, and

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.120
that's the sticker.
That's the sticker.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.000
So when you walk into the bathroom, you can
get this rather [laughter] uncomfortable view

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.029
about what it might be like should you decide,
or not decide, to do something.

00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:47.830
So again, you know, I mean it's the idea of
using design to get people to engage with

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:53.380
things a little bit more than they might otherwise.
So, these are just some of the approaches

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.809
that design thinking takes and some of the
kinds of projects that it's being applied

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:01.409
to.
But I like to go back to Brunel here, and

00:23:01.409 --> 00:23:05.710
propose a possible connection as to why this
is happening now, why it didn't happen 20

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:10.519
years ago, and why design thinking may be
a useful tool.

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:15.549
And I think that connection is a pretty simple
one; it's to do with change.

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:22.309
In times of great change, we demand new solutions,
new alternatives, things that haven't existed

00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:23.970
before.
It's a very simple idea.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.760
You know, Brunel worked during the height
of the Industrial Revolution, when every piece

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:36.419
of our economy and society was getting reinvented.
Now, you know, many of those industrial systems

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:39.679
from Brunel's time have run their course and,
indeed, they're part of the problem today

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:43.460
in many cases.
And again, we live in the midst of massive

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:49.210
change; it's just a different kind of change,
driven by different kinds of technology.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.550
And that change is forcing us to question
many of the fundamental components of our

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.750
society, like healthcare, government, education,
and security.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.520
And, in periods of change, we need new ideas,
because our existing solutions are simply

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.090
becoming obsolete because of that change.
It's a very simple idea.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:12.539
But, why design thinking?
Because it changes the way that we tackle

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:16.779
problems.
Instead of focusing on our -- sort of, defaulting

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:24.029
to -- our normal convergent approach where
we make the best choice out of existing alternatives,

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:30.769
it encourages us to diverge, to explore new
ideas, and create new alternatives that haven't

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:35.909
existed before.
But, before we can do that, before we can

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:42.270
diverge, before we can explore new alternatives,
there's an important first step.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:46.639
And that first step is, "What's the question
we're trying to answer?"

00:24:46.639 --> 00:24:49.909
In the design industry, we might call that,
"What's the design brief?"

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:53.889
Now, Brunel may have asked this question,
"How to I take a train from London to New

00:24:53.889 --> 00:24:56.470
York?"
He'd have had a hard time building a bridge,

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.590
but he did come up with a solution.
But, what are the kinds of questions that

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.520
we might be tackling today?
And, we're very lucky we get asked -- just

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.269
as you are.
We're very lucky we get asked lots of really

00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:11.300
fascinating questions.
We get to ask lots of fascinating questions

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.870
ourselves.
These are just some of them we've been working

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.850
on recently.
I won't be very long, so don't worry.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:24.380
One of them, in particular, is a project that
we've been doing with The Acumen Fund, which

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.490
is a social innovation fund in New York.
I'm guessing some of you know who they are,

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:34.210
because I'm guessing that you have a relationship
with Acumen as well, and on a project actually

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.490
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
And this is the question, "How might we improve

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.299
access to safe, drinking water for the world's
poorest people, and at the same time stimulate

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:49.230
innovation amongst local water providers?"
So, instead of taking the obvious approach

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.820
and having a bunch of American designers in
Palo Alto come up with a bunch of new ideas

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.610
that may or may not have been appropriate,
we tried to take a more open, collaborative,

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.050
and participative approach.
So we teamed designers and investment experts

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.120
up with eleven water organizations across
India, and then through a series of workshops,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:13.220
they explored new ideas for product services
and business models.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.889
We then hosted a competition and awarded seed-funding
to five of those organizations.

00:26:19.889 --> 00:26:22.940
And then, they developed and tested and iterated
on their ideas.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:29.029
And idea-designers and Acumen folks went out
and were out in India working with these organizations

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:35.389
for several weeks, designing new social marketing
campaigns, community outreach strategies,

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:41.000
business models, new water vessels, the drinking
water, and new service delivery ideas.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.120
Now, these are just getting -- some of these
are just getting rolled out right now.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.470
It's kind of early to see too much of the
impact, although in one case, there's one

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:54.269
of the organizations there's one that does
large-scale, kind of village-scale, filtration

00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:59.960
plants for villages in India, and they run
on a subscription service.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.539
And, by redesigning the kind of community
outreach strategy they had -- essentially

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:09.500
to design an event to which they invited villagers
 -- they increased subscription by four times.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:16.440
So we're hoping to see many more kind of areas,
sort of, impact like that from these different

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.250
organizations as they roll out their ideas.
And we're just repeating this whole exercise

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:29.889
in East Africa with a group of NGOs there.
For me, this is an example of how far design

00:27:29.889 --> 00:27:35.659
thinking can go from tackling the kinds of
small problems I was working on in the beginning

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:39.570
of my career.
By focusing on the needs of people, using

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:46.889
prototypes to move ideas along quickly, getting
the process out of the hands of designers,

00:27:46.889 --> 00:27:52.789
and getting the active participation of everyone
in the community, can be applied to more important

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:58.019
perhaps, bigger questions.
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,

00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:07.279
design can have a far greater impact.
So there are always areas that I'm particularly

00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:15.269
interested in, in asking questions about,
and thinking about from the perspective of

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:17.049
a designer.
And I was just kind of going to throw out

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.880
some of them now.
And they might be a useful for the start of

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.450
any Q and A we might have.
So three that I been thinking about quite

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.750
a lot recently, and I think the world's thinking
about a lot at the moment, at least the top

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.279
two anyway.
This whole issue of reinventing health, not

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:39.059
just in America where we're hearing about
it today, but I mean, to be honest, we don't

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:42.200
really have sustainable healthcare systems
anywhere.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.919
And so, it's a pretty big problem.
Encouraging sustainable consumption I know

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:51.779
is something a lot of you guys care about
a lot, but it's something that we're making

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:56.720
pretty slow progress on.
And imagining a new role for media.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:03.090
One of the reasons I put this one up is because
your organization is one that has a huge role

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.251
to play.
You are a media organization, and I think

00:29:07.251 --> 00:29:12.049
you have a huge role to play in changing the
role of media as we go forward.

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:16.250
So, on the topic of healthcare, this is one
that I'm particularly interested in.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.789
I believe we will only get to a sustainable
healthcare system when we think of healthcare

00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:27.170
as a life skill, not as sickness to be avoided.
And a place to start, at least, is to figure

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:33.700
out, How can we start to educate kids to treat
health as a life skill?

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:40.429
To think of health as a life skill just as
we think of many other things as life skills

00:29:40.429 --> 00:29:44.529
in order to be able to kind of manage and
think about healthcare as they go through

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:47.570
their lives.
And how can technology help?

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:53.240
How can it help get kids interested in health,
and give them a means to monitor their progress?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.220
I'm going to get you upset.
I'm going to use one of your competitors.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.559
So what would a health-oriented version of
Facebook look like?

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:07.659
I'm sure there's something better than Facebook,
but you know, how might it help build communities

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:11.330
of kids, or communities of adults, to help
with their own health?

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:16.059
And how can we better illustrate the connection
between nutrition, exercise, and health?

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:24.240
There's still a lot of work to do.
On the topic of consumption -- I think this

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.639
is an interesting one and a difficult one
 -- which is, "How are we going to create

00:30:27.639 --> 00:30:34.190
closed-loop products -- products that do not
use up and waste resources at any point, from

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:41.480
manufacturing through use through disposal
 -- in terms of products and services -- such

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.240
that we can create growth for business, because
that turns out to be quite important to all

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:53.899
of us without extending the depletion of resources?"
I mean, for me, this is one of the most challenging

00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:57.780
questions that I get to ask as a designer.
I mean, as an industrial designer, one of

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:05.549
my great contributions to society is to create
hundreds of thousands of tons of landfill.

00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:08.580
And I don't always feel that proud of that.
I mean, I feel proud of the products that

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.809
I've designed.
They've been very useful to people.

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:12.780
But, in the end, that stuff has ended up in
landfills.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:19.740
And we just simply can't continue to do that.
So, I think it's an important question.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.779
And again, we're making slow progress.
We need to apply much more thought to it.

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:33.100
On the topic of media, what interests me is,
I think media has got itself into this place

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:38.740
where it considers itself really to be either
entertainment or awareness-building.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:44.690
There's definitely an educational role, and
we understand that, but can media go beyond

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:50.600
that when it comes to helping us deal with
some of these other pressing problems we have

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.049
to deal with?
So many of these issues are going to require

00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:58.299
behavior change.
They require behavior change at a mass scale.

00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:00.539
We all have to change our behaviors around
health.

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:04.980
We all have to change our behaviors around
consumption.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.730
And what's the role of media in helping us
change our behavior?

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:15.740
Can media be partners to us in helping us
change?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.519
What new media products and services might
help with that?

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:25.889
So, you know those are some of the questions
that I'm kind of interested in asking these

00:32:25.889 --> 00:32:30.429
days.
So I'd like to believe that design thinking,

00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:33.179
as one approach to innovation can actually
make a difference.

00:32:33.179 --> 00:32:38.799
It can help create new ideas, new innovations
that go beyond the latest products on the

00:32:38.799 --> 00:32:41.670
High street.
To do that, we have to go back to this idea

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:46.620
of thinking about design in a more expansive
way, more like Brunel, less like a priesthood

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.779
of professionals.
And the first step is to start asking the

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:55.600
right questions.
That's all I have to say.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.669
Thank you very much.

00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:03.179
&gt;&gt; [clapping]

00:33:03.179 --> 00:33:06.690
&gt;&gt; So, for those of you who don't have to
rush off to all the sorts of important things

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.870
you have to do, then I'd be happy to take
a few questions, if you wish.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:15.000
&gt;&gt; Thanks for coming.
I have a big question.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.919
And I think you've already hinted at the answer,
but I'm interested to know what your direct

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:23.830
answer is to the question.
And the question is, "How would you like to

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.830
save the world?"

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:32.639
&gt;&gt; I think it would be excessive, in the extreme,
to think that anyone can do that.

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:37.750
But, I'd like to work on these kinds of questions.
We're getting more of a chance to do that.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:44.259
One of the things that makes me hopeful is
that, when we first started getting interested

00:33:44.259 --> 00:33:49.690
in working on sort of what I would broadly
call "global questions" rather than simply

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:57.460
the, "How do we design the next soda bottle
that a client might come and ask for, or a

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.549
piece of tech that a client might ask for."
When we first started to do that, it was sort

00:33:59.549 --> 00:34:03.759
of the only way to do that was to do it on
the side somehow.

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:07.670
Was to do it either in our spare time or to
find somebody that had a project and we do

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.630
it on the side.
Then we found ourselves in the position of

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.720
being able to convince some, you know, well-funded
foundations, that they could start to invest

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.290
in some of that stuff, and that's been great
 -- people like Gates, Rockefeller, and others.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:25.030
What's beginning to happen now is that we're
finding some of our large, corporate clients

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.900
beginning to come, and we're able to ask them
some of these questions.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.690
And they're beginning to engage in them.
And I know there are some leading organizations

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.470
of the world -- of which this is one – that
have been doing that for awhile, but, there

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:39.970
aren't many.
And we're just beginning to see more, and

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:45.240
that gives me some hope.
Because here's the problem I see which is,

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:51.110
If we add up all of the innovation capacity
of the world's NGOs and foundations and people

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:56.090
who are excited about solving those problems,
and compare it to all the world's capacity

00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:02.100
for doing R and D and innovation in corporations,
we'd be comparing this to this.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.400
I mean, there are trillions of dollars spent
around the world on R and D inside corporations

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.760
today.
If we can apply some of that to some of these

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.530
problems, I think we'd make a lot more progress.
So the only way we're going to do that is

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.480
if we get these kinds of companies to engage.
So that's something I'm pretty excited about.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.310
So maybe that's a way that we can make a difference.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:31.780
&gt;&gt; Your remark about media and power to people
to change behavior.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:43.570
And it seems like media's being used to reinforce
behavior or make people behave in ways that

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:48.307
are against their own self-interest.
And I'm not -- politically it's a long story

00:35:48.307 --> 00:35:49.307
 -- but, for example, like sugary soft drinks.
People are bombarded with advertisements.

00:35:49.307 --> 00:35:52.210
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's philosophically and
politically a really challenging problem,

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.570
right?
Because you can go from encouraging behavior

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:58.560
change to propaganda very, very quickly.
There have been some, actually, really-effective

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.210
uses of media to create social change, that
happened in the mid-20th century in countries

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:08.780
like Germany, and the results weren't that
great.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:14.450
And so, there is this -- we're in this sort
of very interesting spectrum between, yes,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:20.900
advertising and other forms of media that
reinforce "un-useful behaviors", shall we

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.980
say, and then propaganda at the other extreme.
And we somehow got to find something else.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.140
And I think that "something else" is actually
not about dictating to people what to do.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.920
It's about making choices and making the world
transparent.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.850
And I think that's why this organization plays
such an important role is that, the more we

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:41.620
can make information transparent and the more
we can help people interpret that information

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:48.200
such that they can make good choices, the
more likely they are to make those good choices,

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.100
I think.
But, I mean, it's a really tricky, difficult

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.280
problem.
I don't know.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.870
Do we want to legislate away from advertising?
There's actually an interesting piece on NPR

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:57.870
this morning that's about just that.
It's a tricky one.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.510
&gt;&gt; We have people who spend their lives watching
advertising in Fox News, and they believe

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:07.030
everything they see.
How do you put some other message in there?

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:18.380
&gt;&gt; My own solution has been not to have a
TV in my house, if that helps.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.380
[laughter]

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:28.880
&gt;&gt; 
You mentioned a minute ago that it seemed

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.080
very promising to get these corporations engaged,
and what I'm wondering about is, it sounds

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.720
like you're on the cusp of, from when they
weren't very engaged to becoming more engaged.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.900
What have you found got them engaged?
Does it always include some way to profit

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.840
from it?
And I'd be interested to hear about that.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.840
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think that's the shift that's
happening is that, you know, I first started

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.750
to see it.
I get the chance to go to Davos every year,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:02.110
and I first started to see it there a few
years ago, where more and more CEOs were starting

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.720
to stand up and talk about this -- talk about
how they saw that things like their permission

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.530
to do business in markets was going to be
affected by solving some of these problems.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.320
So that was the first sign.
And of course, it's one thing for CEOs to

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.320
stand up and talk about it; it's another thing
for corporations to do something about it.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.960
And now, what I'm beginning to see is, more
and more companies like UniLever, like Nike,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:30.530
like Nokia, is another example of companies
that are beginning to see how their businesses

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:34.710
are fundamentally going to get impacted by
either not solving these problems or solving

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.330
them.
And, you know, I mean, corporations are self-interested

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.319
organisms, right?
So when they start to make that connection

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:44.920
 -- even when there's no short-term profit
 -- and it's going to be tough.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.430
And, you know, Wall Street makes it tougher,
because there's sort of a short-term fixation

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.640
on profit -- makes it far harder to look out
into the distance and see the time when those

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.510
profits aren't going to be available.
But, I'm seeing more companies that have got

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:03.810
the strength of purpose and vision to see
that they need to work on these problems somehow.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:08.950
Now, I think one of the problems that might
occur quite quickly is this sort of chaotic

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.800
scrum of these organizations trying to get
involved with different NGOs, and the whole

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:18.490
thing could get to be a bit of a mess.
And I think it's going to take some way of

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.970
organizing that.
And one of the ways that I think we can start

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.940
to organize that is, begin to agree on some
of the questions we're actually trying to

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.220
answer.
So that, instead of everybody that wants to

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.050
tackle a problem goes to ask a different question,
we can actually start to apply some energy

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.530
around some sort of questions that we might
actually agree on.

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:41.690
Again, it's a scale issue for me.
It doesn't matter how many of us are interested

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.440
in tackling these problems.
If we're all asking different questions in

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.370
a very narrow way, it's very hard to tackle
these big, systemic problems.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:51.200
But, if we can start to agree on what some
of these questions might be, then we might

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.990
be able to apply a lot more capacity to solving
it.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:58.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I think a couple of things that come to mind

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:03.450
for me are the importance of the forums in
which people will share.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:08.960
Like, you mentioned Davos, and probably certain
influential publications and all this and

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.360
media.
And then the other is, I wonder tools to help

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.770
them recognize it sooner within for the self-interested
reasons potentially.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:18.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Good point.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:24.920
&gt;&gt; So, I'm curious: In your experience, what
kinds of behaviors and practices you've observed

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:31.391
that get in the way of this kind of approach
to problem identification and solving?

00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:38.121
Any things that you've discovered help break
down those kinds of blocks and help people

00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:39.600
engage in this kind of work?

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.370
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, it's very easy to get into
the routine of just waiting for somebody to

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.030
come and ask you a question.
And, you know, that was the kind of mindset

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:51.020
I was in for much of my career.
It was like, "Okay. What's the next cool client

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.990
going to walk through the door?
And they're going to ask a question.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:59.930
And I'm going to solve that question for them."
And it was only as I, kind of -- not just

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:04.560
me, but many of my colleagues too -- started
to wonder, "Well, you know, this isn't that

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.740
interesting."
Either we're getting the same questions over

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.491
and over again -- and we've always had this
problem with IDEO, and just I suspect you

00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:15.130
do too -- but, you know, we've got Severe
Attention Deficit Disorder.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.420
[laughter]

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:22.100
And so we were so excited to do the first
ever laptop, and we were so excited to do

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.620
the original mouse for the Lisa computer and
then the Macintosh, but by the time somebody

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.560
came and asked to do the third or fourth one,
we just didn't want to do it.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.850
And we, you know -- so that's part of what
sort of encouraged us to start asking new

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:43.460
kinds of questions.
So, it's somehow moving from that reactive

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.040
 -- just waiting for those questions to emerge
 -- to start to ask them for yourself.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:55.240
For me, the best way to do that is to be as
observant as I can, to watch the world, and

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.210
look at the world and try and, often through
personal experiences.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:03.990
So I mean, for me, it was going to India,
and spending time in some of these hospitals

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:08.340
and villages, and actually seeing some of
these problems firsthand, or spending time

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.131
in, you know, schools, or wherever it might
be.

00:42:11.131 --> 00:42:17.451
I mean, that firsthand experience has actually
been an important thing for me, because, One,

00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:21.600
it allows me to observe behaviors that kind
of spark ideas off of my own head.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:27.940
But, it just makes the importance of those
questions somehow just more visceral.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.310
So, thank you.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.450
&gt;&gt; Hi. [laugh]
You talked about taking some of this role

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:41.760
out of the hands of designers and bringing
people in to engage in these sorts of activities.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:48.380
And also, you talked about children and their,
kind of, what they might be exposed to through

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:54.260
Facebook with more health, kind of.
I was wondering if you had thoughts on education

00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.120
and roles that companies like yours and ours
and the role of teaching of divergent thinking

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:06.231
and convergent thinking and that kind of thing,
both from your position in the industry and

00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:10.470
having been a dad.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Well, I'm pretty convinced that all kindergarteners

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:19.060
know how to do design thinking intuitively,
and we beat it out of them, as they go through

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.340
school.
Not intentionally, but because schooling focuses

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.850
so much on analytical thinking -- which is
valuable.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:32.790
I wouldn't claim that they're not valuable
 -- but we've forgotten other forms of thinking.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:38.221
So, you know, we have had the opportunity
to do some work in early years education and

00:43:38.221 --> 00:43:42.980
primary education.
I would love, obviously love, to see some

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:49.750
of these very simple ideas getting, you know,
kind of integrated into education, because

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:55.030
I think kids would pick them up very easily.
They're not difficult concepts.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:59.390
I mean, the skills that one needs to acquire
in order to be a great designer in terms of

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.510
visualization skills, prototyping skills.
Yes, they may take some while to accumulate,

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:09.560
just like the skills in any field do, but
the basic principles are really very simple.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.330
And I think, it's possible for all of us to
use them in simple ways in our own lives.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:22.950
So, I'd love to see more of them having more
support within conventional, primary education.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:29.290
And there are some places where that's happening.
There are design-focused, charter high schools

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:33.070
and things that are in the United States that
have been quite successful.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.580
I'm a little -- the only thing that worries
me about that is this idea you pick people

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.660
up and say, "Okay. You're going to go into
a design school."

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.630
That's what I did right?
I mean, I went to art school.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.750
I spent seven years in art school.
I made that decision but, through luck, not

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.960
because I knew that was the right thing for
me.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.480
And a lot of people don't get to make that
choice at the right moment or make the wrong

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.060
choice.
So I'd rather see it being integrated into

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.860
 -- more broadly into general education.
I think the UK is a place that's tried to

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.850
do that, with some success -- not as much
as it might be.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:09.140
Partly, again, because -- one of the reasons
why I'm interested in talking about this as

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:15.450
a "thought process" rather than as a "skills-based
idea," although skills are important in design,

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.870
is because I think that gives it some level
of legitimacy when you compare it to other

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.190
thought processes.
And you can say, "Well, how does that compare

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.680
to narrative approach to thinking?
How does that compare to an analytical approach

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.810
to thinking?"
And you can start to understand the strengths

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.900
and weaknesses of each.
And, in fact, we may all be better off if

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.810
we've got access to all of them.
Thanks.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:40.560
&gt;&gt; Hi.
I'm really curious to hear about your creative-thinking

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:46.840
process at IDEO.
I'm really -- when you have -- when you come

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:54.960
to -- you have your question -- you come,
you kind of deduce it down into a pretty simple

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960
specific question.
What do you guys actually do in the creative-thinking

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.020
process?
And I'm particularly curious how the balance

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.570
between people who are process experts in
creativity and then domain experts, the people

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.070
who actually know how the water system works
in India.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:06.920
&gt;&gt; I mean, we're pretty much a community of
generalists.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.210
So, although people do build domain expertise
over their careers, most of them don't start

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.940
off that way.
And we don't hire domain experts.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:21.140
The way we hire, we use this idea, which I
originally stole from McKinsey, although I

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:26.370
think about it differently, which is this
notion of hiring T-shaped people.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:30.160
And you've probably heard of it.
The idea of a T-shaped person is somebody

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.960
who's got some skill in something, and, in
our case, some skill in something that allows

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.990
them to do something from a design perspective.
So, that could be as a writer, a filmmaker,

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:45.430
an architect, or industrial designer, a business
person, whatever that is, as long as it contributes

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.610
to what we do, then that's fine.
But we're not interested in just having specialists.

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:55.070
What we need are people who've also got this
horizontal stroke of a T, which is this -- kind

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:01.790
of, almost sort of -- need to involve themselves
in other parts of the process, in other aspects

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:06.000
of the process, in other things.
And then, more and more, we've got more people

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.220
who've got multiple vertical strokes to their
makeup too.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:17.410
And the reason for that is that, it used to
be that design was a relatively simple idea.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:23.130
If I was, as an industrial designer, designing
this, I can do that on my own, pretty much.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.180
I mean, there's lots of people involved downstream,
you know, perhaps engineering, perhaps manufacturing,

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.620
certainly distributing it.
But, when it comes to kind of figuring out

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.050
what a water cup might be like, or a chair
 -- you know, the sort of traditional objects

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.300
of design -- individual designers can do that
relatively well.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:42.640
But, when we're talking about redesigning
clean-water systems or energy conservation

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.140
 -- whatever else we might be working on -- it's
way too complex for individuals to tackle.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.810
So we need to work in teams and, at least
for us, we want to work in teams which are

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.620
extremely interdisciplinary and able to work
very collaboratively together.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:00.050
In other words, I may be a designer, but I
could lead the research team on a project.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:05.260
Or maybe I'm coming up with new business models.
We want people with that degree of flexibility

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:11.030
and agility.
So that's why we have generalists.

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:15.780
It's not a simple, linear process, of course.
It's messy; it's iterative.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.600
We ask the question.
We usually re-ask it many times during the

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.700
 -- I mean, whatever we start with -- the
original brief -- will have been re-asked,

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.400
redefined, and sometimes blown-up and started
all over again several times before we get

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.970
to the end.
You know, we do rely a lot on going out into

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.990
the world and trying to look at how people
really behave as a source of our ideas.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.340
We do a lot of the obvious things around,
kind of, brainstorming other ways of coming

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:44.620
up with ideas.
Prototyping is a huge core of our culture,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:51.010
so people are building things all the time,
and finding new ways to build things in order

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.510
to try them out.
So it's hard to describe it as a step-by-step

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.680
process.
It's a lot messier.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.750
We can try and describe it, it always turns
out to be a lot messier.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:06.260
And for me, if there's one deep skill that
people who practice design a lot get, it's

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.010
knowing how to use the tools of the process
in messy and interesting ways.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.690
I often compare it to being a cabinetmaker,
you know.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:18.240
A cabinetmaker will know when to use a plane,
when to use a chisel, when to use a piece

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.140
of sandpaper.
They won't necessarily use them in the same

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.050
order all the time, but they know exactly
the right moment.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.530
And I think that's the kind of process that
designers --

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.290
It's one where there's all these tools you
can use, and you've just got to pick the right

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:33.830
moment to use them, and that's where experience
kind of really helps.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:39.950
&gt;&gt; Just a quick follow-up question.
When you're selecting people to join IDEO,

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:46.030
is there something that you've seen over and
over again and you're like, "Yes, this is

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.210
the kind of person," something that indicates
they're the kind of person who will succeed

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.210
there?

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:52.430
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean that whole T-shaped thing
is a pretty important filter.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.010
They're generally good storytellers, kind
of passionate about what they do.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:59.160
But one of the things we found is that, it's
very hard to tell from a resume who's going

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:05.870
to make a good person at IDEO.
And so, you know, we rely a lot on internships

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:11.730
for bringing young folks into IDEO, and have
historically done that, which is why we teach

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.710
a lot -- Stanford and other schools around
the world -- is because that's the way we

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:22.660
get to have two-year-long internships with
people, and find great people.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.640
It's a cultural -- most of our hiring process
is about cultural match as much as it is about

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.750
skill.
It's easy enough to tell when somebody has

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.370
got the skills.
It's a lot harder to tell when somebody has

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.810
got the cultural fit.
So, we spend a lot more of our energy on trying

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:41.569
to find out if somebody's got the cultural
fit than skills fit.

00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:42.569
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:43.569
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:50:43.569 --> 00:50:46.590
&gt;&gt; Thanks again for the inspirational talk.
I would like to go back to the three questions

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:52.170
that you raised, especially the second one,
which is, we should be designing closed-loop

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:53.670
systems.
I was just curious.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:58.170
What are the dimensions that you are thinking
about when you talk about the "closed loop"?

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:03.220
And just to give a very simple example.
If you manufacture a bike, which is made out

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:08.730
of iron and other different parts, it consumes
a lot of material and energy.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:12.590
But the person who's riding it saves energy
by not using fuel.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:18.780
However, the person loses productivity, because
it takes longer, but the person is actually

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.280
using that time to exercise.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.540
&gt;&gt; They're damnably complex.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:24.080
[laughter]

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.080
&gt;&gt; So.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.210
&gt;&gt; I mean, you know, it's going to take you
guys to figure out how to even visualize these

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:31.550
systems.
And actually I think that's one of the problems.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:36.680
It will be a fun thing to work on together.
How do we even start to visualize these closed-loop

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.860
systems?
I find, as a designer, I can start to tinker

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:46.750
around with things when I can visualize them.
And yet, most of what we have today, in terms

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:51.700
of tools to help visualize these kinds of
systems, are based on life-cycle analysis,

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.500
which are just -- they're engineering flowcharts,
basically.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.470
They don't do anything for me as a designer.
And, you know, I compare that to kind of Hans

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:04.130
Rosling stuff that you got down in the lobby
down there, which is a great way of visualizing.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:08.700
It's a change of state over time.
I think we need similar kinds of clever ways

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.980
of visualizing these systems.
The reality is you've got to look at energy

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.380
and materiality and I mean there are social
pieces to it too.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:25.340
And it's extremely, extremely complicated.
And I suspect that we will not go from where

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.270
we are to designing perfect, closed-loop systems
in one leap or ten leaps.

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:35.070
It's going to have to kind of be an evolutionary
process that's goes on for quite sometime.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:40.300
I think it'll start, right?
And it seems to me, we haven't done such a

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.300
good job of starting it.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:48.490
&gt;&gt; 
You mentioned the difference between telling

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:54.160
stories and building movements, and I was
curious to hear a little bit more about that

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.430
and maybe some of the fundamental differences
between approaching telling a story and approaching

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:58.430
successfully building a movement.

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:00.840
&gt;&gt; The simplest piece of it is a movement
that requires participation, right?

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.890
I mean, stories, you know, traditional advertising
can be consumed.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:11.740
You can sit in front of a TV or a computer
and consume advertising; it can affect your

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.800
decision.
But the participation at best is when you

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.320
go and buy something later.
I think, for movements, absolutely require

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:24.420
people to participate.
And I think, clearly, that's what Obama did

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:30.070
so successfully with the last election.
He got people to go from consuming information

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:34.650
about an election to actually participating
in it, you know, in really interesting ways.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:40.100
And so, that, for me, is the big step -- the
big difference between a movement and a story.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:44.880
&gt;&gt; So, more specifically, what characterizes
in your mind a successful story vs.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.650
a successful movement?
Are there different fundamental?

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.970
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, stories are controlled, you
know.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.540
I mean, one of the big challenges I think,
for corporate America today or corporations

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.450
all over the world is this idea that they've
spent the last 50 years controlling their

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:06.460
brands and controlling the stories that get
told about their brands and producing them

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.280
in such a way that other people consume them
but they can't change them.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.750
In a world of movements, that can't happen,
right?

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:19.420
You have to let go of your idea and let other
people participate in it and change it and

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.730
control it.
We see lots of examples of that happening,

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:26.030
and we see lots of examples of companies trying
to prevent that happening.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:31.840
And they will eventually all lose.
Eventually all of them will lose that battle,

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.790
and it's going to require a fundamentally
different way of thinking about brands and

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:44.800
a fundamentally different way of thinking
about how we look after or steward those.

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.850
The simplest vision for me was, I was always
used to thinking of companies as being entities

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:53.770
with 20-foot-high billboards all the way around
them facing out, you know.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:57.520
And I think that's the way we thought about
companies for a long time.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:02.830
They projected an image out into the world,
and were often very different from the inside.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:07.750
And companies like yours have kind of completely
reinvented that idea.

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:13.320
You're a company where its internal behavior
is its brand.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.380
And a lot of the enthusiasm that people have
for Google is the fact that people can look

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:22.640
inside it -- to some degree, anyway.
And I think that's going to be the case for

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:28.030
all successful brands, whether they're companies
or whether they're social movements, like

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:33.250
climate change.
I hope that's somewhat helpful.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:37.130
&gt;&gt; So what do you have to say about the American
auto industry, and are they going to start

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:38.580
to let people participate inside?

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:45.600
&gt;&gt; It's a sad, sad case.[laughter]
And I'm a bit of a car geek myself.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.561
And, you know, fortunately, I got lots of
other great car companies around the world

00:55:50.561 --> 00:56:00.790
to get passionate about.
It was unbelievable, kind of, inability to

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.540
see the future coming.
Well, actually, that's not fair.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:09.050
I think they probably saw the future coming.
They couldn't figure out what to do about

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.620
it.
I'm sure it will go down as the, kind of,

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:19.420
fundamental lesson in how large industries
can just take themselves off the rails.

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:23.280
I'm sure good things will come bubble up out
of what's left of the U.S. car industry.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:30.470
There will be good brands and good cars and
good things that happen.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.750
But, you know, again as a Brit, I've been
through the decimation of the national car

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:39.200
industry once already.
It happened when I was a kid.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:45.300
I grew up in Oxford, which was one of the
centers of car manufacturing in the UK.

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.430
It now makes the Mini, which is very good,
but it's owned by BMW.

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:51.310
It's not a British car.
There are no British car companies left.

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.970
There are none.
At least, nothing that doesn't hand-build

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:57.790
a few hundred cars a year.
Everything else is gone -- owned by somebody

00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.890
else.
And, you know, I suspect that we're going

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:06.220
to see a lot of that same thing happening
with the American car industry.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:12.160
It'll look very small.
It'll look very different in ten years time.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:16.370
It's kind of a sad thing, but in some way
that inevitability was probably set decades

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:17.690
ago.
We done?

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.690
All right.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:23.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for coming, and a special
thank you to Tim.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.270
&gt;&gt; [applause]
