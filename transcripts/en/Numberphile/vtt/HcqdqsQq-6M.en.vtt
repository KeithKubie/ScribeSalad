00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
- It used to be that clocks had faces on them. They're analog clocks. They're unknown today,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
but, you know, occasionally you find one.
And you look at it,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
and you have-- at least I have an immediate question of, hey, if it's noon,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.109
how long will it be-- you know, these are lined up--
how long will it be until

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.020
they're lined up again?

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.359
Well, not... it's more than an hour,
but  how long until-- just at exactly what time

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.849
will the clock hands line up? Well, okay, a little bit after one

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.510
it'll line up. And it'll line up again a little bit after two.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
So, what's the time difference between there? You know, you say, well, It's more than an hour,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.349
how can I figure that one out? I'm sitting there, saying yeah, you know, I remember sitting in a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.780
fifth grade classroom trying to figure it out, drawing diagrams and thinking, boy,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.090
I need to add a little bit more, a little bit more,

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.959
just, it's gonna be a little bit more than that. It's gonna be...

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.950
And then,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.170
you know, it's going to be more than that, more than that. How much time until...?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.500
And then, (chuckles)

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.540
like you, I realized,
oh, there's a simple way to solve it.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.850
Let's go back to noon.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.809
How many times do these hands cross in 12 hours? Well, there's once,

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.009
twice,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.270
three times, and so on.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.770
In fact, think about it, and you'll realize
the hands cross each other 11 times

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.710
every 12 hours.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.960
Ah! If there's 11 hand crossings,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.640
every 12 hours, that means that they will cross each other. So that means...

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.420
How long will it take between here to here?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.700
That must be 12 divided by 11 hours,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.640
which happens to be 1 hour, 
5 minutes and 27-something seconds.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.360
My clock is almost out of potential energy, so I might as well wind it up.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.519
Recharge my old Seth Thomas for a week.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.680
- Thanks for watching this numberphile video.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.420
You may not know I actually run another channel called Objectivity,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.560
and in each episode, we look at a different science treasure.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.740
It could be things like Isaac Newton's death mask,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.380
these treasure trunks with secret hidden locks,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.300
or things like this, or this.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.140
or these. You never know what you're gonna get. In fact, this week, the video was about clocks.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.740
[clocks chiming and ringing]

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.700
And there's a few more clock videos coming soon, as well. We've done over a hundred videos,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.080
there's new ones every week. If you'd like to check it out, there are links on the screen and in the video description.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.789
I'd love it if you subscribed. Thanks for watching.
