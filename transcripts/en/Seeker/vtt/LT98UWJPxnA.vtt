00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.360
Have you ever noticed how mothers just seem
to “know” what their babies need from

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.690
single cry?

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.270
…. Or do they?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.270
...

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.270
HI guys, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.710
I dont know about you, but I am terrified
of babies.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.310
They scream, they cry, they don’t use their
words and I want to help, but I can never

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.779
quite seem to figure out what they want.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.220
But, mothers, mothers just seem to “know”.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.179
Even if it’s not their kid that’s doing
the crying.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.699
Whats up with that?

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.480
Its almost as if mothers have a clairvoyant
ability to perceive subtleties in the vocalizations

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.610
of their offspring and pick up some imperceptible
communication about whether a child is hungry,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.720
lonely, or in pain when all of us non-parents
just hear screaming.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.690
Dont believe me? just ask one, they’ll tell
you.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.620
But is this really true?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.670
Well, yes and no.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
Science has shown that the “primal pull”
of a baby in distress is enough to reach across

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
species.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.030
Mule deer mothers (yes, deer.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.820
We’re talking bambi) deer mothers that live
in the wilds of the Canadian prairie quickly

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.100
move toward recordings of infant deer distress
sounds, but they also respond to the distress

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.319
calls of animals they’ve never encountered
before like infant fur seals, dogs, cats and

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.430
even humans!

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.100
Now all these species have distress calls
at roughly the same pitch, so scientists concluded

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.009
that there must be some evolutionary significance
to the similarity of infant distress calls

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.869
and to the maternal response to them.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.859
By the way, my favorite part of that experiment
was they showed that even the ultrasonic calls

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.350
of infant bats attracted the deer mothers
if scientists used software to lower their

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.579
pitch to match deer calls.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.799
So there is definitely evidence to support
the maternal instinct to relieve a baby in

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.799
distress.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.260
But c’mon, do you really know that that
is your baby’s “hungry cry”? or are

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.759
you inferring that from time of day and the
fact you’ve tried everything else?

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.229
Well, while I’ve had many a parent assure
me that there is in fact some deep ability

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.229
to non-verbally communicate with their infant
child, science says …. eh, not really.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.840
A recent paper out of the Czech Republic tested
this assertion by playing recordings of various

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.039
human infant cries recorded from babies between
5 and 10 months of age.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.190
The researchers used both distress cries like
those associated with hunger, pain, and isolation,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.390
and non-distressed vocalizations from infants
that had just been reunited with a parent,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.920
just been fed, or were engaged in play.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.300
These sounds were played back for a sample
of 333 subjects composed of female and male

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.170
adult humans, some but not all of whom were
parents themselves and the subjects were asked

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.320
to classify the communications.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.250
Unsurprisingly, the data show that adult humans
are universally able to differentiate a child’s

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.430
distress cry from any other vocalization,
and are also really accurate at identifying

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.510
the sounds of play, but that’s where our
abilities start to diverge.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.990
Being a parent slightly improved a subject’s
ability to differentiate the play situation

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.630
and the hunger situation from any other, and
younger subjects were simply better at classifying

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.960
the sounds in general.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.620
But my favorite statement from the discussion
section of this paper was “Our results thus

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.820
support the hypothesis that men and women
are equally well predisposed to perceive and

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.840
decode information from baby vocalisations”

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.050
Surprising?

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.080
Sorry guys you’re not off the hook!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.420
Men are just as capable of anticipating the
source of an infant’s cry as woman (and

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.620
don’t let your spouse tell you any differently,
because Science!)

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.050
So, once again science swoops in and casts
doubt on socially held beliefs about human

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.050
nature.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.620
No, we can’t tell what our babies want just
by hearing them cry, and women don’t “just

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.830
know these things”.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.400
So parents, go out there and do your best!

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.101
Its no better or worse than anyone else could
do.

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:33.101
What do you think?

Also, I know some of you are thinking: I have
the same reaction to vocalizations from my

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.640
pet, do I love my dog as much as my baby?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.010
Well good news!

00:03:42.010 --> 00:04:01.790
Science has an answer!
