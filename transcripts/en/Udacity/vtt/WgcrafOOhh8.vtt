00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.630
I'm really proud of us for figuring out a way to make the prisoner's

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.990
dilemma a little more friendly. It turns out, though, that this, this idea, this

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.530
sort of core idea, is very general and kind of cool. So, it leads

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.945
us to a topic that we could call, repeated games, and the folk theorem.

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:15.593
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; So the general idea here is that when you're in the repeated game setting,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.900
this possibility of retaliation, the possible of, you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.710
know, not being cooperative actually opens the door

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.710
for cooperation. Because now it becomes, it can become better

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.500
to just get along and cooperate than to get retaliated against.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.050
&gt;&gt; Right. And that makes sense as long as the retaliation is plausible.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.860
&gt;&gt; Well, we're not talking about

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.790
plausibility of the retaliation. We're just talking

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.510
about, right, because the tit for tat, it's, it's not analyzed in that way.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.172
It, it doesn't say whether or not it's actually plausible. It just says, well,

00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:49.225
if you have this strategy and you

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:50.941
play against this strategy, there's no incentive

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:51.350
to switch.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.920
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.420
&gt;&gt; But we'll, yeah, we'll get into this plausibility thing in a little bit.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.965
&gt;&gt; Oh, I, I stumbled across a word. Okay, go.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:00.870
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I want to point out one thing first, which

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.590
actually kind of irritates me. Kind of along the same lines as

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.720
like, regression is the wrong word and reinforcement is the wrong word.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.570
Folk theorem is the wrong word. So, what is a folk theorem.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.530
&gt;&gt; It's two words.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.170
&gt;&gt; In general mathematics, sorry say again?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.720
&gt;&gt; A folk theorem is two words.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080
&gt;&gt; That's fair, yes. So, I think it's actually

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.590
two different terms of art. So in mathematics folk theorems

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.630
are results that are known, at least to experts in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.370
the field, and they're considered to have established status but

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.570
they're not really published in their complete form. There

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.700
isn't some kind of original publication saying, oh look, I,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.920
I found this thing. It's more, something that like, kind

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.410
of everybody knows, and so you don't really give anybody

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.760
credit for it. So it's like a theorem that is in the general

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.220
mm, cloud of understanding. It's sort of among the population, among the group.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.610
&gt;&gt; Wait! Does, does anybody every prove these folk theorems?

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.120
&gt;&gt; You can, yeah! All folk theorems are provable. But it's

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.180
not like you say you know this is Charles Isabel's theorem.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.600
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.190
&gt;&gt; It's like. No, it's just a folk theorem. It's

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.022
like. Charles, Charles can prove it. We can all prove it.

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:08.800
But we, we're not really sure whoever proved it first.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.430
It was just one of those things that everybody knows.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, so it's like an oral tradition.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. I think that's a good way to think about it.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.860
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm just imagining mathematicians sitting around

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.440
a fire in the winter, cuddled up against

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.200
one another sharing theorems that have been proved

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.340
since the beginning of time to one another.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.350
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Right that's the image that I have as well. This, just it's

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.490
folk theorems. It's this sort of, you know, I learned it from my grandmother and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.350
now I'm telling you.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.337
&gt;&gt; Hm. I like that. I like to think of mathematicians that way.

00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:36.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] As grandmothers.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.640
&gt;&gt; So so that's what a folk theorem is in mathematics. However, in game

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.060
theory it means something different. It is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.080
referring to a folk theorem, but it's also

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.520
referring to a particular folk theorem. So

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.360
the folk theorem in game theory refers

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.590
to a particular result that describes the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.960
set of payoffs that can result from Nash

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.550
strategies in repeated games. So it's a funny thing, it's a funny way that they

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.030
use the word. It's, it's a, it's a folk theorem but it's also the folk theorem.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.070
&gt;&gt; Hm, well, well, maybe it was actually,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.948
proven the first time by some guy named Folk.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:12.016
&gt;&gt; That's a good idea, we should probably, we should push

00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:15.640
that forward like call him Folke or something like that. Folke's theorem

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.154
&gt;&gt; But but no. [LAUGH]

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.510
&gt;&gt; Oh well, I tried.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.286
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's that's really great idea

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.780
that we're going to just move on from.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.200
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.490
&gt;&gt; But what I, what I'd like to do next is kind of build up to this

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.280
notion of the Folk Theorem and it's going to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.260
require a couple basic concepts that are not too

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.370
different from stuff we've already talked about, but

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.230
we're going to kind of make them concrete and then we're

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.140
going to show how they all come together to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.820
provide us with this idea of a Folk Theorem.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.
