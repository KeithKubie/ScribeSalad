00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.200
Hey, can you turn it up?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.900
I feel like Neo.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.680
Why, because you're the chosen one?

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.810
I could be the chosen one.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.849
You don't know.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.060
But no, that's not what I meant.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.900
What did you mean?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.769
Just that the world feels off to me.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.400
Like how?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.880
It's kinda hard to explain.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.579
Like it's artificial somehow.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.140
Like we're dreaming all this through a computer
system and our physical bodies are just being

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.309
used as batteries.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.710
Well, I don't know.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.140
I don't know, that's the point.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.640
I just know that something's wrong... something
not right with the world.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.079
Yeah, it's called humanity.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.210
It's like we're living in an artificial world,
oblivious to the real world going on around

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.210
us.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.790
I think you just watch too many sci-fi movies.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.790
Didn't you do a marathon last weekend of sci-fi
films?

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.140
Yeah, I did The Matrix, Dark City, The 13th
Floor, Inception, and Men in Black.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.620
Yeah, all movies that deal with alternate
realities.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.770
I don't think I get your point.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.510
It's like whenever you watch a bunch of scary
movies and then you want to climb into my

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.260
bed and sleep 'cause you're scared?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.040
You watched all these movies that have a fake
reality, and now you're convinced your reality

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040
is fake.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520
You're talking yourself into this, can't you
see that?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.550
I guess that's possible.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.080
Who, deja vu.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080
What?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080
Where?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080
What happened?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.870
There was an orange cat, and then another
one just like it.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.300
How much like it?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.300
Was it the same cat?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.680
A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix!

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Holy sh*t!

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.980
Calm down, calm down.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.800
We have two orange cats.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.580
They're twins.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.580
Remember?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.250
Oh, yeah.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.920
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.120
For a second there my world almost came crashing
down around me.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.060
What does it matter if it's all fake?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.610
So you're admitting that it's all fake?

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.610
No.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.610
I was being sarcastic.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.010
You need to learn not to take me so seriously.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.769
You know, sarcasm is also usually a glitch
in the Matrix.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.409
I'm with the guy in the hat.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.439
They're both wearing hats.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.659
The guy on the right, the guy in the beanie.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:39.260
That figures, he's even stupider than you
are.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.750
Thanks!
