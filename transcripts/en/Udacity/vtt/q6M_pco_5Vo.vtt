00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to begin this unit with an old problem known as the "water-pouring problem."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here's what we're given: two glasses of water and we have a faucet in a sink,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which can be the source of as much water as we want.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, these glass are of different sizes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I haven't drawn them that much different, but this one is 4 oz, and this one is 9 oz.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For those of you in the rest of the world besides the U.S., an ounce is about 30 mL.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Our goal is to measure out a specific amount of water.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What we want to have is 6 oz of water measured out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Six ounces won't fit in this glass.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The idea is at the end want to have this glass filled with exactly 6 oz of water.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There's no gradated markers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's not like a function.graduated cylinder or measuring cup

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
where we have the measurements on the glass.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It wouldnâ€™t be accurate enough to just eyeball it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What we've got to do is we've got to figure out how to do that by

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
measuring out a precise amounts into the cups and pouring them off.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
For example, if the goal had been 5 oz, then that would have been easy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We'd just fill the 9 oz all the way up to the top,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then pour the 9 oz into the 4 oz until the 4 oz is all the way full,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and then what would be remaining here because there's 9 altogether would be 5 in this glass.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Five ounces is easy. Six ounces is not as obvious how to get there.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The puzzle is to find a sequence of pouring actions, and the pouring can be

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
from one glass to another. It can go in the other direction.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It can go from the faucet into each of the glasses.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And it can go from the glasses down the drain.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Six different actions we can take, and we want to find a sequence of actions

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that arrives at this goal of 6 oz.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Of course, we can generalize the problem and put any number rather than 9 and 4 and 6.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
As usual, let's make our inventory of concepts that we're going to be dealing with.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We have the glass, and the glass has a capacity and a current level.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This glass would have capacity 9, current level 5.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We're also going to need collection of glasses probably--a pair of glasses.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I guess we can say that the pair of glasses and they're current levels

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
represents a complete state of the world.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We'll think of that as a state of the world.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Everything we need to know about where we are in the problem.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Then we have a goal that we're trying to reach.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We have the pouring actions--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That breaks down into emptying, filling, and transferring.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The transferring, I think, is a little bit tricky, because there are two ways to do it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When we were transferring from the 9 oz into the 4 oz--

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so we transfer from x to y--we can do that until y is full.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's what happened here. The 4 oz was full.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Or we could do it until x is empty.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
If we were starting to pour back 4 oz from here into an empty one, we could do it until it was empty.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Anything else in the inventory? Oh, well, we certainly need a notion of a solution.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
A solution is going to be a sequence of steps--

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to pour from here to here, then from here to the drain, then fill up, then pour again, and so on.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
What this unit is really all about is techniques for finding these solutions,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which are sequences of steps.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Again, we're always talking about managing complexity in this class.

00:03:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The complexity we're trying to manage here is a complexity
