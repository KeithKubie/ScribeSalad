00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:09.460
What happens if an astronaut gets sick or
injured in space?

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.640
On the moon, you're over three days away,
or on Mars you could be as much as eight months away.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.780
Not everybody on a crew to Mars is going to be a physician.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.560
You have to be able to operate autonomously.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.780
Dr. George Pantalos and the team at University
of Louisville are working with NASA,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.040
Carnegie Mellon University, 
and Baylor College of Medicine

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.820
to develop novel ways to perform complicated procedures

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.840
in near-zero gravity.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.140
When you're working in weightlessness, it
completely changes how you interact

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.440
with your instruments, how you interact with your supplies and equipment, how you interact

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.960
with your patient. Whoever is providing the care has to be somehow or another fixed in place,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.360
as does the patient, so that you can interact
with them successfully and safely.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.520
In addition to overcoming the challenges of
weightlessness, the team has to consider the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.329
size, shape, and efficiency of medical tools.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.840
You can only take so much with you given the
thrust capabilities of the launch vehicle,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.740
the power, the volume available for storage
in the spacecraft, and everything.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.400
As we're starting to anticipate using a robot
as a surgical assistant during a spaceflight,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.799
might we need to redesign some of the surgical
tools, both to make them easy for the robot

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.530
to identify visually, as well as to pick up
with their fingers, and to then hand it to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.680
the surgeon when the surgeon needs it, or
to manipulate the instrument themselves?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.580
George and his students have brainstormed
and built several answers to the challenge

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.440
of space medicine, from fluid containment
to 3D-printing.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.460
When we’re working in weightlessness, especially
when we’re doing new procedures and working

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.320
with new materials, and materials that might
be hazardous, we want to make sure

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.860
that they don't get out into the rest of the environment.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.520
A glove box is a container that you put an
object in to keep it from getting away, simply put,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.900
or to provide special treatment. We've
had to create a very brand-new glove box that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.180
will fit in the size limitation of the suborbital
spacecraft.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.420
During surgery on the earth, you might have
one instrument to provide suction, you might

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.890
have another instrument to provide cautery.
We've created an instrument that combines

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.080
all of those things together, so in one instrument
the surgeon, at the push of a button,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.200
can do suction, irrigation, illumination, and
eventually will be able to do cautery.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.140
We've developed a hemispherical dome, that
you can put over the location of where the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.299
surgery is going to take place to contain
surgical fluids. With wound waste recovery,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.380
the idea is to recover all of these fluids
and try to filter it and treat it. The output

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.720
from that would be drinkable water, sterile
water, or sterile saline.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.600
Which sounds gross, but could help support
astronauts on long term space missions.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.940
For an exploration space mission, there will
be some kind fabrication module onboard that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:28.110
can 3D print plastics, polymers, metals, tissue,
electronics, and hybrid materials. Those materials

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.220
can be recycled and put back into the source
material storage to 3D-print for some other

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.840
tool, or a replacement part that might come
up needed later in the mission.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.640
Once George and his team are ready to test
out their new designs, they’ll travel to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.060
the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where
they’ll test their tools

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.700
on the NASA zero-G plane.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.960
The preparation for a test flight with NASA
is pretty intensive, but once you get up in

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.680
the air and you actually start to see things
work, that's when things get really exciting

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.260
and lots of fun. Working in weightlessness
is such a unique experience,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.340
even though it's challenging, it's also very pleasant.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.520
Though it takes several years for the designs
to be tested and approved by the FDA,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.300
George’s research is paving the way for safer and more
feasible human space travel.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.860
If we can accomplish this kind of medical
care during an exploration space mission,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.320
there is a good chance we could do it, let's
say, on a lunar colony that's been established

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.720
for visitors to come and visit the moon.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.420
Now,&nbsp;as it turns out, medical tools and instruments
and monitors that are going to be used in

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.720
spaceflight could potentially be very beneficial

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.760
to make surgical procedures back on the ground go a lot better.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.380
