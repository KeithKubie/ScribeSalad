Speaker 1:          00:00          Happen. The Joe Rogan experience that they have some sort of special couch. Okay, dog, my friend's girlfriend, we're all sitting around. My friend's girlfriend, so hot, so hot is one of those. Go with Zach. We're sitting there and she goes, and I was, I was meditating and I saw a deer and it looked at me and the deer gave me love and we're all like, I'm just looking at her tits. I was a young gun, Lazy. She's so hot. She, she, she's so, she's such an estrogen, you know. And um, my buddy, of course, you know, you had those swords and can't let it go. Just let it go. Let her have her thing. My buddy goes, what gave you love? Explain that shit to me. Explaining why I get all biological. Well, you know what? You're close minded and you're not intuitive. I'm really intuitive and it became massive, intuitive.

Speaker 1:          00:48          My favorite thing, I love that shit. But those people that claim that they have some special connection with animals, like animals just recognize who I am. They know my nature. You know, kind of schooled me, Megan Fox. I was doing a movie with her and, and I assumed she started talking about signs and I was making fun of like psychics and signs and all, and Megan goes, well, um, maybe you ever think that maybe you're a little close minded. And I go, no, not scientific minded and no I'm not. And I think all psychics are liars and I think astrology is bullshit. But then like Megan literally went into her knowledge of science and geology and everything else and I was like, oh, you're a fucking, oh wait, you're a really hot intellectual and you know a shit load. And I made a judgment on you.

Speaker 1:          01:36          It was very, it was actually embarrassing isn't it? And interestingly, you would automatically make a judgment on someone who's hot, like Ah, utilize been easy as fuck. Right. And she's not like that. Like a judgment that you would make on the son of a rich man. Like if someone correct grew up in, is in the family business and his father was a, a very successful man, but he's taking over the family business, you would assume this guy's a bitch. Yup. Right? Yup. Most of the time. Most of the time you're wrong. So often. Yes. It's such a bad debt. Yeah. Cause like if a great, if a great man has a son, yeah. Most like he's going to teach that Sun's cool shit and the sun's going to have to like live up to a certain standard. Right. Well that was the thing with Megan.

Speaker 1:          02:17          I would notice after I had that interaction with her, I've known her a little bit cause I know her husband really well. And then, uh, and then I noticed that every time we wouldn't be shooting, she'd be reading a book of substance. Like that's what she does when she's not on set. So I was like, well, what are you doing? You're, you're, you're laying an iPhone next to your head. What am I doing? Their iPhone next to the other side of your head and you have these weird conversations with that. That's my favorite thing you did. I got to start doing that again.
