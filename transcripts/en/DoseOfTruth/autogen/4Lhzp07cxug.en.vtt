a problem right that that's a big
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250
a problem right that that's a big
problem and that there's a Freudian

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
problem and that there's a Freudian
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260

element to this is like this family is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
element to this is like this family is
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600
element to this is like this family is
now divided because one child is the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
now divided because one child is the
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090
now divided because one child is the
favorite of the mother and that's Jacob

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
favorite of the mother and that's Jacob
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590
favorite of the mother and that's Jacob
and one child is the favorite of the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
and one child is the favorite of the
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360
and one child is the favorite of the
father and so Jacob is kind of a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
father and so Jacob is kind of a
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330
father and so Jacob is kind of a
mother's boy I guess to use an a rather

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
mother's boy I guess to use an a rather
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
admirable from his father's perspective
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.279
admirable from his father's perspective
as Esau who's a tough guy who goes out

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
as Esau who's a tough guy who goes out
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959
as Esau who's a tough guy who goes out
with a bow and arrow and like you know

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
with a bow and arrow and like you know
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640
with a bow and arrow and like you know
wanders around in the plains and brings

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
wanders around in the plains and brings
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399
wanders around in the plains and brings
animals home and and he's tough he's a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
animals home and and he's tough he's a
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.620
animals home and and he's tough he's a
tough guy so and but but there's this

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
tough guy so and but but there's this
 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.300
tough guy so and but but there's this
discord in the family because one parent

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
discord in the family because one parent
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010
discord in the family because one parent
prefers one child and the other parent

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
prefers one child and the other parent
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.350
prefers one child and the other parent
prefers the other and it's obvious from

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
prefers the other and it's obvious from
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730
prefers the other and it's obvious from
the story that the parents do not

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
the story that the parents do not
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560
the story that the parents do not
communicate about this because they

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
communicate about this because they
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300
communicate about this because they
really take sides and so there's a split

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
really take sides and so there's a split
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999
really take sides and so there's a split
in the family and that's I think very

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
in the family and that's I think very
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160
in the family and that's I think very
realistic because one of the things that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
realistic because one of the things that
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840
realistic because one of the things that
you do learn if you have a family and of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
you do learn if you have a family and of
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249
you do learn if you have a family and of
course most of you do but if you also

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
course most of you do but if you also
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380
course most of you do but if you also
think about families is that there's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
think about families is that there's
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170
think about families is that there's
there's deep divisions within families

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180
there's deep divisions within families
 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060
there's deep divisions within families
very very frequently that no one will

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
very very frequently that no one will
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.390
very very frequently that no one will
ever talk about and or even think about

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
ever talk about and or even think about
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100
ever talk about and or even think about
often because it's too painful to think

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
often because it's too painful to think
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170
often because it's too painful to think
about you know and Freud himself said

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
about you know and Freud himself said
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969
about you know and Freud himself said
Freud was clearly his mother's favorite

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
Freud was clearly his mother's favorite
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100
Freud was clearly his mother's favorite
and the family sacrificed a lot

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
and the family sacrificed a lot
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200
and the family sacrificed a lot
including some of the potential

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
including some of the potential
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999
including some of the potential
ambitions of the other children in order

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
ambitions of the other children in order
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920
ambitions of the other children in order
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.410
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a
pedestal and advance his education and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
pedestal and advance his education and
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660
pedestal and advance his education and

a great man but there was a cost to his
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679
a great man but there was a cost to his
siblings and Freud himself said that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
siblings and Freud himself said that
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.450
siblings and Freud himself said that
there was something about being the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
there was something about being the
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789
there was something about being the
favorite of the mother that gave a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
favorite of the mother that gave a
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.029

of Abraham that of being the progenitor

of Abraham that of being the progenitor
 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.480
of Abraham that of being the progenitor
of the Messiah and the error of the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490

Christ's Kingdom it was at least typical

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.379
Christ's Kingdom it was at least typical
of spiritual privileges those of the

well that's a lot harsher than meets the

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330
well that's a lot harsher than meets the
 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.629
well that's a lot harsher than meets the
eye to begin with and so there's a very

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639
eye to begin with and so there's a very
 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.129
eye to begin with and so there's a very
interesting deep moral story there which

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139
interesting deep moral story there which
 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.390
interesting deep moral story there which
is it's sort of Esau does the opposite

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400
is it's sort of Esau does the opposite
 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.640
is it's sort of Esau does the opposite
of a sacrifice it's the reverse right he

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650
of a sacrifice it's the reverse right he
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.560
of a sacrifice it's the reverse right he
sacrifices the future for the present

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570
sacrifices the future for the present
 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.980
sacrifices the future for the present
and so that the story basically says the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990
and so that the story basically says the
 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.930
and so that the story basically says the
way it's laid out across stories is that

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940
way it's laid out across stories is that
 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.189
way it's laid out across stories is that
if you're the sort of person that

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199
if you're the sort of person that
 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.300
if you're the sort of person that
sacrifices the future to the present

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310
sacrifices the future to the present
 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.879
sacrifices the future to the present
then that eradicate the possibility that

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889
then that eradicate the possibility that
 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.600
then that eradicate the possibility that
you will bring them the most noble being

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610
you will bring them the most noble being
 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.000
you will bring them the most noble being
into existence that's what it means and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010
into existence that's what it means and
 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.730
into existence that's what it means and
you can again this is the psychological

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740
you can again this is the psychological
 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.860
you can again this is the psychological
significance of the biblical story so

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870
significance of the biblical story so
 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.560
significance of the biblical story so
that's a bad thing to do if you want to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570
that's a bad thing to do if you want to
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.409
that's a bad thing to do if you want to
realize your potential let's say you

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419
realize your potential let's say you
 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.480
realize your potential let's say you
don't do reverse sacrifices that's a

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490
don't do reverse sacrifices that's a
 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.379
don't do reverse sacrifices that's a
very bad idea

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389
very bad idea
 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.370
very bad idea
and so ESO really did himself in by

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380
and so ESO really did himself in by
 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.529
and so ESO really did himself in by
being too attached to the present

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539
being too attached to the present
 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.170
being too attached to the present
without a vision of the future so he's -

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
without a vision of the future so he's -
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.400
without a vision of the future so he's -
in the moment you know

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410
in the moment you know
 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.460
in the moment you know
and and he pays a heavy price for it I

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
and and he pays a heavy price for it I
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.770
and and he pays a heavy price for it I
mean he's the first of all he loses his

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780
mean he's the first of all he loses his
 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.480
mean he's the first of all he loses his
birthright and and his double

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490
birthright and and his double
 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.890
birthright and and his double
inheritance so there's a practical

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
inheritance so there's a practical
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.450
inheritance so there's a practical
consequence and then there's a spiritual

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
consequence and then there's a spiritual
 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.210
consequence and then there's a spiritual
consequence and then he's well he's be

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220
consequence and then he's well he's be
 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.310
consequence and then he's well he's be
made a fool of by his brother Jacob

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320
made a fool of by his brother Jacob
 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.820
made a fool of by his brother Jacob
means supplanter by the way that's what

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830
means supplanter by the way that's what
 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.920
means supplanter by the way that's what
the name means and Jacob is always

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930
the name means and Jacob is always
 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.860
the name means and Jacob is always
trying to usurp Esau as we seed and so

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870
trying to usurp Esau as we seed and so
 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.930
trying to usurp Esau as we seed and so
Jacob gets one over on him and you know

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940
Jacob gets one over on him and you know
 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.700
Jacob gets one over on him and you know
that's not doesn't make an older brother

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710
that's not doesn't make an older brother
 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.080
that's not doesn't make an older brother
happy when a younger brother gets

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090
happy when a younger brother gets
 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.490
happy when a younger brother gets
something over on him that's for sure

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500
something over on him that's for sure
 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.710
something over on him that's for sure
and then he loses the opportunity to be

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720
and then he loses the opportunity to be
 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.480
and then he loses the opportunity to be
the progenitor of the Messiah which is

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490
the progenitor of the Messiah which is
 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.400
the progenitor of the Messiah which is
like people already didn't realize that

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410
like people already didn't realize that
 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.140
